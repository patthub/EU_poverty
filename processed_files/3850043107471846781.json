        "3 Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Foreword Foreword High-quality statistics are an infrastructure element of a democratic society in any country of the world and thus also in developing countries. From these countries\u2019 perspective, governments and businesses, on the one hand, and the press and citizens, on the other hand, need timely and reliable information to make informed decisions about the development of the country and to assess governance. From the international community\u2019s perspective, reliable statistics are considered as a key element towards the better measurement, monitoring and management of the results of development assistance. The Millennium Development Goals (MDG) indicators are an example of this need. The European Union (EU) provides over half the world\u2019s development assistance and the European Commission, together with the EU Member States, is a major player in the field of international statistical co-operation. For over 50 years the Statistical Office of the EU, Eurostat, has been developing methodology and instruments to provide the EU institutions, governments and citizens with a set of harmonised and reliable statistics. This valuable experience further contributes to the global advocacy initiatives in international statistical cooperation and enables Eurostat to provide technical advice to countries, primarily through the EU\u2019s external relations services and the EU Delegations. The \u201cGuide to statistics in European Commission development co-operation\u201d is the fruit of a close cooperation amongst Commission services and international stakeholders in statistical co-operation for development. It is principally aimed at supporting EU staff in the delegations, but is also relevant to others actors in statistical development programmes. The \u201cGuide\u201d version 2.0 is more than a mere handbook: it is a dynamic interactive tool, in three languages. It attempts to gather together the key aspects involved when dealing with and supporting statistics as part of development cooperation. It is completed by nineteen chapters dedicated to statistics in sector policies. Eurostat is already working on the next version of the \u201cGuide\u201d to integrate the continuously renewed paradigms of international statistical co-operation. Comments and feedback are most welcome but in the meantime I hope that this \u201cGuide\u201d helps you better find your path in the world of statistical development cooperation.

        "A 35 Introduction: The Guide to the Guide Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Part A: Introduction: The Guide to the Guide A.0.1. Why a Guide to statistics in European Commission development co- operation and who should read it \u2018I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts...\u2019 Sherlock Holmes in \u2018 A Scandal in Bohemia \u2019 by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle , 1891 The purpose of the Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Cooperation is to explain why statistics are important for development cooperation, how to use them and what needs to be done to make them available. It is not intended to be a course in statistics and statistical methods. Alternative and additional reading is shown in the To find out more box at the end of each section. The target audience is Commission staff working in development cooperation, especially in delegations, and most particularly people who know very little about statistics and would prefer to spend their time on their core tasks. This Guide explains why and how statistics are relevant to their work and what they need to do in various situations. It provides the information required for Commission staff to undertake the following tasks: Use statistical indicators to design and monitor develop- \u2022 ment programmes; Identify and develop statistics support actions; \u2022 Advocate timely consideration of statistical issues over the \u2022 Commission aid cycle. The Guide aims to answer a few basic questions about development statistics: Part \u2022 A, this Introduction , is a guide to when and how to consult the Guide Part \u2022 B: Statistics in Development looks at why and how sta- tistics enter the development process and how to under- stand and check data Part \u2022 C: Support for Statistics considers when and how the European Community needs to act to make sure that good quality statistics are available to support its development goals Part \u2022 D: Statistics for Policy Issues looks at how statistics can be used and supported to achieve European Commission policy aims in the context of Commission sector policy ar- eas, hence in more detail. If you think that statistics are important but bread is more urgent , please ask yourself on what information you base your answers to these questions: \u2018 How much bread? \u2019 and \u2018 Where is it needed? \u2019 Development fundamentally is about people and about eliminating poverty. In order to manage the process, it is essential to measure it. While statistics may not directly reduce poverty or hunger, they are an essential component of a complex process; without adequate statistical data it is by no means certain that actions to reduce poverty will be directed at the right problem, that they will be effective or that they will result in sustained improvements. It is obvious that good and reliable statistics are necessary to donors, in order to assess where aid is most needed, to use resources efficiently, to measure progress and to evaluate results. There is broad consensus that the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) identify the desired outcomes as well as the means for measuring progress. Thus, statistics are vital to \u2018Managing for Development Results\u2019 with shared accountability and focus on results. A key issue is the need for good country-specific and country- owned policies and institutions. Better statistical data and improved analysis can create a political will for changes. Without good statistics, governments cannot deliver efficient administration, good management, and evidence-based policy making. An effective and efficient national statistical system, providing regular and reliable data on the economy and the well being of the population, is an important indicator of good policies and a crucial component of good governance. Statistics also provide a means for the media, non- governmental organisations and any citizen to monitor the activities of government. The ability to provide regular and reliable data on the economy and the well-being of the population is an important indicator of good policies and institutions. When the statistical system produces quality data which is trusted by the public, transparency increases and accountability is promoted. However, the quality of the statistics is only as good as the source data. The quality and availability of data depend on the capacity of the institutions involved in the national statistical system, which are often undervalued and under funded. Now read on, this Guide will help you find what you want to know. ",

The document linked to is a preliminary version of the module on \u2018 Investing in data collection and dissemination \u2019 (part of the course Investing in Statistical Capacity ) . Please send any comments on this to the e-mail address above. The European Development Fund has supported SADC (the Southern African Development Community) to develop a standardised course aimed at teaching the basics of official statistics, covering basic statistical concepts. Click on the \u2018resources\u2019 tab. A.0.2. What is in the Guide A.0.2.1. Statistics in Development Part B: Statistics in Development looks at why and how statistics enter the development process and how to read and check data. Chapter B.1, Statistics for development cooperation , explains the increased demand for development statistics from a global policy perspective by examining the international initiatives which focus on performance measurement and results-based policy making. The initiatives covered are: the Millennium Development Goals, \u2022 poverty reduction strategies, \u2022 Managing for Development Results, \u2022 the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and the \u2022 Marrakech Action Plan for Statistics. The discussion of the European Consensus on Development places the global initiatives in a European context. The outcome of these policy initiatives is increased demand for: indicators to measure progress toward policy goals, \u2022 indicators to inform the preparation, monitoring and \u2022 evaluation of individual policies and instruments, indicators to prepare, monitor and evaluate development \u2022 actions. Many, probably the majority, of these indicators are based on statistics. Chapter B.2, How statistics are made , gives a minimally technical introduction to the production of statistics. Official statistics consist of data published by government agencies, regional and international organisations such as the UN as a public good, together with explanations of how the data were compiled (metadata). The chapter looks at: the fundamental principles of statistics: what makes for \u2022 useful data and legal framework for statistics, the process of statistics operations from analysis and design \u2022 to dissemination of results, the institutional framework: the national statistical system \u2022 and how it relates to users of statistics, the role of regional and international organisations in \u2022 producing statistics and in standardising concepts and methods. Chapter B.3, Statistics and indicators in the European Commission development aid process , examines the indicators used to inform the policies discussed in chapter B.1. It places the various types of indicators used by the European Commission in the context of their use at each stage in the programme cycle and in reporting to provide visibility and accountability. Chapter B.4, Statistics across policy sectors , then focuses on international policy-related indicators: Millennium Development Goals (MDG) indicators, \u2022 Indicators commonly used for Poverty Reduction \u2022 Strategies. It includes a cross-reference between the European Commission\u2019s policy sector definitions and statistical activities. A.0.2.2. Support for Statistics Part C: Support for Statistics considers when and how the European Commission needs to act to ensure that statistics are available to support its development goals. Part C is more applied and \u2018hands on\u2019 than Part B. Chapter C.5, How to decide on a statistical action, considers support actions for statistics capacity and/or strengthening the demand for statistics. The chapter starts with a presentation of \u2018quality\u2019 in statistics: what should a developing country\u2019s statistical system be able to provide for its users? It then considers how to evaluate a country\u2019s statistics and the system that produces them. In passing, it explains how to construct the Commission\u2019s standard data tables. Chapter C.6, How to bring assistance to statistics, provides guidance on whether and how to give support to statistics. It discusses the relationship of statistics strategy with national development and poverty reduction strategies and analyses the development and implementation of statistics strategies. The chapter also discusses capacity building in statistics, covering the link to statistical strategy documents and practical considerations. ",
        "A 37 Introduction: The Guide to the Guide Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Having looked at what is to be done, the chapter then moves on to examine in general how statistics actions are to be done. Coordination at various levels is addressed: who can do what and what needs to be done to ensure coherence and eliminate duplication? Chapter C.7, The European Commission\u2019s support to statistics, starts at the point when the development partners accept that there is a need for external support to statistics. The chapter aims to inform the decision about whether and how the European Commission should be involved. It first considers the Commission\u2019s development statistics activities in the context of country / regional strategies and programmes, including any statistics strategy. It continues by looking at the purpose of statistics actions and how they are linked to the development objectives using the logical framework. The chapter finishes with a practical look at the various types of European Commission statistics interventions, showing links with policies, identifying areas of cooperation, listing examples and providing action points. Chapter C.8, How to manage statistics actions , starts at the decision that a European Commission statistics intervention is justified to achieve the goals agreed with its development partners. This chapter presents guidance on how to prepare actions to support statistics capacity building and major statistical projects. It provides practical advice for preparing and evaluating terms of reference at each stage of the programme cycle. A.0.2.3. Statistics for Development Policies Part D: Statistics for Policy Issues looks at how statistics can be used and supported for decision making and monitoring achievements in the context of European Commission sector policy areas, hence in more detail. Part D is organised according to the statistics activities defined in the UNECE Classification of International Statistics Activities. An overview of the correspondent policy areas defined by the European Consensus on Development can be found in Box 4.4 (section B.4.3) and in Box 9.1 (chapter D.9). Each chapter follows a more or less standard structure, presenting statistics in the context of sector policies, followed by information on their use, quality analysis and any support required. The chapter structure is as follows: Policy applications and the statistics to inform them 1. Sources of data and metadata 2. The limits of data and how to check data quality in the 3. statistical activity How to build a statistical action in the sector 4. Part D Statistics for Policy Issues cover the following statistical domains; organised according to the corresponding policy areas as defined by the European Consensus on Development (see section B.1.5) : Trade and Regional Integration D.10 External trade and Balance of Payments D.11 National accounts, economic accounts and the non- observed economy D.12 Price statistics D.19 Government finance and public sector statistics (placed under the policy area \u2018Governance, Democracy, Human Rights and Support for Economic and Institutional Reforms\u2019 below) D.13 Business statistics Environment, Sustainable Management of Natural Resources D.14 Environmental statistics Infrastructure, Communications and Transport D.15 Transport statistics Rural Development, Territorial Planning, Agriculture, Food Security D.16 Human settlements and housing statistics D.17 Agricultural, forestry and fishing statistics D.18 Regional and small area statistics Governance, Democracy, Human Rights and Support for Economic and Institutional Reforms D.19 Government finance and public sector statistics D.20 Justice and crime statistics Human Development D.21 Living conditions and poverty statistics D.22 Population and migration statistics D.23 Education statistics D.24 Health statistics D.25 Income and consumption statistics D.26 Sustainable development indicators Social Cohesion and Employment D.27 Labour market statistics D.28 Social protection statistics ",

Statistics for development co- operation The chapter in brief This chapter explains the recently increased demand for statistics in developing countries by examining the international initiatives which focus on performance measurement and results-based policy making. It commences with the global approaches, covering the Millennium Development Goals, Poverty Reduction Strategies and Managing for Development Results, focusing on the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and the Marrakech Action Plan for Statistics. The discussion of the European Consensus on Development places the global initiatives in a European context. B.1.1. Millennium Development Goals The Millennium Declaration, signed in September 2000, committed the 189 signatory nations to work together to achieve eight human development goals: Goal 1: Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger Goal 2: Achieve universal primary education Goal 3: Promote gender equality and empower women Goal 4: Reduce child mortality Goal 5: Improve maternal health Goal 6: Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases Goal 7: Ensure environmental sustainability Goal 8: Develop a global partnership for development These Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) provide the agreed overall aims of development policy. They form a framework for development partners to work coherently towards common goals. The progress towards these goals is to be assessed through 21 quantifiable targets that are to be reached by 2015. Four of these targets were proposed at the World Summit in 2005. In 2008, the MDG monitoring framework was revised to include also these targets. To measure progress toward the targets, 60 linked statistical indicators were agreed by the Inter-agency and Expert Group on MDG Indicators (IAEG), compromising more than 20 international agencies (including agencies from the United Nations system, the ILO, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the OECD Development Assistance Committee). These indicators enable regular monitoring of progress at national level, and in some countries at sub- national level, toward the targets set by the Millennium Development Goals. The regular monitoring allows to have information on the degree of countries progress towards the achievement of the goals: those which have already reached the goal or target; those which have made progress sufficient to achieve the goal; those which have made progress but not sufficient to achieve the goal; those which have deteriorated and those which do not have sufficient data to make an assessment. This core international policy agreement was innovative in that it brought measurement of outcomes and comparison of these across countries into the centre of development policy and practice. Making these measurements and drawing valid comparisons and conclusions are considerable challenges to statistics in developing countries (as discussed in the outline of the MDG indicators in section B.4.1 and the more detailed examination in Part D). Managing for Development Results, the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and the Marrakech Action Plan are to a large extent initiatives that were born as the consequence of the demands for measurement of the Millennium Development Goals. The IAEG, United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) and the UN Regional Commissions arrange a series of regional workshops on monitoring of the MDGs , e.g. in Geneva in November 2010 and in San Jos\u00e9 (Costa Rica) in January / February 2011. These workshops address countries\u2019 needs in building capacity for the production and analysis of MDG and development indicators. They provide information and advice on implementing international and national recommendations to improve the monitoring of MDG indicators. Some of the key recommendations of these workshops are: effective coordination of national statistical systems, \u2022 involving a central role for the NSI, a national MDG monitoring committee, establishment of a national MDG database and efficient data transmission (SDMX recommended) resolving discrepancies between national and international \u2022 data, documenting both international and national methodologies and models (metadata), more efficient and coordinated data requests and data transmission (SDMX), and putting in place better notification systems whenever national data are modified by international agencies development of new MDG monitoring framework in \u2022 countries, taking account of national characteristics, supported by IAEG and its partners improvement of the statistical capacity of the NSI and \u2022 NSS (workshops, training seminars and establishment of metadata systems at national level) The IAEG is publishing a revised version of the Handbook on MDG indicators in 2011; the Handbook on \u201cIndicators for Monitoring the Millennium Development Goals\u201d published in 2003 only contained information on the 48 indicators defined at that time. The new Handbook is tailored to country needs, focusing on methods to produce the MDG ",
        "B 46 Statistics for Development Co-operation Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 indicators at the national level, based on existing national sources. It also clarifies the differences between methods used by international agencies and those recommended to national experts. Furthermore, it includes information on the new MDG indicators, guidelines on how to disaggregate data, and links to relevant publications and websites. The new Handbook provides additional supplementary information for all MDG indicators, including new alternative indicators, its methodology and sources. It also presents detailed examples for each MDG indicator to explain the calculation process step-by-step, as well as examples for alternative indicators and data sources. To improve the information on third-country statistics, Eurostat has studied the data quality and availability of the 10 core indicators for a number of ACP countries. Eurostat collected available data on 10 core MDG indicators from different international and national sources, as well as the data collection methodology of the countries. The availability, quality and comparability of the data were analysed, including analysis of potential causes of discrepancies whenever such are observed. The first \u201cAnalysis of the 10 Core MDG indicators - Methodology and quality issues\u201d studies covered the member states of the African regional organisations COMESA, SADC, ECOWAS and UEMOA: Analysis of the 10 Core MDG indicators, Methodology \u2022 and quality issues \u2013 Countries of COMESA and SADC regional organisations (26 countries) (November 2009) Analysis of the 10 Core MDG Indicators: Methodology \u2022 and Quality Issues \u2013 Countries of ECOWAS (including UEMOA) (15 countries) (September 2010) In 2003 and 2004, PARIS21\u2019s Task Team for Improved Statistical Support for Monitoring Development Goals carried out six case studies to better understand the data and systems developing countries use to monitor progress towards the MDGs and other development goals. These case studies sought to identify changes and interventions that would improve the availability, reliability and use of key indicators, particularly at the national level. Furthermore, they aimed to document the capacity and current practices of the national statistical systems in these countries. The six countries studied were selected to represent a variety regarding, amongst others, geographical and income group coverage. In addition, it was considered whether vital information such as GDDS metadata (see Box 5.9), a PRSP, a MDG country report, and a statistical development strategy (NSDS or other) were available. The selected countries were: Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Malawi, Moldova, and Yemen.

National development strategies and the demand for statistics B.1.2.1. National Development Strategies Many developing and developed countries prepare medium-term national development strategies that seek to achieve and sustain economic growth, reduce poverty and usually increase employment. Other economic, social and increasingly environmental objectives are often incorporated. National development strategies have evolved into a means of quantifying medium term objectives to provide a framework for public policy. The quantification of medium term strategies has led to increased demand for statistics for policy preparation and monitoring. The European Commission\u2019s Country Strategy Papers / Regional Strategy Papers (CSPs/RSPs) and National Indicative Programmes / Regional Indicative Programmes (NIPs/RIPs) are developed to follow and support the National Development Strategies in the developing countries. This is also the case for the EU Member States and for other development partners. The targets of the national strategies have become more quantified, in other words easier to measure both in terms of goals and in terms of progress. The donors are therefore increasingly requiring more, better and up-to-date statistics, in order to determine targets for aid, assess progress and to evaluate overall achievement. National Development Strategies can take various forms. The World Bank-supported Poverty Reduction Strategies (PRSs), which cover around 70 low income countries, are one form of development strategy. PRSs are not applicable to middle income countries. Nevertheless, PRSs can be used as a general model of the demand for statistics for strategic planning and development. As such, they can also serve as useful models or inspiration for the increasingly widespread country-defined strategies for growth and development. ",
        "B 47 Statistics for Development Co-operation Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Poverty Reduction Strategies, summarised in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs), have formed the basis of all concessional lending by the World Bank Group (for development) and the International Monetary Fund (for macroeconomic stability) since September 1999. The PRSP was primarily used as the basis of multilateral processes such as debt reduction through the HIPC (Highly Indebted Poor Countries) mechanism. Thus, PRSPs have become a key instrument for low-income countries\u2019 relationships with the donor community. The objective of Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers is to improve the impact of government policies on poverty reduction. The papers incorporate comprehensive analyses of a country\u2019s macroeconomic policies, especially structural policies that aim at sustainable fiscal and balance of payments deficits, as well as social policies. They therefore focus on external financing needs, promoting growth and reducing poverty in a long term perspective. PRSPs are intended to be nationally owned, being prepared by governments through a participatory process that involves civil society. Development partners, notably the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, are also closely involved. A Performance Assessment Framework (PAF) is the core tool for the joint assessment by government and development partners of implementation of the national strategy and reform programme. The PAF is a government-owned document that prioritises reform measures and agreed targets in priority sectors within the national strategy. It provides a concise and verifiable set of indicators that is regularly revised in line with progress. Most PRSPs have an associated PAF. The PAF and its implications for statistics are considered at section B.4.2. To find out more\u2026 about PRSs: World Bank\u2019s website: \u2022 http://www.worldbank.org/prsp B.1.2.2. National development strategies as a framework for policy PRSPs and other development strategies, such as National Development Plans, are structured to identify and specify country policies and activities that will support the country\u2019s overall economic and social goals. The logical framework of a PRSP, for example, is structured as follows: Objectives \u2022 : the country\u2019s overall goals, such as economic growth; human development and poverty reduction; and good governance; Development outcomes \u2022 : the policy objective - specific desired results to be attained; Outputs \u2022 : the consequences of activities and policies; Activities / policies \u2022 : actions to be undertaken in this framework. In the process of promoting democracy and good governance, strengthening the statistical system and the quality of its statistics enhances the accountability of decision-makers, by giving parliaments, national auditors, media and citizens the chance to monitor performance. If the national statistics of a country are lacking quality, the national development strategy should highlight the support to statistics as a priority. However, the production of statistical data should not be a target in itself but should be supported as a means towards good governance. Advocacy for evidence-based decision-making is essential. From the donors perspective, statistics are also a tool for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of co-operation actions and therefore help them to achieve their commitments regarding the Managing for Development Results initiative (see section B.1.3.) and the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness (see section B.1.4.). The Kenya Vision 2030 Program is Kenya\u2019s long-term development strategy, covering the period from 2008 to 2030. It aims to transform Kenya into a newly industrialised, \u201cmiddle-income country providing a high quality life to all its citizens by the year 2030\u201d. The Vision 2030 is based on a 3-pillar structure, comprising an economic pillar, a social pillar and a political pillar. The Vision 2030 is to be implemented in successive five-year Medium-Term Plans. Box 1.1 shows the policy framework of the first Kenya Vision 2030 Medium-Term Plan, covering the period 2008-2012 . This plan is considered by the World Bank as fulfilling the requirements of a PRSP. The framework shows the policy goals (development outcomes), the specific outputs required to attain these goals and the government activities and policies required to deliver the outputs. Many of the outputs are not measured by statistics, for example \u201cConstitutional supremacy\u201d (column 3 \u2013 political pillar). Other outputs are measurable, at least in principle: \u201cReduced illiteracy\u201d (column 3 \u2013 social pillar) and \u201cSchool enrolment rates\u201d (column 3 \u2013 social pillar) are examples.

Managing for Development Results B.1.3.1. Overview Since the International Conference on Financing for Development in Monterrey (2002) , the development community has increasingly focused on measuring the results of development and changing actions to improve the outcomes. The Marrakech International Round Table (2004 ) endorsed five principles on \u2018managing for results\u2019 and issued an action plan that recommends specific national and international initiatives. (For more details on the principles of Managing for Development Results, see section B.1.3.2. below.) The Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness (2005) defines managing for results as \u201c managing and implementing aid in a way that focuses on the desired results and uses information to improve decision-making \u201d. Partner countries commit to establish result-oriented reporting and assessment frameworks and to strengthen linkages between development strategies and budget processes, while donors commit to align with partner countries assessment frameworks, rely on partner country reporting and harmonise their monitoring and reporting requirements. The Hanoi International Round Table (2007) has confirmed previous commitments, reviewed progress in their implementation and focused on creating capacity for managing for results. Communities of Practice were recommended as vehicles for country-level work on implementing practical aspects of the agenda. The Accra Agenda for Action (AAA) from 2008 aimed at accelerating progress towards the objectives laid down in the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. It strengthens the donor\u2019s commitment to working through national systems in the recipient countries and increasing transparency and predictability. Conditions should be based on the developing country\u2019s own development objectives and restrictions on developing countries buying of goods and services relaxed. A strong focus is on increasing aid\u2019s value for money, through management for results. This involves capacity building, accountability and transparency, as well as enhanced cooperation and coordination with local governments and civil society organisations. The Fourth High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness is held in Busan at the end of 2011. The Forum will take stock of the progress made since the High Level Forum in Accra in 2008. It will also set out a new framework for increasing the quality of aid in order to achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. Developing countries have listed as their priorities for the Forum: predictable aid; use of country systems; an end to policy conditionality; country-driven capacity development; mutual accountability and reduced transaction costs. Several international initiatives were established in response to these global objectives , which include: PARIS 21, the Census Trust Fund, the International Household Survey Network, the DAC Joint Venture on Managing for Results, the MDG Indicators Expert Group, the Marrakech Action Plan monitoring committee. At the African level, processes for promoting managing for results and the development of statistics are well established . The African Statistical Coordination Committee (ASCC) and African Statistical Commission (StatCom-Africa) are accompanied by the Africa Symposium on Statistical Development (ASSD) and the Forum of the African Statistical Development (FASDEV) which includes countries and donors. The Reference Regional Strategic Framework for Statistical Capacity Building in Africa (RRSF) was adopted in 2007 as a regional implementation framework for the Marrakech Action Plan for Statistics (MAPS). The RRSF is a key instrument for coordinating and mainstreaming statistics development in Africa towards managing for development results. It was prepared to contribute to improved development outcomes and good governance in Africa, by guiding and accelerating sustainable statistical capacity building. It sets out a coherent framework to build this capacity, outlining twelve strategies for achieving statistical development in African countries and in the region as a whole (including statistical advocacy, user needs, coordination and partnerships, statistical infrastructure, ICT, human resources, funding and sustainability). The overarching strategy is the design of National Statistical Development Strategies (see chapter C.6.1). The RRSF has generated a momentum for statistical development in Africa, leading to restructuring and strengthening in regional organizations. Progress has been made regarding coordination of statistical activities in Africa, e.g. advocacy for statistics through the African Charter on Statistics and African Statistics Day celebrations, joint statistical capacity- building workshops and other activities, mainstreaming of gender in the NSS and their activities and development of NSDS within countries. A network of RRSF coordinators at regional and national levels has been created. The DAC (OECD Development Assistance Committee) Joint Venture on Managing for Results has produced a source-book of applications of the managing for results principles. It is also producing capacity assessment tools that are proposed for national discussions on managing for results. To be effective, these externally driven efforts to build capacity require domestic demand to see results. ",

Principles of Managing for Development Results The Managing for Development Results (MfDR) initiative was influenced by experience with the Poverty Reduction Strategies, outlined in section B.1.2. The Monterrey Conference on Financing for Development in 2002 called for \u201cbetter measuring, monitoring and managing for results\u201d. To achieve this, reliable and relevant data are needed. The objectives of the meeting were to ensure that aid would be used as effectively as possible and that aid could be demonstrated to have an impact on policy objectives, especially the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. The \u2018Managing for Development\u2019 approach was therefore developed to be \u201ca management strategy focused on development performance and on sustainable improvements in country outcomes. It provides a coherent framework for development effectiveness in which performance information is used for improved decision-making, and it includes practical tools for strategic planning, risk management, progress monitoring, and outcome evaluation 1 \u201d. Box 1.2: The principles of Managing for Development Results The five principles of Managing for Development Results, to be used at all levels and within a variety of interventions (national, sector, program, project and organisation) are: Focusing the dialogue on results at all phases of the development \u2022 process; Aligning programming, monitoring, and evaluation with results; \u2022 Keeping measurement and reporting simple; \u2022 Managing for, not by, results; \u2022 Using results information for learning and decision-making. \u2022 To better manage their development processes towards desired outcomes, developing countries need better measuring, monitoring and managing for results: adopting results-based approaches to public sector management, building national capacity for results-based monitoring and evaluation and strengthening statistical capacity. Effective monitoring and evaluation (M&E) shows the extent to which specific activities or programs contribute to achieving national outcomes. M&E systems depend on careful definition of objectives and identification of indicators and measurement tools. 1 Managing for Development Results \u201c Emerging Good Practice in Managing for Development Results \u2013 Sourcebook \u201d, 3rd Edition (2008) Box 1.3: Ten steps to a results-based monitoring and evaluation system Conduc 1. ting a readiness assessment Agreeing on outcomes to monitor and evaluate 2.

The statistical implications of Managing for Development Results: the Marrakech Action Plan for Statistics The Marrakech Action Plan for Statistics (MAPS) is an agreed set of common principles and a work programme designed to support statistics systems so that they can fulfil the measurement needs of Managing for Development Results. MAPS was an outcome of the 2004 second Managing for Development Results meeting of over 200 developing country and development agency representatives. Discussions focused on country level issues: harmonising monitoring and evaluation around national strategies and systems in order to provide useful reporting on results; donor coordination of support to planning and statistical systems; and monitoring and evaluation capacity that countries need to manage development. The conclusions of the Marrakech meeting was a key input to the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness principles on development progress to the planning and statistics systems. Box 1.7: The Marrakech Action Plan for Statistics The Marrakech Action Plan for Statistics (MAPS) defines six key actions to support statistics systems, so that they can provide the data needed for Managing for Development Results. These key actions are: Promote 1. strategic planning for developing statistical systems Prepare for the 2. 2010 census round Increase investment 3. in statistical systems Set up an international network to better coordinate 4. support for household surveys Make 5. immediate improvements in key areas , especially the MDGs Improve coordination 6. and accountability of the international statistical system The Action Plan therefore identified the key actions in support of publicly available statistics that require international support. It is a mixture of strategic and policy actions (points 1, 3 and 6) and specific statistical actions (points 2, 4 and 5). Points 1-3 require action carried out at the national level (cost estimated in MAPS at an additional $118m per year); 4-6 require international collaboration (cost estimated in MAPS at $24-28m per year). Several actions are being undertaken in fulfilment of the Action Plan as follows: Mainstream strategic planning of statistical systems 1. Incorporate national strategies for the development of \u2022 statistics (NSDSs) into strategic planning processes such as PRSPs and include them in the policy dialogue between developing countries and donors; Prepare NSDS for all low-income countries by 2006; \u2022 Ensure that donor-specific statistical programs support \u2022 national statistical plans; Continue advocating and providing training and financial \u2022 support from PARIS21 and the World Bank . Response: The PARIS21 consortium promotes dialogue and advocacy for statistics and coordinates the development and implementation of the NSDS methodology. See section C.6.1 for further information on NSDSs and PARIS21. PARIS21 has integrated NSDSs into strategic planning in its advocacy presentations and associated documents, notably: Counting down poverty: The role of statistics in world development . On a technical level, the paper Measuring Up to the Measurement Problem: The role of statistics in evidence based policy-making addresses the issue largely in the context of the PMMP (Poverty Monitoring Master Plan - linked to the PRSP, pp 20-22); there is also discussion of the MTEF (Medium Term Expenditure Framework, p19). PARIS21 maintains a list of NSDSs at various states of preparation and implementation. The PARIS21 Partner Report on Support to Statistics (PRESS) provides details of donor support to statistics, which enables verification of their support to national statistical plans. (See point 3 below for financing issues.) In October 2008, PARIS21 issued the report \u2018National Strategies for the Development of Statistics (NSDS): Worldwide Report on Progress and Emerging Issues\u2019 , identifying what progress has been made in strategic statistical planning and what remains to be done if NSDS targets are to be achieved. This report may serve as an input for the design of support programmes to countries. Additionally, the report aims inspire NSDS country teams to report in greater detail on their own strategic planning efforts. The 2010 Census Round 2. Develop an overall strategy for funding and conducting \u2022 censuses in low income countries. Research on census costs and operational methods should be made to determine practical measures to reduce costs and maximize timely dissemination and use of census results. Research in order to improve methods to estimate \u2022 population regularly at national and sub-national levels. Assist national statistical offices to advocate regular \u2022 censuses and to secure funding within countries and from the donor community. Build national technical capacity to develop management \u2022 skills to prepare a strategy and a costed plan and discuss with donors and users.

        "B 53 Statistics for Development Co-operation Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 The 2010 World Programme on Population and Housing Censuses website covers information on when the 228 participating countries and areas carry out their censuses 2 , the census methodological guidelines, the Census Knowledge Base (including national experiences and know-how) and up-to-date news and information relating to the 2010 Census Round. An Interregional Advisor on Population and Housing Censuses has been appointed to provide the necessary technical support for ensuring active involvement and participation of UN member states in the programme. Population statistics and census are described in more detail in chapter D.22. Box 1.8: Census costs \u2013 main components Censuses need to be as cost-efficient at possible. However, despite the use of modern information technology, they are large-scale operations and remain costly. There is a fine balance between keeping census costs 3 to a minimum and preserving the unique advantages of a census; unless sufficient resources are available at each stage of the census, the quality and value of the entire census can be jeopardized. The main cost components of a census are: Census maps: \u2022 Accurate maps provide the basis for a variety of census operations; setting enumerator assignments, ensuring completeness of coverage, estimating travel time and costs, and establishing field offices. They also enable thematic maps for spatial analysis. The use of GIS can lead to significant savings in the determination of enumeration areas. Population enumeration: \u2022 The most expensive census operation. Each person and every living quarter must be enumerated within a short period of time. The costs depend upon factors such as the method of enumeration; the source of supply of enumerators, the geography and topography of the country and the number of questions asked. Sampling can reduce these costs and improve the quality of the information. However, care needs to be taken in sample selection and implementation to avoid biases. Data capture, processing, analysis, preparation of reports \u2022 and dissemination: Information technology such as scanning or the use of laptops in the field has greatly increased the speed and reliability of data capture. Modern IT solutions have also reduced the time and costs required for data processing, analysis and dissemination. However, the required IT solutions and the qualified human resources required are frequently in short supply in developing countries. Source: United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) 2 As of 1 August 2011, 157 countries and areas had carried out a census, 71 had scheduled a census and 6 had not yet scheduled it. 3 See in particular the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) papers \u2018Population and Housing Censuses - strategies for reducing costs\u2019 and \u2018Counting the people: Constraining Census Costs and assessing alternative approaches\u2019 and the Census Knowledge Base papers \u2018Organization and financing of population censuses in sub-Saharan Africa: problems and prospects\u2019 and \u2018Projected Census Dates, Funding Requirements and Sources, and Technical Assistance Needs for the 2010 Round of Population and Housing Censuses\u2019 . Increase Financing for Statistical Capacity Building 3. Integrate financing needs from different agencies and \u2022 initiatives to make it easier for donors to see the full picture of needs and make reliable commitments. Bring donors together in an annual joint event and try to \u2022 engage new donors. Existing statistical capacity building activities are largely \u2022 part of investment projects in other sectors. Identify statistical capacity building projects better and link them with general budget support and Poverty Reduction Support Credits, using a strategic planning process. Support long-term statistical investment projects (see \u2022 detailed action plan in reference). A balance is needed between grants, loans, and country resources. Response: A concerted approach to planning and monitoring the increase in support to statistics was developed, called the \u2018Scaling up\u2019 of Statistical Capacity Building. This consists of two elements: a \u2018sector-wide\u2019 approach to statistics combined with pooled donor funding. The European Commission\u2019s position is that the two elements are sufficient: existing mechanisms can be used for the pooled funding. Corresponding to the concreted approach, a set of international financing instruments has been established: the Trust Fund for Statistical Capacity Building (TFSCB) provides grants to developing countries for statistical capacity building activities, especially for planning and development of a NSDS or similar mid-term statistics development plans; the Statistics for Results Facility Catalytic Fund (SRF-CF) is a multi-donor fund administered by the World Bank, providing grants mainly for implementation of the NSDS or similar statistical development plans according to a coordinated and sector-wide approach; STATCAP is a World Bank loan programme to finance statistical capacity building, normally financing the implementation of the NSDS or similar plan. These instruments are described in more detail in Box 1.9 and in section C.6.3. ",
        "B 54 Statistics for Development Co-operation Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Box 1.9: International financing instruments for statistical capacity building Trust Fund for Statistical Capacity Building (TFSCB ) The Trust Fund for Statistical Capacity Building (TFSCB) is a global grant facility. Its objective is to strengthen national statistical systems in support of poverty reduction strategies and other national and international development goals. This is done through sustainable improvement of the NSS\u2019s capacity to produce, analyse, disseminate and use timely statistics. TFSCB works to develop effective and efficient NSS and to promote evidence-based decision making and implementation. TFSCB projects are relatively small and quick disbursing. Priority is given to countries eligible for support from the IDA and involved in the PRSP and NSDS process. TFSCB supports two major types of projects: preparation and updating of National Strategies for the Development of Statistics (NSDS); \u2022 improving the statistical capacity in key priority areas within the framework of NSDS, regional or global strategies. \u2022 Statistics for Results Facility Catalytic Fund (SRF-CF) The Statistics for Results Facility (SRF) aid the scaling up support for statistics. Its goal is to increase developing countries\u2019 capacity to formulate development policies and for evidence-based decision making. In support of this, the Statistics for Results Facility Catalytic Fund (SRF-CF) provides grants to: Stimulate support for implementing the NSDS or similar statistical development plan; \u2022 Promote a system-wide approach in statistics at country level; \u2022 Promote improved coordination and partnership between statistics users and producers; \u2022 Deliver more efficient and effective aid and technical assistance for strengthening statistical systems and results measurement. \u2022 A country requesting support from the SRF-CF must have a national statistical plan (NSDS or similar) and be willing to establish a national partnership in statistics. Eligible countries must agree to: Exercise leadership over their statistical development by developing a good quality (comprehensive, realistic, prioritized and costed ) national \u2022 statistical plan; Allocate resources and carry out necessary administrative reforms for proper implementation of the national statistical plan; \u2022 Take a lead in coordinating donor and government support to statistics through the creation of national partnerships (multi-stakeholder group \u2022 to improved collaboration and coordination in statistics); Put into effect the \u2022 UN Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics , in particular to ensure that users have confidence in the quality and integrity of national statistics; Monitor progress in statistics and statistical capacity through output and outcome indicators. \u2022 STATCAP The Statistical Capacity Building Program STATCAP provides countries with loans to finance comprehensive or sectoral statistical capacity building projects, typically the implementation of a NSDS. STATCAP provides flexible financing, for meeting recurrent costs, financing investments and making best use technical support and advice. Each project is based on an assessment of the country\u2019s needs and existing capacity. Projects typically include actions to improve or strengthen: Statistical policy and the regulatory and institutional framework: legislation safeguarding independence and confidentiality, mechanisms for \u2022 efficient management and coordination; Statistical infrastructure: the business register, sampling frames, classifications, database structures and geographic information systems; \u2022 Statistical operations and procedures; Human resources; and \u2022 Physical infrastructure and equipment. \u2022 The criteria for use of the STATCAP programme are: the preparation of an NSDS or statistical master plan; \u2022 national commitment and leadership to strengthen the national statistical system; \u2022 willingness to comply with good statistical practice; \u2022 participation in global development and monitoring activities; \u2022 use of sustainable implementation arrangements. \u2022 To assess progress, countries are encouraged to use frameworks such as the IMF\u2019s General Data Dissemination System and Data Quality Assessment Framework , the UN Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics , as well as the PARIS21 Indicators of Statistical Capacity Building.

        "B 55 Statistics for Development Co-operation Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Set Up an International Household Survey Network 4. Organize a Household Survey Network to share \u2022 information and mobilise international support for more efficient household surveys in developing countries. Develop recommendations for household-based economic \u2022 and social data, taking into account multinational survey programs and developing countries\u2019 need to monitor their development. Work with experienced data archivists and data users to \u2022 establish a global information centre containing household survey and metadata; establish good dissemination practices which promote analysis and research while protecting the confidentiality of survey respondents. Response: The International Household Survey Network (IHSN) was set up as an informal partnership of international organizations seeking to improve the availability, quality and use of survey data in developing countries. Sample surveys play a critical role in supporting the planning, implementation and monitoring of development policies and programs. To target poverty reduction, one needs consistent and coherent household-based socio-economic data sets. IHSN provides a platform to better coordinate and manage socio-economic data collection and analysis. It provides support for efficient and effective approaches to conducting surveys in developing countries, providing methodologies, practical tools and guidelines for household surveys in developing countries. Key objectives of IHSN are: Improved coordination of internationally-sponsored survey programs with emphasis on timing, sequencing, frequency and cost-effectiveness; Provision of harmonized technical and methodological \u2022 guidelines by the international community, in particular related to data collection instruments; Availability of a \u2022 central survey data catalog to better inform users of the availability of survey and census data from all sources; Provision of \u2022 tools and guidelines to data producers , to foster documentation, dissemination and preservation of microdata according to international standards and best practices. Furthermore, the Accelerated Data Program (ADP) help countries improve their survey programs and increase the use and value of survey data. ADP provides technical and financial support to documentation and dissemination of survey data, as well as for improving national survey methods. ADP helps developing countries to set up national survey databanks, as well as to define national data collection standards to improve comparability of data across different national sources. ADP is further described in Box 5.2. Box 1.10: Activities of the International Household Survey Network The IHSN fosters the improvement of the availability, accessibility and quality of survey data in developing countries, and to encourage their analysis and use by national and international development decision makers, the research community, and other stakeholders. Key activities of the IHSN are: The development and maintenance of \u2022 tools and guidelines for better management of survey and census microdata . Our objective is to provide data producers with tools and guidelines related to all phases of survey implementation, from planning and budgeting to microdata dissemination and preservation. Our website is the main media we use for sharing these tools and guidelines, but some products are also made available in the form of publications, CD-ROMs and others. The \u2022 improvement of survey methods and harmonization of international guidelines , in partnership with lead agencies and stakeholders. The IHSN facilitates the work of experts and specialized task forces. The IHSN activities related to the improvement of survey methods also include the development and maintenance of a Question Bank , a central repository of survey guidelines. The Question Bank is the product of a broad collaboration between the IHSN Secretariat, the IHSN member agencies and other survey specialists. Its objective is to provide easy access to international survey guidelines, and the related concepts and indicators definitions, interviewer\u2019s instructions, and classifications. The maintenance of \u2022 survey and census catalogues , with the objective to inform data users about the existence of data. The IHSN does not distribute microdata, but contributes to make these data more accessible by providing data documentation, cataloguing and dissemination tools and recommendations to agencies who own such data.

        "B 56 Statistics for Development Co-operation Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Response: The MDGs, their targets and the linked statistical indicators are described in detail in section B.1.1. A variety of organisations are engaged in training and monitoring capacity building: for example, a joint UNECA/UNSD workshop on coordination of reporting mechanisms and data discrepancies in MDG monitoring in Africa was held in May 2008. Increase Accountability for the International Statistical 6. System (See section B.1.4) Adopt statement of principles on international \u2022 organizations\u2019 responsibilities in their official statistical activities. Submit statement to UN Statistical Commission, other interested parties. Encourage international agencies to adopt statement as core values guiding their activities; Improve interagency activity coordination: establish a core \u2022 work program reporting mechanism for international agencies to allow an exchange of views on improvements needed; Collect information on international spending on statistical \u2022 activities by agency, functional area and intended results. Hence, assess effectiveness and identify areas for additional resources. Response: The UN\u2019s development of the Principles Governing International Statistical Activities in 2005 is covered in section B.2.1. The PARIS21 Partner Report on Support to Statistics (PRESS) was referred to at point 1 above. A Reference Regional Strategic Framework for Statistical Capacity Building in Africa (RRSF) was adopted in 2006 4 as a means of implementing MAPS. It provides a basic framework for developing statistical capacity programmes in Africa which is intended to focus on instruments for improving the planning, financing, management, and coordination of statistical development activities to meet demands for statistics of good quality. The framework is built around three themes: meeting users\u2019 needs, improving management of statistical systems; and ensuring sustainability. The RRSF\u2019s backers expect that National Statistical Institutes (NSIs) refer to the framework for guidance on statistical capacity building; that international organizations will be using it as an input in their selection of programmes and projects supporting statistical development in African countries; and that all stakeholders would be able to use it to promote effective partnerships and coordination of capacity building efforts by both national and international institutions. 4 It was adopted in February 2006 at the 2 nd Forum for Statistical Development in Africa (FASDEV-2). The proposal was prepared by African Development Bank, ECA, World Bank and PARIS21. AfDB and ECA oversee implementation. Subsequent to Marrakech, support for statistics development featured at the Third Roundtable on Managing for Development Results. This Roundtable took place in Hanoi in 2007 and focuses in particular on statistical capacity building. Good progress was observed concerning the implementation of MAPS: According to PARIS21, as of May 2009, a total of 56 IDA and Lower Middle Income countries are currently implementing a NSDS and a further 32 are either currently designing or waiting for adoption of a NSDS. Under the Accra Agenda for Action (AAA), developing countries committed to strengthen the quality of policy design, implementation and assessment by improving co-ordination and linkage of various sources of information, including national statistical systems, budgeting, planning, monitoring and evaluations of policy performance. Furthermore, aid will be made more transparent by facilitating parliamentary oversight and implementing greater transparency in public financial management. UNSD has initiated a programme to obtain funding for the census round, the International Household Survey Network has been set up and the Accelerated Data Programme is being piloted. Statistics are central to MfDR, but higher quality is needed. Three main lessons learned were a reaffirmation of the relevance and need for continuing implementing MAPS, the need to increase funding on NSDSs (including funding from the countries themselves) and an emphasis on the importance of disseminating to the public. In November 2009, the participants to the PARIS21 Consortium meeting adopted the Dakar Declaration on Development of Statistics , recognising that a lot has been achieved since 2000 to improve the monitoring of the Millennium Development Goals, but that much still remains to be done to deliver the vision of the Marrakech Action Plan for Statistics (MAPS).

Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness The 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness aims to improve transparency and accountability in the use of resources for development assistance. Aid donors and recipients are to be mutually accountable and publicly monitored. At country level, the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness encourages donors and partners to jointly assess the implementation of commitments on aid effectiveness. Box 1.11: The commitments and indicators of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness The 56 partnership commitments in the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness are based on five key principles, to which 12 indicators are attached. Ownership: Developing countries exercise effective leadership over their development policies and strategies; they coordinate development efforts. Donors support and enable developing countries\u2019 ownership by respecting their policies and helping to strengthen their capacity to implement. Indicator: Partners have operational development strategies 1. Alignment: Donors base overall support on partners\u2019 national development strategies, institutions and procedures. Donors therefore draw conditions, whenever possible, from a partner\u2019s national development strategy, instead of imposing multiple conditions based on other agendas. Indicators: Reliable country systems 2. Aid flows are aligned on national priorities 3. Strengthen capacity by co-ordinated support 4. Use of country public financial management systems and 5. procurement systems Strengthen capacity by avoiding parallel implementation 6. structures Aid is more predictable 7. Aid is untied 8. Harmonisation: Donors aim to be more harmonised, collectively effective and less burdensome, especially on countries that have weak administrative capacities, such as fragile states. This implies establishing common arrangements at country level for planning, funding and implementing development programmes (paragraph 32). Indicators: Use of common arrangements or procedures 9. Encourage shared analysis 10. Managing for results : Donors and partner countries manage inputs and improve decision-making for results. Donors support developing countries\u2019 efforts to implement performance assessment frameworks that measure progress toward national development strategic goals (paragraphs 43-46). Indicator: Results-oriented frameworks 11. Mutual accountability - Donors and developing countries pledge that they will hold each other mutually accountable for development results. Indicator: Mutual accountability 12. To find out more\u2026 See the OECD Development Co-operation Directorate websites: Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness as well as \u2018 Monitoring the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness \u2019. Twelve indicators of aid effectiveness were developed to track and encourage progress on the partnership commitments (see Box 1.11). Targets have been set for the year 2010 for 11 of these commitments. Most of the associated indicators concern the organisation of development cooperation programmes and so do not have any direct implications for statistics. Exceptions are indicator 2, reliable country systems and indicator 11, Results-oriented frameworks , which directly support the use of statistics. Nevertheless, the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness\u2019 principles of ownership, alignment and accountability are likely to have considerable implications for statistics. The Fourth High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness is held in Busan, South Korea, at the end of 2011. It will set out a new framework for increasing the quality of aid in order to achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. The progress made on the commitments undertaken in the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness will be evaluated. A number of processes provide evidence from across the globe to inform the debate and outcomes from Busan: The \u2022 2011 Global Survey on Monitoring the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness , the third round of this survey, in which more than 90 countries have provided their input; An \u2022 Independent Evaluation of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness , focusing on what difference aid effectiveness action has made in reducing poverty and reaching the Millennium Development Goals. The evaluation is supplemented by studies of 21 developing countries and 7 donor agencies, examining how the principles of aid effectiveness have been put into practice and what effects this is having at the country level. The \u2022 2011 Survey on Monitoring the Principles for Good International Engagement in Fragile States and Situations provides facts on the progress in the quality and impact of engagement in countries in situations of conflict or fragility. An official \u2022 Partner Country Position Paper , based on an online consultation involving over 60 developing countries, summarises their expectations for the High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness.

EU development policies: the European Consensus on Development and its implications for statistics B.1.5.1. The European Consensus on Development as a framework for development policy The 2005 European Consensus on Development presented the European Commission\u2019s and EU Member States\u2019 common vision on development. As the EU is a signatory to the Millennium Declaration, The Millennium Development Goals are a critical element of the EU approach. The second part of the European Consensus on Development lays out \u2018the European Community Development Policy to guide implementation .\u2019 The Community will concentrate on areas where it has comparative advantages. These are: trade and regional integration, \u2022 the environment and the sustainable management of \u2022 natural resources, infrastructure, communications and transport, \u2022 water and energy, \u2022 rural development, territorial planning, agriculture and \u2022 food security, governance, democracy, human rights and support for \u2022 economic and institutional reforms, conflict prevention and fragile states, \u2022 human development, and \u2022 social cohesion and employment. \u2022 Cross-cutting issues to be focused on are: the promotion of human rights, gender equality, democracy, good governance, children\u2019s rights and indigenous peoples, conflict prevention, environmental sustainability and combating HIV/AIDS. The European Consensus on Development identifies (paragraph 115) a central role for statistics: \u2018 The Community will consistently use an approach based on results and performance indicators . Increasingly, conditionality is evolving towards the concept of a \u2018contract\u2019 based on negotiated mutual commitments formulated in terms of results .\u2019 Indicators, many based on data, are to be used to allocate funds between countries, to observe progress toward policy goals, specifically on progress on the MDGs (paragraphs 15 and 95) and to monitor development activities, including specifically monitoring the budget support instrument (paragraph 114). In addition, paragraph 15 notes that \u2018The EU will support partner countries\u2019 poverty reduction, development and reform strategies, which focus on the MDGs\u2026 Progress indicators and regular evaluation of assistance are of key importance to better focus EU assistance .\u2019 This implies a much wider group of policy-relevant indicators than the \u2018needs and performance criteria\u2019 used for fund allocation. Paragraph 95 notes that \u2018MDG-related performance indicators will be strengthened to better link sectoral and budget support to MDG progress and to ensure adequate funding for health and education.\u2019 The MDG indicators and poverty reduction strategy indicators are internationally accepted criteria. Although these indicators were previously used by the EU, their consistent use in policy monitoring is formalised by this document. It also states that funds are to be allocated between countries through \u2018 criteria based on needs and performance. \u2019 \u2018 The needs criteria include population, income per capita \u2026 poverty, income distribution and \u2026 social development, while the performance criteria include political, economic and social progress, \u2026 good governance and the effective use of aid \u2026 for development, beginning with \u2026 own resources \u2019 (paragraphs 64, 65). Thus, the approach to development policies put forward in the European Consensus on Development requires the use of statistics-based indicators in order to set priorities for the EU\u2019s development objectives, as well as to demonstrate progress at activity level and towards the achievement of policy goals. The challenge is to transfer this policy commitment into actual demand for statistics and to deliver the information required. B.1.5.2. Regional policy focus As noted in the previous section, the European Consensus on Development identifies regional integration as an area where the European Community has a comparative advantage; paragraphs 49 and 72 specifically identify regional cooperation on trade. Paragraph 78 identifies infrastructure as a cooperation area of regional interest; similarly for water issues (paragraph 81), agriculture and food security (84-5) and conflict prevention (89). The joint Africa-EU Strategy, adopted at the 2007 Lisbon Summit, identifies regional and continental integration as one of the four main objectives of the partnership (p.2 of the strategy document). Trade and regional integration is a strategy (p.9) for achieving the partnership\u2019s overall objectives. Regional Economic Communities (RECs) and the Economic Partnership Agreements are both identified as having a role in this field. Other issues identified that have a regional context are migration (paragraph 69), agriculture and food security (72), infrastructure (75), energy (81) and science and technical capacity (87). Paragraph 48 notes that \u2018\u2026 Africa and the EU will strengthen their cooperation in the field of statistics with the aim of helping policy makers and other users of statistics and enhancing ongoing efforts in the coordination and harmonisation of statistics in Africa within the framework of the African Charter on Statistics.\u2019 ",

How statistics are made The chapter in brief The chapter presents an overview of what constitutes official statistics, how they are produced and how they are disseminated. It addresses the following issues: Principles of statistics production and the consequent legal \u2022 framework for official statistics Overview of statistics operations from analysis and design to \u2022 dissemination of results Structure of the National Statistical System, how it organises \u2022 statistics production and how it relates to users of statistics Briefing on the role of regional and international organisations in \u2022 producing statistics and in standardising concepts and methods B.2.1. Official statistics and their fundamental principles B.2.1.1. Defining official statistics Official statistics are the statistics that are produced and disseminated by the specialised public organisations that make up the national and international statistical systems 6 . Official statistics are available publicly, freely or at relatively low cost; they aim to be a unique, definitive and generally accepted public measure and record of an economic, social or environmental condition. Areas of interest can be social, economic, environmental or other subjects relevant to public policy. Examples of official statistics include numbers of children born, numbers of unemployed people and measures of the quality of water, etc. Basic commentary on data that explains the main features of the latest data (metadata) is often included in official statistics publications. Official statistics, also called \u2018public statistics\u2019, are used to design, implement, monitor and evaluate public policies. Official statistics are published in many forms such as summary publications for the non-specialist public; press releases that can make newspaper headlines and affect financial markets; and large, detailed databases for further analysis by specialists. In recent years, the Internet has become a primary means of dissemination of statistics. In contrast to official statistics, unofficial, private or internal statistics are not necessarily publicly available or may be published at high cost for a specialist audience. Unofficial statistics often do not aim at being unique and definitive; their methodologies can be unpublished. Opinion polls, market research and company production data are examples of unofficial statistics. 6 Excluding any publications that are explicitly stated not to be official Most official statistics are \u2018descriptive statistics\u2019: numbers that represent observed measurements of a state or condition of a \u2018population\u2019. A population can consist, for example, of all persons, businesses or land areas in a country. The individual entities that make up the population are known as \u2018population units\u2019. Descriptive statistics also include \u2018metadata\u2019: information about the data. Metadata consists of: Concepts: the characteristics, definitions and descriptions \u2022 of observations or of a series of observations taken over time (time-series), including classifications Methods: analysis and accounts of how the data is collected \u2022 and processed. In surveys, the most important element is the sample methodology, which describes how the population was observed statistically. Metadata about official statistics is published, sometimes in manuals of \u2018sources and methods\u2019. The methods used to prepare the official statistics are therefore transparent. Unofficial statistics producers may or may not publish the methodology used. In contrast to \u2018descriptive statistics\u2019, \u2018theoretical statistics\u2019 make statements that infer relationships such as causes or forecasts of future trends in data. Because these studies hypothesise causal relationships, they are generally contestable and cannot aim at being unique and definitive measurements in the same way as official statistics. For this reason, economic forecasts, social analyses and environmental projections are usually worked on outside national statistics institutes, even though they are often based on official statistics. Economics, social scientists and environmentalists are therefore more often seen as users of official statistics than as producers. Official statistics are in certain circumstances based on statistical inferences (theoretical statistics). Examples include estimating missing data values, short term forecasts and estimation for the total population based on sample survey data. The range of official statistics can be classified by broad subject area.

The fundamental principles of official statistics The international community of statisticians has agreed on ten \u2018fundamental principles\u2019 with which official statistics must comply to correctly inform the public. These principles were adopted in 1994 by the United Nations Statistical Commission (see Box 2.1). The principles state that all organisations that are responsible for producing official statistics must: Compile and disseminate them in an impartial manner \u2022 Select their methods based on purely professional \u2022 considerations (strict scientific principles and ethical rules). Ensure the protection of personal data collected from \u2022 individuals and enterprises. The European Statistics Code of Practice is based on the United Nations\u2019 \u2018fundamental principles\u2019, develops them further and puts them into more concrete. It comprises 15 principles with each a set of indicators of good practices covering the institutional environment, statistical processes and outputs. The European Union\u2019s institutions involved with statistics, notably Eurostat, are committed to respect this code and to periodically assess its application through good practice indicators and a detailed questionnaire developed by Eurostat in co-operation with the EU National Statistical Institutes. Information on compliance with the code by statistical authorities is published on the Eurostat website . Box 2.1: The UN\u2019s Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics Principle 1. Official statistics provide an indispensable element in the information system of a democratic society, serving the Government, the economy and the public with data about the economic, demo- graphic, social and environmental situation. To this end, official sta- tistics that meet the test of practical utility are to be compiled and made available on an impartial basis by official statistical agencies to honour citizens\u2019 entitlement to public information. Principle 2. To retain trust in official statistics, the statistical agencies need to decide according to strictly professional considerations, in- cluding scientific principles and professional ethics, on the methods and procedures for the collection, processing, storage and presenta- tion of statistical data. Principle 3. To facilitate a correct interpretation of the data, the statis- tical agencies are to present information according to scientific stand- ards on the sources, methods and procedures of the statistics. Principle 4. The statistical agencies are entitled to comment on er- roneous interpretation and misuse of statistics. Principle 5 . Data for statistical purposes may be drawn from all types of sources, be they statistical surveys or administrative records. Statis- tical agencies are to choose the source with regard to quality, timeli- ness, costs and the burden on respondents. Principle 6. Individual data collected by statistical agencies for statis- tical compilation, whether they refer to natural or legal persons, are to be strictly confidential and used exclusively for statistical purposes. Principle 7. The laws, regulations and measures under which the sta- tistical systems operate are to be made public. Principle 8 . Coordination among statistical agencies within countries is essential to achieve consistency and efficiency in the statistical sys- tem. Principle 9. The use by statistical agencies in each country of inter- national concepts, classifications and methods promotes the consist- ency and efficiency of statistical systems at all official levels. Principle 10. Bilateral and multilateral cooperation in statistics con- tributes to the improvement of systems of official statistics in all coun- tries. ",
        "B 65 How Statistics are Made Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Box 2.2: The Principles of the European Statistics Code of Practice Principle 1: Professional Independence - The professional independence of statistical authorities from other policy, regulatory or administrative departments and bodies, as well as from private sector operators, ensures the credibility of European Statistics. Principle 2: Mandate for Data Collection - Statistical authorities must have a clear legal mandate to collect information for European statistical purposes. Administrations, enterprises and households, and the public at large may be compelled by law to allow access to or deliver data for European statistical purposes at the request of statistical authorities. Principle 3: Adequacy of Resources - The resources available to statistical authorities must be sufficient to meet European Statistics requirements. Principle 4: Quality Commitment - All ESS members commit themselves to work and co-operate according to the principles fixed in the Quality Declaration of the European Statistical System. Principle 5: Statistical Confidentiality - The privacy of data providers (households, enterprises, administrations and other respondents), the confidentiality of the information they provide and its use only for statistical purposes must be absolutely guaranteed. Principle 6: Impartiality and Objectivity - Statistical authorities must produce and disseminate European Statistics respecting scientific independence and in an objective, professional and transparent manner in which all users are treated equitably. Principle 7: Sound Methodology - Sound methodology must underpin quality statistics. This requires adequate tools, procedures and expertise. Principle 8: Appropriate Statistical Procedures \u2013 Appropriate statistical procedures, implemented from data collection to data validation, must underpin quality statistics. Principle 9: Non-Excessive Burden on Respondents - The reporting burden should be proportionate to the needs of the users and should not be excessive for respondents. The statistical authority monitors the response burden and sets targets for its reduction over time. Principle 10: Cost Effectiveness - Resources must be effectively used. Principle 11: Relevance - European Statistics must meet the needs of users. Principle 12: Accuracy and Reliability - European Statistics must accurately and reliably portray reality. Principle 13: Timeliness and Punctuality - European Statistics must be disseminated in a timely and punctual manner. Principle 14: Coherence and Comparability - European Statistics should be consistent internally, over time and comparable between regions and countries; it should be possible to combine and make joint use of related data from different sources. Principle 15: Accessibility and Clarity \u2013 European Statistics should be presented in a clear and understandable form, disseminated in a suitable and convenient manner, available and accessible on an impartial basis with supporting metadata and guidance. The African Charter on Statistics is based on the UN fundamental principles and requires the statistics system of Africa to adopt and respect them. In April 2008, the Joint African Union-UN Economic Commission for Africa Conference of African Ministers of Economy and Finance had approved the draft charter and recommended its submission to the Executive Council of the AU after its revision by legal experts. On 3 February 2009, the Charter was adopted by African Heads of State and Government. As of August 2010, 20 countries had signed the Charter, but only one country had signed and ratified it; it will enter into force when 15 countries have ratified it. As a consequence of the slow rate of ratification, the African Union has devised an Advocacy Strategy for the Signing and Ratification of the African Charter on Statistics . Goal 1 of this strategy is that \u201c The African Charter on Statistics is signed and ratified by the largest possible number of Member States and enters into force at the latest by 1 January 2012 after fifteen (15) Member States have deposited instruments of ratification with the Chairperson of the African Union Commission. \u201d ",

The Statistical Conference of the Americas of ECLAC identified the European Statistics Code of Practice as a standard for best statistical practices to be promoted in the Latin American and Caribbean region. This 2007 meeting requested Eurostat and ECLAC to prepare an action programme for its implementation in the context of the Memorandum of Understanding between the European Commission and ECLAC. The aim is to establish a frame of reference for good statistical practice appropriate for the Latin American and Caribbean region and to encourage its adoption especially in terms of the Institutional Environment. International organisations involved in the production and dissemination of statistics, principally UN agencies, similarly adopted Principles Governing International Statistical Activities in 2005. Once again, these are based on the \u2018fundamental principles\u2019. The International Statistical Institute (ISI), an independent professional association of statisticians, has drawn up a Declaration on professional ethics for statisticians. The aim of this declaration is to let the statistician\u2019s individual ethical judgments and decisions to be lead by shared values and experience, rather than by rigid rules imposed by the profession. The declaration documents widely held principles of statistical inquiry and identifies factors that hamper their use.

        "B 68 How Statistics are Made Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 B.2.1.3. Legal framework for statistics The legal framework for the powers and responsibilities of government, individuals and private organisations concerning the collection and publication of statistical information is known as \u2018Statistics law\u2019. Most countries have adopted laws and other regulatory instruments which define the conditions in which activities relating to official statistics will be carried out. In principle, statistical law should conform to and implement the UN fundamental principles of official statistics. Statistics law therefore generally covers the following areas: Authorisation and responsibility for collection and \u2022 publication of statistical data: hence the organisation and functioning of the National Statistical System (NSS) and National Statistical Institute (NSI); Independence of statistical activity from political \u2022 authorities; Obligation on individuals and organisations to reply \u2022 truthfully to official surveys and censuses; Dissemination rules and confidentiality of statistical data, \u2022 including exchange of statistical information within the public administration; Programming procedures, including a requirement for \u2022 broad stakeholder consultation and transparency. The existence of adequate statistics legislation and its implementation are key conditions for the development of official statistics. Effective implementation requires stakeholders to accept that the statistical law is a prerequisite for disseminating quality statistics that respond to users\u2019 needs. Missing or poorly implemented statistical legislation may create a number of problems, which can seriously influence the quality of the statistics: Undefined responsibility for authorising statistical \u2022 activities can result in parallel activities being undertaken by different authorities. This in turn can mean additional administrative burden on respondents, inefficient use of public funds and multiple statistical publications. Dependence of statistics institutes on political authorities \u2022 can result in statistical data being released late or not at all or being subject to manipulation. Without a guarantee of confidential treatment of responses, \u2022 individuals and organisations may refuse to answer surveys for fear of the possible consequences, for example on their taxation. This can occur even if there are effective penalties for survey non-response. High response burden due to lacking coordination, missing trust in the integrity and objectivity of the statistical office, as well as doubts about the confidentiality of the information given, may discourage respondents and lead to inaccurate responses. It may also discourage the staff of the statistical office. Lacking coordination and cooperation between authorities may limit the possibilities for cross-checking or benchmarking statistical data against other sources. Furthermore, inefficient use of funds reduces the resources available for internal capacity building in the statistical office, such as staff training, investment in ICT and improved statistical procedures and operations (sampling frames, data collection and processing, quality controls, dissemination, etc). On the other hand, over-prescriptive legislation can lead to inflexible statistical organisations and publications. Statistics legislation exists within a national legal and administrative framework. Since these structures can differ greatly between countries for historical reasons, there can be no single approach to the development of statistical legislation and to the organisation of administrative structures producing statistics. Whatever approach is adopted, it should conform to the UN fundamental principles of official statistics and to any regional frameworks based on them. The UN Handbook of Statistical Organisation gives guidance on the legal structure. A good example of modern statistical legislation is Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on European Statistics No 223/2009 , also known as the \u2018Statistical Law\u2019 in Europe. In particular, the Statistical Law states that European statistics shall be produced according to the principle of subsidiarity, independence, integrity and accountability of the statistical authorities. It also gives reference to the European Statistics Code of Practice and defines quality principles. The Statistical Law defines the European Statistical System (ESS): It gives Eurostat a coordinating role on EU level and the NSIs on a national level. Eurostat is also responsible for the coordination of statistical activities of all EU institutions. The Statistical Law gives Eurostat flexibility to respond to future challenges, such as rapidly emerging policy needs, also outside the five-year statistical programmes. At the same time, it provides a stable and transparent legal basis. To find out more\u2026 UN Handbook of Statistical Organisatio \u2022 n ESS websit \u2022 e ",
        "B 69 How Statistics are Made Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 B.2.2. The statistical process B.2.2.1. Main types of statistical operations Official statistics are derived from various sources. The basic distinction is between administrative and survey data collection. In the former, data is collected without direct contact from respondents; the latter method is based on direct questioning of respondents. Sometimes a mix of data sources, known as mixed mode , is used to produce statistics. Administrative data is produced from information about the population held in administrative registers 7 , e.g. registers on trade operators (see section D.10.2), businesses (see section D.13.2), vehicles (see section D.15.3), population (see section D.22.2), school enrolment (see section D.23.4), deaths and births (see section D.24.2) and job-seekers (see section D.27.3). Such data have been collected for an administrative purpose. It might often be possible to produce official statistics on the basis of administrative data. The costs of collecting administrative data are covered through the budget of the responsible body. Thus, the costs of further use (\u2018secondary use\u2019) for official statistics of these data are normally limited to the additional costs of preparing them for statistical use. However, the definition of variables is often different from what is ideally needed for producing statistics, the population covered might be different from the one the statistics aim to measure, and the quality controls are aimed at assuring quality for the original administrative purpose and not for statistical use. However, such issues can be relieved by cooperation between the statistical office and the institutions holding the administrative data. Coordination of the data collection for both administrative and statistical use carry a vast potential for cost reduction and reduction of response burden, while at the same time offering better coverage of the population. In developed countries, where the use of administrative data is more widespread than in developing countries, statistical legislation often grants the statistical office influence on administrative data collections and data. Examples of administrative records that are used as sources of administrative statistics are reports of schools, monthly compilation of customs statistics, weekly reports by hospitals, daily civil registration of births and deaths (vital statistics) and annual and quarterly surveys of enterprises, based on establishment or business registers. All of these examples are achievable by many developing countries. Surveys collect data direct from respondents. They can be divided into two groups: Censuses 8 , e.g. on population (see section D.16.3 and section D.22.2) and agriculture (see section D.17.2), collect data from all population units, for example all persons, all households or all businesses. This method is used when there is a need 7 Examples of registers are not exhaustive 8 Examples for censuses are not exhaustive for exhaustive information about the population, or when there is only a small number of units in the population (e.g. hydro power plants or steel producers). When the population is large, the costs of carrying out a census are very high; the number and complexity of questions that can be asked must therefore be carefully selected to balance the costs and information value. Censuses are also valuable to give a complete overview over a population, which can be used to draw samples for later surveys (\u2018sampling frame\u2019) Sample surveys 9 , e.g. on household expenditure (see section D.12.2), enterprises (see section D.13.3), road freight transport (see section D.13.5), farm structure (see section D.17.2.3), income and living conditions (see section D.21.3), health (see section D.24.2) and labour force (see section D.27.2.1), collect data from a sample that has been selected from the target population to be representative of its characteristics. Various statistical methods are used to derive a representative sample, of which the simplest is random sampling. Other techniques are often based on a sampling frame. Statistical data is also produced through estimating , modelling, short-term forecasting and other methods based on existing data pools. These methods are used to provide, for example, current period statistics when data has been only partially received. How statistics are collected in any particular country depends on legal and administrative structures. Even within the EU, statistics collection methods vary considerably, especially for social statistics. Statistics collection methods can also depend on development levels. For example vital statistics (i.e. births and deaths) that in developed countries usually come from the official register are often collected by survey in low income countries. The inherent advantage of survey-based data over administrative data is that the survey questions can be tailored specifically to give information about the statistical concept of interest. In contrast, administrative data is defined or categorised by the purpose of the data collection, which is generally unrelated to statistics. Survey questions are also more readily revised to capture changing population characteristics, although revisions come at the expense of lack of comparability with historic data. If there exists administrative information which is sufficiently close to the information collected by survey, one may consider replacing this survey (or part of the survey) by the administrative information. Clear advantages are lower costs (as the costs are already covered by the administrative body collecting and holding the data) and potentially a much larger number of observations, meaning greater accuracy . Several conditions must be considered when considering whether a survey can be replaced by administrative data, most importantly: 9 Examples for sample surveys are not exhaustive ",
        "B 70 How Statistics are Made Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Whether the administrative concepts are sufficiently \u2022 close to the desired statistical concept, or whether there is a satisfactory method of converting the administrative concept into the statistical concept; Whether the register of units covered by the administrative \u2022 data is accurate and up to date; To which extent the administrative data cover the \u2022 population covered by the survey; Whether appropriate quality controls are in place; \u2022 Whether the long-term availability of the administrative \u2022 data is assured, or whether the content or existence of the data are liable to be changed on short notice through administrative or political decisions. Often, problems in the administrative data concerning incomplete coverage of the statistical population or missing information on certain issues can be addressed through mixed mode data collection. This means that the administrative data replaces a greater or smaller part of a survey, but that the information which cannot be extracted from the administrative data is still collected by survey. Another important use of administrative data is to benchmark, quality assess and calibrate survey results. When a survey can be replaced by administrative data, this may be considered as a sign of development of the statistical system and maturity of the administration. However, basing statistics on administrative data require a good and close cooperation between the statistical office and the administrative body concerned. In this context, a useful tool is to grant the statistical office influence on the set-up and contents of administrative systems and databases through the national Statistical Law. A key issue to consider regarding the quality of information is that respondents trust that data confidentiality is respected by the administrative body; in extension, any statistical use of these data must also assure this confidentiality. Even though the costs to the statistical office may be substantially reduced, it must still be prepared to pay for the preparation of the data for statistical use and for quality controls and statistical processing. In the end, even the replacement of one single question in a survey may turn out to be a major undertaking. A good example of the different sources that can be used to produce statistics occurs in vital statistics: data on births and deaths. In developed countries, this information comes from registers of birth and deaths and is usually highly accurate. Some developing countries are also able to maintain these registers to a high standard. Elsewhere, registers might be accurate only in urban areas, may be unreliable or may not exist at all. In these cases, demographic surveys are required to collect the information. If the surveys are intermittent, for example if they are based on the population census and hence occur only every ten years, then problems with respondent recall or survival bias will bring inaccuracies into the data, although methods exist to reduce these problems. In the absence of a register, the best way to collect vital data is therefore relatively frequent surveys of a representative sample of the population, drawn using a sampling frame that is derived from a population census. In some situations, for example health statistics, statistics from administrative and survey sources exist side by side. They can convey very different information because they are measuring different phenomena: the administrative data will cover events related to government run health facilities, while the sample surveys may cover population health events in part or all of the country. It is possible that neither source provides full coverage of health related issues. In this situation, further analysis of both data sources may provide information that is contained in neither data series alone. The national accounts (see chapter D.11) are compiled from many statistical sources, including the above sources, to measure exhaustively the flows of national income and expenditure within an economy and with the rest of the world. Core censuses and sample surveys include: Population Census \u2022 (see chapter D.16 and chapter D.22) is a primary source of information about the size of population, its composition, characteristics, spatial distribution and organization into families and households. Because censuses are used as the basis for sample frames for household surveys, the population census provides the basis for data collection and compilation for comprehensive statistical information for economic and social development. Housing and agriculture censuses are also undertaken, sometimes as part of the population census. Price surveys \u2022 (see chapter D.12) in consumer outlets are the basis of the Consumer Price Index (CPI), one of the most widely quoted official statistics. Other measures of inflation also make use of producer price surveys. Household Budget Surveys (HBS) \u2022 provide data on household consumption, expenditure and income and thus the socio-economic characteristics of the population such as the prevalence of poverty. HBS results are also inputs into a variety of economic statistics, including national accounts. Household budget surveys are examined in further detail in chapter D.21. Many developing country household surveys are carried out according to an internationally standardised international format, permitting comparison between developing countries. Some cover more than one policy area: Living Standards Measurement Studies (LSMS) \u2022 , initiated in 1980 by the World Bank, LSMS have become an important tool in measuring and understanding poverty in developing countries.

The statistical production process step by step Box 2.4 shows a generic picture of the process of producing statistics. This applies to all statistical series, whether based on administrative sources, surveys or both. The statistical system is set in motion by a request for statistical information to support the preparation, implementation or public oversight of an issue of public concern. A mechanism is required to identify and rank the various demands for data so that official statistics stay relevant to public policy priorities. The output of the system is the dissemination of the resulting statistics. The analysis and design stage considers which statistics are to be presented, how they are to be presented and how this output is to be best achieved. It is vital to involve key users of the statistics at the design stage. Only if the users\u2019 needs for these specific statistics are taken into account will the statistics actually be relevant to users; \u2018Relevance\u2019 is a main dimension of statistical quality. Data is collected, organised on computer in accordance with the initial design, checked and corrected as necessary. The results are compiled in detail and in summary. The analysis looks at the main features of the results, including comparisons with recent historical data. The statistics are then published in various forms, targeted at different types of user. The methods used (known as metadata) are also published, if this has not been previously done. Box 2.4: The organisation of the statistical process ",

Users of official statistics Statistical data exists to answer the questions of decision- makers, whether public or private, national or international. Users of statistics are therefore important members of National Statistics Systems. Box 2.5: Users of official statistics Five groups of users of official statistics can generally be identified: government \u2022 : political decision-makers and officials of central government, local authorities and supranational bodies; general public \u2022 : press and citizens; business \u2022 : enterprises, business and employers\u2019 representatives and trade unions; other countries and international organisations \u2022 : including trade partners and development partners other users \u2022 : research centres and non-governmental organisations, whether national and international. Statistical data are often further analysed following publication, by journalists, researchers, professional analysts and others. The use of official statistics for studying effects of government policies and other issues in society adds value to statistics. Widespread use and analysis of official statistics also serves to verify the quality of the statistics and to rise the authority of the official statistics if the quality is perceived as good. The core use of official statistics is in preparation, public discussion, implementation and evaluation of government policies. Therefore, the largest users of official statistics are, as a rule, government agencies and policy-makers. As well as being intensive users of general economic, demographic and other data, business users can demand detailed sector information. As data providers, businesses may have apprehensions about the confidentiality of the data they furnish, in particular whether competitors can deduce facts about their business from published data. In addition, businesses might be concerned about the workload of providing data. Statistics can be used to analyse the outcomes of different policies that are pursued in comparable countries and regions, provided that the statistics have the same definitions and similar coverage. Consequently, the closer countries work together, for example in an economic union, the greater is the demand for comparable harmonised data . As a result, the EU has often taken the lead in international efforts to harmonise statistical concepts and methodologies and as a rule EU Member States\u2019 statistics are more directly comparable than are data from other developed countries. The role of regional and international organisations in statistics is further explored in section B.2.4. Much user demand for data is fairly stable: many users require statistics to remain comparable over time so that the effect of long-term policies can be assessed. However, new policy fields give rise to new demands for official statistics: examples include economic and social globalisation and climate change. Users now demand statistics to be available in considerable detail through the internet, which can help reduce data dissemination costs. Policy driven demand for additional information requires that a financial commitment is made so that new statistics can be published. Cooperation partners are key users of statistics, both in allocating funds and in evaluating progress of recipients of funds towards development goals. In low income developing countries, the statistics user community can be small and there may be few skilled analysts. In this situation, the cooperation partners may become the primary users of statistics, even if they are aware of and guard against this possibility. Because cooperation partners and international agencies need to make cross-country comparisons in order to evaluate the effectiveness of their policies, they are often supporters of regional harmonisation of data, so that it becomes regionally comparable. In the past, development cooperation partners commissioned surveys to \u2018their own\u2019 specifications in order to obtain data that met their requirements. National ownership of statistics and elimination of overlapping surveys mean that this practice is now less common. B.2.3.2. The organisation of a National Statistics Systems The term \u2018National Statistics System\u2019 (NSS) refers collectively to a country\u2019s statistics producers, i.e. the National Statistical Offices (NSI) and other producers of official statistics. Mostly, the NSI is at the heart of the statistical system (but, for instance, USA is an exception). The structure of a NSS is generally built on national administrative or legal traditions. In developed countries, the statistical system is normally defined by a Statistical Law, which in particular states the main principle of the professional independence of the NSI. The Statistical Law also defines the obligations (e.g. relating to confidentiality) and rights (e.g. to influence and access administrative data registers) of the NSI. There is no \u2018right way\u2019 to organise an NSS; it is always dependent on traditions and organisation of the national administration. Three structural elements describe how an NSS is organised: Functional centralisation: the extent to which the whole process of production and dissemination of official statistics is managed directly by the NSI. In a more functionally centralised system, the NSI and the Central Bank are together responsible for most or all statistical publications and a large proportion of surveys and administrative data collection. ",
        "B 73 How Statistics are Made Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 In a less functionally centralised system, line ministries such as health and education ministries publish their own statistics and the NSI may have a restricted role in carrying out surveys. Geographical centralisation \u2022 : the extent to which statisti- cal functions carried out throughout a country\u2019s territory are controlled by the central NSI. In large or federal coun- tries, the NSI may have a federal structure. In particular, data collection may be carried out by state statistical insti- tutions, so that the NSI must maintain consistent stand- ards and methodologies for data collection across all states. With extreme geographic decentralisation, data collection units may be part of state / provincial administrations with no direct links to the NSI. System coordination: \u2022 The NSS may be coordinated through a National Council for Statistics which has the re- sponsibility for coordinating statistical activities and meth- odologies and in which the main producers and users are represented. Such a council may have effective coordinat- ing responsibilities, notably responsibility for authorising surveys, or else may be purely advisory. Alternatively, the NSI may itself be legally responsible for prioritising and coordinating activities and methodologies, in which case it would normally be answerable directly to national authori- ties. The organisation of the NSS varies between countries. However, the main principle of professional independence of the NSI should always be maintained. Coordination of statistics activities is very important: without it, different government bodies can organise multiple data collections and produce competing statistics sources, none of which would be credible. Common methodologies are required to achieve coherence of results between different statistical series through the use of common classifications, concepts and methods. Agreed methodologies are also required to meet standards agreed with international organisations. The more an NSS is functionally decentralised, the more system co-ordination becomes important. As well as providing a framework for formalising co- ordination between data producers, a National Council for Statistics can also be an essential place for dialogue between statistics producers and users. The Council sometimes has an additional role of promotion of statistics and may be requested to give its opinion on issues such as statistical programmes and the legal framework for statistical activity. Alternatively, where there is no Council, a consultative committee can be used for dialogue with statistics users. Box 2.6 describes the semi-autonomous NSI in Uganda, which is responsible for NSS coordination. Box 2.6: Uganda Bureau of Statistics Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS) is the principal data collecting, processing, analysing and disseminating agency responsible for coordinating and supervising the National Statistical System. Formerly the Statistics Department of the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, it was transformed into a semi-autonomous body by the Uganda Bureau of Statistics Act No. 12, 1998. The decision to establish the Bureau arose from the need for an efficient and user-responsive agency that would meet the growing demand for statistics in the country. UBOS itself coordinates \u2018the development and maintenance of a National Statistical System which will ensure collection, analysis and dissemination of integrated, reliable and timely statistical information.\u2019 The provisions of the UBOS Act include the following: UBOS will be responsible for: providing high quality central statistics information services; i. promoting standardization in the collection, analysis and ii. publication of statistics to ensure uniformity in quality, adequacy of coverage and reliability of statistics information; providing guidance, training and other assistance as may be iii. required to other users and providers of statistics; Promoting cooperation, coordination and rationalization among iv. users and providers of statistics at national and local levels so as to avoid duplication of effort and ensure optimal utilization of scarce resources; Promoting and being the focal point of cooperation with statistics v. users and providers at regional and international levels. UBOS will be a source of official statistical information. UBOS may perform the following functions: review all initiatives to collect data at the national and local a. government levels and approve instruments developed for data collection including census frames, registers, sample designs and questionnaires; collect, compile, analyze and publish social, environmental, b. economic and national accounts statistics; conduct censuses and surveys as the need arises; c. collect routine administrative statistics; d. organise and maintain a central depository of statistical reports, e. publications, documents and data from both within and outside Uganda; guide and coordinate local government statistical services; f. The UBOS Board is made up of up to seven members, including up to three members from major producers and users of statistics. UBOS is required to \u2018consult and cooperate\u2019 with other statistics producers and vice versa. There is no user consultative committee identified on the UBOS website. www.ubos.org ",

About the various ways in which NSSs are organised, see \u2018 Models of Statistical Systems \u2019 by Roger Edmunds B.2.3.3. Statistical data producers B.2.3.3.1. The National Statistical Institute The National Statistical Institute (NSI) is the main body of the NSS, the core producer of official statistics. Its responsibilities may vary, as explored in section B.2.3.2. The NSI can have the status of a ministerial department or be an autonomous government body with its own budget. The regulatory authority of an NSI also varies from one country to another: Presidency, Prime Minister, a Minister in charge of the economy, finance or planning or a Parliamentary Committee. In some countries, the NSI is part of a ministerial department and is not directly responsible to a Minister. The statute of the NSI and its administrative attachment influence its autonomy vis-\u00e0-vis the political power and its authority within the NSS. Whatever the legal and administrative structure for an NSI, the important elements for the effective functioning of a NSI are: guarantees of professional independence \u2022 assured financial support \u2022 a clear public mandate from government \u2022 operational flexibility as to how it meets that mandate \u2022 NSIs can be organised by function, by statistical subject or a mixture of the two. The UK\u2019s Office for National Statistics, for example, has directorates for subjects such as \u2018macroeconomics and labour market\u2019 and also for functions such as \u2018surveys and administrative sources\u2019 and \u2018methodology\u2019. France\u2019s NSI, INSEE (lnstitut National de la Statistique et des Etudes Economiques) is largely organised along subject matter lines, with few functional directorates. In the USA, the activities of an NSI are undertaken by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. Census Bureau and other institutions. American textbooks may reflect this structure. A wide range of developing country NSI structures exists. See for example the structures of the Botswana CSO, Cameroon\u2019s INS and the Mozambique INE. Francophone developing countries generally reflect INSEE\u2019s structure. Anglophone developing countries have varying organisational structures that mostly do not replicate current or historical British practice. To find out more\u2026 About NSIs in developed and developing countries, visit the websites of statistics producing organisations in the UK, France, the USA, Botswana, Cameroon and Mozambique: France: http://www.insee.fr/fr/a_propos/connaitre/ organisation/directions.htm United Kingdom: http://www.statistics.gov.uk/about_ns/foi/ons _org_chart.asp USA: http://www.bls.gov/; http://www.census.gov/ Botswana: http://www.cso.gov.bw/index.php?option=com content1&parent_id=184&id=362&nid=184# Cameroun: http://www.statistics-cameroon.org/manager .php?id=2 Mozambique: http://www.ine.gov.mz/home_page/o_ine/dir _organograma/organograma National Statistical Institutes may and arguably should also play a coordinating role for the NSS (see section B.2.3) and usually act as representatives of the NSS in international meetings. However, representation in international meetings depends on the structure of the NSS. When other official bodies are responsible for certain statistics they may be the national representative in such meetings, e.g. the Ministry for Internal Affairs for migration and asylum statistics or the Customs Service for classification of external trade products. A primary group of challenges facing NSIs in many transition and developing countries concern their financing . Financial problems may consist of: Insufficient \u2022 budgets, Late \u2022 authorisation or release of funds; or Lack of \u2022 multi-year funding coupled with unpredictable annual budgets. Insufficient financial resources are often the cause of a human resources shortage. Many developing country NSIs are unable to pay sufficiently to attract and retain high quality staff. Externally funded statistics operations often pay more (and on time) than nationally funded actions. This can lead to staff leaving national statistics producers or to statistics producers prioritising externally funded surveys at the expense of regular statistics production. A more recent phenomenon is the increased demand from resurgent private sectors for statisticians with a few years\u2019 experience. Another problem is the ageing of professional teams and its consequences in weak technical competence especially in new technologies. Good practice in statistical governance is of strategic importance. If an NSI forms part of a government ministry and does not have direct responsibility at ministerial level, it is unlikely that it will be sufficiently independent to publish data without political review or that an appropriate policy- level dialogue can develop. This lack of dialogue with political ",
        "B 75 How Statistics are Made Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 decision makers can also be the cause of the financing problems referred to above. Moreover, an NSI\u2019s inability to make or adjust its priorities to inform development policy may result from poor communications with decision makers. Operational flexibility covers the ability of the NSI to hire appropriately qualified staff at reasonable salaries, set its own internal structure (hence have the ability to restructure) and not be overly constrained to use government common resources, such as printing facilities, where their use would prevent the NSI from meeting its statistical objectives. These issues are explored in greater detail in chapter C.5. To find out more\u2026 about how an NSI is organised, see: The Handbook of Statistical Organisation, The Third Edition: The operation and organisation of a statistical agency . United Nations Statistical Division, 2003. B.2.3.3.2. Other producers of official statistics The organisation of the National Statistical System governs which statistics are produced by other bodies than the NSI. All producers of official statistics should be covered by the fundamental principles and statistical codes of practice in the same way as NSIs. Their production of official statistics is normally included in the national work programme for Official statistics (see section B.2.1). Central banks are responsible for overseeing the financial and banking system. Thus, they are generally responsible for compiling monetary and financial statistics. In some countries, the central bank is also responsible for the balance of payments statistics, as the primary source for this is the Central banks\u2019 report on financial transactions with abroad. In addition, in some countries, the national accounts are published by the central bank. The central bank, together with the finance ministry, is the contact point and dialogue partner for the International Monetary Fund. Line ministries such as agriculture, health, education, customs or social security may have statistical services. The justification for producing statistics in these ministries is that they have in-depth knowledge of the field and of any specific issues or problems which needs to be considered. They also have a close contact with the actors in the area. Thus, they are in prime position to validate and assure the quality of data. In particular, data from administrative sources, such as hospital data, are usually collected by the line ministry, but may be processed and published either by them or by the NSI. Whatever way the tasks are assigned to institutions, the line ministry and the NSI need to coordinate methodologies and classifications so that the resulting data is coherent with statistics from other sources such as health surveys. Surveys that are funded by external assistance and are organised independently of national statistics operations constitute a further group of statistics production. This type of action is particularly prevalent in developing country health statistics where there is urgent need of data but little national capacity to collect it. The challenge is to integrate the autonomous projects within the National Statistics System so that the data is collected according to appropriate national classifications, especially geographic, and that the resulting statistics are disseminated widely within the country, including through the National Statistics System. The capacity created by these statistics actions should be used to benefit the National Statistics System and the working methods and concepts and classifications can potentially be used to benefit the National Statistics System. Such surveys arise because many developing countries\u2019 NSIs have difficulties in obtaining and using financial resources effectively. When confidence in the NSI is lost, statistical activities can be transferred to or carried out in parallel by line ministries or the central bank. While there is no necessity that the NSI is the organisation responsible for compiling, for example, the national accounts, it is essential that an appropriate division of properly financed work is maintained between institutions. B.2.4. The role of international and regional organisations with statistical activities B.2.4.1. International organisations B.2.4.1.1. Overview Generally, international organisations that undertake statistical activities carry out the following tasks: Development and agreement on international standards \u2022 for statistical activities; Compilation and dissemination of globally comparable \u2022 statistical information; Support for countries\u2019 efforts to strengthen their national \u2022 statistical systems through technical and financial means; Coordination of international statistics-related activities. \u2022 The United Nations (UN) acts through the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD), i.e. a part of the Department of Social and Economic Affairs, as a coordinator of the global statistical system and a repository of certain international statistical data. Furthermore, certain UN specialised agencies perform statistical activities, notably compiling globally comparable data and working in their respective fields of competence on methodological improvement. The Partnership in Statistics for Development in the 21st Century (PARIS21) aims at developing a culture of evidence- based policy making which seeks to improve governance and ",
        "B 76 How Statistics are Made Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 government effectiveness in reducing poverty and achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDG). PARIS21 focuses on promoting high-quality statistics and making the data meaningful by informing development policy decisions and managing their implementation. The consortium\u2019s role is to foster more effective dialogue among those who produce development statistics and those who use them. Its current objective is for every developing country to have designed a National Strategy for the Development of Statistics (NSDS) in order to have nationally owned and produced data for all MDG indicators by 2010. Other global organisations that have significant statistical methodology or coordinating roles are the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). In particular, the World Bank Trust Fund for Statistical Capacity Building (TFSCB) can provide the resources to support the drafting of NSDSs. Box 2.10 illustrates the development cooperation roles of certain UN agencies and other international organizations, showing selected publications and databases. In addition to that, PARIS21 publishes the \u2018Global Directory of Partners in Statistical Capacity Development\u2019 , in order to strengthen the partnership of statistical actors. The coordination role of international organisations means that they are able to introduce statistical initiatives on a regional or a global scale. Also at national level, international organisations sometimes take the lead among the donors in coordinating statistics interventions. To find out more\u2026 About the coordinating role of the UNSD see: http://unstats.un.org/unsd/default.htm http://www.paris21.org/ Introductions to other global institutions with statistics roles include: http://go.worldbank.org/SI5SSGAVZ0 http://www.imf.org/external/data.htm http://www.oecd.org/statistics http://www.uis.unesco.org/ http://childinfo.org B.2.4.1.2. Data compiling and disseminating The United Nations specialised agencies and other regional and international organisations compile and publish data in their fields of competence based on information they receive from national authorities. As a rule, the international agencies process the data by making adjustments to ensure comparability across the countries, producing estimations for missing data and disseminating the results through public databases and publications. In certain cases, the UN specialised agencies may also make forecasts of economic data. Some of this data is used for high profile development aid allocation and investment decisions. Data in this category includes the Millennium Development Goals indicators database and the IMF\u2019s International Financial Statistics. Major international data sources are shown in Box 2.8. Since the data has been processed to achieve comparability, international data publications typically do not match the national statistics publications of developing countries. There is a continuing debate between developing countries and international organisations, especially those responsible for sections of the MDG indicators database. The issues concern data transmission from developing countries to the international organisations and the transparency of the data processing and estimation methodologies used by the international organisations to harmonise statistics across countries for this database. Regional integration, especially trade agreements, creates demand for comparable data. Regional organisations such as the EU disseminate regionally harmonised and therefore comparable data from their Member States. The European Statistical System\u2019s approach to harmonisation is often seen as a model in other regions. ",
        "B 77 How Statistics are Made Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Box 2.7: What metadata can do for you Metadata is Information that is needed to correctly use and interpret statistics; they are data that describe other data (\u2018ordinary\u2019 data become metadata when they are used in this way). Generally, metadata can be split in structural and reference metadata. Structural metadata is used to identify, formally describe or retrieve statistical data: Examples are: dimension names, variable names, dictionaries, dataset technical descriptions, dataset locations, keywords for finding data etc. Structural metadata includes e.g. the titles of the variables and dimensions of statistical datasets, as well as the units employed, code lists, data formats, potential value ranges, time dimensions, value ranges of flags, classifications used, etc. Reference metadata (sometimes called explanatory metadata) describes the contents and the quality of the statistical data from a semantic point of view. It includes explanatory texts on the context of the statistical data, methodologies for data collection and aggregation, as well as quality and dissemination characteristics. There are several international frameworks for structuring and disseminating reference metadata, including the IMF\u2019s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) and Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) (see Box 5.9). Metadata give crucial insight into the data, which is vital for understanding how data can be used, whether they are comparable with other statistics and how reliable analysis based on them is likely to be. For example, metadata should give answers to questions such as: What is the source of the data; sample survey, census, administrative \u2022 records or a combination of several sources? Who is producing the statistics? For whom and for what purpose are the data compiled? Which \u2022 persons or entities are covered by the statistics, and how are the characteristics defined? What is the quality of the data? Do they follow international \u2022 standards and classifications and statistical good practice? What is the frequency of the data collection? Is it certain that the \u2022 data collection will be repeated with regular frequency? Is there a legal basis for the data collection? Are the statistics comparable with corresponding statistics in other \u2022 countries? Are they comparable with other national statistics? More information on metadata can be found on Eurostat\u2019s RAMON metadata server . B.2.4.1.3. International statistical concepts and methods To produce statistics that are comparable across countries, common concepts, classifications and methods need to be defined and implemented (concepts and methods were discussed in section B.2.1 above). For example, concepts of unemployment, grey economy and foreign population have been defined at international level. Established international nomenclatures and classifications include those covering economic activities ( ISIC ), the classification of occupations ( ISCO ) or the classification of diseases . Similarly, standard methods for carrying out statistical actions are described in international manuals.

        "B 79 How Statistics are Made Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Revisions of methodologies and classifications are carried out periodically through dialogue among statisticians from national and international institutions, often coordinated through the United Nations Statistics Division. The periodic revisions of the System of National Accounts are among the most complex of these activities: revisions are dated 1968, 1993 and 2008. The purpose of methodological updates in general is to ensure that the methods and concepts used in the statistics remain relevant to the economic, social or environmental issues being measured. In addition, greater attention is now being drawn during methodological revisions to the needs of developing countries. One such need is to ensure that developing countries with limited statistical resources are able to produce statistics that meet the international standards while avoiding unnecessary complexity. Furthermore, statistical concepts need to be appropriate to the economic and social conditions found in developing countries. For example, in economic statistics the output of the informal and subsistence economies needs to be taken into account. Another example is in social statistics: the definition of a household can differ in some developing regions from the models commonly found in developed countries. A valuable source for information on the quality and availability of data in individual countries is the IMF\u2019s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) (see Box 5.9) and Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) . The GDDS is mainly used by developing countries, whereas SDDS is used mainly by developed countries and transition countries. The objective of the GDDS is to encourage the production and dissemination of complete sets of data with widest coverage, based on international methodologies. The GDDS contains reference metadata such as explanatory texts on the context of the statistical data, methodologies for data collection and aggregation, as well as quality and dissemination characteristics (see Box 2.7 for further details on metadata). This information covers both general system information and information on some selected statistical areas. GDDS provide key information on the overall state of countries\u2019 statistical systems and their adoption of international methodologies and classifications. This is valuable input for planning and evaluation of technical assistance in statistics. GDDS metadata are also useful to co- ordinate, assess, implement and evaluate statistical programs across agencies and donors. Further details on statistical quality can be found in section C.5.3 and on IMF\u2019s Standards Bulletin Board . In developing countries, international classifications and methodologies are not always fully adhered to . This is often because major statistics actions such as surveys have not been carried out for some time. Good practice in developing countries is to implement methodological or classification updates when there is a major statistical action, such as periodic survey or census or a change in an index base year. Surveys therefore need to be sufficiently well planned to permit the adoption of current international classifications. For example, in household budget surveys, the main purpose is to provide an overview of and measure trends in poverty and welfare at national and sub-national level. The main measures derived are household consumption, income poverty and a range of non-consumption measures, such as in education, health and water sectors. These enable the survey to: Provide a set of baseline measures \u2022 Assess trends and track progress resulting from poverty \u2022 reduction policies. Comparisons with a baseline offer information about changes in poverty and the effect of policies pursued. Furthermore, this survey is also the basis of the consumer price index weighting scheme and so the classifications used have to be compatible with the consumer expenditure classification. Achievement of all objectives of this survey requires close collaboration of statisticians specialized on social issues, survey specialists, price statisticians, system specialists and others. Attainment of this level of cooperation is a senior management task . Support in these tasks is provided through the International Household Survey Network (IHSN) , which is a partnership of international organizations seeking to improve the availability, quality and use of survey data in developing countries. IHSN maintains a database on household surveys in developing country; it is a very useful source for information on which household surveys have been carried out and which surveys are planned. In addition, IHSN provides methodologies and practical tools and guidelines for household surveys, In addition, the Accelerated Data Program (ADP) provides technical and financial support to documentation and dissemination of survey data, and helps developing countries to set up national survey databanks. IHSN is described in more detail in Box 1.10 and ADP in Box 5.2. ",

In the past, classification changes often required significant updates to computer systems, although current systems are more easily changed. In developing countries, adoption of a new index base or classification still usually requires computer systems to be updated. Internationally agreed concepts and methods express a minimum consensus: where appropriate, some flexibility for countries in meeting the standards is permitted. In particular, classifications such as trade classifications are mandatory at more aggregate levels, with some flexibility permitted at detailed level. However, for direct comparability between country statistics at detailed level, greater harmonisation not only of classifications but of concepts and methods generally is required. Regional partnerships require increased statistical harmonisation in order to prepare, monitor and evaluate the partnerships\u2019 common policies. Due to the EU\u2019s high level of economic integration, Europe has become a leading force in international harmonisation of statistics. National accounts represent a good example of successful harmonisation. The global standard in recent years has been the 1993 System of National Accounts (SNA93). The European Union has built on the SNA93 to develop the European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA95). Changes in the economic environment caused an adaptation of the SNA93 and the ESA95 respectively. Based on the SNA 2008 the ESA 2010 has been developed and will provide the legislative basis for the EU National Accounts statistics from 2014 onwards. ESA 2010 is compatible with the SNA 2008 and provides for more closely defined sources, methods and data transmission. In May 2008, Eurostat organised in conjunction with the Statistical Division of the UN, a high-level conference on national accounts in the context of development cooperation. The conference concluded by endorsing a series of Recommendations which were then passed on to the Inter-secretariat Working Group on National Accounts (ISWGNA) for further consideration before submission to the UN Statistical Commission in February 2009. In the 2nd quarter of 2009, ISWGNA finalised the adoption of the SNA2008 and used the following selected principles laid down by the Luxembourg Recommendations to underline the proposed implementation strategy of the SNA2008: strategic planning; \u2022 coordination, monitoring and reporting; \u2022 improving statistical systems. \u2022 The ISWGNA principle of improving national statistical systems is undertaken providing support, focusing on the collection and processing of basic source data and in so doing, improving national accounts at the institutional and international level through undertaking the following tasks: Use of common tool for the production of national \u2022 accounts preparing manuals and handbooks \u2022 UNSD agreed on the new SNA08, in February 2008. SNA08 is expected to be implemented by 2014. More information about national accounts, the SNA and its implementation in developing countries can be found in chapter D.11. Regional trade agreements and increased integration in the global economy is increasingly leading to a need for statistical harmonisation in developing countries. In many countries, adherence to international statistical classifications, concepts and methods still needs improvement. However, such harmonisation, which can be integrated with measures to adopt general international statistics standards, places further demands on the often limited statistical capacity.

Regional organisations Generally, regional organisations comprising, inter alia , developing countries undertake statistical activities in order to: Advise policy makers on interpreting statistics relevant to 1. regional policies; Develop and produce harmonised statistics in fields 2. where comparable statistical data is needed to shape regional policies; Exploit economies of scale by virtue of undertaking joint 3. actions where the respective member states have similar statistical needs. ",
        "B 83 How Statistics are Made Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 As a rule, a statistics unit of a regional organisation typically needs to have access to data that originates from both the National Statistics Systems of their member states and from international organisations. These data sources are needed to present, compare and explain policy-relevant statistics that cover both the member states of the region and other countries. Regional statistics units, therefore, require effective communication of current data with their Member States\u2019 NSIs, as well as access to international statistical databases. It is very confusing to data users when there are differences between national and international sources for the same statistics. Also when data from various Member States are presented in the same table, users expect data to be comparable and need to be properly informed about the reasons if this is not so. Increased data comparability between countries is achieved by adopting consistent concepts, methods and classifications. This process is known as \u2018statistical harmonisation\u2019. Harmonisation requires agreement on common statistical classifications, methods and systems. This is a long, expensive process that usually requires extensive consultation. Therefore, harmonisation in developing countries is usually focusing on statistics in key policy areas of regional integration. Statistics on external trade in goods and on prices are common priorities, as these, especially trade data, are central to regional trade agreements. The European process of economic and monetary integration favoured the creation of a European Statistical System ( ESS ). The process of economic and legal harmonisation of statistics in many developing regions is broadly comparable. The challenges of coordination are at least as great as they were in Europe. However, the financial resources and the availability of skilled personnel are much more restricted. The majority of regional development organisations have some statistics personnel. The functions of the statistics unit can range from being limited in practice to providing advice to decision makers within the organisation to leading the production of regionally harmonised statistics. The UN regional organisations (e.g. ECLAC, UNECA) also have statistics functions and in some cases organise regional statistics activities.

Examples of this are training in tailored software for specific statistical domains, e.g. external trade or national accounts. Regional organisations can coordinate training programmes to meet the needs of its member states\u2019 NSIs. Adoption of common statistical processing software also utilises economies of scale, both in software development, introduction, maintenance and training.

Established in 1993 by the 14 African Franc Zone members, Afristat comprises 18 Member States (as on December 2009). Afristat\u2019s headquarters are located in Bamako, Mali. Afristat\u2019s goal is to support the development of statistics in its Member States, mainly economic, social and environmental statistics. It provides consultancy services to the National Statistics Institutes of its Member States. It has statutory power in terms of harmonisation of concepts, standards and statistical methods. Its responsibility includes the institutional assessment of the NSSs of its members. Afristat responds to the need for regional economic integration through its support for comparable statistical information. Member States define a work programme, which is implemented by operations to support collection, processing and dissemination of statistical information and its economic analysis.

Eight States of West Africa, which already shared a common currency, decided in 1994 to increase their economic integration by signing a Treaty creating the UEMOA. The resulting Treaty provides for a multilateral monitoring of eight statistical indicators in support of policy convergence. The following four statistical indicators rank first: budget surplus / deficit as % of nominal GDP; \u2022 annual inflation rate; \u2022 public debt as % of the nominal GDP; \u2022 arrears of annual payments. \u2022 The statistical data must be comparable across all eight Member States. The UEMOA Commission supports its Member States in harmonising the statistical data used for producing these indicators. It has benefited from EU regional integration support programmes. UEMOA is financing an enhancement of the regional statistical system. This programme aims to (i) improve, harmonise and modernise regional statistical production; (ii) to implement and operationalize the institutional arrangements for follow-up in each domain; (iii) to reinforce the institutional and technical capacities of the UEMOA Commission in the field of statistics. The actions are be implemented in the framework of this horizontal statistical programme, organised on 4 axes: Reinforcement of policy convergences; i. Poverty and social cohesion (follow-up of regional PRSP and ii. MDG\u2019s) Common market establishment; iii. Institutional support; iv. Concrete activities include: the adoption of a Harmonised Consumption Price Index (HCPI) (see Box 12.2); publication of a regional consumption price index in the form of monthly and biannual notes; production and publication of biannual reports on the implementation of the multilateral monitoring system; adoption of methodologies for calculating the Gross Domestic Product (GDP); creation of a data base on competitiveness; harmonisation of sectoral, social and environmental statistics; creation of a regional business register; and promotion of gender statistics and governance. In October 2010, UEMOA established a Regional Statistical Centre, centralizing the statistical activities of the UEMOA Commission and contributing to improving the quality of the regional statistics.

Statistics and indicators in the European Commission development aid process The chapter in brief This chapter starts with a presentation of the typology of \u2022 indicators used by the European Commission. This is useful to understand what types of indicators are used to measure different phenomena. Section B.3.2 presents how indicators and statistics are needed at \u2022 all stages of the Commission cooperation action. The calculation of funds to be allocated to the European Commission cooperation with a particular country is based on a set of indicators. The decision of which sectors and areas to support also requires the observation of indicators in order to identify particular needs, weaknesses and strengths. The choice of the particular activities to undertake in a particular sector is also assisted by the information provided by sector indicators. Finally, indicators are needed to report to citizens of donors and beneficiaries on the results achieved by cooperation projects. B.3.1. The role and importance of statistics and indicators in the aid context The development aid allocates to a country is calculated on the basis of a number of indicators. The Cotonou Agreement refers to the calculation of the multi-annual indicative allocations based on need and performance criteria. The European Consensus on Development also makes a commitment to decide on the resources allocated to each country based on objective and transparent criteria. Thus, the need for quality statistics arises even before the cycle of operations has started. Over the last years, there has been an increased focus on the efficiency of development aid. In this context, the need for reliable statistics has increased strongly, both for monitoring during activities and for evaluation of results after their completion. The Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness puts weight on results based management, \u2018Management for Development Results\u2019 ( MfDR ), means managing and implementing aid in a way that focuses on the desired results and uses information to improve decision-making. This process has been backed by donors, seeing the need to deliver more and better aid and increasing the efficiency of the aid delivered in terms of impact in priority areas. This has meant that the \u2018traditional\u2019 measurements of direct aid input (such as person-days or budget allocated for a specific aid project) and direct, measurable results (such as number of hospital places, number of educated nurses) have yet been supplemented by indicators addressing the results from the beneficiary point of view (e.g. access to basic medical services) and addressing the overall impact of an aid activity (e.g. decreasing death rates from treatable diseases). A close monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of activities and projects needs data of good quality. The data must be appropriate for the task: it must be relevant, reliable and available when needed and expected. For evaluating development over time, the data must be comparable over time. For wider benchmarking uses, the data should be comparable between countries and regions. To assure the reliability of the statistics, it is important to support good statistical governance in the beneficiary countries. The professional independence of the institutions involved in the national statistical system ensures the credibility of statistics. The resources available to the NSS must be sufficient to assure the long-term capacity to maintain and develop the statistical system. Another key aspect is that the importance of good data and good indicators goes well beyond efficient M&E. Quality statistics are vital for the development of evidence-based development policies. Quality statistics are crucial for the priorities contained in National Development Strategies and in Country/Regional Strategy Papers. The Accra Agenda for Action strengthened donor\u2019s commitment to working through national systems in the recipient countries based on the developing country\u2019s own development objectives, while increasing the aid\u2019s value for money. Result-oriented reporting and assessment frameworks and strengthened linkages between development strategies and budget processes are central in this process. Furthermore, the existence and use of relevant quality indicators supports the development of country-specific and country-owned policies and institutions. Good statistics are essential for efficient public administration. Quality statistics, trusted by the public, increase transparency and promote accountability of the government. B.3.2. Typology of development indicators B.3.2.1. Typology according to what the indicator is measuring In order to classify an indicator according to what state or event it measures, the European Commission uses the OECD- DAC\u2019s typology . This classifies each indicator as measuring an \u201cinput\u201d, an \u201coutput\u201d, an \u201coutcome\u201d or an \u201cimpact\u201d. Each indicator falls into one and only one of the types. ",
        "B 88 Statistics and Indicators in the European Commission Development Aid Process Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 These types of indicators are all relevant for policy makers and development practitioners. A full diagnosis of progress and weaknesses of a sector (or programme or project, or country) will require a set of indicators that includes all the four different types identified. Input Indicators \u2022 measure the financial, administrative and regulatory resources (often called \u201cprocess\u201d) provided by the Government and donors. It is necessary to establish a link between the resources used and the results achieved in order to assess the efficiency of the actions carried out. Examples: Share of the budget devoted to education expenditure, Technical Assistance person-days provided Output Indicators \u2022 measure the immediate and concrete consequences of the measures taken and resources used. Examples: Number of schools built, number of teachers trained Outcome Indicators \u2022 measure the results at the level of beneficiaries. The term \u2018results indicators\u2019 is used as well. Examples: school enrolment, percentage of girls among the children entering first year of primary school Impact Indicators \u2022 measure the consequences of the outcomes. They measure the general objectives in terms of national development and poverty reduction. Examples: Literacy rates, unemployment rates. Box 3.1 presents a visualisation of the main characteristics of this typology. Measures the consequences of the outcomes in terms of wider objectives (e.g. literacy rates, health improvement, employment rate). The definition covers the wider effects of the outcomes but there might also be higher level impacts, related to broader objectives \u2013 growth and income poverty, for example. IMPACT OUTPUT OUTCOME (RESULTS) INPUT Measures the results at the level of beneficiaries (e.g. gross enrol- ment rates in primary schools, vaccination, inscription rate for vocational training, share of vocational training graduates employed after training). The definition covers the outcomes (or results) from the use and satisfaction of the goods and services produced by the public sector - it is where supply comes face-to-face with demand Measures the immediate and concrete consequences of the resources used and measures taken (e.g. number of schools and training centres built / restored / equipped, teachers trained, teachers employed, nurses trained). The definition of output covers those goods and services \u201cproduced\u201d or \"provided\" by the public sector with the inputs. Measures the financial resources provided and the adminisrative and regulatory measures taken, for example, resources allocated, resources used, measures taken, laws passed. The definition of inputs can be treated as very broad, covering in some cases what are often called \"process indicators\". Box 3.1: Typology of indicators ",
        "B 89 Statistics and Indicators in the European Commission Development Aid Process Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Other donors might use diverging definitions of the different types of indicators. For example, some donors use the term \u201coutcome\u201d or \u201cresult\u201d to refer to what the above typology calls \u201cimpact\u201d. When entering into dialogue with governments or donors concerning the types of indicators to be used to take disbursement decisions, it is crucial to clarify beforehand the concepts underlying the terminology. The use of carefully selected outcome indicators (performance measurement indicators) is key to implement a performance- based approach. EuropeAid has recently published the guide: \u201c Policy Steering: The Role and Use of Performance - Measurement Indicators \u201d, which focuses on outcome indicators to measure the impact of policies, improving decision-making processes and informing the public of policy impacts. The EuropeAid Guide underlines that there are no standard tools or pre-defined indicators that match the specific circumstances and priorities of each individual partner country. It presents a three-stage method to select appropriate sectoral indicators: What information would shed light on or reflect the spe- \u2022 cific policy aspects and challenges on which attention is to be focussed? Determine whether the indicators relevant to the identi- \u2022 fication of needs have the necessary characteristics to be used to set targets, to monitor progress and to be available as required. Formally recording the chosen indicators on a fact-sheet \u2022 designed to provide comprehensive information about the calculation of the indicator, document the sources used, communicate any reservations as to the quality of those sources and give a brief idea of how the indicator can be used and interpreted. The EuropeAid Guide provides a practical framework for performance measurement in the context of co-operation polices, including the definition of indicator matrices (or \u2018Performance Measurement Frameworks\u2019; PAFs) and the selection of indicators based on the main targets of policies and the indicators\u2019 relevance to users. The EuropeAid Guide underlines that the data on which the performance measurement approach is based must be discussed together with the outcomes of the policy. The EuropeAid Guide also provides a number of practical examples and comments related to challenges faced when defining and implementing performance measurement frameworks in a development co-operation context, illustrating the main dimensions and concepts of statistical data quality.

We can identify three groups: Group A monitors overall progress at country level, Group B at sector level, often used for sectoral programmes and group C for aid effectiveness indicators.

The indicators and statistics to use at each stage of the European Commission Development Cycle B.3.3.1 Statistics and Development Country Attribution The need for statistics related to a particular country arises even before the cycle of operations has started. The allocation of funds made available for cooperation by the European Commission to a country is calculated based on a number of indicators. This principle is set up in the legal instruments that constitute the basis for the cooperation between the European Commission and its partner countries. Thus, both the Cotonou Agreement and the Development Cooperation Instrument make explicit reference to the calculation of the multi-annual indicative allocations based on need and performance criteria. The European Consensus on Development also states an European Commission commitment to decide on the resources allocated to each country based on objective and transparent criteria. The following aid allocation model has been developed in the context of the European Commission\u2019s cooperation with the ACP for the 10th European Development Fund. A two-step approach was used to determine the programmable country attributions: An initial allocation based on a statistical model which \u2022 analyses country needs and performance criteria, based on data published by international institutions and financial performance data extracted from the Commission\u2019s accounting system; A possible additional \u201cincentive tranche\u201d is based on more \u2022 qualitative criteria of democratic governance that cannot easily be analysed within a quantitative model and which are instead assessed in close coordination with the Member States. Box 3.3: The Cotonou Agreement and Country Resource Allocation Resource allocation shall be based on needs and performance, as defined in this Agreement. In this context: (a) needs shall be assessed on the basis of criteria pertaining to per capita income, population size, social indicators and level of indebtedness, export earning losses and dependence on export earnings, in particular from the sectors of agriculture and mining. Special treatment shall be accorded to the least developed ACP States and the vulnerability of island and landlocked states shall duly be taken into account. In addition, account shall be taken of the particular difficulties of post-conflict countries; and (b) performance shall be assessed in an objective and transparent manner on the basis of the following parameters: progress in implementing institutional reforms, country performance in the use of resources, effective implementation of current operations, poverty alleviation or reduction, sustainable development measures and macroeconomic and sectoral policy. Cotonou Agreement. 2005. Annex IV, article 3(1) The initial allocation is determined in four stages: First stage \u2013 Half of the available funds are allocated pro \u2022 rata of the initial 9th EDF allocations. The other half is allocated according to population and income per capita data, which have been updated since the 9th EDF. Second stage \u2013 The following additional needs criteria \u2022 have been taken into account: demographic dynamics, measured as the share of the young (less than 15 years) in the population; the prevalence rate of AIDS among adults from 15 to 45 years; the human poverty index, developed by the UNDP but with an enhanced malnutrition com- ponent; the vulnerability of the country as measured via the volatility of the growth rate of gross domestic prod- uct (GDP) around its average over the last 25 years; and geographic isolation. In line with the Cotonou Agreement, further specific criteria are added to this instability meas- ure in order to take into account the structural handicaps of the least developed countries (+ 5%) and of the land- locked or insular countries (+ 10%). Third stage \u2013 The performance criteria are grouped in \u2022 three parts: Financial performance. The aid absorption capacity is i. measured by a combined factor of the commitment rate halfway between that of the 9th EDF and the ratio between what \u201cremains to be disbursed\u201d and the average annual payments over the last three years, taking into account an aid dependency ratio. Economic performance is subdivided into investment ii. climate criteria and sustainable macroeconomic performance indicators. Social performance, including relative share of public iii. expenditure devoted to education and health relative to military expenditure and progress made in reaching the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in the sectors of education (primary education for all in 2015) and health (reduction by 2/3 of child mortality by 2015). Fourth stage - The results obtained are corrected in order \u2022 to limit excessive aid volatility by limiting the maximum changes in either direction from the 9th EDF. Results affect the allocation of resources at the third stage. However, at mid-term the weighting of performance on any reallocation decision should be increased. The financial performance should not be the dominant factor; due attention should be given to performance in the focal areas of intervention and to country level performance indicators (social, macro-economic and governance related).

The European Consensus on Development. Doc No 14602/05. Paragraphs 64-65 B.3.3.2. Statistics and Programming When setting up the cooperation strategy between the European Commission and a partner country, it is crucial to have a clear picture of the situation faced by the country in key development issues. Only if such information is available it will be possible to identify those sectors and areas where the Commission support is needed or might be of particular added value. The tool to be used to obtain that clear picture is a set of indicators. This set will usually include general and sector indicators. These indicators should be collected at the initial stages of the drafting of a Country Strategy Paper and should be annually revisited in order to measure progress in terms of poverty reduction and social development. These same indicators should also be the main ones to be considered in the context of the mid-term evaluation of the cooperation strategy. The December 2002 European Commission \u2018 Guidelines for the use of indicators in Country Strategy Papers\u2019 defined the basic principles for the definition and use of indicators. More importantly, these Guidelines clearly stated the Commission\u2019s intention to be more results-oriented, therefore to focus increasingly on outcome indicators. This led to the selection of 10 key poverty indicators to be monitored in each Country Strategy Paper. These indicators were mostly drawn from the 60 indicators defined to monitor progress towards the MDGs. They were selected on the basis of their inclusion in PRSPs, their use by other donors and data availability. EU Member States, the OECD and the World Bank were involved in the process of designing the guidelines and selecting the 10 key indicators. They are shown in the European Commission (\u2018EC\u2019) column in Box 3.6. In parallel to this work on indicators to monitor progress in fighting poverty, the World Bank has increased the result orientation of its Country Assistance Strategies (CASs) for the countries receiving aid through the International Development Association 14 th Replenishment (IDA 14). In a November 2004 paper, \u201c Measuring results: Improving National Statistics in IDA countries \u201d, the World Bank outlines a final list of 14 outcome and impact indicators to be monitored in the CASs of each country receiving IDA loans. Of these 14 indicators, 7 are identical to the indicators selected by the European Commission, hence 7 are MDG indicators and 7 are additional non-MDG indicators which focus on growth and private sector development. The African Development Bank (AfDB) measures country progress on key outcomes using an evolving list of 12 indicators that are also used by the World Bank for IDA countries, as well as 6 indicators which reflect country specific priorities in the areas of governance, regional integration, private sector development, agriculture and information technology. For the African Development Fund 11 (AfDF11) countries, AfDB intends to monitor an additional indicator, EITI (Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative), bringing the overall number of indicators to 19.

B.3.3.3 Statistics and Identification The use of indicators is also crucial for the success of a project or programme identification. Compared to the set of indicators used during programming, the indicators chosen at this stage will tend to present a closer definition of the particularities of a sector. The choice of the set of indicators will provide measurements of the situation in the sector where the cooperation intervention is to be designed. The main aim of these measurements will be to identify what are the needs, the strengths and weaknesses existing in the sector and will facilitate the choice of activities and targets constituting the project. In the case of budget support programmes, it is important not to confuse the indicators that will furnish this crucial information on needs, strengths and weaknesses and those that will be used for the disbursement of the variable tranches. Usually the disbursement indicators will be a limited subset 10 Purchasing power parity. of the sector indicators that will focus on a few main issues which are considered crucial to assess the progress of the government towards the achievement of the programme\u2019s objectives. Examples of indicators used for the identification of projects and programmes for various sectors can be found throughout Part D. B.3.3.4 Statistics and Formulation / Implementation These are the indicators that will constitute a project\u2019s logical framework. The same set of indicators used to support the identification of a project or programme will usually be useful for the formulation phase. However, given the greater knowledge of the field of intervention at this stage, new indicators are often added to the set as new needs for information on specific issues are defined. In principle, the indicator set that fulfils the information need for effective project formulation should be the same set of indicators that will be used later on for monitoring of project implementation. Examples of indicators used for the formulation and monitoring of projects and programmes in various sectors can be found throughout Part D. ",
        "B 93 Statistics and Indicators in the European Commission Development Aid Process Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 B.3.3.5 Statistics and Evaluation Four sets of indicators correspond to four specific stages of the evaluation process: Context indicators 1. provide information about the changes in the country under evaluation, the location and the assistance provided. Programme indicators 2. detail the resources, implementation, results and if possible the impacts of an ongoing activity Evaluation indicators, 3. when examined together with the evaluation criteria, enable the evaluator to formulate a judgement on the programme\u2019s relevance, coherence, efficiency and effectiveness and to support answers to evaluation questions Monitoring indicators 4. are included in the monitoring system of programmes and sometimes used by evaluators to assess the implementation of programmes An indicator can belong to several of these indicator sets and be used in a variety of situations. For example, a socio- economic indicator may also be appropriate as a programme impact indicator. Examples of indicators used for the evaluation of projects and programmes in various sectors can be found throughout Part D. B.3.3.6 Statistics and Reporting for Accountability Development institutions are increasingly required to report on the outcomes of their development actions. This is a consequence of the international reporting obligations to which these organisations have agreed and ultimately of governments\u2019 growing awareness of their interest in reporting the results of their development interventions to improve their accountability to their citizens. As a signatory to the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness , the European Commission is therefore committed to providing public data on the 12 indicators of aid effectiveness explained in detail in section B.1.4. These focus on providing accountability on the operation of aid policies and mechanisms. The indicators are published at two yearly intervals by the OECD \u2013 see reference in the \u2018To find out more\u2019 box below. This public information is a major advance on the situation a few years ago, when the main Commission development information consisted largely of funds allocated and disbursed by country and by region, together with breakdowns by broad types of expenditure and the broad sectors targeted. No serious conclusions could be drawn from this information as to the effectiveness of development aid or the extent to which policy objectives were being met.

Statistics across policy sectors The chapter in brief Section B.4. \u2022 1 and section B4.2 presents some international indicators that have cross-sectional coverage and are relevant to the European Commission development aid process: the MDG indicators (section B.4.1) and indicators to assess the implementation of a Poverty Reduction Strategy (section B.4.2). Examples of project or programme indicators are presented in Part D of this Guide. Section B.4. \u2022 3 provides cross-references between the Commission\u2019s defined policy sectors and statistical activities. B.4.1. Millennium development goals, targets and indicators Section B.1.1 showed how the 8 overall development goals laid out in the Millennium Declaration are linked to 21 specific targets to be attained by 2015, which themselves are measured by 60 indicators. Box 4.1 shows the relationship between Millennium Development Goal 1, its two associated targets and the six indicators used to measure progress toward the targets. The process is repeated for each of the MDGs. The entire table is shown on the UNSD website \u2013 see the \u2018To Find out More\u2019 box below. The Millennium Declaration therefore requires each country to produce up to 60 11 statistics-based indicators periodically, the frequency of data depending on the indicator and the country\u2019s level of development. The data is intended for use as a development map to illustrate how countries, regions and the developing world as a whole are progressing to the Millennium Development Goals. Although the MDG indicators have stimulated demand and co-ordinated international support for sustainable national statistical capacity-building, they have also led to debates about the quantity and quality of the data and associated metadata (the description of the basis of the data), as represented in the official database. The most common concern is the lack of developing country data, especially recent data, in the database. In particular, there are continuing debates about how indicators are defined, produced and coordinated at national level, how they are communicated to the international organisations responsible for specific indicators in the global database, how they are adapted to be comparable with other countries\u2019 data and how they are represented in the global MDG database. These questions fundamentally concern data availability, comparability and national ownership of the indicators. 12 11 NB: Some indicators are not applicable to all countries (e.g. malaria); others are only meaningful for regional and global monitoring (e.g. fish stocks, species in extinction). 12 PPP: Purchasing power party.

To measure progress towards the first target, MDG indicator 1a is the \u2018poverty headcount ratio\u2019, which is defined as: \u2018The proportion of the national population whose incomes are below the official threshold (or thresholds) set by the national Government. National poverty lines are usually set for households of various compositions to allow for different family sizes. Where there are no official poverty lines, they may be defined as the level of income required to have only sufficient food or food plus other necessities for survival.\u2019 Data on household income, consumption and expenditure are generally collected through household budget surveys. National statistical offices, sometimes in conjunction with other national or international agencies, usually undertake such surveys, typically every three to five years in developing countries. Household income may be converted into income per adult equivalent 13 . This can be calculated for different types of households (e.g. rural or urban, by gender of the head of the household, etc.) Income-per-adult equivalent can also be used to define national \u2018poverty lines\u2019, the level of income under which the household is considered as poor. When using statistical data that originates from different surveys, attention must be paid to the definitions of income, for instance, whether income in kind is included or not. 13 Four of the current targets were further proposed and agreed at the 2005 World Summit. The sixty-first session of the General Assembly in 2006 recommended the incorporation of these commitments into the set of targets used to monitor the Millennium Declaration. Target 1.B: Achieve full and productive employment and \u2022 decent work for all, including women and young people Target 5.B: Achieve, by 2015, universal access to \u2022 reproductive health; Target 6.B: Achieve, by 2010, universal access to treatment \u2022 for HIV/AIDS for all those who need it; Target 7.B: Reduce biodiversity loss, achieving, by 2010, a \u2022 significant reduction in the rate of loss. The old target on developing decent and productive work for youth, which was under Millennium Development Goal 8, has been replaced by the new target 1.B (under Goal 1). Box 4.2 shows how an MDG indicator is developed based on existing statistics. 13 According to this scale, the first household member over 16 equals 1, all others over 16 equal 0.5, all under 16 equal 0.3.

        "B 99 Statistics Across Policy Sectors Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Indicators are required at each of these levels of the PRS analysis. Box 4.3 shows how the Kenya PRSP (whose overall structure was examined in Box 1.1) proposes the use of indicators and identifies data sources to measure progress towards development outcomes and outputs in education. The indicators of Human Development and Poverty Reduction should be, at the levels of Objectives and Development Outcomes, similar or identical to MDG indicators as they serve the same purposes. At the action / policy level, indicators are often specified in less detail in the PRSP itself because individual activities will often be designed subsequent to the adoption of the PRSP. While PRSPs can require diverse data, commonly used indicators are: economic statistics (macroeconomic monitoring): two key \u2022 national accounts aggregates, i.e. Gross National Income (GNI), Gross Domestic Product (GDP); consumer price index (inflation monitoring); public finance statistics (budget balance, public debt); balance of payments; demographic statistics: enumeration of population, its \u2022 geographical distribution, its distribution by age and sex, mortality (especially infant mortality) by age and sex and birth rates; statistics on household living conditions: income and \u2022 expenditure, consumption, household equipment, employment; statistics on education: population of school age, school \u2022 attendance, adult literacy, diplomas delivered, teachers, schools and their equipment; statistics on health: population morbidity, access to \u2022 healthcare, staff and health infrastructures. Although PRSPs base their indicators on existing data sources where possible, there is an explicit recognition that Poverty Reduction Strategy implementation may require improvement to statistical quality and / or the range of available statistics. The PRSP website includes a section on support to statistics. From the European Commission perspective, this issue is considered further in part C. A Performance Assessment Framework (PAF) is the core tool for the joint assessment by government and development partners of implementation of the national strategy and reform programme. The PAF is a government-owned document that prioritises reform measures and agreed targets in priority sectors within the national strategy. It provides a concise and verifiable set of indicators that is regularly revised in line with progress. Most PRSPs have an associated PAF. The PAF should contribute to national capacities in planning, implementing, monitoring and evaluating its programmes. The long term vision is for ministries and agencies to produce their own quantified and verifiable input, output and outcome indicators as a part of their annual planning processes. PAF-type instruments are influenced by the European Commission Budget Support framework. The PAF design should ensure that indicators are simple and that systems are in place to produce the data necessary to monitor progress on a timely basis. The PAF as a whole is not necessarily used as the basis for Poverty Reduction Budget Support (PRBS) disbursement, although all disbursement indicators should be included in the PAF. Government will each year identify from among its goals and targets a concise list of the highest priority indicators and targets for the subsequent year. The selection of appropriate targets and indicators is the responsibility of the nation al planning ministry, in consultation with sector ministries and Box 4.3: Examples of indicators used in the Kenya PRSP Objectives Development Outcomes Indicators Data Source 5.

B.4.3. Mapping European Commission policy intervention areas to statistical activities General development strategies target development of overarching aspects of society such as economic growth or poverty reduction. To assess the progress in these fields, quantifiable information is needed on a wide range of aspects associated with the strategy. For example, Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers use a variety of indicators to quantify targets and measure progress. These indicators are drawn from a wide range of statistics, including e.g. national accounts, price statistics, public finance statistics, balance of payments, population statistics, education statistics, health statistics, and obviously statistics on living conditions and poverty. Although there are common characteristics across statistics areas (see e.g. section C.5.3 on statistical quality), each statistics area has its own characteristics, challenges, sources and data providers. The evidence base on specific statistics areas, which is required for policy formulation, implementation, monitoring and assessment, may not be available, may be of inadequate quality, may need to be transformed to be comparable with other sources or may need to be interpreted with special care. The chapters of Part D: Statistics for Policy Issues provides detailed information on statistics needed to inform specific policy areas where the European Commission has a \u2018comparative advantage\u2019, as identified by the European Consensus on Development (see section B.1.5). The chapters are organised according to the policy area they mainly inform. The statistics covered by the chapters are defined according to the UNECE Classification of Statistical Activities (CSA) , which is used to classify the statistical activities of international organisations in UNECE\u2019s Database of International Statistical Activities (DISA) . CSA is also used by PARIS21 to classify statistical activities in the Partner Report on Support to Statistics (PRESS) , it forms the basis for categorising standards in the proposed Global Inventory of Statistical Standards , and a slightly revised version of the first three domains are adopted as part of the Statistical Data and Metadata eXchange (SDMX) Content-oriented Guidelines. Part D offers advice on how statistics and indicators from different sectors can be used to inform policies, to monitor progress and evaluate outcomes and impacts. Its chapters present data needs and use for specific statistics areas and provide the main definitions and concepts used. They describe how data quality and data availability in the area can be improved and give practical advice and examples of how the statistical system can be developed. Box 4.4 shows the chapters of Part D, the corresponding European Commission policy areas and the corresponding statistical activities. In particular, it highlights the main actors involved in providing data and the main data sources (census data, survey data, administrative data and others) in the specific statistics area. Improving data quality and availability and the comparability between data sources generally requires that the stakeholders are involved and have an interest in the process. Box 4.4 is supplemented by Box 9.1, which provides an overview of the content of each chapter, including key concepts and statistics, so that topics of special relevance can be easily found. The overall aim of these chapters is to give non-statisticians involved in the formulation, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policy programmes and projects, both system-wide and sector specific, a basic insight into the data and statistics forming the evidence base. The chapters provide the required knowledge to find, use, analyse and improve specific statistics and indicators. ",

How to decide on a statistical action C.5.1. The importance of National Statistical Systems C.5.1.1. National statistical systems are generators of official statistics National statistical systems are the key producers of official statistics. Without good statistics, governments face great problems in delivering efficient administration, good management, and evidence-based policy making. An effective and efficient national statistical system, providing regular and reliable data, is an important indicator of good policies and a crucial component of good governance. Quality statistics increase transparency and promote the accountability of policy-makers by enabling media, non- governmental organisations and citizens to monitor the activities of government. Good and reliable statistics are also essential to international organisations and other donors. These need to assess where aid is most needed, whether resources are used efficiently, to measure progress and to evaluate results. Statistics are vital to \u2018Managing for Development Results\u2019, with mutual accountability between beneficiaries and donors and focus on results. Regional co-operation is an engine of economic growth, development and security. The European Commission supports a strengthened role for regional and sub-regional organisations in the process of enhancing international peace and security, including their capacity to coordinate donor support. International cooperation partners also need to make cross-country comparisons in order to evaluate the effectiveness of global and regional policies. Therefore, they are supporters of regional harmonisation of data, so that these become regionally comparable. With its extensive experience in harmonising classifications, definitions, concepts and statistics in a large group of countries, the European Commission has often taken the lead in such international efforts. The role and activities in statistics of different regional and international organisations is explored in section B.2.4. In low income developing countries, the national use of and interest in statistics may be low. However, promotion of evidence-based policy-making along with advocacy on the importance of statistics raises national user interest. This, together with strategic planning in the NSS, should substantially increase the interest and trust in statistics and thus the level of analysis. The Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness (see section B.1.4) and the Accra Agenda for Action (AAA) (see section B.1.3.1) encourage developing countries to set their own strategies for poverty reduction, improve their institutions and tackle corruption. National ownership of statistics implies that surveys first and foremost respond to the national need for data to inform policies and therefore to meet user needs. C.5.1.2. Data available through the national statistical systems The purpose of evaluating a country\u2019s statistics system is to understand what the country is currently capable of producing, in terms of quantity and quality of statistics, and what it actually does produce. A detailed evaluation will identify the major constraints to the system. The best starting point in identifying statistics as a potential sector for support should be the national development strategy or poverty reduction strategy . The ideal situation is that an NSDS exists (see section C.6.1) that is compatible with the national development strategy. Failing this, a performance monitoring system that includes MDG indicators and has been agreed by the country and all donors can be the target for improvement. If there is no means to obtain expert analysis of data coverage and quality and no recent analysis has been made, the non-specialist should examine a core indicator set for performance monitoring so as to look at what data exists and what its status is. The European Commission\u2019s Country Strategy Paper (CSP) and Joint Annual Report (JAR) are now required to include standard \u2018 Country at a Glance \u2019 tables of core indicators. In the absence of an agreed performance monitoring system, these can provide a core indicator set for the non-specialist to analyse; they should not be used as the target for support. The chapter in brief This chapter explains the aims and methods used to improve the capacity to produce and publish statistics and to strengthen the ability of users to understand and analyse statistics. The situation normally arises either when a country or region requests support or when the European Commission\u2019s agreed development cooperation agenda with the country or region is clearly impeded by the poor quality or absence of the data needed for policy / activity preparation and evaluation. The chapter includes a presentation of the concept of \u2018quality\u2019 in statistics: what should a developing country\u2019s statistical system be able to provide for its users? With the objective quality measures as a benchmark, the chapter also considers methods of evaluating a country\u2019s statistics and the system that produces them. The methods proposed start with the simplest and become progressively more systematic. ",
        "C 108 How to Decide on a Statistical Action Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Availability and reliability of the data is a basic indicator of the condition of the statistical system. These tables should be drawn directly from national sources to ensure that the country analysis is based on the most up-to-date data available and that there is agreement among the development partners on the data sources to be used. The core economic data should be fairly complete and up to date. What \u2018up to date\u2019 means depends on how frequently, easily and rapidly data can be collected, processed and published. Consumer price index (CPI) and external trade (imports and exports) data in nominal prices should be available within one and three months respectively, based on international recommendations. Data that is constructed from many sources, notably GDP and other national accounts data, should be available within a year of the reference period. Discussions of the international recommendations for when data should be available are located in the relevant chapters of Part D. The national sources of key indicators are mostly the NSI and the Central Bank. However, data published by the World Bank is usually used in practice. Key NSI documents are country yearbooks and periodic, usually quarterly or annual, statistical digests. Press releases give the most recent information, although they can be subject to revision. As a matter of principle, national data sources should be preferred where there is no need for cross-country comparison. Data availability for the MDG indicators is less straightforward than for economic and demographic data. Data may originate from outside the NSI, such as from Ministries of Health and Education. Coordination among statistics producers and publishers can be difficult and there are more likely to be \u2018competing\u2019 duplicate statistical publications than with the economic data. Identification of the best source usually requires sector knowledge. Social data is less frequently updated - some of the 10 European Commission key indicators are legitimately updated with less than annual frequency. In some cases, appropriate methods are used to project estimates for years in which no new data can be collected. Such estimates should be clearly indicated in the published data. It is essential to use the most recent version of the data. It is therefore necessary to keep a record (metadata) of the source (publication, edition and publication date) of each data series and, if necessary, each data point. Many developing countries\u2019 NSIs and Central Banks have websites, although some are not always accessible. These websites vary enormously in quality, especially in how frequently they are updated, although many are able to provide the recent basic data that the \u2018Country at a Glance\u2019 economic table requires. Data for the 10 key indicators can also sometimes be found in the website of the NSI. A checklist for the key points to look for in examining data is given in Box 5.1. The first points to be checked are general; the later points are more specific but most can still be checked by someone with no specialist knowledge. Box 5.1: Key questions for examining national data availability Are data that cover the performance indicators available from \u2022 national sources? Is the statistical information about the sector sufficiently up to date \u2022 so that it can be used to evaluate progress against a baseline? Will the frequency of data publication allow the National \u2022 Indicative Programme\u2019s implementation to be monitored? Are the data sufficiently disaggregated for activity monitoring and evaluation? When is the base year for quantity or index calculations? Is the \u2022 base year more than 10 years old? Do the statistics appear to be reliable at first glance: \u2022 Are rates of change over time believable? \u03bf Do national data broadly concur with data from international \u03bf sources? Can detailed data be aggregated to published totals (where \u03bf technically possible)? Are the shares (e.g. in percentages) of disaggregated data \u03bf reasonably stable over time? Is the current data easy to obtain? Can it be found on the \u2022 internet? Are there \u2018competing\u2019 data sources on the same subject \u2022 published by more than one organisation? Is methodological documentation available? \u2022 Are there references to international methods and classifications \u2022 and do they appear to be adhered to? Does the data broadly meet the international quality standards \u2022 as applied to the sector? For economic statistics, is the national data broadly comparable \u2022 with international sources? ",
        "C 109 How to Decide on a Statistical Action Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Measuring and monitoring development outcomes require timely, reliable, comparable, relevant and accessible survey data. But in many developing countries, survey programs rarely provide the necessary flow of reliable, timely, comparable and accessible data. The timing of national surveys is rarely optimal, data collection programs lack methodological consistency, and existing data often remain largely unexploited. In many cases, it is difficult to get a comprehensive picture of which data are actually collected throughout the national statistical system. The Accelerated Data Program (ADP) was launched in 2006 as a recommendation of the Marrakech Action Plan for Statistics, to help countries improve their survey programs and increase the use and value of survey data. The ADP is supporting NSIs in more than 50 ACP and ALA countries. The ADP is implemented as a partnership between the PARIS21 Secretariat, the World Bank, and other partners. The PARIS21 Secretariat is in charge of implementation in countries and management of the funds, while the World Bank\u2019s Development Data Group provides global coordination. Other World Bank departments contribute to the implementation. The ADP is mostly financed by the World Bank Development Grant Facility through a grant to the PARIS21 Secretariat at the OECD. Further details on the ADP are given in Box 5.2 below. Box 5.2: The Accelerated Data Program (ADP) The Accelerated Data Program (ADP) supports developing countries in producing statistical data relevant for policy design, monitoring and evaluation, by making better use of existing data and aligning survey programs and statistical outputs to priority data needs. This goal is achieved by: Assisting countries that do not have a coherent long-term survey program in developing a strategy for their data collection activities; \u2022 Building national capacity in micro-data preservation, analysis, anonymisation, and dissemination; \u2022 Working with national data producers and secondary users on the production of updated estimates of key indicators, by further exploiting \u2022 existing datasets and collecting new data. ADP provides technical and financial support to survey data documentation and dissemination, and to the improvement of survey methods. Key outputs include the establishment of national survey databanks and the establishment of national data collection standards to foster comparability of data across sources. The ADP is focused on sample household surveys because they provide estimates of many key outcome indicators, as well as data needed for research and impact evaluation. ADP is restricted to the documentation, preservation, dissemination, harmonization, collection and analysis of microdata (from censuses, surveys or administrative data collection systems). It works in close collaboration with the International Household Survey Network (IHSN ), which develops and disseminates many of the tools and guidelines used by the ADP. ADP provides specialized training, technical assistance (national and international consultants), and acquisition of software and hardware. It can also support the participation of counterparts in relevant international conferences, and regional cooperation activities in the area of microdata management and dissemination. The data producers keep full ownership of their data and decide on the dissemination policy, within the framework of the national legislation. The ADP and IHSN provide recommendations based on three levels of accessibility: public use datasets, licensed datasets, and datasets available in restricted data centres only The country work programs are typically designed so that the agreed activities are implemented in 12 to 24 months or an even shorter period if the support is limited to a very specific activity. The procedure to obtain ADP support is simplified to allow fast decision and implementation. The country work program can be finalized within eight weeks of the approval of the request, after which implementation starts immediately. The amount allocated depends on the work program agreed; funding from ADP is limited but can be very quickly mobilized at country level. The ADP funds can also trigger additional funding by other sponsors ",
        "C 110 How to Decide on a Statistical Action Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 C.5.1.3. International sources as data sources and quality references International data sources are useful for a first examination of a country\u2019s statistical system, even though their primary purpose is to act as a basis for comparison between countries. The differences between data from national and international sources can provide a pointer either to the ease of communications between the country and the compiler of the international data or to the confidence that the international organisation has in the national data, although it can be difficult to distinguish between these two situations. Eurostat has made available for European Commission staff the 10 Key Indicators and the \u2018Country at a Glance\u2019 economic indicators \u2013 see section B.3.4. The data are mostly sourced from international organisations, in particular the World Bank and IMF. The Eurostat database uses the same structure as the mandated country tables so it is directly comparable with data collected on these indicators from national sources In some cases, data from national sources exists that is not replicated in the international databases. This can occur either because of difficulties in communications or because of a belief by the international organisation that the data is of insufficient quality. Sector knowledge will often be needed to distinguish between these two situations. The main international data sources were first presented in section B.2.4. The IMF Statistical Annexes are particularly useful for looking at the quality of economic statistics such as GDP. These annexes are not adjusted to follow a set format or to be comparable between countries. For this reason, this data gives an indication of the IMF\u2019s view of the data quality: if the data in this document is similar to the data in national publications, this may imply a positive view by the IMF of the country data. Data in the United Nations Statistics Division\u2019s Millennium Goals Indicators database can be compared with national data sources on social issues. There can be a variety of possible causes for national data to be missing, estimated or very different from nationally published data in the international database. Considerable sector knowledge is often required. Looking at the available international data and trying to find its national counterpart can give an idea of how accessible the statistics are and to what extent they contain or give directions for finding the metadata. In certain cases, data not available at national level may be replaced by data available through international sources. This can be the case e.g. when international organisations have used nowcasting and/or forecasting techniques to produce estimates, when data too uncertain to be published at national level have been further processed and improved by use of secondary sources or data structures from similar countries, etc. However, using international sources should only be a temporary solution. If key data are missing at national level, the medium and long term objective must be to develop the statistical system\u2019s capacity to provide such data, according to sound methodology, international standards and classifications and with good quality. Above all, the statistical system must be enabled to produce the data long term, in other words the sustainability of the data provision process must be assured. Strengthening of the capacity of the national statistical system and strategic development of statistics is described in chapter C.6. C.5.2. Assessing the capacity of the National Statistical System C.5.2.1. Objective of the assessment Statistical quality is most often defined as \u2018fitness for use\u2019 by end users. Quality therefore depends on data uses and users. Various users \u2013 local, national and international \u2013 can have different demands. Analysis of statistical quality permits the identification of target areas for capacity building. The analysis so far has covered the data and other basic facts of the national statistical system. It may have arrived at some tentative conclusions concerning the quality of the data available for use for policy making and management and for European Commission development cooperation in particular. The demand for statistics for policy formulation and management is the point of departure for both an assessment of a National Statistical System (NSS) and for medium term statistical strategy more generally. Approaches to statistics strategy are discussed in more depth in section C.6.1. Correcting widespread deficiencies in published statistics requires an understanding of their causes, direct and indirect. Any fruitful analysis of the NSS must be undertaken and owned by the country itself. Thus, prior support at the political level is essential for an in-depth assessment, including recognition of the resources required for an effective statistics system. Support for an assessment should be a precursor to medium term support for statistics capacity building.

        "C 111 How to Decide on a Statistical Action Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Providing support for assessing an NSS is a strategic choice. It should be discussed with the development partners in a country. As in any other field, a strategic diagnosis and recommendations should be owned by the partner country and agreed and shared by development partners. This forms a basic starting point towards coordination. C.5.2.2. The issues to be addressed The typical difficulties that face an NSS can be classified into: Legislation and strategic relationships with government \u2022 and within the NSS. These were outlined in section B.2.3; Financing and consequent human resources issues; \u2022 Systems and infrastructure. \u2022 A detailed assessment of the NSS must obtain sufficient information on these issues to allow appropriate conclusions to be drawn. As with other government departments, the NSI and other statistics producers may not receive sufficient financing from the national government. Lack of funding could be motivated by: Overall lack of government funds and / or budgeting prob- \u2022 lems at government level; Lack of understanding of the need for and use of statistics \u2022 and / or; Lack of confidence in the NSI to deliver quality statistics \u2022 for policy purposes. Largely as a consequence of the financial problems, human resources difficulties, such as salary levels or even late payment of salaries, are typical problems with NSIs and other statistics producers. These problems may arise also in other government departments but personnel issues that might be more evident with statistics producers include: Staffing structures that do not reflect current working \u2022 methods, showing relatively high numbers of low level technical personnel, even if the total number of staff is ap- propriate; Lack of current knowledge and / or skills (at any grade and \u2022 staff age); Absence of human resources strategy or staff training \u2022 strategy; Brain drain towards the private sector. \u2022 Some NSIs have been established as public bodies outside national civil services, which may give them greater control and flexibility over staff grading, pay scales and budget certainty. However, institutional independence does not necessarily eliminate any of these problems. NSI senior management may respond to the impact of financial problems on human resources in a sub-optimal way, as explored in Box 5.3. Box 5.3: Case study: Surveys and financial constraints on human resources Faced with inadequate or unpredictable funding, NSI senior management can face a very difficult challenge to maintain a stable, reputable organisation. A common challenge in this situation is to maintain a stable workforce when salaries are inadequate, paid late or both. Response strategies can potentially persist after the financial problems have been resolved. Without adequate or predictable salary income, staff per diems for work away from base can become necessary to assure a basic level of income for the staff working at the NSI. Surveys have been carried out without serious attempts to reduce or eliminate duplication of effort. Staff can be drawn away from non-survey activities, causing delays in publishing these statistics. Improved donor coordination has now considerably reduced the number of overlapping surveys demanded, although the problem has not been eliminated. Poor survey planning can be a legacy of past wage constraints. When a survey is poorly planned and budgeted, a larger than necessary household sample is unusually interviewed. Not only is this a misuse of scarce resources, the lack of sample analysis prior to the survey means that some statistical inferences, particularly at the local level, may not be valid. A larger sample size means that survey processing takes longer, delaying the results and reducing their usefulness. Moreover, concentrating project finance on the survey stage may mean that funds are not available (or even planned!) for results publishing. Finally, there can be a consequent lack of interest in publishing and analysing the results, notably in longitudinal analysis over time. Lack of publication of survey results can also occur as a result of political pressure. If the survey has been poorly planned and budgeted, it may be difficult to find out the cause or causes of a failure to publish results. Good survey planning requires the following: A pre-survey sampling analysis, \u2022 A credible survey and processing timetable and \u2022 A publication plan that incorporates analysis of the results and is included in the survey budget \u2022 ",
        "C 112 How to Decide on a Statistical Action Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Statistics managers may not have adequate training or incentive to allow them to focus sufficiently on building, maintaining and updating their department\u2019s operational manuals. Managers can therefore lose touch with how data is actually collected on the ground. This lack of institutionalised knowledge means that data quality can suffer from changes in management or even local supervisory staff. Systems and infrastructure problems that may be faced by NSIs and other major statistics producers include statistics software systems and, more generally, computing, communications and offices that are out of date. Regional statistical harmonisation requires similar classifications to be used, often necessitating recently updated software. A key reference on the organisation of national statistical systems is the UNSD Handbook of Statistical Organisation . C.5.2.3. Assessment methodologies Since some but not all of the difficulties facing statistics producers are common to other public sector institutions, an assessment methodology must both integrate the NSS study with other public sector institutional assessments and also pay attention to the specific problems facing statistics. One solution is for the development and implementation of a statistics strategy to be part of a general public sector reform programme. General public sector assessment methodologies are outside the scope of this Guide. The overall methodologies for developing statistics strategies are presented in section C.6.2. As part of these methodologies, international organisations have developed assessment methods that are specific to statistics. A key method is the \u2018Statistical Capacity Building Indicators\u2019 analysis developed by the PARIS21 Task Team on Statistical Capacity Building Indicators . Statistics is a vital element of the whole cycle of political priority setting, project definition, planning, financing, implementation, and evaluation. Based on its experience as a technical reference throughout this cycle, Eurostat has considered some of the most pressing problems that may limit the success of statistical cooperation activities. A key problem is ensuring the sustainability and resilience of the results achieved. The support provided by Eurostat and other DGs should be refined to enable objective measurement and increase the sustainability of the results of statistical cooperation activities, thus making more effective use of available resources. Box 5.4 presents Eurostat\u2019s pilot questionnaire that aims to document key aspects of national statistical systems in ALA countries. This study addresses the set-up of the statistical system, its main actors, professional independence, legal basis and resource situation. ",

Review of the European Commission strategy documents for the cooperation with Central Asia, especially the Regional strategy paper 2007- \u2022 2013. Review of the relevant documents related to the current situation and the actors of the official statistics system in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, \u2022 Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan (e.g. legislative documents, Country reports, the Multi-annual working programmes and Assessments drawn up with assistance by the World Bank, IMF, etc., reports of previous international and bi-lateral assistance programmes). Highlight basic practical recommendations for the national statistical systems to develop their capacities to meet the six essential principles of \u2022 independence, mandate for data collection, adequacy of resources, quality commitment, statistical confidentiality, impartiality and objectiveness. Missions to each of the five concerned countries. The experts will visit central and regional statistical institutes, other institutions dealing with statistical production: Ministries of Economy, the Central Bank, the Ministry of Finance, etc., to meet with the top management and with the managers responsible for the domains covered by the assessment, as well as to identify and contact the main users (at government, private and other levels when appropriate). the offer should allow in the budget for both experts to travel to all five countries concerned whilst the contractor will in the design of the final \u2022 methodology propose whether or not the experts may split up to achieve the assignments objectives Production of reports on the respective countries. \u2022 Proposals for the post-TACIS statistical cooperation strategy will be formulated and coordinated with the different stakeholders. These proposals \u2022 will meet the following main requirements: Be based on the European Commission strategy for the cooperation with Central Asia for 2007-2013 \u2022 Determine a few general statistical areas, in line with the provision of the European Commission Regional Strategy Paper for Central Asia, where \u2022 statistical production in the CA countries could be brought to the harmonised level, approaching the EU and international standards.

        "C 115 How to Decide on a Statistical Action Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Within the frame of MESTAT II programme, the assessment of the capacity of the Mediterranean partner NSIs followed a different approach, leading to a Country Statistical Situation Report for each. This assessment approach is detailed in Box 5.6. C.5.3. The concept of quality in statistics C.5.3.1. The key quality concepts in statistics Internationally adopted quality frameworks for statistics are used for assessing the quality of the data and the procedures that are used in their production. They are practical applications of the principles of statistics, notably the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics of the United Nations, which were explored at section B.2.1. As such, all quality frameworks cover the various dimensions of quality. Quality frameworks consider all steps of the statistical process by which data are collected, transformed and disseminated. They therefore refer to the quality of the: overall organisation of the process, \u2022 input data, \u2022 data collection, transformation and dissemination \u2022 operations, products (output data) \u2022 The approach of the European Statistical System comprises the institutional environment, statistical process and statistical outputs in line with European Statistics Code of Practice referred to in chapter B.2. Institutional environment Institutional and organisational factors have a significant influence on the effectiveness and credibility of a statistical authority producing and disseminating European Statistics. The relevant issues are professional independence, mandate for data collection, adequacy of resources, quality commitment, statistical confidentiality, impartiality and objectivity. Statistical processes European and other international standards, guidelines and good practices must be fully observed in the processes used by the statistical authorities to organise, collect, process and disseminate official statistics. The credibility of the statistics is enhanced by a reputation for good management and efficiency. The relevant aspects are sound methodology, appropriate statistical procedures, non-excessive burden on respondents and cost effectiveness. Statistical outputs Available statistics must meet users\u2019 needs. Statistics comply with the European quality standards and serve the needs of European institutions, governments, research institutions, business concerns and the public generally. The important issues concern the extent to which the statistics are relevant, accurate and reliable, timely, coherent, comparable across regions and countries, and readily accessible by users. These dimensions can be specified as follows: Box 5.6: Country Statistical Situation Reports in MEDSTAT Within MEDSTAT, providing European Commission statistical assistance to southern and Eastern Mediterranean states, the Country Statistical Situation Reports (CSSRs) is a key tool for taking stock of national statistics. The CSSRs contain detailed descriptions of: the general legal and institutional framework; \u2022 statistical capacity and infrastructure, including classifications and \u2022 registers; T infrastructure, data processing and data dissemination; \u2022 training and human resources, and; \u2022 nine thematic activities, comprising national accounts and external \u2022 trade, agricultural, environmental, energy, social, migration, transport and tourism statistics. The CSSRs, statistical sector reports and Project Orientation Reports (PORs) were developed on the basis of orientation missions in the countries. The CSSR serves as a central input for a National Statistical Development Strategy (NSDS) and associated activities and for the POR, whereas the sector reports and POR lead directly into the national road maps for statistics. The CSSRs are developed in cooperation between the MEDSTAT team, comprising experienced domain experts, and the NSI. The MEDSTAT Road Map Coordinator for the country and the Principal National Coordinator coordinate the process. The CSSRs are public documents. The first versions were published in 2006, following detailed evaluations of individual country requirements. They were updated in 2009, especially with a view to progress made towards international comparability and harmonisation.

Comparability 4. refers to the impact of the differences in applied concepts and measurement tools and procedures when statistics are compared between geographical areas, sectoral domains or over time; and Coherence refers to the adequacy of the data to be reliably combined in different ways and for various uses metadata standards: is the background documentation \u2022 complete and publicly available? adherence to current international standard \u2022 methodologies and nomenclatures, consistency within national statistics (are classifications \u2022 and statistical concepts consistent from one area of statistics to another?), consistency with data published by various international \u2022 organisations, and international quality comparisons and peer review. \u2022 Accessibility and clarity 5. refer to the conditions and modalities by which users can obtain, use and interpret data publication and dissemination methods, \u2022 full availability of results and metadata, and \u2022 orienting publications toward the users of statistics. \u2022 Eurostat publishes on its internet standards, handbooks and guidelines developed within the European Statistical System relating to quality management and quality reporting. Five dimensions \u2013 assurances of integrity, methodological soundness, accuracy and reliability, serviceability, and accessibility \u2013 of data quality and a set of prerequisites for data quality are at the centre of the IMF Data Quality Assessment Framework (DQAF). The DQAF, which is used for comprehensive assessments of countries\u2019 data quality, covers institutional environments, statistical processes, and characteristics of the statistical products. Box 5.4 in section C.5.2 provides an example of a practical checklist for documenting structural quality aspects of a NSS. Box 5.5 provides an example of Terms of Reference for an assessment of national statistical systems. As a further example, Box 5.6 gives information on the assessment methodology followed within the MEDSTAT II programme. Box 5.7 below gives a practical example of how the Terms of Reference for a major statistical capacity building action or a major operation can be specified in order to assure a high quality of the outcomes. Box 5.7: Improving quality in a major statistical capacity building operation \u2013 points for the Terms of Reference Terms of reference for a major statistical capacity building action or a major operation such as a large survey or census should refer to the methods to be used to ensure quality. This could be either an exposition of how quality will be addressed or a commitment to apply a specific quality methodology from the planning stage onwards. It should include a reference to the means of monitoring: self-assessment, Data Quality Assessment Framework (DQAF), peer review, etc. The usual situation is that NSIs have little or no experience in selecting, specifying or applying a quality methodology. Hence, a quality assessment is usually needed. This looks at a statistical system\u2019s capacity and outputs. It identifies key areas for improvement, e.g. statistical legislation, training and technical assistance to assist in planning and implementing quality methods could be appropriate. There should be a general commitment to applying a quality methodology. Terms of reference to implement DQAF (or another quality methodology) could be based on the following: The statistical action will ensure quality by implementing the 1. appropriate sector DQAF. For each of the (approximately 50) DQAF indicators, the quality 2. report will show: The indicator a. The current status or value of the indicator b. The source of this measurement c. The objective for this indicator and explanation for the choice d. of this objective. The activities required to achieve this objective (within the e. action being planned or not) The resources required to carry out the action (within the ac- f. tion being planned or not) ",
        "C 117 How to Decide on a Statistical Action Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 C.5.3.2 Examining data quality The assessment of a country\u2019s statistics may be triggered by a realisation that at least some of the data required to carry out the European Commission\u2019s cooperation programme with its partner is non-existent, late, inaccurate, inappropriate to the needs and / or not comparable with the country\u2019s other data or relevant international classifications. The first questions to be asked are: what is the extent of the statistics problem, who has observed them, what analyses have been made and what plans prepared? Information sources about data quality include existing analyses of the data from a number of sources, such as: a medium term statistics strategy such as an NSDS \u2022 (explained in section C.5.4) by national or international consultants; the Commission\u2019s experience in development cooperation \u2022 with its partners; international sources. \u2022 The place of the NSI in the partner country\u2019s medium term national development plans or programmes such as a PRSP or a MDG-based national development strategy can provide very useful information. A NSI that is marginalised in these plans or even the existence of a specific programme indicators unit usually indicates that the NSI either has technical deficiencies or does not have the confidence of decision makers for other reasons. The identification of \u2018competing\u2019 duplicate statistical series shows lack of confidence within the sector concerned. Assessments of data quality, sectoral and global, should be summarised in the CSP and JARs. These are written in conjunction with the partner country and should identify when the available statistics are unable to support analysis of the social, economic or environmental situation in question. Similarly, the National Indicative Programme should identify the need to improve statistics in areas where cooperation is being proposed, whether or not a specific statistics related action is being planned. A summary of data assessment in a CSP can look something like the information in Box 5.8. There are a number of tools available for assessing data quality. Two tools provided by the IMF are the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) , presented in Box 5.9, and the Data Quality Assessment Framework (DQAF) , presented in Box 5.10. Further quality frameworks are the Quality Framework for OECD Statistical Activities and the ISO 9000 quality standard. Various international resources support the wider evaluation of the quality of a country\u2019s statistics. A description of most NSSs can be found in the database \u2018Country profiles of statistical systems\u2019 on the website of the United Nations Statistics Division. This database covers the history of the NSS, the legal basis for the statistical activities, the NSI and other data producers. It may contain the NSS\u2019s or NSI\u2019s activity report, the most recent data and publications. As such, it gives the basic structural information on the NSS, as discussed in section B.2.3. For countries benefiting from Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC) , the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) and annual reports provide information on the timeliness of the strategy monitoring indicators that are appended to the annual reports. They can also contain information about the relevance of indicators and on the difficulties encountered in their preparation. The World Bank and IMF joint notes and reports on the PRS\u2019s evaluation (IMF and IDA Joint Staff Advisory note and Joint Staff Assessment of the PRS annual report) frequently offer elements for estimating an NSS\u2019 capacity to provide data for the follow-up of the PRS implementation. Box 5.8: Case study: Statistics in Nigeria\u2019s CSP / NIP 2001-07 A number of statistics can be found in the document. Furthermore, three paragraphs in the CSP chapter on the country\u2019s situation allude to the state of official statistics: \u201cAccording to the weak existing official statistics, manufacturing is only 6% of GDP\u2026\u201d [page 11] \u201cOverall, macroeconomic management is hampered by the lack of adequate statistics. Work has begun, with European Commission and other donor supports, to strengthen the Federal Office of Statistics.\u201d [page 12] \u201cThe reliability of any data on trends is questionable: for the infant mortality rate and the under-five mortality rate, some data suggest a decline of less than 7% over a 30 year period, while other data indicate a decrease of around 25% over a 20 year period.\u201d [page 17] The NIP mentions the planned support to statistics as follows: \u201cFederal level public management finance: the specific objective is to support Nigerian reform of federal public finance management. The major likely intervention is a second phase of the current Economic Management and Capacity Programme (ECMAP), with a probable emphasis on strengthening of the Federal Office of Statistics.\u201d [page 33] ",
        "C 118 How to Decide on a Statistical Action Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Another source of information on the status of national data is the IMF General Data Dissemination System ( GDDS ) website. It provides detailed, systematic information about the availability and quality of national mostly economic data, as well as about plans for improvement. This is the most important international source of information on economic data quality. However, it can be very out of date. National self-assessment reports on the MDGs contain analyses, many of high quality, on social data availability and quality. Statistical assessments are also made and sometimes published as part of the preparation for major interventions, especially for multi-country projects. The MEDSTAT II assessments of 10 Mediterranean countries are examples \u2013 see reference in \u2018To find out more\u2019 box below. The NSS as a whole may already have been analysed, perhaps as part of the preparation of a statistical strategy or plan, such as a National Strategy for the Development of Statistics (NSDS). The existence of an effective strategy or plan could reflect national government understanding of the role of statistics as a policy management tool. The PARIS21 webpage provides information on country NSDSs and other strategy papers, legal texts regarding statistics and other information related to NSS organisation. PARIS21 also coordinates and disseminates information collection concerning development assistance support for statistics. The application of NSDSs and other strategic analyses is discussed further in section C.6.1. Eurostat is currently developing a Database on International Statistical Cooperation (DISC) for European Commission\u2019s staff, which contains much of the above information on assessments of national and regional statistics systems and statistics actions supported by the European Commission. More information on DISC can be found in Box 7.2 in section C.7.3.2. A clear picture may emerge from this investigation of the availability and quality of statistics in a sector or in the statistics system as a whole. The set of observations obtained can serve as a basis for discussion with the partner country about the need for a strategic development of institutional statistical capacities and the development of an NSDS. Box 5.9: The General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) The purposes of the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) are to: Encourage member countries to improve data quality; \u2022 Provide a framework for evaluating needs for data improvement \u2022 and setting priorities in this respect; and Guide member countries in the dissemination to the public \u2022 of comprehensive, timely, accessible, and reliable economic, financial, and socio-demographic statistics It is intended to provide guidance for the overall development of macroeconomic, financial, and socio-demographic data. The framework takes into account, across a broad range of countries, the diversity of their economies and the developmental requirements of many of their statistical systems. The objective of the GDDS is to encourage the production and dissemination of complete sets of data with widest coverage, based on international methodologies. The emphasis is placed on complete data sets rather than on specific indicators. The GDDS framework is built around four dimensions: Data characteristics \u2022 Quality \u2022 Access, and \u2022 Integrity \u2022 The data dimension includes coverage, periodicity (i.e. the frequency of compilation), and timeliness (i.e. the speed of dissemination). The data dimension in the GDDS is closely linked to the quality dimension, within which plans for improving data quality form an integral part. Box 5.10: The Data Quality Assessment Framework (DQAF) The IMF Data Quality Assessment Framework (DQAF) identifies quality-related features of governance of statistical systems, statistical processes, and statistical products. It is used for comprehensive assessments of countries\u2019 data quality. The DQAF is rooted in the UN Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics and grew out of the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) and General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) , the IMF\u2019s initiatives on data dissemination. The DQAF incorporates their good practices and is the result of intensive consultations. The DQAF provides a structure for assessing existing practices against best practices, including internationally accepted methodologies. The DQAF\u2019s coverage of governance, processes, and products is organized around a set of prerequisites and five dimensions of data quality assurances of integrity, methodological soundness, accuracy and reliability, serviceability, and accessibility. For each dimension, the DQAF identifies 3-5 elements of good practice, and for each element, several relevant indicators. Further, in a cascading structure, more detail and more concreteness tailored to the dataset are provided by focal issues and key points. The generic DQAF serves as an umbrella for seven dataset-specific DQAF frameworks: National accounts statistics; Consumer price index; Producer price index; Government finance statistics; Monetary statistics; Balance of payments statistics, and; External debt statistics. In addition, a DQAF module on household income in a poverty context has been developed in collaboration with the World Bank. ",
        "C 119 How to Decide on a Statistical Action Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 C.5.4. Looking at the National Statistical System as a whole The analysis of the national statistical system and of its data quality may have revealed a number of problems. For example it may be that no relevant data exists, or that existing data is of poor quality, out of date, or even that data exists but has not been disseminated. Any such problem justifies an intervention to strengthen the statistics in the sector concerned. Data may well be required for evidence based policy making in the sector at national level as well as to evaluate the project at European Commission level. As underlined by the Evaluation of European Commission support for statistics in third countries (2007), the effectiveness of projects that support statistics and the sustainability of their results increase when: interventions are anchored in the overall development \u2022 strategy of the partner country ; the projects are conceived within the global context, \u2022 considering the NSS as a whole. They should be identified on the basis of the statistical situation and the information needs, thus focusing on the demand for information by users, particularly by decision-makers. Ideally, the priorities should be defined in the National Strategy for the Development of Statistics; activities promoting a culture of evidence-based decision- \u2022 making are systematically included, throughout the design and implementation of the intervention, such as the production of material which advocates statistics. All such material should be transferred to the statistical system managers after the project for further use.. specific measures are drawn up to involve all users and \u2022 not only the staff of the NSI. This goes beyond pure information and may include specific seminars to help users understand the data and develop confidence in their accuracy, reliability and integrity. the focus of assistance is more on strengthening the capacity \u2022 of the NSS as a whole (and not only the NSI) to regularly produce reliable basic data rather than on supporting a particular survey or study. This should then enhance the quality of statistical data and indicators. a policy dialogue accompanies statistical support to \u2022 prepare the phasing out of the project. This should include foreseeing whether the partner government or another donor will take over the funding after the end of the intervention. the status of the NSS as well as the human and financial \u2022 resources available are taken into consideration: statistics are not only an instrument, but form an integral part of the architecture of public services. the personnel that worked on the statistical project can \u2022 continue and transmit their know-how to others within the NSS. The sustainability of human resources is linked with financial sustainability. Insecurity regarding longer term funding as well as delays in funding can lead to a substantial \u2018brain drain\u2019 from the statistical institutes to the private sector. The need for and benefits of an integrated approach to the development of statistics, both with respect to the overall development strategies and with respect of strengthening the capacity of the statistical system as a whole, is at the heart of chapter C.6.

Statistical strategy C.6.1.1. Why a Statistical Strategy The aim of any statistics intervention is to support the collection and dissemination of statistics that inform development policy. National development policies are usually integrated in a strategic framework, such as a National Development Plan or a Poverty Reduction Strategy. Informing national and sector development strategies through assessment frameworks to monitor progress is a commitment of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness 14 . The assessment frameworks include performance indicators that need to be coherent between policy sectors and consistent over time. These performance indicators are largely based on published statistics which must be coherent in the same way. A policy level overview or strategy is needed to ensure that regularly disseminated quality statistics are attuned to policy requirements, are affordable, are comparable over time and are consistent between sectors. A statistical strategy aims to demonstrate how statistics will inform the monitoring of progress in the implementation of the development strategy. It therefore needs to show what statistics will be collected, published and how. It also needs to identify the resources, both financial and human, that will be available to the NSS. It needs to analyse the constraints the NSS faces: issues of the legal framework; budget and finance; institutional coordination; physical resources; and human resources \u2013 staff numbers, skills and commitment. Similarly, it needs to address how the National Statistics System will publish quality 15 statistics. 14 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness paragraph 44, Partner countries commit to: \u2018Endeavour to establish results-oriented reporting and assessment frameworks that monitor progress against key dimensions of the national and sector development strategies; and that these frameworks should track a manageable number of indicators for which data are cost-effectively available.\u2019 See also section B.1.3.. 15 See section C.5.1 for analysis of quality in statistics. The core element of the statistics strategy is its vision of the medium-term objectives of the statistics system: what statistics will be produced, how and with what resources and their links with the demand for data to monitor policy progress. An action plan, often for five years, that demonstrates how the strategy will be fulfilled, forms a part of the strategy. The role of the statistics strategy in informing national policies as well as the need for commitment of resources means that the statistics strategy is an explicitly political document and thus requires authorisation and active participation from decision makers. In order to be effective, statistics strategies should be based on and consistent with national strategies; the national budget, poverty reduction strategy and sector policy monitoring frameworks should be seen as the starting points for defining both the minimum indicator set and the estimated budget for statistics. This will enable statisticians to be exposed to concrete examples of how data are needed and used by policy makers and will ensure that strategies are owned by both statisticians and users of statistics. Since ambitious strategies are never implemented, strategies should seek to collect the minimum set of indicators. Sequencing and getting the basics right first are critical. Since staff numbers, skills and motivation are the key elements in producing statistics and salaries are the largest cost of producing statistics, a good statistics strategy will include a clear, detailed exposition of the human resources requirements. C.6.1.2. National Strategies for Development of Statistics The most common methodology for developing a statistics strategy is the National Strategies for the Development of Statistics (NSDS), technically supported by the PARIS21 consortium. The particular strength of this methodology is its recognition that the statistics strategy is a policy document whose value decision-makers may be unaware of. Advocacy at the political level therefore plays a prime role in PARIS21\u2019s approach. The chapter in brief This chapter provides guidance at the decision phase on whether and how to give support to statistics. It discusses the relationship of statistics strategy with national development and poverty reduction strategies and analyses the development and implementation of statistics strategies. This is followed by a presentation of capacity building in statistics, including how it is related to statistical strategy documents and practical considerations in capacity building. Having looked at what is to be done, the chapter then moves on to examine in general how statistics actions are to be done. The issues of coordination at various levels are addressed: who can do what and what needs to be done to ensure coherence and eliminate duplication? Box 6.1: Action points for statistics strategies Statistics strategies must be demand driven, modest and realistic \u2022 and must build on existing processes Statistics strategies should take a realistic approach to Manag- \u2022 ing for Development Results (see section B.1.3) that focus on key indicators and take into account limited national capacity and resources Strategies should focus and harmonise donor support on coun- \u2022 try statistics priorities Strategies\u2019 implementation should be monitored \u2022 ",
        "C 124 How to bring Assistance to Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 A key quality action is to let independent peers review the NSDS. Not only are the independent peers ideally placed to critically assess presumptions and priorities, they are also in a position to bring in their experience and fresh views and ideas to the national NSDS process. Indeed, peer reviewing is a central part in the quality work of the European Statistical System, where Member States\u2019 compliance with the ESS Code of Practice is reviewed. PARIS21 produces methodological guidance on strategic planning and assist countries in finding solutions to obstacles. This includes helping countries setting up peer reviews of their NSDS, giving the opportunity to get an independent view and assessment of the NDSD and sharing experiences in strategic plan development and follow-up of advanced countries. The main alternative to this methodology is the \u2018Plan for Change\u2019, developed by the IMF as a consequence of the GDDS programme 16 . This approach is of interest to countries that are working closely with the IMF on GDDS compliance and where advocacy at the decision-making level is less of an issue. The choice of methodology is one for the partner country to take for itself. This section will concentrate on the NSDS. The key PARIS21 document for this discussion is A Guide to Designing a National Strategy for the Development of Statistics . While the form and content of an NSDS will depend critically on factors such as the administrative structure of government, the level of development and affordability, a strategy usually includes 17 : The establishment of mechanisms for consultation with 1. all the main stakeholders in a statistical system, including producers, users and providers of statistics; An assessment of the current status of the system, 2. including from the user perspective and taking account of existing improvement programmes; A vision, setting out an agreed statement of what 3. governments and other stakeholders want from the statistical system at some point in the future. The vision provides a goal that everyone can agree on: a statement of where statistics should be; An identification of options on what strategic actions 4. are required to overcome the constraints and achieve the vision, including prioritisation of actions; A detailed action plan with a timetable and a financing 5. plan to put these strategic actions into effect in order to achieve the desired results; Identification of mechanisms to monitor progress, 6. including indicators and reporting to inform the updating and adaptation of the strategy. 16 See section B.2.4. 17 A Guide to Designing a National Strategy for the Development of Statistics, p7 Box 6.2: An effective National Strategy for the Development of Statistics ... has high-level political support; \u2022 is mainstreamed within national development policy processes, \u2022 building on what is already available; is the output of a nationally led, nationally owned and inclusive \u2022 participatory process that draws on international standards, recommendations and experience; provides the basis for the sustainable development of statistics \u2022 with quality \u201cfit for purpose\u201d; assesses the current status of the national statistical system and \u2022 provides a vision and a strategic plan for national statistics; sets out an integrated statistical development programme that is \u2022 flexible enough to cope with change; outlines the financing requirements, but is realistic about resource \u2022 needs; serves as a coherent framework for international support for \u2022 statistical development.

It is important that all institutions and structures with an interest in the statistical strategy participate in its elaboration, creating a common ownership of the NSDS and thus increasing commitment to the strategy. The development should be in the hands of the members of the National Statistics System, operating under active political direction and support. Where external consultants are used, the challenge is to ensure that the strategy remains rooted in the national demands for published statistics and the perceptions and possibilities of the NSS, as well as maintaining political backing. It is important that the NSDS is written in such a way that the people who will be responsible for its implementation can relate to it. Consultation and input from users and other stakeholders should include political decision-makers. The PARIS21 documentation clearly states that there is no uniform template for an NSDS and therefore there cannot be a uniform set of terms of reference for its development. What is important is that the six points above are answered by the NSDS. Box 6.3 shows the different phases of a typical NSDS and their expected outputs. Box 6.4 shows the possible timeframe for preparing an NSDS. ",

Capacity building in statistics \u2018Capacity can be defined as the ability to perform tasks and produce outputs, to define and solve problems, and make informed choices\u2019 18 . \u2018Capacity is the ability of people, organisations/institutions and society as a whole to successfully manage their affairs. Capacity development is the process of unleashing, conserving, creating, strengthening, adapting and maintaining capacity over time.\u2019 19 A country\u2019s statistical capacity can be defined as the ability of statistical producers to fulfil their mission of collection and dissemination of reliable and up-to-date statistics that meet users\u2019 needs. Statistical capacity building is the process whereby these bodies create and strengthen their statistical capacity. Leaving aside crisis situations, in which policy objectives are very short term and any work on statistics supports the immediate response to the crisis, most donor intervention in statistics aims at sustainability and therefore contains an element of capacity building. This should be the case even when the support provided is for a statistics operation, such as a population census or a household survey, and not directly aimed at increasing statistics capacity. 1 8 Institutional Assessment and Capacity Development: Why, what and how? EuropeAid Aid Delivery Methods Concept Paper 09/2005 1 9 Source: OECD/DAC Task Force on Capacity Development, (2004). Quoted in DAC Guidelines and Reference Series Harmonising Donor Practices for Effective Aid Delivery Volume 3: \u2018 Strengthening Procurement Capacities In Developing Countries \u2019 Capacity building in statistics reduces the barriers to effective production and dissemination of quality statistics. Therefore capacity building can include: Reform of the legal framework; \u2022 Improving dialogue with the political level, within the NSS \u2022 and with users of statistics outside government, especially the general public; Adapting the organisational structure of an NSI or \u2022 other statistics producer to better meet the demand for statistics; Training and education so that staff management and \u2022 technical knowledge are sufficient for their tasks; Ensuring that materials, buildings and equipment are \u2022 adequate. This can be summarised as \u2018human\u2019, \u2018technical\u2019 and \u2018organisational\u2019 capacity building. Training is an important aspect of capacity building, given the importance of technical and managerial knowledge in organising statistics operations. Another vital aspect is the appropriate information and communication technology (ICT), both with respect to the hardware and the required software applications (see section C.8.8). Furthermore, in order for a statistical process to be efficient and sustainable, the necessary organisational framework must be in place; this involves not only the legal framework, but also the support of and cooperation with other actors, such as line ministries, holders of administrative information, business federations and key enterprises, key statistics users, and so forth. All aspects of statistical capacity may be brought forward through dedicated assistance; the key is to focus on which aspect(s) are critical in the specific national (or regional) setting. The European Commission\u2019s support to statistics and different types of activities are discussed in chapter C.7). The ideal framework for planning capacity building is a sector-wide statistics strategy such as an NSDS described above. This will lead to capacity building actions being planned as part of the strategy implementation. In other situations such as existing stand-alone sector programmes with a statistics component, the programme planning should ensure that the capacity will be available Box 6.5: NSDS status in IDA countries (as of March 2011) Countries currently implementing a strategy Countries currently planning / designing a strategy or awaiting adoption Countries without a strategy nor planning one Total Africa 22 17 1 40 Asia and Pacific 11 13 3 27 Latin America and Caribbean 1 4 4 9 Europe 3 0 0 3 Total 37 34 8 79 To find out more\u2026 about National Strategies for the Development of Statistics, visit PARIS21\u2019s website: www.paris21.org A Guide to Designing a National Strategy for the Development of Statistics \u2013 key summary document Knowledge Base \u2013 PARIS21\u2019s database of NSDS-related documents Map of NSDS in Africa ",

Building an effective NSS takes a long time. Commitment to medium-term support for strengthening statistical capacity is required both from the country\u2019s decision makers and from its aid partners. The alternative strategy is to include statistical capacity building within each sector and in particular linked with major surveys. The advantage is that the focus can easily be placed on the role of statistical information within the sector. The disadvantage is that there is less impetus for the construction of a coordinated NSS. To plan and implement capacity building actions, a number of checklists and programmes have been developed (references and links in the \u2018To find out more\u2019 box below): A PARIS21 report on Statistical Capacity Building \u2022 Indicators gives a list of 16 quantitative and 18 qualitative indicators for capacity assessment, as well as an analysis of how to implement the analysis. The generic chapter on Institutional Capacity Assessment \u2022 of the EuropeAid Project Cycle Guidelines is highly relevant to statistics A Regional Reference Strategic Framework for Statistical \u2022 Capacity Building in Africa has been developed within the Marrakech Action Plan for Statistics framework (see section B.1.3). This can give an idea of the likely components of a comprehensive capacity building programme. The key issue when considering statistics capacity building is ensuring that the action under consideration is likely to make a significant practical difference to statistics operations. The logical framework (or \u2018logframe\u2019) for a regional statistics training project, presented in Box 6.6, shows the main elements for building and managing such a project. The first column, entitled \u2018Project Description\u2019, first states the main purpose of the project, then the expected general result, which is again detailed into a number of practical outputs (or \u2018operational objectives\u2019). For each of these aspects of the project planning, one can follow the rows to find for each: Indicators which can be used for assessing progress and \u2022 evaluate the final results for that aspect of the project, e.g. for the overall \u2018Purpose\u2019 measures of how this has been met by the project; How to verify sources for verifying the results of these \u2022 indicators, e.g. for the training courses looking at the training course reports and the resulting statistics; and The assumptions that have to be fulfilled for the different \u2022 aspects of the project to be fulfilled, e.g. for delivery of professional training courses that the required documentation of outcome have been defined in the Terms of Reference and that the conditions for follow-up of the training are in place.

Co-ordinating with other programmes and other development partners C.6.3.1. Co-ordinated financing for statistical capacity building The Marrakech Action Plan for Statistics (MAPS) (see section B.1.3.3) calls for increased investment in statistical systems (Action 3) and strategic planning for developing statistical systems (Action 1), while improving the coordination and accountability of the international statistical system (Action 6). In response to this, a set of financing instruments have been established to provide required funding for the development and the implementation of National Strategies for Development of Statistics (see section C.6.1) or similar strategies and comprehensive statistical development plans, as well as associated activities. Developing countries generally need financial assistance for investments in infrastructure, people and equipment. However, the poorest developing countries may also need assistance to cover also recurrent costs, at least in the shorter term. This challenge calls for donors to increase their financial support for statistics and, at the same time, for developing countries to provide increased domestic budget allocations, in order to build a sustainable statistical system. To assess progress, the international financing instruments for statistical capacity building encourage developing countries to apply international standards and frameworks. These include the UN\u2019s fundamental principles of official statistics (see Box 2.1) and IMF\u2019s General Data Dissemination System (see Box 5.9) and Data Quality Assessment Framework (see Box 5.10). The PARIS21 indicators of statistical capacity building offers a further tool to measure progress. Based on the goals of the NSDS, measurable targets and indicators of success should be defined. The preparation of an NSDS is an essential step in improving the capacity of statistical systems. This is an important mechanism for co-ordinating financial and technical assistance to statistics in accordance with national priorities. NSDS and the associated implementation and financing programmes lead towards more co-ordinated financing for statistics and bring financial support from donors together in a coherent and consistent framework. The design of NSDSs is being supported by bilateral and multilateral donors. The World Bank\u2019s Trust Fund for Statistical Capacity Building (TFSCB) , financed by contributions from a number of donors, provides small grants to support the preparation of NSDSs and some initial capacity building activities. In Africa the preparation of NSDSs is also supported by the African Development Bank. The TFSCB\u2019s objective is to strengthen national statistical systems in support of poverty reduction strategies and other national and international development goals. Projects are designed to be relatively small and quick disbursing. All World Bank member countries are eligible to apply for TFSCB funding, but priority is given to countries that are eligible for support by the International Development Association (IDA). TFSCB currently supports two major types of projects: \u2022 preparation and updating of National Strategies for the \u2022 Development of Statistics (NSDS); and improvement in statistical capacity in key priority areas \u2022 within the framework of NSDS, regional or global strate- gies While the TFSCB is an effective mechanism for supporting the preparation of NSDSs, it is not intended or designed to provide substantial and sustained investment in statistical capacity. To meet this need, the Statistics for Results Facility (SRF) was set up. SRF is a global initiative concerned with the strengthening of statistical systems and building capacity in the poorest developing countries. In accordance with MAPS, SRF focuses both on scaling-up levels of resources for investing in statistical capacity on the basis of a NSDS and on the promotion of more effective delivery of assistance. The SRF consists of both a new approach and new funds. The Statistics for Results Facility Catalytic Fund (SRF- CF) is a multi-donor \u201cprogrammatic\u201d trust fund, managed by the World Bank on behalf of the donors. The SRF-CF provides grants to invest in statistics, using a program-based approach (both system-wide and sector-wide). It pays great attention to the aid effectiveness principles of Managing for Development Results (see section B.1.3.2) and the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness (see section B.1.4). The SRF-CF also provide funding for project preparation and supervision, to be managed (as appropriate) by in-country \u201clead\u201d donors in statistics. SRF-CF pilot projects have been launched in Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Rwanda and Nigeria. This pilot phase is expected to last until around 2012. ",

Eligible countries must agree to: Exercise leadership over their statistical development by \u2022 developing a good quality (comprehensive, realistic, prioritized and costed ) National Statistical Plan; Allocate resources and carry out necessary administrative reforms \u2022 for proper implementation of the National Statistical Plan; Take a lead in coordinating donor and government support to \u2022 statistics through the creation of national partnerships; Put into effect the UN Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics \u2022 (see Box 2.1), in particular to ensure that users have confidence in the quality and integrity of national statistics; and Monitor progress in statistics and statistical capacity, based on \u2022 output and outcome indicators. To promote good practice, the SRF-CF encourages donors to agree on a number of principles in the area of statistics, based on the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. These include: Respect country leadership in the implementation of the National \u2022 Statistical Plan; Support nationally-agreed statistical priorities, thereby avoiding \u2022 donor driven activities; Deliver statistical support in a harmonized and coordinated \u2022 manner, based on program-based approaches; and Assist countries in their efforts to set up results-oriented \u2022 measurement frameworks for sector development plans (including Poverty Reduction Strategies) Source: World Bank \u2018SRF-CF Charter\u2019 and \u2018SRF-CF Guidelines and Procedures\u2019 Box 6.8: Statistics for Results Facility Catalytic Fund: Key issues Country leadership: \u2022 Have countries led the process of improving statistical capacity?

        "C 131 How to bring Assistance to Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 through investment projects. STATCAP provides flexibility in financing, including meeting recurrent costs, providing new means for financing investments and making best use of all sources of technical support and advice. Projects normally finance the implementation of NSDS or a comparable strategy (see section C.6.1). These strategies generally include a detailed assessment of the national statistical system, a strategy for its further development with goals and targets, and an action plan to put it into effect. Where this has not yet been prepared or need updating, a grant from the Trust Fund for Statistical Capacity Building (TFSCB) can be made available. The criteria for developing countries\u2019 use of the STATCAP program are: a NSDS or similar comprehensive mid-term plan; \u2022 national commitment and leadership to strengthen the \u2022 national statistical system; willingness to comply with good statistical practice; \u2022 participation in global development and monitoring \u2022 activities; use of sustainable implementation arrangements. \u2022 Each project is based on a full assessment of a country\u2019s needs and existing capacity, but most STATCAP projects include actions to improve or strengthen: Statistical policy and the regulatory and institutional \u2022 framework: legislation safeguarding independence and confidentiality, mechanisms for efficient management and coordination; Statistical infrastructure: the business register, sampling \u2022 frames, classifications, database structures and geographic information systems; Statistical operations and procedures; Human resources; \u2022 and Physical infrastructure and equipment. \u2022 STATCAP financed projects are implemented using the principles agreed by PARIS21 on country ownership and donor coordination. Countries must comply with good statistical practice and put in place appropriate and sustainable implementation arrangements. The STATCAP framework encourages effective coordination, participation of other international and bilateral donors, and participation of national stakeholders, both in the public and private sectors. Each separate project or phase must identify specific targets and indicators of success, based on goals set out in the NSDS and agreed through a consultative process.

Co-ordination of partners and activities A valuable tool for coordination of activities in Eastern European Neighbourhood (ENP) countries is the Database of Integrated Statistical Activities (DISA) , which gives a detailed overview of the activities of over 30 statistical organizations active in the UNECE region. DISA is a coherent catalogue of planned work in international statistics over the coming year. Good practices on how to develop strategic planning frameworks for the development of statistics can be found in PARIS21\u2019s \u201c Guide to using a system-wide approach to implement National Strategies for the Development of Statistics (NSDS) \u201d, which provides guidance on how to use a system-wide (or programme-based) approach to support the strengthening of National Statistical Systems. The approach emphasises the central importance of implementing well-designed and realistic National Strategies for the Development of Statistics (NSDSs), directly linked to national poverty reduction strategies or other development plans. The document provides operational guidance for managers and funders of National Statistical Systems on moving from the preparation of plans and strategies (NSDSs or similar documents) to their implementation. In statistics-related fields, as in other areas, donors specialise in a limited number of technical fields, provide financial support across wider areas and leave some subjects altogether to other development partners. To avoid both duplication and the involvement of development partners in statistics actions outside their areas of expertise, co-ordination with the development community at large is essential. The Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness commits the development partners to coordination. The European Consensus on Development (section B.1.5) goes further than this and makes a specific commitment in paragraph 32: \u201c The EU will take a lead role in implementing the Paris Declaration commitments on improving aid delivery and has in this context made four additional commitments: to provide all capacity building assistance through coordinated programmes with an increasing use of multi- ",
        "C 132 How to bring Assistance to Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 donors arrangements; to channel 50 % of government-to- government assistance through country systems, including by increasing the percentage of our assistance provided through budget support or sector-wide approaches; to avoid the establishment of any new project implementation units; to reduce the number of un-coordinated missions by 50 %. \u201d The \u201c European Code of Conduct on Division of Labour in Development Policy \u201d addresses the essential question of who does what in development initiatives, giving a set of concrete measures to enhance complementarity and division of labour amongst EU donors There are four main channels of coordination of activities, each of which is also a source of information on statistics- related actions planned or in progress: The beneficiary country or region has a Paris Declaration 1. on Aid Effectiveness responsibility for coordinating external assistance. A statistical strategy such as a NSDS is the best means of coordinating internal and external resources, both financial and technical. A primary benefit from this level of coordination of statistics is the reduction or elimination of superfluous household surveys. Development partners committees in the beneficiary 2. countries, including the participation of EU Member States, provide a key element of co-ordination. Some development partners have highly decentralised decision processes, providing information about the content of activities through channels within a beneficiary country. This is particularly the case with sector projects. In these, statistics may form a relatively small part. This could lead to only the main sector of operations being recorded centrally and that information about the statistical implications is missing. The international organisation charged with co- 3. ordinating the sector statistics in question is an important information source. One example of international organisations\u2019 co-ordination is the preparation of the 2010 World Population and Housing Census Programme through the UN Statistics Division. Websites and other documents provide information about regionally and globally coordinated actions. International and global organisations responsible for statistics in specific sectors are identified in section B.2.4. Eurostat is developing a Database on International 4. Statistics Cooperation (DISC), to be available within the European Commission, containing information about EU support for statistics development. Standard project information does not necessarily provide full information on statistics activities. Potential overlaps can occur between national and regional projects; between sector support for statistics and statistics parts of projects in other sectors; and between support actions for overlapping regional organisations. The Database on International Statistics Cooperation (DISC) will provide a source of information to improve coordination.

The European Commission\u2019s support to statistics C.7.1. Objectives for statistics actions: statistics in strategy and programme documents This section looks at how to decide whether statistics needs to be mentioned in country / regional strategy and programme documents and how to ensure that the mention of statistics fully supports the European Commission\u2019s and the partner country/region\u2019s development objectives 20 . The section also looks at how to verify the authority for a statistics action in strategy and programme documents. Box 7.1 below summarises the action points. Statistics are instrumental in achieving policy goals, as discussed in chapter B.1. In particular, statistics that are insufficient to permit the use of indicators to prepare, monitor and evaluate a specific programme are a barrier to the implementation of that programme. The diagnosis section in a strategy paper should identify areas where absent or poor quality statistics are a significant constraint to achieving policy goals because they do not permit policy measures to be adequately prepared, monitored and evaluated. If statistics are a constraint across many fields, this can be considered as a governance issue. In a regional context, insufficient statistics can be a barrier to regional integration policy goals. The response strategy should identify support for quality statistics as a means to inform policy preparation, monitoring and evaluation in the areas of concern identified. Support will enable statistics to inform decision making by meeting the relevant quality criteria, including the UN Fundamental Principles of Statistics 21 . 20 The section is based on the terminology of the ACP Country Strategy Papers and National Indicative Programmes. However, the methodology is intended to be more widely applicable. 21 Official statistics and their fundamental principles are discussed in section B.2.1; quality in statistics is discussed at greater length in section C.5.1. Actions in support of statistics should normally be compatible with medium-term statistics strategy or planning documents, where they exist. These strategies should be compatible with national development plans or poverty reduction strategies. See section C.6.1 for further information. The availability of good quality statistics are a pre-condition for proper strategic analysis and for programming and design of concrete interventions. Ideally, the strategy and programming documents should discuss the state of the statistics system, its strengths and weaknesses and remedial and quality improving actions required. Strategy and programme documents will clearly facilitate European Commission statistics action if the diagnosis section identifies poor quality statistics and the response strategy identifies necessary interventions in statistics . If both these points are missing, it will be much more difficult to justify support to statistics; for example, a very strong argument must be made that support to statistics is required to reach the main objectives of the strategy paper). This argument can be made by linking support for statistics to the effective operation of the programme, for example linking quality statistics to the availability of statistics-based indicators for programme design, monitoring and evaluation. The chapter in brief The chapter starts from the point at which the development partners accept that there is a need for external support to statistics. The chapter aims to inform the subsequent decision about whether and how the European Commission should be involved. It first considers the Commission\u2019s development statistics activities in the context of country / regional strategies and programmes, including any statistics strategy. It continues by looking at the purpose of statistics actions and how they are linked to the development objectives using the logical framework. The chapter finishes with a practical look at the various types of European Commission statistics interventions, showing links with policies, identifying areas of cooperation, listing examples and providing action points. The chapter makes repeated reference to the 2006 Evaluation of the Commission\u2019s support to Statistics in Third Countries. Box 7.1: Check points to assure statistical actions are in aligned with policy goals The statistics action is aimed at supporting a policy that is itself \u2022 compatible with national and/or regional partner country and region development strategy \u2013 (section B.1.4) and it is therefore mentioned in the Strategy Paper and Indicative Programme or equivalent document \u2013 section C.5.2. Statistics actions, including their scope, should be normally be \u2022 compatible with national statistics strategies (NSDS) \u2013 section C.6.1. National / regional ownership of the statistics action is clearly \u2022 demonstrated. To find out more\u2026 Evaluation of the Commission Support for Statistics in Third \u2022 Countries, 2007 ",
        "C 136 The European Commission\u2019s Support to Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 C.7.2. Matching outputs to objectives: the logical framework of a statistics action This section shows how to develop the statistics supporting actions that can achieve the policy goals discussed in section C.7.1. It provides an overview to the discussion of implementing statistics actions in chapter C.8. The statistics actions under discussion should be compared with the problems with statistics analysed in section C.5.2. The logical framework and the project cycle management terminology are applicable both to traditional projects and to other implementation instruments. The purpose of any European Commission statistics intervention is to support the development partner to produce good quality 22 statistics sustainably in order to inform decision-making . This statement is a model for any statistics action, to be included in the logframe description of the project purpose. A similar statement is included in section C.6.2 at Box 6.6: Logical framework for regional statistics training programme. In order to focus support on achieving policy goals, it is important to identify and classify the types of intervention being considered. This will help ensure that planned activities will achieve the objectives. All European Commission statistics actions in all regions of cooperation and development aim at one or more of the following three specific objectives 23 : Improve coverage and quality of statistical information 1. (output) Improve capacity to collect, process, analyse and 2. disseminate statistical information (capacity building) Improve the use of statistical information (use) 3. For example, an action to support the adoption of statistics standards in a partner country might include specific objectives that cover both output and capacity-building. The specific objective in the example in Box 6.6 clearly falls under the capacity category: Ensure that the capacity exists within the region to provide \u2022 statistics-related training that directly enables statistics producers to improve the quality of statistics produced and for users to improve the quality of their statistical analysis. The biggest challenge in developing a statistics activity is ensuring that there is a clear explanation of how the planned outputs will contribute to achieving the results (specific objective). This is especially important in statistics capacity building, where the impetus from worthwhile activities can easily be lost. 22 i.e. meeting the relevant international criteria, including the UN fundamental principles of statistic 23 Evaluation of the Commission Support for Statistics in Third Countries, 2007, page 9 At the operational objectives level, six common types of outputs can be identified, which together correspond to the range of statistics-related problems described in section C.5.4: Strengthen statistics relationships with decision makers; 1. set medium term strategy to meet policy-oriented goals (strategy). Section C.6. \u2022 1 considers policy-level relations and statistics strategies. Strengthen legal and regulatory framework, inter- 2. institutional relationships (framework). The framework for statistics is considered together with \u2022 strategies in section C.6.1. Strengthen capacity to develop, maintain and disseminate 3. quality statistical information required to formulate, implement and monitor policies (capacity) This is the largest activity in implementing an NSDS. \u2022 Develop the international comparability of statistics. In 4. some cases this requires harmonisation with the European Statistical System (ESS) (capacity / harmonisation) Capacity building is considered in \u2022 section C.6.2. Harmonisation with ESS standards is identified separately as it is the specific purpose of some European Neighbourhood Policy statistics actions. In this situation, capacity building actions are undertaken in support of the objective. Strengthen capacity of stakeholders to access, analyse and 5. interpret statistical data (users) Provide direct support to produce and disseminate 6. specified statistics (production support) Direct support for data production and dissemination is \u2022 usually for population censuses and large-scale surveys, where external support is appropriate due to their cost. Indicators and sources of verification: At the project purpose level, these should relate to \u2022 publication of statistics and metadata both at country (or regional) level and through international data sources. There should usually be specific mention of the IMF GDDS metadata website (see section B.2.1 and section B.2.4) in capacity building actions. For statistics users, published analyses of statistics should be highlighted. At the results level, indicators should relate to the \u2022 application of the activity outputs. This is particularly important in capacity building activities. For example, in the case of training in statistics: what is the plan to apply the training received, for example in changing statistical nomenclature? Have the former statistics students been employed to produce and disseminate official statistics? ",
        "C 137 The European Commission\u2019s Support to Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Output level indicators are relatively straightforward, \u2022 even for capacity building actions: training materials, attendance lists, trainer\u2019s reports and student evaluations are examples. C.7.3. Providing European Commission support for statistics C.7.3.1. The European Commission\u2019s implementation instruments and statistics Support to statistics can be applied through any of the various types of instrument used in European Commission development cooperation. Classic \u2022 projects focussed on statistics tend to create large demands on Commission management time, relative to the size of the project. Nevertheless, they are still used where there is no alternative. Sector-Wide Action programmes \u2022 \u2018A SWAp is a programme-based approach applied to a particular sector, such as education, health or agriculture. This will support a sector development programme (SDP), which is \u201ca single comprehensive programme and budget framework, comprising a specific, time-bound and costed set of actions and activities within a sector\u201d such as, in the case of statistics, an NSDS incorporating both government and donor resources 24 . A sector-wide programme for statistics may or may \u2022 not form part of a wider government or planning system reform. The aim is to improve the statistical and analytical capacity needed in key ministries. The approach provides for a general reform of the statistical function, including capacity building measures. An example is the Mozambique United Nations Development Assistance Framework 2007-2009 , which includes a wide range of support to statistics at national, provincial and local level. The EDF10 programme in Mauritania proposes general support to statistics reform as part of good governance. Support to statistics SWAps is the objective of the \u2018scaling up\u2019 joint funding strategy discussed in section B.1.3. SWAps for education, health or other sectors may contain \u2022 a statistics element. This is perhaps the more common of the two approaches. For example, the Uganda EDF10 CSP identifies agriculture statistics as being a problem to be addressed within the rural development focal area. 24 Definition from Paris21: A Guide to Using a System-wide Approach to Implement National Strategies for the Development of Statistics (NSDS) Budget support programmes typically have a capacity building component that can be mobilised to support the strengthening of statistical systems, either through project modality, technical assistance or pooled funding. EDF10 budget support to Rwanda includes support to statistics. C.7.3.2. Eurostat\u2019s role in supporting European Commission development statistics Eurostat\u2019s role in statistical development co-operation is to provide an advisory service to the European Commission external General Directorates, in particular to Commission delegations. Advice is given to the national statistical institutes and regional organisations of the European Commission\u2019s development partners with the agreement of the relevant external service. This Guide to Statistics in Development Cooperation is being developed to help fulfil this role. Eurostat is consulted on the preparation of the Country/ Regional Strategy Papers, National/Regional Indicative Programmes and Joint Annual Reports. The Evaluation of the Commission Support for Statistics in Third Countries concluded that \u2018The systematic recourse to the technical competence of EUROSTAT was very beneficial in terms of quality.\u2019 Eurostat\u2019s objective in development statistics cooperation is to support EU external relations policies by providing appropriate and focused statistical technical assistance. For countries covered by the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), Eurostat\u2019s objective is to support the development of these countries\u2019 statistical systems with a view to providing a basic set of harmonised data that meet the ESS requirements. Administratively, Eurostat\u2019s Statistical Cooperation unit (A6) works in development with the European Union\u2019s external service\u2019s programmes working with Africa, Caribbean, Pacific, Asia and Latin America. The same unit is also responsible for Statistical Cooperation with European Neighbourhood Policy countries as well as with EU candidate and potential candidate countries. Eurostat is responsible for fulfilling the European Commission\u2019s Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness obligation (see section B.1.3) to report on development cooperation activities that involve statistics. Its Database on International Statistics Cooperation (DISC) is being developed to provide this information concerning the European Commission support programmes. A dialogue between EU Delegations and Eurostat is therefore developed to update the information in DISC on statistics-related actions.

The Community Statistical Programme 2008 to 2012 bases its activities in the fields of Development cooperation and of Economic, financial and technical cooperation with third countries on the European Consensus. The Statistical Programme lays out Eurostat\u2019s overall development objective 25 as to \u2018prepare and implement regional development programmes and to ensure a close link between statistical actions and the wider objectives of EU programmes.\u2019 Eurostat\u2019s statistical programme states that its development cooperation 26 activities will be as follows: The overall objective is to support EU external relations \u2022 policies by providing appropriate and focused statistical technical assistance \u2026 statistical cooperation is increasingly focused on strengthening the measurement and monitoring of poverty, with a particular emphasis on the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) indicators. Technical advice and support is provided in the area of \u2022 measuring the impact of EU development programmes and with regard to the statistical element of EU regional development programmes in general. 25 Cross-cutting issues 2: relations with stakeholders \u2013 technical cooperation with third countries, page L344/21 26 Title XX, page L344/42 Areas for support include multilateral surveillance, \u2022 improvement of national accounts, price statistics, agricultural statistics, statistics on natural resources and on the pressures on the environment, foreign trade, business statistics and statistical training. Technical cooperation activities stress the importance \u2022 of a user focus, and promote the value of multi-annual programming. Main initiatives for 2008 to 2012 with respect to developing \u2022 countries (especially African) are: the visibility of statistics in national and regional \u03bf development plans will be increased, technical advice and scientific support will be \u03bf provided, where possible, for the conduct of statistical development programmes, in particular at regional level; to support projects with statistical implications and harmonisation of statistics in countries benefiting from EU aid; and to contribute to the assessment of the statistical priorities for the planning and programming of EU statistical cooperation activities, particular emphasis, taking into account the gender \u03bf dimension, will be put on measuring and monitoring poverty, progress on social cohesion, environmental sustainability and the MDG indicators.The objective of economic, financial and technical cooperation with third countries in statistics 27 , for countries covered by the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), is to support the development of these countries\u2019 statistical systems with a view to providing a basic set of harmonised data meeting EU requirements in areas where EU policies call for such data. The statistical assistance for these countries is implemented through the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument. Main initiatives for 2008 to 2012 with respect to countries \u2022 covered by the ENP are: the key areas of economic statistics, national accounts \u03bf and price statistics, external trade, migration statistics and social statistics will be developed. In addition, other sectors like energy and environment statistics \u2013 and, more broadly, sustainable development indicators \u2013 should progressively emerge as a key input for policy making, cooperation will also aim at building-up and enhancing \u03bf the institutional capacities of the national statistical offices and inter-institutional cooperation. 27 Title XXI, page L344/43.

European Commission types of action in statistics C.7.4.1. Overview The section aim is to look at types of statistics action in which the European Commission is often involved to identify: the relation of policies to statistics-related actions; \u2022 European Commission areas of experience; areas where \u2022 the Commission finances statistics but is not technically involved; examples of current and recent interventions; \u2022 action points specific to each type of action. \u2022 This analysis and many action points in this section are based on the 2006 Evaluation of the Commission support for statistics in third countries. Early outputs from the Eurostat DISC Database on Statistical Cooperation have been used among other sources to classify recent interventions. Detailed information about recent programmes in the field of international statistical co-operation is regularly updated in PRESS . European Commission support for statistical interventions can be categorised into the following type of action: System-wide support at national level 1. Large-scale operations (e.g. population censuses, 2. household surveys) Sector statistics intervention, capacity building and / or 3. support for specific statistics production Strengthening regional statistics 4. The 2007 Evaluation examines (page 33) support for the demand and use of quality statistics to prepare decisions and to monitor the effects of their implementation, including the interpretation of statistical data. The key findings were: The issue of raising the demand for statistics and their \u2022 understanding by decision-makers is mentioned in many projects but little firm action was being planned. The number of seminars and workshops addressed to users \u2022 was very limited. Provision for promoting statistics was included in most \u2022 projects but was generally not sustainable beyond project termination. Box 7.3: Action points for statistics interventions Diagnosis The diagnosis of problems and priorities should be drawn from a \u2022 statistics strategy or else one should be developed as part of the intervention \u2013 see section C.7.1 Strategy The statistics strategy (e.g. NSDS) on which the intervention is \u2022 based must link to the national poverty reduction strategy / national development plan The statistics that are expected to result from the action must be \u2022 defined by their use: the policies to be prepared / monitored / evaluated There needs to be a clear analysis through the logframe that shows \u2022 how the problems diagnosed will be addressed by the planned activities \u2013 see section C.6.2 and chapter C.8 As well as ensuring clear links with the development objectives of \u2022 the partner countries, national statistics institutes should provide the lead at the formulation stage. Design The level of disaggregation of statistics required (e.g. geographic \u2022 localisation, gender-specific statistics) should be determined by the policy objectives and needs to be specified in general terms as an output. This is not a technical issue. Support for the use of statistics needs to be incorporated into \u2022 statistics actions and its implementation monitored. Establishing a permanent exchange of data between partner \u2022 countries and Eurostat (perhaps based on a Memorandum of Understanding on data exchange, such as Eurostat has agreed with Mediterranean countries) permits partner country data to be published via Eurostat\u2019s free dissemination database and so increases the user base.

Projects in preparation had begun to include the advocacy \u2022 dimension. C.7.4.2. Support to the whole statistical system at national level A strategic approach to statistics redevelopment aims to support a locally owned and led programme to develop a country\u2019s NSS in a comprehensive and co-ordinated way, typically centred on implementing a national strategy for the development of statistics (NSDS or similar) and moving towards use of country systems and procedures for implementation. The preparation of a statistical strategy that covers at least the main parts of NSS provides a framework within which support can be provided to deliver co-ordinated financial and technical assistance. Key components of the system-wide approach are: A clear nationally owned policy, strategy and programme \u2022 for official statistics A medium-term expenditure framework that reflects the \u2022 long-term strategy Systematic arrangements for programming resources \u2022 A performance monitoring system that measures progress \u2022 and strengthens accountability Broad consultation mechanisms that involve all \u2022 stakeholders, including mechanisms for dialogue and coordination across the national statistical system Host government-led processes for donor co-ordination \u2022 and dialogue An agreed process for moving towards harmonisation \u2022 of procedures for budgeting, financial management, procurement, and monitoring and evaluation. The policy objective of these interventions is often related to governance. Activities include but are not confined to statistical capacity building (introduced in section C.6.2), including: revision of statistical legislation, \u2022 relations with political level \u2022 statistical infrastructure, \u2022 organisation of the NSS, notably co-ordination of \u2022 methodologies and establishing a distribution of responsibilities management of the NSI \u2022 direct support to statistics production and dissemination \u2022 can be included. This approach responds to beneficiaries\u2019 need for support in management and coordination of the statistical system as a whole. In order to ensure sustained political level support and provide a complete diagnosis of the system problems, a statistics strategy such as a National Strategy for the Development of Statistics (section C.6.1.2) should exist. The 2006 Evaluation of the Commission support for statistics in third countries observed that system-level problems with statistics had rarely been addressed by European Commission statistical co-operation. Well developed statistics strategies should address this observation. Examples of European Commission support to the whole statistical system are: Angola Institutional support to INS Angola (10 ACP \u2022 ANG) Burkina Faso.

Past European Commission projects have often omitted this. The national statistics strategy evaluates this issue. There is a need to improve coordination and exchange of \u2022 information between producers of statistics across the National Statistics System and between national and regional institutions Dissemination and promotion of statistical information needs to \u2022 be addressed at the design stage by system-wide actions.

(9 ACP BU 13) C.7.4.4 Sector statistics support at national level Sector statistics interventions aim to ensure that statistical information is available for preparing, monitoring and evaluating sector policies. While there can be a focus on ensuring that indicators for sector budget support are available, it is important that the statistics intervention is viewed as producing data for national use according to national priorities. Sector statistics interventions are often mounted as relatively small parts of sector-wide programmes. Statistics-related interventions have been identified in agriculture and education. Other sectors where statistics components can be found include health, external trade and fisheries. Identification of relatively small but important statistics components of major sector programmes can be difficult. Sector statistics will be addressed in greater depth in Part D: Statistics for Policy Issues. Examples are: Swaziland \u2013 Support to education and training: Education \u2022 management and coordination. Support the development of planning and management structures.

In principle, these relations should be addressed by the statistical strategy. Administrative information can be held within ministries, \u2022 institutions (schools, hospitals) or other organisations (e.g. private aid bodies). Access to this data and possible support for its improvement may need to be addressed at the decision-making level. Box 7.6: Action points for sector level interventions to avoid duplicate surveys Duplicate surveys are two or more surveys in the same sector or \u2022 policy field that are not coordinated in time and ask similar (but usually not the same) questions and are separately organised. Consequently they produce differently classified data, most commonly on different geographic classifications. The resulting data is usually not comparable or only comparable to a limited extent. Duplicate surveys can arise as a result of demands by donors \u2022 for data that has defined characteristics or, at worst, must be produced by a specified survey. Most donors in statistics have made undertakings that should permit elimination of these practices (section C.6.3). Duplicate surveys that have external funding can be a means for \u2022 statistics producers to support the incomes of their staff where core wages are insufficient (see Box 5.3). Duplicate surveys can only be eliminated definitively when both \u2022 underlying conditions are removed. Survey seeking behaviour by statistics producers can be reduced \u2022 by ensuring that the statistics system\u2019s finances do not depend on donor-supported surveys and that remuneration is comparable between statistical staff of similar grades whether they participate or not in surveys.

        "C 142 The European Commission\u2019s Support to Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 C.7.4.5. Strengthening regional statistics Regional integration requires comparable statistics to inform common regional policies. The regional statistical capacity approach was recognised by the 2006 Evaluation as resulting in \u2018economies of scale and good results in terms of harmonisation, comparability and exchange of methods and data.\u2019 The European Commission has supported regional statistical capacity for regional integration in the TACIS and MEDA programmes and in the ECOWAS, UEMOA, CEMAC, COMESA, EAC, SADC, PALOP, CARICOM, MERCOSUR, Andean Community regions and ASEAN. Informing regional policies to encourage free trade areas and customs unions led to support for statistics interventions in international trade . Economies of scale and an interest in developing the use of common statistical concepts led to support for statistical training at regional level. These areas, as well as national accounts , where the adoption of common concepts is also important, have been consistent areas of European Commission regional statistics interventions. As regional policy interests widen, such as transport networks, increasing interest at regional level in the Millennium Development Goals and their indicators and the need for multilateral surveillance data for monetary unions, so the range of regional statistics actions has broadened. Nevertheless, the focus remains on economic statistics such as external trade, price indices and national accounts. Common regional statistics actions have often been based around development and implementation of common statistics tools: Eurotrace for international merchandise trade, Eretes for national accounts. The emphasis is now placed on production and dissemination of the statistics concerned. Statistics related training is closely related to capacity building, so section C.6.2 is relevant. Section C.8.5 will deal more specifically with training activities. Examples of regional statistics-related projects are: SADC: Regional statistical training project. Expected \u2022 results include: a Regional Statistical Training Strategy (RSTS) and development of national training strategies; improved regional training capacity to support the training strategies. 8 ACP RAU 5.

Its purpose is to increase SADC institutions\u2019 capacities to drive and coordinate the regional integration agenda, notably through the development of direct financial support (using SADC\u2019s own procedures) as the main mechanism for SADC-ICP development cooperation, e.g. through an EU-SADC Contribution Agreement.

The project was initially planned to end in 12/2005. Following Mid-Term Review in late 2003, project implementation was extended to end-2007 without additional cost. At this time, the project logical (planning) framework was adjusted to reflect a lower project budget and address the training needs of the producers and users of statistics more coherently. Following a financial review in June 2007, the European Commission contribution was reduced to \u20ac3.85mn to reflect the late project start. The project was managed by the SADC Secretariat and co-ordinated by a Regional Steering Committee of representatives from SADC Member States and the SADC Secretariat, with the European Commission as an observer.

How to manage statistics actions The chapter in brief The chapter starts at the point when the decision has been taken that a European Commission statistics intervention is justified in order to achieve the goals agreed with its development partners. This chapter presents guidance on how to prepare the various types of projects/ programmes to support statistics capacity building and major statistical projects. It provides practical advice for preparing and evaluating terms of reference at each stage of project/programme preparation: key points for terms of reference are included in this chapter. The presentation is based on EuropeAid standard procedural documents. Section C.7.2, \u2018Matching outputs to objectives: the logical framework of a statistics action\u2019, provides the overview for this chapter and the linkage to earlier material. It also provides the starting-point for this chapter: the expected results (specific output) of the programme or project have been determined in general terms. C.8.1. Identification / Pre-feasibility The background for this section is the situation in which: Absent or poor quality statistics have been identified as be a \u2022 significant constraint to achieving policy goals because they do not permit policy measures to be adequately prepared, monitored and evaluated. The goal of overcoming this constraint has normally been incorporated in the strategy and programming documents (section C.7.1) The purpose of intervention has therefore been outlined in \u2022 these documents (see section C.7.1 and section C.7.2) The key outputs of a statistics identification or pre-feasibility study are: The intervention\u2019s specific objectives are fully defined: what \u2022 results are needed to achieve the purpose laid out in the strategy and programming documents. Section C.7. \u03bf 2 discussed the three types of specific objectives common to all European Commission statistics interventions: improvement in statistics production, development of statistical capacity and improvement in the use made of statistics. One or more of these objectives might be relevant. Alternatives for the operational objectives to be \u03bf delivered by the project / programme are discussed, with a preferred option identified. Section C.7.2 discussed the six common output types at operational objectives level. A first view of the activities to be undertaken \u2022 Analysis of the linkages between the activities, operational \u2022 objectives, the expected results and the project purpose. This is particularly important for capacity building projects, where the achievement of planned outputs may or may not lead to the expected results. Examination of the risks and uncertainties, together \u03bf with the strategy proposed and assumptions made.

        "C 148 How to Manage Statistics Actions Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Box 8.1: Terms of reference checklist for a statistics identification or pre-feasibility study This box applies the DG EuropeAid documents Standard Terms of Reference for Programme/Project Identification Studies and Standard Terms of Reference for Programme / Project pre-Feasibility Studies to a statistics based action. This box provides information both on preparing study terms of reference and on response evaluation. It is intended to be applied not only in traditional programmes / projects but also in sector-wide programmes, contribution agreements and in actions related to budget support. 1. Study Background Terms of Reference should contain: A description of the role of the (focal or non-focal) sectors concerned in the overall programme and the anticipated use of the statistical \u2022 information that motivates the intervention. The discussion should reflect the context of \u2018Managing for Development Results\u2019 ( \u2022 section B.1.3) and any statistical strategy document such as an NSDS that the preparer is aware of (section C.6.1) Political sensitivities that can have statistical implications should be outlined: e.g. a requirement to collect data in each region, even if this is not \u2022 justified by the technical analysis Any required institutional framework for the intervention should be specified. \u2022 The likely administrative framework (e.g. budget support, contribution agreement, classic project) should be specified and the administrative \u2022 interlocutors identified. 2. Study Objective The study objective is to show how best to respond to the need for statistical information expressed in the strategy and programming documents and any statistical strategy document. The technical proposal should therefore contain: Decision criteria in terms of relevance, sustainability and feasibility for whether the preferred option should be accepted. \u2022 Technical alternatives: the study should evaluate alternatives by referring to how the data will be used. \u2022 In some large scale surveys, the final choice of technical alternatives is preferably left to the feasibility / formulation stage, when a sampling \u2022 expert can be used to define efficient means of achieving the technical objectives. Capacity building alternatives: the evaluation should consider the impact of different approaches on the sustainability of statistics production \u2022 and dissemination; it should also consider the relevance and likely effectiveness of the capacity building measures. Frequency and means of technical reporting and monitoring. This is especially important for contribution agreements and actions undertaken \u2022 within a budget support framework, as the absence of a specified reporting mechanism can leave the intervention without an effective means of reporting and monitoring. 3. Issues to be studied The technical proposal should show how the following issues will be assessed and should identify associated risks and assumptions: Confirmation of intervention coherence with strategy / planning documents agreed with European Commission and with any statistical \u2022 strategy, such as an NSDS (section C.6.1) A statistics intervention is relevant if the results \u2013 the improved statistics, capacity built and / or users more appreciative of statistics - are likely \u2022 to inform policy decisions in the sectors concerned. Rejection of a proposed intervention is most likely to relate to lack of statistical sustainability. Sustainability issues and whether they can be \u2022 addressed by the intervention need to be assessed especially in the evaluation of the counterpart institution. Typical issues are a mismatch between the counterpart\u2019s technical attainment and working methods that are required by the counterpart; statistics confidentiality, where this cannot be improved through capacity building; or when the minimum resources required for the sustainability of statistics operations are not expected to be maintained. Technical alternatives: the technical choices (where they exist) often concern the degree of adherence to international standards and/or how far \u2022 the statistics can be disaggregated. In both cases, the choices made will influence both costs and the possible uses of the data. Capacity alternatives: even in an intervention that aims primarily at improving the coverage and quality of statistical information, there are \u2022 alternative levels of associated capacity building. How much capacity is built and how effectively it is built can affect sustainability. 4. Methodology The proposal methodology should ensure that sufficient information is available to make the above decisions. The Assessment of the National Statistical System, section C.5.4, provides a system-wide checklist to assess what is lacking and what is required in order to produce quality statistics. This can be focused on specific sectors where appropriate: Technical aspects of statistics production (methodology, organisation, data processing tools and procedures, work schedule, technical and \u2022 human resources). Capacity building: examine links between actions and results \u2022 If the technical formulation of the project has been drawn: detect the possible unsolved technical problems. Otherwise, a thorough technical \u2022 study must be envisaged within the formulation study. Analysis of the overall budget, of the envisaged mechanisms of co-ordination and management. \u2022 ",

The project\u2019s intended partners should play a fundamental role at this step. A design study may be at the core of the work performed at this step.

Issues to be studied Analyse the coherence of the proposed project with the CSP/NIP (or RSP/RIP) priorities and the development policy of the partner. Analyse the future project stakeholders, their motivation, institutional power, relationships, internal structure and management ability. The stakeholders may include: the Ministry in charge of the National Statistical Institute, the Statistics Council, the National Statistical Institute and other producers of statistics, possibly a regional institution. In the course of the study, the degree of co-operation and co-ordination between the National Statistical System stakeholders must be accurately evaluated. If a project aims to support sectoral statistics, the relations between the statistical service in charge of producing the sectoral information and the institutional stakeholders concerned should also be analysed. In addition data users (institutional, private as well as general public) should be taken into account. Analysis of the stakeholders institutional abilities: The users: who are they? What do they think of the available data? What is their image of the NSS/NSI? How do they express their requests? What \u2022 are their relations with the NSS?

        "C 151 How to Manage Statistics Actions Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Identify the in-progress or past supports to statistics within the domain or in related domains; experiences drawn from these supports. Check the coherence with other in-progress or planned supports Check the absorption capacities: due to the implementation of poverty reduction policies, NSSs have been increasingly demanded by donors to set up various surveys. Coordination of these actions is sometimes difficult, because NSIs from less-developed countries have limited methodological and technical means for achieving co-ordination. Specific structures are often built, to the detriment of global co-ordination and point out the problem of the sustainability of these actions. A weak capitalization has been noticed despite the support offered over the last 10 years. Define in a detailed way the global objectives, the specific objectives, the results and the activities. Draw up the logical framework matrix. The implementation of a NSDS is a priority for the development of statistical abilities. Describe the monitoring system of the project: in case of a regional project, the system used for the follow-up of local level activities must be very well described. The monitoring system should be as integrated as possible into the key partner\u2018s own monitoring system. For participation to large- scale projects, the monitoring system will have to be fully integrated into the project\u2019s own system. Identify assumptions and risks. In statistical projects, assumptions and risks often relate to the following matters: Delays in the implementation of the legal and regulatory framework needed for the statistical activity (especially in the revision of the NSI \u2022 statutes) Delays in the survey implementation, in particular for censuses. \u2022 Delays in the provision of national resources (budgetary and/or technical resources). \u2022 Availability and stability of the national statistical teams. \u2022 Perpetuation of the project results. This matter must be thoroughly analysed when, at the end of the project, the involved NSI/services have to \u2022 periodically reproduce the tasks, for example, data collection or publications. Role of the technical assistance at the implementation stage and terms of reference for consultants. The technical assistance usually intervenes \u2022 at two steps in the statistical co-operation projects: To transfer competences towards beneficiary institution teams: implementation of new methodologies (SNA93, internet, GIS, survey \u03bf methods, harmonization with international or regional standards), audit of existing measures and proposals for improvement. More and more often, this support can be brought through a South-South co-operation, but it must not be realized to the detriment of the country or institution providing expertise. To provide the beneficiary institution with additional human resources for the achievement of some activities within the project. This \u03bf mechanism, which is similar to subcontracting, may be very useful to consolidate local teams\u2019 abilities or to face additional workload resulting from the implementation of new mechanisms. This must however be conceived in a framework of ownership and sustainability. Methodology In the statistical domain, the methodology section should always plan: Meetings with users: public institutions, international organisations, trade organisations and major actors in the domain in case of a sectoral project, non-trading companies (political representation, press, NGO). It would be better that these meetings are held with the participation of the key stakeholder in the project. Examination of the last National Statistical System publications (in paper and internet version). When the study is completed, discuss the proposal of project with the partners. This allows to collect concrete feedbacks and to supplement the information relating to the project ownership and risks.

Start-up phase Several months (even years) may pass between the collection of information on the field during the formulation phase and the project\u2019s effective start-up. Meanwhile, the project background may have been modified by certain events or operations. The information must be updated in the start-up phase and potential impacts on the project must be evaluated. If need be, adaptation measures should be taken. The updating process should include all effective changes regarding: Global statistical capacity building: Legal framework of the statistical activity, \u2022 Work on a National Strategy for the Development of \u2022 Statistics, Organisation and functioning of the National Statistical \u2022 System and National Statistical Institute; functioning of the services producing statistics elsewhere. National Statistical Council planned or implemented. \u2022 Sector support to statistics: List of statistical data collection operations planned in \u2022 the sector. Such a list may impact the methodology, the collection operations as well as the data processing. Other supporting statistical projects related to the sector, \u2022 started or planned. At the end of the start-up phase, the list of activities relating to the project should be updated as well as the work plan. Terms of reference of potential technical advice may be reviewed and complemented. C.8.3.2. Implementation phase The project team should pay close attention to the timeliness of project results. In statistical capacity building actions, timeliness is not only dependent on planned actions (training, programmes, procedures and tools); timeliness often depends on decisions to be taken or legal acts to be introduced by the beneficiaries. This includes e.g. the official announcement of a census date. The progress in making such decisions (legislation, regulation, budget, staff, other means) has to be carefully monitored. In particular the monitoring must include the funding mechanism. Indeed, starting up certain tasks requires corresponding financial means to be made available. Large operations often depend on joint financing or on national budget participation. This could be the case of interviewers training, printing of questionnaires, interviewers\u2019 and controllers\u2019 fieldwork. On-time funding can be crucial . The late start-up of certain tasks may deeply impact survey results. For example, the choice of the observation period of household expenses depends on civil and religious holidays; the choice of the observation period for harvesting depends on the agricultural cycle. As a consequence, any delay in finalising tasks previous to fieldwork may deeply impact the quality of information . Statistical operations such as surveys or censuses are heavy operations. They involve a number of tasks and require big teams (thousands of people may be mobilized). Stringent planning and close monitoring are requested . The rules of monitoring, set up during the start-up phase, are an important factor in the operation\u2019s achievement. All of the operation\u2019s partners and stakeholders should be kept informed. The data processing and results analysis phases depend on few people in comparison with the operations of field data- collection. Although reaching the end of the operation, these phases should be subjected to the greatest attention by the staff concerned. A statistical operation is not closed until all results have been disseminated and analysed . It happens too often that only a small part of the survey is really utilized or that a late use makes the information irrelevant\u2026 C.8.3.3. Final phase The final phase is essential because it regards the ownership of project results. In any kind of statistical project, this phase must include the preparation of the final report and the archiving of all information . The importance of CD- Rom/DVD archiving should be borne in mind, especially in the case of surveys as, due to their costs, they involve heavy investment. The comparison with older data is of high importance in analysing a survey and in interpreting its results\u2026 as far as these data are available! For projects involving the setting-up of periodical operations of data collection, the transfer of ownership of the new system to the national team which will become in charge of the future operations is a very important phase. The future team manager\u2019s participation in the project will pave the way to successful ownership. Such a transfer should be planned in the same way as a service transfer and should include: Transfer of \u2022 documentation on the methodology of the survey (design, questionnaire, fieldwork organisation) and on teams training; Transfer of \u2022 information technology processing and dissemination tools: programmes, documentation and training; Transfer of the \u2022 data and metadata that have been collected or produced (as well as archived) during the course of the project; Transfer of \u2022 survey report with, if need be, a section devoted to data quality. This transfer is particularly important for the sustainability \u2022 of the project. ",

A Guide to the Evaluation procedures and structures currently operational in the Commission\u2019s external cooperation programmes. 28 \u2019 Evaluation aims at an as impartial as possible appraisal. It either takes place during the implementation (mid-term) or at the end of the operation (ex post). The evaluation provides an opportunity to learn lessons from the support provided by the European Union. The mid-term evaluation of statistical projects (or programmes with a statistical component) will be carried out if lessons learnt from the first implementation phase could lead to abridging, re-directing or otherwise amending the activity programme. Such an evaluation should be carried out in any of the following cases: the implementation is taking a long time (more than two \u2022 years); 28 EuropeAid Office. Evaluation Unit March 2001. numerous and complex activities have to be carried out \u2022 in the frame of the projects or programmes (population census; wide-scope surveys, surveys requiring large samples);projects or programmes presenting innovation in the methodology, the data collection methods or even the processing or dissemination phases. In this case, a pilot- study is usually conducted for testing. It is appropriate to make an assessment just after the pilot-study; projects or programmes largely depending on decisions \u2022 to be made or actions to be undertaken by the partner country. Ex-post evaluations are really worth their costs: when the European Union\u2019s support follows a medium- \u2022 term approach; when the support to statistics is provided as part of a more \u2022 global sector support; when the socioeconomic context is radically changing. \u2022 The lessons learnt can greatly enhance the efficiency of the support to statistics. As for any European Commission project, the assessment criteria used are relevance, performance, efficiency, impact and sustainability. Within each criterion, specificities of statistics which have to be carefully observed are the following: Evaluation criteria for statistical projects Relevance Do the project objectives aim at solving the problems identified in the provision of statistical information for the definition and monitoring of development (maybe sector) policies? Are they consistent with the NSDS? Has the analysis of the beneficiaries (within and outside the NSS) been correct in the light of the implementation? The analysis of intra-beneficiary relations and of the institutional context will be verified in a similar way. The risks might be re-assessed. Effectiveness Mid-term assessment: do the means committed fit with the effective results? Are the means that have been committed (by the project and by the beneficiaries) comparable to those used in past similar operations (surveys having resulted in similar data or regarding similar domains) To which extent have the stakeholders committed to the monitoring process? How far have they committed to integrating this process in the current process of the implementing institution? Did the project enable the institution to improve in this domain? Efficiency Sectoral statistics: are the expected data available? Are they good quality (or has the quality improved?) following the criteria of statistical quality. Global statistical capacity building: to what extent have the results helped to implement the NSDS? Impact Sectoral statistics: what is the appraisal of the sector managers on the project impact? Global statistical capacity building: how deeply did the project impact the rest of the NSS works? Sustainability Sectoral statistics: do the ownership of the project results and the beneficiary service resources enable future data production on a periodical basis? Global statistical capacity building: are the results sustainable in terms of NSS human, technical and financial inputs (budget, software and hardware, staff considering the expected turnover)? ",

Relevance: Has the implementation of the project confirmed the initial analysis undertaken in the pre-feasibility and formulation stages? \u03bf Has the project brought an answer to the true needs? \u03bf Had the problems underlying the statistical support been correctly identified during their analysis and do they still reveal to be the true \u03bf problems? If not, did the project adapt in order to answer to the true problems and needs? Has the logical framework been coherent and complete? \u03bf Efficiency: Have the different activities attained the objectives, at the expected quality and cost levels and according to the initial time schedule? The \u03bf following issues should be checked: daily monitoring, cost and price to quality ratio, stakeholders\u2019 contribution, technical assistance and monitoring. Effectiveness: How have the results allowed reaching the specific objectives of the project? \u03bf Global statistical capacity building: has the behaviour of the NSS vis-\u00e0-vis users and data diffusion changed? Has cooperation inside the NSS \u03bf developed concretely? Has the operating system of the NSS changed? Have these changes brought the expected improvements? Sectoral statistical support: are the responsible (Partners, Delegations) of the sectoral Development programmes satisfied with the statistical \u03bf data provided: coverage of the field of observation, quality of the data? Had the risks been correctly assessed, in particular regarding the adoption of the different regulations, the operating mode of the key \u03bf partner, the staff\u2019s mobilisation? Impact: To what extent has the progress in statistics achieved by the project contributed to improve and develop the \u201cmanagement for results\u201d? Has \u03bf the follow-up of poverty reduction policies been reinforced consequently? Sustainability: Have the positive effects of the projects been extended beyond the project? \u03bf Have the stakeholders been kept mobilised around the objectives of the project all over its duration? \u03bf Will the authorities respect their decisions vis-\u00e0-vis the development of statistical capacities? For example the commitments undertaken in \u03bf the framework of the NSDS or pertaining to the change in National Statistical Institute\u2019s statutes. Will the organisation providing sectoral data be able to carry on the production of new data with the same level of quality? \u03bf Computing science playing an important role in statistics, have the technological choices made during the project been relevant? Will the \u03bf tools be maintained? Coherence: I \u03bf s the project, in the end, still coherent with the development priorities of the partner, the CSP and with the support of other partners? Supports occurred in the course of the project but not formerly identified should not be omitted. Value added of the Community: To what extent can the contribution of the Community be compared to a similar contribution that would have been provided by one of the \u03bf Member States of the European Union? Required expertise For this type of mission, it is necessary to combine a double expertise in evaluation and in statistics, completed by a good knowledge of the administrative environment of the countries in the area.

        "C 155 How to Manage Statistics Actions Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 C.8.5. Support in strategy and management Section C.5.3 has tried to demonstrate that support to statistics cannot be reduced to support in statistical methodology but must be complemented by a support in statistical strategy and management. The \u2018 Evaluation of the Commission support for statistics in third countries \u2019 (2007) also noted that: \u201cNeither the coherence of national statistical systems nor the need for efficient \u201cstatistical coordination\u201d was systematically taken into consideration\u201d \u201cNo statistics projects or programmes really addressed the design and functioning of the statistical system as a central coherent element of public administration; this resulted in more limited impact on the statistical systems as a whole\u201d \u201cResponses that focused only on specific indicators created a risk of fragmentation of the statistical system.\u201d More recent projects (see, for example, support to Burkina Faso National Statistical Institute in section C.7.2) correct these drawbacks and introduce elements aiming at: improving centralised statistical coordination, \u2022 transforming the NSI into a more autonomous public \u2022 administrative body, providing tools for: \u2022 the programming of activities, \u03bf the management of financial resources \u03bf the development of human resources. \u03bf providing resources in parallel to the statistical services of \u2022 line ministries, in particular the ministries responsible for social affairs, health and education, given their importance in the Poverty Reduction Strategy. Successfully completing such new objectives requires \u2022 non- statistical types of support including potential technical advice in: legislation, \u03bf public administration, \u03bf budget and external funds management, \u03bf marketing, \u03bf strategic planning, \u03bf human resource management, \u03bf staff training, \u03bf communication, \u03bf foreign languages, \u03bf etc. \u03bf It should be noted that Afristat, at its geographical level has already organised seminars for Heads of NSIs in order to make them aware of solutions to these problems. Work with peers has been particularly appreciated and the regional approach can be recommended. Unfortunately, the turnover at the head of NSIs is very high and such high level training should be frequently undertaken. A global strategy has also been designed for fragile states and states emerging from critical situations such as crises or wars in order to take into account their specific situation. ",
        "C 156 How to Manage Statistics Actions Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Box 8.4: Strategies for fragile states and states emerging from critical situations such as crises or wars Statistical information needs are crucial not only for the definition, implementation and monitoring of consolidation programmes of fragile states, but also for the programmes of humanitarian aid and reconstruction in countries emerging from crisis and war situations. However, in these countries, valuable statistical information is rare or even missing altogether. In many fragile countries, administrative structures are failing for total lack of operating budget or lack of staff. The National Statistical System is unable to fulfil its mission and does not produce regular statistical information any more. Some statistical data may keep being produced, but presenting some drawbacks such as discontinuation of samples, partial geographical coverage due to low security in field work. Data collected often have little significance. Nevertheless, these operations have the merit of going on mobilising the few people who will be of great help once normal statistical work has been resumed. In such fragile countries , only surveys are able to respond, often only partially and in limited geographical areas, to the most important information needs regarding poverty. The implementation of light household surveys will enable the capture of household demographic characteristics, income and expenditure data, employment and unofficial activities. To conduct this work, existing teams within the NSS are called upon. An example of such an operation is the 1-2-3 survey conducted to estimate the impact of the non-observed economy in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2004-2005. In countries emerging from crisis and war situations , priority has to be given to promptly gather the minimum two types of statistical information that allows aid programmes to be defined: Information on the state of the population: large moves of population occur during these periods, sometimes leading to a decrease in some \u2022 age classes (emigration, deaths). Census data do not reflect the country\u2019s current situation any longer. Information on the conditions of the economic and social infrastructures: transport, public buildings and housing, industrial and commercial \u2022 infrastructures. In such cases, it is often impossible to design a heavy data collection campaign such as a census for both population and infrastructures, because any administrative structure capable of setting up such operations no longer exists and because this operation would take too much time. Therefore, a demographic survey on a sample of households is generally conducted, complemented by an assessment of the infrastructures on the sample of geographical units to which the selected households belong. Such operations face several technical difficulties. First, local teams have to be re-constituted to carry out fieldwork, data analysis and the dissemination of results. As far as possible, NSS-experienced staff is favoured. Secondly, it is necessary to build representative samples while the sample frames either no longer exist, or are completely archaic. This work is most commonly carried out within the framework of a project linked to the reconstruction programme. This approach was adopted after the end of the 1993 conflict in Lebanon. In both cases, the aim is to favour the re-launching of statistical activities as a preliminary to any reconstruction of statistical capacities . But this reconstruction should figure among the concerns of the general reconstruction programme or as a support for administrative capacities. After periods of war or crisis, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) are often the only organisations present in the country. They generally possess data stemming from their internal management that could be used as a basis for roughly estimating the population in their sphere of activity. Before launching any national statistical operation similar to those presented above, contact with the NGOs is essential. The information they may provide will be used in defining the surveyed sample. In the absence of local authorities, they could also relay the information about populations surveyed. In order to support the fragile states and states emerging from critical situations such as crises or wars, , Eurostat has prepared the handbook \u201c Essential SNA: building the basics \u201d. The handbook is particularly relevant for Least Developed Countries and micro-states to produce the most essential tables for a \u201cminimal\u201d \u2022 implementation of SNA. The handbook includes best practice for analysis of basic data to ease the start-up phase of NSIs facing the challenge of producing NA data in \u2022 accordance with a SNA for the first time. The handbook will be based on and fully compatible with Volume I and II of SNA 2008 An important effort still needs to be made in advocacy for the use of statistics in decision-making, which, according to the above cited evaluation report \u201cmay have constituted a major missing link between results and outcomes.\u201d Poor dialogue with national data users remains a characteristic of a number of National Statistical Systems of developing countries and improvement of this dialogue should be included in any strategic plan of development of statistics, for example by complementing the training of statisticians (data producers) by a training of the users. On these issues, PARIS21 has already organised several international meetings and developed advocacy material that can be very helpful. ",

Regional and sub-regional (multi-country) projects C.8.6.1. Multi-country projects In development co-operation, the terms \u2018region\u2019 and \u2018sub-region\u2019 correspond to classifications based on geographical terms. These classifications are defined and used by international organisations for geographical areas comprising a large number of countries. For example, the United Nations defines five macro geographical regions (Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe and Oceania) and twenty- one geographical sub-regions. The World Bank defines six regions (Sub-Saharan Africa, Europe and Central Asia, the Middle East and North Africa, South Asia, East Asia and the Pacific and Latin America and the Caribbean). The terms \u2018region\u2019 or \u2018sub-region\u2019 can also correspond to political entities, such as a group of countries, linked by economic or other type of common interest, which decides to start a regional integration process or a regional partnership. The regional integration process can be formalised as a regional organisation, which scope of competence and organisation is defined by its mandate (e.g. ECOWAS, the Economic Community of West African States). To avoid confusion one should bear in mind that, in contrast, \u2018regional\u2019 in national official statistics normally refers to sub- national areas (e.g. decentralised territorial units, provinces, states). For more information on \u2018regional and small area statistics\u2019 in the statistical sense, see chapter D.18. Eurostat is the statistical office of the European Union. It provides high quality statistics at European level that enable comparisons between countries and regions. Eurostat supplies statistics to define, implement and analyse European policies, as required by the European Commission and other European institutions. Other key users are governments, businesses, the education sector, journalists and the public (see Box 2.5). Eurostat does not collect data; this is done by the statistical authorities in the Member States. They verify and analyse national data and send them to Eurostat. Eurostat\u2019s role is to consolidate the data and ensure they are comparable, using harmonized methodology. The European Statistical System (ESS) is the partnership between Eurostat and the national statistical institutes and other national authorities responsible for development, production and dissemination of European statistics. It was built up gradually with the objective of providing comparable statistics at EU level. The ESS functions as a network in which Eurostat\u2019s role is to lead the way in the harmonization of statistics in close cooperation with the national statistical authorities. Quality considerations play a central role to Eurostat and its statistical operations. The European Statistics Code of Practice (see Box 2.2) sets the standard for developing, producing and disseminating European statistics. It builds upon a common ESS definition of quality in statistics and targets all relevant areas from the institutional environment, the statistical production processes to the output: European official statistics. The European Consensus on Development (2006/C 46/01) recognises the \u201cparticular role and comparative advantages of the [European Commission]: \u201c[\u2026] Drawing on its own experiences, and exclusive competence in trade, the [European Commission] has a comparative advantage in providing support to partner countries to integrate trade into national development strategies and to support regional cooperation whenever possible. \u201d The increasing regional dimension of European Union statistical projects over the past decades has been highlighted by the \u2018 Evaluation of the Commission Support for Statistics in Third Countries \u2019 (2007). Statistical projects at regional level may: support a policy aiming at regional integration (ex: UEMOA \u2022 - project PARSTAT; ECOWAS - project ECOSTAT; COMESA - external trade statistics; MERCOSUR, Andean Community), meet the political needs of a regional organisation (ex: \u2022 CILSS - project DIAPER), provide support in the context of regional partnership \u2022 agreements (ex: MEDSTAT, the statistical component of the MEDA programme launched after signature of the Barcelona Declaration in 1995), or support statistical schools and training centres. \u2022 The \u2018Evaluation\u2019 considered that \u2018 the projects aimed at strengthening regional integration yielded very good results in policy areas where there was good ownership by the regional institution and the member states (e.g. indicators for multilateral surveillance in the UEMOA); in other areas the results were not as good (e.g. data on external trade in the same region) .\u2019 The \u2018Evaluation\u2019 pointed to two factors that were important for the success of regional programmes: the existence of a regional institution serving as a link between the donor and the member countries of the region; and the institutional and technical strengths of the member countries\u2019 NSIs. To strengthen the links between the positive results of statistical programmes and projects and the development of evidence-based decision-making, the \u2018Evaluation\u2019 recommended that the regional approach should be continued and enhanced (Recommendation R4). However, the design of regional statistical interventions should be better adapted to the institutional framework of the partner region. In order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of statistical programmes and projects, better use should be made of the competences and means of regional and sub- ",
        "C 158 How to Manage Statistics Actions Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 regional organizations with statistical responsibilities. These have a better knowledge of local situations and capacities, thus their responsibilities in the design and implementation of statistical projects should be increased. Where possible, contribution agreements should be used (Recommendation R11). There is no specific methodology developed to manage the cycle of regional statistical co-operation projects. Throughout the project cycle, however, matters deriving from their regional dimension have to be taken into account: the mandate of the institution, the capacity of the institution to animate a network of national and international stakeholders, the possible existence of a strategy for statistics at regional or at continental level, the expected level of integration and the related statistics needed. The European Commission\u2019s Communication COM(2008) 604 \u201c Regional integration for development in ACP countries \u201d proposes an approach for EU support to regional integration for ACP development. This support is founded on the basic principles of the Cotonou Partnership Agreement: ownership, dialogue and sustainable development. Accordingly, the EU respects the choices made by its partners on the objectives, design, speed and focus of their integration processes. Obviously, these principles apply also to statistical programmes and projects. The proposed approach addresses the challenges of lack of ownership and institutional capacities at regional and national level; the need to overcome the fragmentation of regional markets and to better implement economic integration agreements; insufficient economic diversification; inefficient infrastructure interconnections; and the need for more effective regional policies to address common challenges in support of sustainability. As a response to these challenges, the European Commission\u2019s Communication COM(2008) 604 proposes that the EU commits to support the priorities: Strengthening regional institutions \u2022 Building regional integrated markets \u2022 Supporting business development \u2022 Connecting regional infrastructure networks \u2022 Developing regional policies for sustainable development \u2022 In order to better leverage the increased support, COM(2008) 604 adds that EU activities at programme and project level should become more strategic through: Gradually moving to a programme- (rather than project-) \u2022 based approach. Actively promote joint delivery methods; co-financing, \u2022 delegated co-operation, pool funds. Regionally-established funds to support regional \u2022 integration. Prioritising projects of a truly regional dimension, ensuring \u2022 that projects and activities support regional priorities and aim at the highest possible returns on regional growth. Strengthening the \u201cregional dimension\u201d by including the \u2022 regional dimension in projects supported at national level. Paying special attention to accountability and capacity \u2022 for effective implementation, with regional organisations empowered by their member states to ensure sound financial management funds. Furthermore, paying attention to the removal of absorption capacity weaknesses of regional organisations and to donors\u2019 capacity to monitor delivery. In addition, subsidiarity is a key guiding concept. It is in the interest of all partners involved to deal with issues at the level that will maximise the efficiency and effectiveness of the activities. This is also vital to strengthen the feeling of ownership amongst decision-makers at both regional and national level and strengthening their commitment to the statistical programmes and projects. It is also important with respect to alignment of the statistical programmes and projects with both regional and national development priorities. However, strong co-ordination and monitoring is crucial to assure that efficiency and effectiveness are realised. In its final report \u2018 Coordination of statistical capacity building programs at the sub-regional level \u2019, the CCSA Task Team on Co-ordination at the Sub-regional Level argued that Regional Strategies for the Development of Statistics (RSDS) at the sub-regional level should be the basis for co-ordinating donor assistance and for ensuring that development assistance is well targeted. The RSDS should be based on the NSDSs in place, on general regional development strategies and on a detailed assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the regional statistical system. C.8.6.2. Regional organisations with a statistical mission or component The motivation and role of regional organisations with respect to development of statistics were presented in section B.2.4.2. That section also lists a number of regional (and sub- regional) organisations with statistical activities (see Box 2.11). Often, strengthening regional trade and/or economic development is the core objective of regional and sub- regional organisations. To monitor the economic and trade development in the region and evaluate the impact of regional policies, statistics covering all member states of the organisation is required. This requires that comparable data is available from each member state within reasonable timeframes. The departments or staff responsible for statistics in regional organisations therefore need effective communication of data from the NSIs of their member states, as well as access to international statistical databases. ",
        "C 159 How to Manage Statistics Actions Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 The organisation of regional entities varies, depending on their nature, purpose, context, coordination needs and administrative traditions of the region. The regional organisation may establish a secretariat to monitor and promote regional integration and the specific objectives and policies of the organisation, but may also take on other organisational forms. In some organisations, agents dealing with statistics are parts of a broader organisational unit, such as a unit dealing with macro-economic analysis or multilateral surveillance. In other organisations, there is a dedicated statistics unit. For example, it is quite recent that African regional integration organisations restructured in order to have a unit or a division to deal with statistics. The statistics function of regional organisations, whether a separate department or part of larger units, is generally charged with delivering improved, comparable statistics for regional decision making. A vital role is to advise policy makers on interpreting statistics relevant to regional policies, thus supporting evidence based decision making. To fulfil this role, the statistical agents or units need to develop comparable statistical data that are needed to shape and monitor regional policies. Therefore, they promote and support the implementation of common standards in the member states, e.g. common classifications, methodologies and quality systems (see section C.8.6.3). Regional level data series and indicators compiled by the statistical agents or units of regional organisations are typically generated on the basis of data reported by the national statistical systems of their member states. Key factors for the overall quality of the regional data and indicators are the comparability of data from the different member states, the consistency of data from individual member states, the efficiency and timeliness of reporting to the regional organisation and the quality of the national data reported. Afristat, presented in Box 2.12, is an example of a regional body with an exclusively statistical purpose. An example of the statistical functions of a regional organisation is presented in Box 2.13. For development partners involved in providing support to statistics at the regional level, capacity building is likely to be a major concern, both for the statistics agents or units of the regional organisations as well as for the national statistical systems of the individual member states. In general, communication and co-ordination is essential, as both the regional and the national level are involved. The number of countries involved multiplies the number of stakeholders this second level. A good practice to improve co-ordination and involve national stakeholders in the regional process is to identify or designate national focal points. This generally improves communication and feedback and strengthens the member states\u2019 sense of ownership and involvement in the regional process. The regional organisations are also in a position to exploit regional economies of scale by working closely with the organisation\u2019s member states on common statistical needs. In particular, this concerns training of staff (see section C.8.7), building up IT infrastructure, databases and software (see section C.8.9), etc. When the number of professionals in each member state needing a specific training is small, it may be more efficient to organise such training sessions at regional level. This also has the added value of creating a forum for exchanging and discussing professional experiences and good practices across the member states. However, practical considerations and costs may be prohibitive. Alternatively, economies of scale may also be achieved through running the same training courses in individual member states or by setting up e-learning courses tailored to the needs of the member states\u2019 national statistical systems. Regional organisations are well situated to co-ordinate and set up training programmes to meet the needs of its member states. In particular, the regional organisations know the local situation and the specific needs of its member states; the better the co-ordination and the communication with the national statistical systems, e.g. trough national focal points or co-ordinators, the better the regional organisation can fulfil this role. Adoption of common statistical software also utilises economies of scale, both in software development, introduction, maintenance and training. The use of common software enables the development of local expertise and makes training and support more efficient. For example, for external trade statistics, the COMESA Secretariat provides training and technical support to Eurotrace installations in its member states and arranges regional training sessions on an annual basis. The COMESA Secretariat has also developed an e-learning solution for Eurotrace (see Box 8.8). The use of common software solutions in specific statistical areas generally also promotes the use of international and common regional standards, thus also improving the comparability of data across member states. C.8.6.3. Range of regional statistic projects Improving regional organisations\u2019 use of statistics in their policy formulation, analysis and evaluation is one of the key motivations and aims of regional projects (see also section B.2.4.2). Generally, regional and international organisations do not involve themselves in the collection of primary (or \u201csource\u201d) data, but rather on ensuring that their member states work in a coordinated manner towards commonly agreed goals. The aim is to provide data for the organisation\u2019s member states that are as comparable as possible, in order to provide stakeholders at all levels with information for viable analyses of regional development, comparisons of individual countries and a consistent evidence base for policy decisions and monitoring. These stakeholders include decision makers at regional level as well as on national level, donors, ",
        "C 160 How to Manage Statistics Actions Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 international organisations, NGOs, analysts and researchers, media and the general public. For regional organisations with a mission to strengthen regional economic integration, multilateral monitoring is an essential method to pursue the objectives of regional integration and the convergence of the economic policies of the member states. Reliable and comparable macro- economic indicators are a key tool to evaluate these processes in an objective way. In this context, the quality, comparability and timeliness of macro-economic statistics 30 are of high importance. They provide core information on the economic situation and development of countries, as well as on their economic structures. Furthermore, donor decisions on country resource allocation uses macro-economic statistics as key input (see section B.3.3.1); thus, the availability, reliability, comparability and timeliness of these macro-economic statistics are vital \u2013 and sensitive. This also applies to a number of social statistics, including the MDGs. The level of comparability of data from the regional entities\u2019 member states is vital for the consistency of statistics and indicators at regional level. Regional organisations may also focus on other areas of common interest and importance to their members. For regional organisations whose member states are developing countries, a key area is the development towards the Millennium Development Goals, including social issues such as poverty and hunger, health and education, gender equality, as well as environmental sustainability. The need to strengthen poverty reduction actions and to address climate change and its effects force these issues increasingly into focus. To make informed assessments, policy decisions and monitoring, comparable, relevant, reliable and timely statistics are crucial. 30 Macro-economic statistics are covered in the chapters on external trade and balance of payments statistics (chapter D.10), national accounts (chapter D.11), price statistics (chapter D.12), government finance and public sector statistics (chapter D.19) and business statistics (chapter D.13). Box 8.5: Example: Regional study on progress towards the MDGs in the Caribbean This study from 2004 identified broad trends relevant to the achievement of the MDGs at the regional level and highlights issues deriving from the peculiarities of the Caribbean Community. It identified similarities and differences among countries of the region and also highlighted successful strategies and approaches which could be replicated in other countries encountering problems in achieving the MDGs. It also identified challenges and obstacles in the way of achieving the MDGs and advances policy and other recommendations to address these challenges and obstacles. It also made a number of specific proposals for the modification of the targets to meet the needs of the Caribbean situation. For the proportion of seats held by women in national parliaments (indicator 4), the report raised a question regarding the relevance and utility for the Caribbean of the indicators established under this Goal and concluded that it would be necessary to add more qualitative and relevant quantitative measures in order to contextualise the targets and indicators and thus make them more relevant to the realities of the Caribbean. A number of specific proposals were advanced in this regard. Emphasis was placed on the importance of ensuring the availability of adequate, and suitably disaggregated, statistics as an essential precondition for the effective achievement of the MDGs and the need therefore to strengthen data collection capabilities in the region. The effective integration of the MDGs into the national planning framework was seen as an essential precondition for their successful implementation. Furthermore, it was considered necessary to establish systematic linkages among the various goals since, although they are listed separately, they are nevertheless closely inter-related. Source: Regional Report on the Achievement of the MDGs in the Caribbean community , UNDP (2004) The CCSA Task Team on Coordination at the Sub- regional level distinguishes between two types of regional statistics projects: Projects that support regional integration and strengthen the statistical capacity of sub-regional organisations and projects supporting national statistical systems through a regional approach. The first group of projects often support several objectives: development and application of common classifications, methods and definitions for the member states of the regional organisation; promotion of common data collection programmes using harmonized methods; collection, compilation, dissemination and analysis of statistical data for the region. Typically, the key activities include one or more of the following: Strengthening co-ordination and management of regional \u2022 statistics, including the regional legal framework; Building and strengthening regional statistical \u2022 infrastructure, including harmonisation of definitions and classifications and development of databases; Investment in appropriate infrastructure, especially \u2022 information and communication technology (see section C.8.9); ",
        "C 161 How to Manage Statistics Actions Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Support for regional data collection activities and for the \u2022 compilation of harmonized regional statistics; Supporting data dissemination; \u2022 Human resource development (see \u2022 section C.8.7). The second group of projects covers projects aimed at improving the capacity of national statistical systems, with support organised and delivered at regional level. Such projects and programmes are especially interesting if the countries in the region covered are small, they have a common background, a common language and/or face similar challenges regarding their statistical systems. According to PARIS21\u2019s Partner Report on Support to Statistics (PRESS) , the European Union is the largest supporter of statistical development worldwide. Up to the PRESS 2010 Round, the European Union stood for more than half of the commitments dedicated to statistical development. A considerable share of the European Commission\u2019s funding is channelled through regional and sub-regional organisations and programmes. MEDSTAT, EU\u2019s programme to supporting statistical capacity and specific sector statistics in Mediterranean partner countries is but one example; others include projects in the Caribbean, in Southern Africa, and so forth. Through the regional approach, costs can be reduced through economies of scale. A regional approach also strengthens co-operation and harmonisation while promoting the exchange of good practices across the region. Typical elements of regional projects programmes are training and technical assistance, as these can often be delivered more efficiently on a regional basis. In large scale projects, the European Commission applies the good practice of dedicating a 2 - 5% share of allocated resources to statistics, i.e. to institutional development linked to collection and processing of the necessary information to monitor and evaluate the programme. This is fully in line with Recommendation 6 of the \u2018 Evaluation of the Commission Support for Statistics in Third Countries \u2019 (2007). The aim of this recommendation was to generalise and improve the current practice in budget support programme: \u201c[R6] In large projects and non-statistical sector programmes, systematically reserve a share of project resources for institutional development linked to collection and processing of statistical information and make sure it is used for monitoring the policy supported by the project/ programme. \u201d Based on its review of regional programs and operations of the World Bank over the period from 1995 to 2005, the World Bank\u2019s Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) concluded that there seem to be five key determinants of success for any regional program: Strong country commitment to regional co-operation; \u2022 The scope of objectives has to match both national and \u2022 regional capabilities; There needs to be clear delineation and coordination of the \u2022 roles of national and regional agencies; Acceptable governance arrangements take time to be put \u2022 in place, but are crucial; Planning to sustain the benefits once the program comes to \u2022 an end must be built in from the beginning. As the number of stakeholders includes decision makers, statisticians and others both at regional and national level, regional projects may involve increased costs, for example for project management and for the interaction between member states and between the regional and national level. Generally, for the success of regional projects it is vital to analyze the mandate and the capacity of regional organisations and whether the structures and co-operation level of the organisations are suited for the project. The statistical dimension of a regional institution\u2019s mission generally includes the compilation of consistent statistics for the region as a whole, as well as for individual member states. Data collection is normally carried out at the level of the member states. The data collection process should enable the compilation of consistent and comparable statistics ant regional level, either through documented and agreed procedures to transform national data or through harmonisation of classification and nomenclatures, survey methodologies and processes. In the longer term, harmonisation is generally the more sustainable approach; however, depending on the region\u2019s context, the use of correspondence tables and transformation procedures from national data to regionally comparable data is a more realistic and feasible approach.

        "C 162 How to Manage Statistics Actions Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Compilation of regionally comparable data involves procedures for data transfer from the member states to the regional level. These procedures should clarify the list and format of data to be transferred, the transfer mode and the transfer schedule. Data should then be transferred in accordance with these specifications in order to compile regional statistics according to schedule. A lack of timely data in a member state (or even late transfer) disturbs the production process of regional statistics; dependent on the context, estimations may be used for the country concerned. However, in the longer term this is not a satisfactory solution. The issues preventing timely transfer of national data should be addressed together with the country concerned, in order to seek permanent solutions to assure the availability of national data. This issue highlights the importance of efficient co-ordination at regional level and of good communications with the focal points or coordinators at national level. Box 8.7: Example: Practical issues in a region-wide statistical data collection \u2013 the UEMOA harmonised price index Each UEMOA state produces a harmonised price index. It is based on a methodology common to all eight member states. In each member state, data are collected on a monthly basis and a monthly index is calculated using the same software (so-called CHAPO). The data are transferred to the UEMOA Commission every month and are used in the calculation of the UEMOA regional price index. Occasionally, member states were unable to produce their index for several months due to a hard-disk failure in the computer that was hosting CHAPO. The consequence was that during this time, due to a very basic technical problem, the UEMOA Commission was unable to produce the UEMOA regional price index. This example illustrates the importance to regional projects of proper routines and contingency plans at both regional and national level. Furthermore, it clearly shows the critical importance of proper ICT structures and equipment for transmission of data and administration of common software solutions (see also section C.8.9). Box 8.6: Example: Improved comparability of Gross Domestic Product estimates in AFRISTAT countries The urgent needs of the sub-regional organisations (UEMOA, CEDEAO) required the development of more comparable GDP figures for the member states, starting from the GDP figures calculated by the member states themselves. In the short term, the GDP targeted are final GDP figures, whose contents are in general explicitly known, rather than provisional GDP estimates, whose contents may be less clear. The requirements For Statistical Data For Multilateral Monitoring Of National Economic Policies are defined by the Commission of UEMOA (the West African Economic and Monetary Union). To effectively fulfil its function, the Commission of UEMOA has set up a network of National Committees for Economic Policy. These national offices assist the Commission in collecting, treating and analysing information on the economic, monetary and financial situation. They regularly provide databases of comparable indicators to the Commission of UEMOA, according to a pre-defined calendar. The statistical data to be provided by the member states are defined through regulations of UEMOA. In theory, the comparability of statistical data should be based on the fact that the countries use the same concepts and methodologies to produce data for the same periods. To this end, the Commission of UEMOA carries out statistical activities with the same methodological tools in parallel in all the member states. AFRISTAT has participated in the production of harmonised and comparable statistical indicators since 1996. Initially, comparable data were produced based on existing national data produced according to not harmonized methods. The second stage consisted in making the countries adopt harmonized methods of data processing. The SNA93 was implemented in the process of modernization of the national accounts of the AFRISTAT member states. This is currently reinforced by the use of the ERETES software system for national accounts in a majority of countries. In collaboration with the sub-regional organisations CEMAC, UEMOA and CEDEAO, and with the financial support of the European Commission, AFRISTAT initiated a process of harmonization of methods for developing the national accounts in two stages: In the short term: Establishing conversion tables between the GDP figures currently calculated by member states and \u201cmore comparable\u201d GDP estimates. These \u2022 conversion tables have made it possible to adjust for some of the variations due to differences in the national accounts methodology applied on national level. In the medium term: Re-basing the national accounts on new base years, using a harmonised and SNA93 compliant methodology and common tools. The \u2022 harmonisation of the methodologies was facilitated by the adoption of a number of accounting standards and statistical standards by the sub- regional organisations (the Handbook of Balance of Payments revision 5 and harmonization of methods; the SYSCOA accounting standard for public limited companies; a common accounting standard for banks; harmonisation of the methods for Statements of Government Operations; harmonised methodologies for price collection and calculation of the consumer price indexes (CHAPO software); a common framework for the production of external trade statistics, using the EUROTRACE software).

        "C 163 How to Manage Statistics Actions Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 When harmonisation is deemed the most appropriate approach to improve comparability of member states\u2019 data, harmonisation objectives must be defined in a realistic way. Two approaches to harmonisation could be envisaged: Harmonisation of concepts, nomenclatures and methodologies: International recommendations are adjusted to the specific requirements of the regional organisation\u2019s member states and to their situation regarding statistical capacity and the development of the statistical system. Harmonisation tools: Common statistical and technical tools are defined and put in place. When processing tools in the regional organisation\u2019s member states are missing or of poor quality, the conditions for developing and/or implementing shared tools are favourable, leading to higher efficiency, stability and comparability at lower costs. Box 8.8: Examples: Regional harmonisation of methodologies and tools \u2013 PARSTAT 1-2-3 surveys and COMESA statistical software support and training Harmonisation of statistical methodologies: In the framework of PARSTAT, the statistical part of the UEMOA Community programme to support regional integration (PARI), the same methodology for observing the informal sector (1-2-3 survey) was shared by the member states Benin, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Senegal and Togo. 31 The 1-2-3 survey was based on the principles of modular mixed mode (household/enterprise) surveys. The use of a harmonised methodology made it possible to analyse the size and the characteristics of the informal sector across the UEMOA and between its member states. The same methodology has since been applied in e.g. the Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi and Vietnam. 32 Harmonisation of statistics processing tools: The COMESA States have chosen the Eurotrace software suite, developed by Eurostat, to produce their external trade statistics. The choice of a common software solution has enabled the development of local expertise and the COMESA Secretariat has continuously provided training and technical support to Eurotrace installations in its member states. Regional trainings have been organised on an annual basis, where participants from each member state have been invited to the COMESA secretariat for one or two week trainings, with the ultimate objective of sharing the acquired knowledge with their colleagues back in the NSI. However, the high turnover of staff in the NSIs and the redeployment of staff to other units lead to rapid loss of the acquired expertise. I response to this challenge, the COMESA Secretariat has developed an e-learning platform and e-learning course material for Eurotrace, called E-Eurotrace . 31 32 31 See \u2018 La mesure de l\u2019emploi et du secteur informels : le\u00e7ons des enqu\u00eates 1-2-3 en Afrique \u2019 by M.

Razafindrakoto, F. Roubaud and C. Torelli (2010) Box 8.9: Example: Development of the Harmonized Consumer Price Index for the COMESA region Countries in the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) use a Harmonised Consumer Price Index (HCPI) to calculate inflation. All COMESA member states are required to use the same methodology to calculate their inflation. The monetary co-operation between the COMESA states is based on a Monetary and Fiscal Policies Harmonization Programme, which aims at establishing a Monetary Union in the year 2025. This programme has four stages: consolidation of existing instruments; introduction of limited currency convertibility; formal exchange rate union, and finally; full monetary union. Economic integration and economic development of the region would be facilitated by greater monetary stability. A key issue in this context is improved price stability. In 2004, the COMESA Council of Ministers adopted revised macro- economic convergence criteria. In this context, the Council noted that: \u201c Harmonization of concepts and methodologies as well as statistical frameworks is critical to the success of the COMESA Monetary Harmonization Programme. \u201d The COMESA Secretariat developed a roadmap for the development of a HCPI in the COMESA member states which was adopted by the COMESA Committee on Statistical Matters. The Committee on Statistical Matters also included the development of a COMESA Harmonized Consumer Price Index (HCPI) as a focal area for statistical development. In 2008, the COMESA Council of Ministers endorsed the HCPI roadmap. The COMESA HCPI roadmap is carried out in two stages. The first stage is implemented in 2011, with approval of the required accompanying regulations. In the second stage, regulations facilitating further harmonization will be developed in co-operation with external consultant. These regulations will be presented to the COMESA Committee on Statistical Matters meetings in 2011 and 2012. By harmonising the CPI, the inflation figures of each member states reflect the facts on the ground. Otherwise, the inflation in one member state might be perceived as is higher than in another member state, only due to different methodologies for calculating inflation. C.8.6.4. Institutional issues Coordination is crucial to regional projects. A strategy for coordination of the project should be defined from the outset. One should keep in mind that the actors are not only the official statisticians; governments have to have awareness of the importance of quality statistics to evidence-based policy making. Governments are both key users of statistics and responsible for strategies and resource allocation, on national level as well as on regional level through their role in the decision-making processes of the regional organisations. Advocacy for statistics is thus an important action in the context of regional and national commitment to statistics, their harmonisation and their inclusion in regional and national development strategies. The regional approach may strengthen the national advocacy efforts for statistics, by building pressure on governments to comply with at least the minimum of the requirements of the regional project. ",
        "C 164 How to Manage Statistics Actions Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Effective advocacy for statistics, both in terms of promoting evidence-based decision making as well as ensuring that statistical activities are properly financed and resourced, is crucial to the development of national statistical systems. The emphasis on global monitoring of the MDGs and of national poverty reduction strategies has stimulated greater awareness of the need for better data. However, the case for further strengthening of official statistics still needs to be made with policy makers and data users at all levels. PARIS21 has developed a range of statistical advocacy materials and an advocacy tool-kit and maintains a library of regional and national advocacy materials that promote the use of statistics in decision-making, the building of statistical capacity and the role of statistics in regional and national development policy frameworks. A key question is who will co-ordinate the regional project. Several options are feasible; a regional organisation with a dedicated statistics function is often a natural coordinator. Alternatively, one of the national statistical institutes or other national institutions involved may take on a coordinating role. This can also be set up as a rotating function; this would increase accountability of the current coordinator, but also offer each coordinator to put forward their specific needs and priorities. Another solution would be to establish an ad-hoc coordination entity for the specific regional project. Several considerations must be made, such as the capacity of the potential coordinator, its commitment to the project, its authority and mandate, its stability, the structure and objectives of the project, etc. Often, regional projects involve a number of different stakeholders at national level. It is a good practice to use national focal points/coordinators to coordinate the networks of national stakeholders and activities at national level, when possible. A national focal point facilitates planning and coordination of the work of the national actors. The national focal point/coordinator may be based in the NSI or in one of the other national entities with a stake in the project. It facilitates the work of the national network by identifying activity areas and responsible group members; ensuring dissemination of the results; organising national meetings and training activities; undertaking advocacy activities; and linking with the regional coordinator. User-orientation is a key aspect of statistical quality (see section C.5.3). However, the user group for regional statistics is somewhat wider than the user group outlined in Box 2.5. Regional level statistics are compiled to provide an evidence base for policy making, monitoring and evaluation at regional level and across the countries of the region, often with an emphasis on regional integration (economic or otherwise). Obviously, governments within the region are key users, both in their function as national decision makers and through their role in the decision-making processes of regional organisations. Commissions or Secretariats of regional or sub-regional organisation are other key users, requiring consistent regional data and comparable national data for multilateral monitoring of the performance of economic policies and national compliance, for evaluating the progress of regional integration, etc. International organisations are important users of comparable national statistics, and thus have a strong interest in the comparability of national statistics and that they are produced in consistency with international principles, standards and good practices. Donors and other technical and financial partners also require quality regional and national data, to identify and formulate programmes and projects, for implementation, monitoring and evaluation, as well for the assessment of strengths, weaknesses and capacity of the national statistical systems. C.8.6.5. Project issues The scope of regional projects is linked to the mandate of the regional organisations, their capacity and their ability to coordinate with their member states. Each regional organisation has its defined mandate and objectives; this will naturally also limit the domain and the scope of project they can deal with. There is no standard approach or rule that can be applied to all regional projects; regions are simply too different. The importance of efficient coordination and a well designed strategy for the project must be underlined. However, there are some core principles to be considered: User relevance \u2022 Efficiency of a regional versus a national approach \u2022 Advocacy and commitment of regional and national \u2022 decision-makers Integration in and consistency with general development \u2022 strategies at regional and national level Coordination strategy \u2022 Subsidiarity \u2022 Capacity building \u2022 Sustainability of results \u2022 A core issue for regional projects is subsidiarity. Only activities that cannot be carried out effectively at national level should be carried out at regional level. This principle stimulates national ownership and commitment to the project objectives and allows adaption to national situations and settings. The use of national focal points/coordinators are valuable to assure that the national activities are in line with the overall regional strategy, to communicate and report efficiently with the regional level and to have a consistent approach throughout the countries involved in the project. Training and capacity building are crucial. Regional projects must have a realistic approach regarding the available IT environment and the expected investment in IT. To establish and maintain an IT environment is costly; the issue of sustainability of the investment in IT infrastructure and associated human capital is critical for the long term ",
        "C 165 How to Manage Statistics Actions Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 viability of the project, on regional as well as on national level. An advantage of the introduction of common software solutions is the inherit harmonisation of statistical methods and procedures and of common concepts, standards and nomenclatures. It also enables the development of local expertise and training and support adapted to the needs of the countries in the region (see Box 8.8). Practical examples of software for specific statistical domains and supported by the European Commission are ERETES (national accounts) and Eurotrace (external trade). Support for IT in statistical capacity building is described in more detail in section C.8.9. Training is also a key part of statistical capacity building. A regional approach may often prove efficient for training on specific statistics-related issues, e.g. national accounts, external trade, price statistics, database management and data warehousing for statistical data, management of statistics organisations and processes, and so forth. Regional organisations are well situated to co-ordinate and set up training programmes to meet the needs of its member states. If regional trainings are arranged centrally, a budget for travel costs must be included. These costs can be very high and therefore undermine all the good initiatives of NSIs willing to coordinate at regional level. Alternatively, the same training courses can be offered in individual member states, thus reducing the travel required to the instructors, or by setting up e-learning courses. Issues concerning training for official statistics are further described in section C.8.7.

Statistical Training The European Union has funded a number of projects for the initial training of statisticians (scholarships, study awards, funding and other assistance to statistical training schools) as well as for vocational training. These actions have been largely appreciated. The Evaluation of the Commission support for statistics in third countries indicates that: \u201cParticular improvements could be observed in partners\u2019 capacity to collect and process data, in early warning indicators and regional trade data, in the conduct of surveys, and in a move towards adoption of internationally recommended practices.\u201d Most of the initial training activities have been developed at the sub-regional level and have succeeded in creating regional networks of statisticians who often keep in touch after their initial education. Vocational training is particularly necessary in new information and communication technologies , with an emphasis on their application in analysis and dissemination. But vocational training is also justified to help statisticians to adapt to the national and global development agendas. Statisticians educated a decade ago, have probably not been trained in the production of environment or governance statistics, or in the analysis of gender issues. Vocational training has been supported by the European Commission at national and regional levels. Experience has shown that such training is often more efficient at sub-regional level . However, there are also limits to the possibilities for arranging training at regional level, such as limited language skills or too different competence levels between the countries. Box 8.10: The regional project of statistical training for SADC The project aimed to strengthen the ability of staff to produce the statistics needed for policy and decision-making. It also assisted in the use of statistics to support most important policies of the SADC and its Member States. It was implemented over 5 years (January 2001 \u2013 December 2005). The following results were reached: National and regional training strategies were defined. \u2022 The regional training capacity to implement these strategies was \u2022 strengthened. More users of statistics were skilled in using information provided \u2022 by official statistics. The producers of statistics better respond to the needs of \u2022 users of official statistics thanks to technical, management and communication training. ",

Participants from NSIs said that they spent over 95% of their time in the red area while universities said they spend 100% of their time in the blue area. Participants saw this distinction as the reason why most university graduates cannot be used by National Statistics Systems (NSS) without further training. The issue is how to close the gap or how to provide sustainable alternative or complementary training. Solutions may be different between regions and linguistic areas, on the basis of different educational and administrative structures. Source: SADC Secretariat, European Development Fund and Eurostat http://www.sadc.int/index/browse/page/337 Eurostat is currently developing ASTRA (Assessment of Statistical Training), a management information system to assess the need on training in statistics. Its general objective is to enhance the effectiveness of statistical trainings, particularly in the ACP countries. The main reason behind the decision to develop such a management tool was the fact that active experience in statistical development and training over years, as well as exchange with countries and evaluations, have shown that there is a redundant difficulty to identify clearly and to monitor systematically the demand for statistics related training at the level of the NSI but also at the level of the NSS. Hence the specific goal of the ASTRA development is to put together the demand and the supply of statistics-related trainings by linking all actors (NSI/NSS, Statistical Training Institutions, regional organisations and donors) involved in a process that starts at the demand side from the statistical producing units, aggregates the demand at each level of the NSS and ends with the supply side of the training institutions. The system offers the opportunity to all these actors to bring in their views from their very specific perspectives and roles. It is intended to provide a practical contribution to the statistical capacity building initiatives and the implementation of NSDS. The realisation of ASTRA is a toolbox which contains three tools: The assessment reports are information and decision 1. making tools for the NSIs, other statistical producers in NSS, regional organizations, donors and statistical training centres. Their establishment follows a logical progression as shown below. The database, basically considered as an input tool, 2. generates the assessment reports and feeds the decision making process. The handbook describes the MIS-ST system and provides 3. instruction for the decision making process and for all the successive steps of the operation. It refers specifically (where indicated) to other sources/references (action plans, NSDS, GDDS, regional programmes, national policies, PRSP, international obligations, donor financing, etc\u2026.) that need to be taken into consideration through the whole process.

Other methodological support If training remains a core aspect of statistical capacity building, support can take other forms at each step of the statistical process: Building statistical infrastructure : provision of Geographical Information System (GIS) \u2022 software to help in the design of a census, of a sample, provision of communication hardware and software for \u2022 instance for the building and maintenance of registers (of enterprises, of administrations, of organisations) for contacts with data providers, with data users\u2026 documentation, methodological and general, \u2022 sufficient paper diffusion of international classifications and \u2022 standard methodologies in all concerned data producing organisations, where internet access is limited, ease of general access to internet, \u2022 diffusion of cost-effective methodologies, elaborated in \u2022 other countries. Data collection : standard questionnaires, \u2022 Data processing : up-to-date statistical software, which is more and more \u2022 efficient, development of standard tools for the processing of surveys, \u2022 the automation of production of short-term indicators archiving tools. \u2022 Analysis \u2022 : again, modern statistical software offers more and more \u2022 powerful analytical tools, examples of analysis made in other countries. \u2022 Dissemination : a GIS software is also needed at this step, for a presentation \u2022 of geographically disaggregated data which could attract potential new national users, making decision at local levels, provision of standard tools for the dissemination of \u2022 databases to general public (for instance, the Devinfo software, originally built by UNICEF meets a great success), website designing tools. \u2022 From the list above, it is obvious that the supply of new information and communication technologies tools play the second major role. Of course, it must be accompanied by the adequate training. C.8.9. Support for IT in statistical capacity building The existence and the proper management of an appropriate Information and Communication Technology (ICT) system is essential to produce modern statistics and is a key component of a sustainable statistical capacity. This applies not only to the NSIs and their regional offices, but also to all other statistics-producing agencies in the NSS. The NSS in many developing countries faces problems caused by a lack of modern computer and networking equipment, suited to the tasks at hand. ICT is important in the whole statistical process: from registers (sampling frames), via sampling, data collection and processing, data storage, to analysis and dissemination. In response to these challenges, ICT has a natural, integrated role in several development cooperation programmes addressing statistical capacity and statistical systems. The European Commission has supported regional statistical capacity for regional integration in most of the partner areas. For instance, the statistical component of the 9th European Development Fund Regional Integration Support Programme (RISP) for COMESA sought to improve and harmonise the production of statistics and to improve the capacity of the NSIs and the regional organisations. Regional integration process requires statistics that enable comparisons between countries and regions. Common regional statistics actions have often been based around development and implementation of common statistics tools. Eurostat develops and supports the implementation of the Eurotrace software for external trade of goods statistics and the ERETES software for national accounts in several regions and developing countries. Besides updating to the latest international standards and maintaining the tools, Eurostat can provide the service of a specialist to train the partner institutions. Other international organisations, such as UNCTAD and UNICEF, also support implementation of software solutions within their fields. Under the World Bank\u2019s STATCAP financing programme, countries may obtain loans or grants to invest in the improvement their statistical capacity. This specifically includes investments to improve statistical infrastructure (such as registers, database structures and geographic information systems) and the use of information technology. See section C.6.3. The issue of IT for statistics has several vital dimensions: Hardware (including networking technology) and its \u2022 specifications Installation, maintenance, upgrade and eventual \u2022 replacement Software \u2022 Training and documentation \u2022 ",
        "C 168 How to Manage Statistics Actions Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 The hardware requirements of an NSI and/or the NSS must be carefully reviewed in cooperation with the beneficiaries, to assure that the equipment specified is appropriate both to the tasks and to the national situation. A realistic assessment of the needs and of the material capacity of the partner is crucial, for instance considering that whenever there is shortage of equipment, basic workstations tend to be used also for statisticians needing to run heavier routines, or that equipment might be exposed to variations in voltage and high temperatures. Bringing in equipment from abroad might expose to difficulties with the national restrictions on imported goods or simply to get service, spare parts or upgrades. Larger-scale investments in IT structure normally involve a certain time lag from order to actual installation. It might also take time to adapt new software to the specific environment in the NSI. This is particularly the case for transfer of software developed for particular tasks in other statistical organisations. Scheduling should take this into account. In particular, training activities should be scheduled so that one can be certain that required equipment and software installations are in place. When a project provides a software tool, clear guidance should be given on the necessary frequency and cost of future maintenance and adjustments. The availability of efficient, quality equipment and software has a positive effect on staff morale, productivity, and quality of outputs. However, trained ICT staff are often sought- after by the private sector and may leave for more attractive jobs elsewhere. One consequence of this is that proper documentation of routines and set-up is critical. Physical and electronic security is crucial for confidentiality (i.e. that no identifiable individual data are available for non- statistical purposes), therefore for NSI integrity. The physical protection of a statistical institution - the actual location of the documents, computer records, microfiches, photographs and other materials \u2013 has to be considered. The virtual protection has to be also taken into account: - the electronic perimeter traced by the agency\u2019s internal communications system, which is presumably connected to its stores of individual data. A well-functioning firewall technology and encryption routines, as well as software for statistical disclosure control are also important. ",

        "D 173 Introduction to sector statistics covered by the Guide Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 D.9. Introduction to sector statistics covered by the Guide Development of statistics in developing countries can be supported as a dedicated project by European funds. However, statistics are also a horizontal issue, providing data for evidence-based policy making, programme and project formulation, monitoring and evaluation (see Part C). Thus, statistics are not only relevant system-wide, but also to all policy areas identified as priorities by the European Consensus on Development (see section B.1.5). As recommended by the Evaluation of the Commission Support for Statistics in Third Countries , in all major sector programmes and projects funds should be reserved to develop sustainable statistics required to monitor and evaluate the process and evaluate the outcomes and impact of the intervention. Part D of the Guide , Statistics for Policy Issues, looks at how statistics can be used and supported for decision making and monitoring achievements in the context of European Commission sector policy areas. The chapters each focus on a specific policy area (or a part of a policy area) where the European Commission has a \u2018comparative advantage\u2019, as identified by the European Consensus on Development. Each of the policy areas covers a wide range of statistics subjects. Moreover, a statistics field might be relevant for more than one policy area. For example, water statistics might be important for the environment, water and energy and human development. The scope of the individual chapters of Part D is defined according to the UNECE\u2019s Classification of Statistical Activities of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, whereas the organisation of Part D follows the sector policy areas of the European Consensus on Development. The chapters offer advice to European Commission staff involved in sector programmes and projects in developing countries on how specific sector statistics can be used to inform sector policies, to monitor progress and evaluate outcomes and impacts in the sector. The chapters of the Guide \u2019s Part specifically address the data needs and uses in the specific statistics area. They provide the main definitions and concepts used in the specific statistics area and the key sources for data and metadata (see Box 2.7). While general aspects of statistical quality was discussed in section C.5.3, the chapters of Part D describes how the quality of data in the sector covered can be analysed, highlighting sector-specific quality issues. The chapters all conclude with practical advice on how the system for producing sector statistics can be set up or enhanced and what actions should be undertaken to improve data availability and data quality in the sector. The overall aim of these chapters is to give non-statisticians involved in the formulation, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of sector programmes and projects a basic insight into the sector statistics required to inform these activities. The chapters are not intended to turn users into sector statistics specialists, but rather to give them the necessary knowledge to find, use, analyse and improve sector statistics as key tools in their work. In particular, the information provided helps users to improve the evidence base for sector interventions and to define actions to improve it further in the medium and long term. Each chapter follows a (more or less) standard structure: Sector policy applications: what these data is used for; \u2022 Concepts and definitions of the sector statistics; \u2022 Sources of data and metadata in the sector; \u2022 How to analyse data quality and identify problems; \u2022 How to improve sector statistics and build a statistical \u2022 action in the sector. When required, this structure is adapted to fit specific aspects of certain chapterspolicy and statistics areas. For example, the chapter on environment statistics contains a large number of quite different sub-topics, requiring the general structure to be followed for each sub-topic separately. All chapters of the Guide\u2019s Part D Statistics for Policy Issues contains an introductory \u2018 The chapter in brief\u2019 box, a \u2018 To find out more box \u2018 with the key references and Internet resources (all hyperlinked) for these sector statistics, as well as a number of boxes containing practical examples of programmes, projects or terms of reference in the sector, practical checklists and advice or more detailed information on specific issues. Box 9.1 provides a quick overview of the content of each chapter, including key concepts and statistics covered, enabling the user to quickly identify the chapters covering topics of special interest to their work. It also gives the correspondence between the chapters of Statistics for Policy Issues, the statistics activities specified in the Classification of Statistical Activities and the policy areas defined by the European Consensus on Development . The box is complemented by Box 4.4 , which lists some of the key sources of data in the sector, as well as the main producers of sector statistics. ",

External trade and Balance of Payments The chapter in brief This chapter covers statistics that inform the European Union\u2019s \u2018Trade and Regional Integration\u2019 policy areas as defined in the European Consensus (see section B.1.5). The relationship between policy areas and statistics fields is presented in Box 4.4 (section B.4.3). Chapter D.10 covers a wide area of external trade and balance of payments statistics. The chapter starts by identifying the main policy areas for which these statistics are used and continues by providing a user\u2019s view of the statistics involved, including a description of the differences between external trade and balance of payments statistics. The chapter then identifies the main sources of data and information about methods, continues by discussing how to analyse the quality of the statistics in this field and concludes with information about how to support an intervention in trade statistics. D.10.1. Policy applications: what this data is used for External trade and balance of payments statistics have a wide variety of uses, including: Providing timely information about trade sectors, both \u2022 goods and services, in which governments have a keen interest, such as main export products. Supporting trade policy, including trade negotiations, \u2022 monitoring trade agreements and resolving trade disputes. This is a major driving force for improving external trade data in developing countries. Within the European Union, external trade data are also used for multilateral and bilateral negotiations within the common commercial policy, for definition and implementation of the anti-dumping policy and for evaluating the progress of the Single Market. Monitoring financial stability and monetary policy: the \u2022 balance of payments measures the external deficit / surplus with the rest of the world and from this is calculated net external debt, the size and composition of which are closely observed by the monetary authorities (usually central banks). If the external deficit is linked to a government sector deficit, then fiscal policy \u2013 taxes and government expenditure \u2013 can be also affected by these measures. Short term economic monitoring: trade and payments \u2022 33 statistics are published frequently (usually monthly for trade, quarterly for payments) and are timely indicators of a country\u2019s economic activity (other such indicators include CPI, financial statistics and output data). For example, since increased economic activity usually results 33 Statistics on cross-border transactions recorded in the balance of payments in an increase in imports, an observed change in imports (or in payments for imported goods) from its trend rate of growth can be an early indicator that overall economic growth has deviated from its recent path. Monitoring medium-term macroeconomic policy: \u2022 trade volumes and price levels (import and export price indices) are used in the national accounts, which is the main instrument for observing the economy as a whole. The contribution to growth of net exports is a key policy indicator. Importers and exporters use international trade statistics \u2022 to identify and quantify markets, often needing statistics on very precisely detailed products. D.10.2. Concepts and definitions The statistics covered in this section are defined by section 2.6 \u2018International trade and balance of payments\u2019 of the new UNECE Classification of International Statistics Activities, which was introduced in section B.4.3. This area is defined as covering statistics on all cross-border transactions recorded in the balance of payments and includes trade in goods and services \u2022 external positions and debt \u2022 foreign direct investment \u2022 foreign affiliated trade \u2022 tariffs, market access, foreign aid, development assistance \u2022 and resource flows to developing countries. This chapter deals with the general aspects of the above, and does not go into details regarding specific groups of products. Details on specific commodities/services can be found \u2022 in the respective chapters of Part D of this Guide , such as chapter D.15 Transport statistics and chapter D.17 Agricultural, forestry and fishing statistics, etc. Exchanges between multinational companies and activities \u2022 of foreign affiliates. External trade in goods statistics are based on physical flows of goods across borders, while trade in services covers the provision of services by residents of a country to non- residents and vice versa. Other commonly used names for external trade statistics are international trade statistics, merchandise trade statistics (goods), foreign trade statistics or simply trade statistics. When using any such figures, care should be taken as to whether they include or exclude trade in services, as these terms are sometimes used to include only trade in goods transactions. ",
        "D 180 External Trade Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 External trade in goods statistics have historically been collected through customs administrations , who primarily record imports and exports for collection of duties. Statisticians take advantage of this source, often supplementing customs data with information obtained from other sources to provide full coverage of external trade. Publication of good quality trade statistics therefore depends on effective coordination with the customs administration. In the European Union, customs records do not cover trade in goods between member states, because transactions within the EU customs union are no longer subject to tariffs or customs surveillance. Other sources need to be used, such as a data collection system based on monthly reporting by enterprises. Box 10.1 outlines the method used by Eurostat to collect data on trade with non-EU countries and within the EU. Box 10.1: Eurostat\u2019s trade statistics system Extra-EU trade statistics data are collected by using a copy of the customs declaration, which traders provide in fulfilling their reporting obligations to the Customs authorities. The statistical information depends, therefore, very much on customs practices, definitions and policies, with only a few details being collected purely for statistical purposes. Making use of existing customs procedures means that there is nearly total coverage of data on trade with non-EU countries. As a result of the abolition of customs control at the borders between the Member States, intra-EU trade statistics are collected directly from traders. The reporting burdens are simpler, compared with the extra-EU system, and private individuals and small scale traders are excluded. However, any natural or legal person registered for VAT in a Member State who carries out intra-Community trade above a certain threshold is obliged to report monthly on its intra-Community trade to the national statistical authorities. The national authorities use data from the fiscal authorities to identify the target population and maintain registers on trade operators. External trade statistics are intended to provide full coverage, therefore in principle the following transactions should be included: trade unrecorded by customs (such as trade in electricity and products transported by pipeline such as gas and petroleum), barter trade, goods on consignment, goods on financial lease, goods traded between enterprises under common ownership, goods traded on government account, processing and repair trade. Enterprise surveys are generally used as a means of collecting data on these headings. Trade in services is more difficult and more complex to measure than trade in goods, dealing as it does with payments made for services provided by residents of one country to residents of another, regardless of where the transactions take place. Historically, many countries have estimated their external trade in services totals by using bank settlement data, which shows the value of payments made in non- national currencies. Surveys of enterprises or individuals are generally needed to break these totals down into the product headings of trade in services. The required indicators for trade statistics are as follows: trade flow (exports, imports, re-exports, re-imports) \u2022 trade partner (i.e. country) \u2022 trade value (monetary terms) \u2022 trade product \u2022 trade quantity in kg (goods) \u2022 trade quantity in supplementary units (goods) \u2022 The trade quantity is important because this enables the calculation of export and import unit values which are used for national accounts and are themselves useful short-term macroeconomic indicators. The current account of the balance of payments statistics measures all current payments between a country and the rest of the world, including payments for trade in goods and services (the balance of trade 34 ); factor payments: income from capital and remittances by workers abroad; as well as international transfers. The capital account covers transactions in investment assets. The current account of the balance of payments therefore covers a considerably wider range of transactions than the external trade data. The balance of trade covers broadly the same transactions as the external trade data, although the different concepts used (for example, change in ownership of goods as against physical flows) mean that, unadjusted, there is no reason for the two data series to match precisely. Since the differences mostly concern the timing of transactions, the balance of trade in goods and the external trade data should be consistent over time, so that data for longer periods should be comparable. In many countries balance of payments data is sourced from international bank transfer documentation, which is usually completed by remitters of funds, and collected by monetary authorities, usually central banks. Additional information can be obtained through value added tax collection systems. Other records of monetary authorities are also used, such as in the case of imports and exports of gold. Even developed countries experience difficulties in compiling merchandise trade statistics. As discussed in the OECD Statistics Brief 35 , \u2018a number of measurement issues and comparability problems remain. In particular the increasingly important phenomenon of globalisation, entailing the internationalisation of production and sales and new forms of delivering goods and services to customers across countries, new developments in information and communications technologies and the growing importance of e-commerce requires new approaches and poses new methodological challenges.\u2019 With increasing globalisation, exchanges between foreign affiliates and their parent 34 Monetary value of exports minus imports of goods and services 35 Trade in Goods and Services: Statistical Trends and Measurement Challenges (Octo ber 2001) ",
        "D 181 External Trade Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 companies are often made at prices which are not market prices. A specific collection of statistics, Foreign Affiliate Trade Statistics (FATS) has been set up to cope with this problem. Compilation of these statistics is likely to be difficult for many developing countries. Describing traded goods and services necessitates a classification. In external trade in goods statistics the recommended classification is the 2007 (latest) version of the Harmonised Commodity Description and Coding System (Harmonized System, HS) which is based on the nature of the commodity. Earlier versions of the Harmonised System (88, 92, 96, 2002) are still used by some countries. The EU\u2019s Combined Nomenclature (CN) is a more detailed version of the HS. An alternative classification is the Standard International Trade Classification, which is based on stages of production and is therefore more suitable for some economic analyses. The current version is revision 4 (SITC, Rev. 4), which was accepted in 2006, though the previous revision is still in widespread use. The Broad Economic Classification (BEC) is based on the SITC and is available for economic analysis. Its top-level classification is as follows: Food and beverages 1. Industrial supplies not elsewhere specified 2. Fuels and lubricants 3. Capital goods (except transport equipment), and parts 4. and accessories thereof Transport equipment and parts and accessories thereof 5. Consumer goods not elsewhere specified 6. Goods not elsewhere specified 7. Trade in services is broken down into eleven product headings: Transportation (sea, air and other) \u2013 passenger, freight and \u2022 other Travel - business and personal \u2022 Communications services \u2022 Construction services \u2022 Insurance services \u2022 Financial services \u2022 Computer and information services \u2022 Royalties and licence fees \u2022 Other business services - merchanting and other trade- \u2022 related services; operational leasing services; miscellaneous business, professional and technical services Personal, cultural and recreational services - audio-visual \u2022 and related services; other cultural and recreational services Government services \u2022 D.10.3. Sources of data and metadata External trade data are published at national, regional or global levels. National data sources cover the trade of a country with its trading partners and are usually published by the NSI or the customs or revenue authorities if they collect the data, while in some countries the Ministry of Trade publishes the data. Regional organisations which manage a free trade area or customs union usually publish data on trade within the region as well as on the region\u2019s external trade with non- member countries. In the European Union, for example, the primary data source for external trade data is Eurostat, rather than the Member States. Global organisations publish data on trade between all possible pairs of countries. Global trade databases are very large, for example, the United Nations Commodity Trade Statistics (COMTRADE) Database contains more than one billion trade records. In addition, commercial trade databases exist that seek to add value to the data. In developing regions, non-government databases (non-profit or commercial) can provide data that is not available from government or regional organisations\u2019 websites. The COMTRADE database disseminates detailed annual data for trade in goods in the Harmonised System (HS \u2013 explained above) at 6-digit level and in other classifications on the required indicators. In addition, the database provides the following indicators at commodity group level: gross and seasonally adjusted trade value (in national \u2022 currency or in USD), unit-value indices, \u2022 volume indices, \u2022 growth rates of trade values and indices, \u2022 trade value (in billion Euro), \u2022 shares of a country in world trade, \u2022 main trading partners, \u2022 balance of external trade \u2022 A selection of links to global, regional and national trade databases is shown in the box \u2018To find out more\u2026\u2019 below. Some databases, for example COMTRADE, provide data according to HS, SITC and sometimes BEC classifications. Correspondence tables can also be used to convert from one classification system to another or to update from an old revision to a current version of a classification system. United Nations and Eurostat sources of correspondence tables are shown in the box \u2018To find out more\u2026\u2019 below. The IMF provides the most comprehensive global database of balance of payments statistics 36 . Other data sources are central banks, the European Central bank being responsible for publication of Eurozone data. 36 The IMF balance of payments database requires subscription ",
        "D 182 External Trade Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 The United Nations is the repository of most methodological manuals for trade in goods and services. The IMF is the responsible authority for definitions in the balance of payments. The UN International Merchandise Trade Statistics: Concepts and Definitions ( IMTS, Rev.2; there is a Rev 3 under development) contains international standard definitions and methodological recommendations. The companion document, the International Merchandise Trade Statistics Compilers Manua l discusses in detail the conceptual and institutional framework of data collection, the sources of data, methods of data compilation, and data dissemination, reconciliation and exchange. Metadata on international merchandise trade statistics, including at country level, can also be obtained from the United Nations\u2019 Commodity Trade Statistics (COMTRADE) Database . The Manual on Statistics of International Trade in Services provides international standard recommendations on methodology as well as classification of services delivered through trade and recommended treatment of the local delivery of services through foreign affiliate trade. An overview of country treatments of statistics on trade in goods and services and on the balance of payments is given in the IMF GDDS / SDDS country pages . The Eurostat database provides access to the EU\u2019s external trade statistics and metadata. It also provides balance of payments statistics for non-EU countries, from international sources: this information is only accessible by European Commission\u2019s agents (see section B.3.4) D.10.4. Analysing data quality and identifying problems The quality of external trade statistics depends on the data coverage, how quickly statistics are published, their compliance with international recommendations, especially classifications, and the availability of indices based on the data. The recommendation on the coverage of external trade in goods statistics (IMTS Rev 2, paragraphs 64-68, on which much of this paragraph is based) is the \u2018general trade system\u2019, which most countries follow. The general trade system is in use when the statistical territory of a country coincides with its economic territory, but a few countries still use the special trade system, which is in use when the statistical territory comprises only a part of the economic territory, for example when an export processing zone is excluded from reporting trade statistics. The trade system or \u2018trade regime\u2019 can be verified from the IMF GDDS / SDDS web pages (see section B.2.4), which shows, for example, Egypt , as using the special trade system 37 . Other issues of availability of statistics and their conformity to international conventions can be analysed relatively easily. A major issue is whether the published data conforms to a 37 as of November 2008 recent trade classification (or nomenclature) system, such as the Harmonised System, as outlined above. Publications should cover all trade, not simply a \u2018top twenty\u2019 list of exported and imported products. Data sources should cover all trade transactions. A review of the data published on-line by Senegal (see link in the \u2018To find out more\u2019 box below) is instructive - because data is collected through Customs procedures, data on imports, which are subject to customs scrutiny, are often more complete than export data, which are not. Export data for primary products should therefore be compared with any available production data. Many developing countries often have difficulty in systematically collecting data on quantities (weights or \u2018supplementary units\u2019), as these are not required for import tariffs. Their availability in detailed statistics publications should therefore be checked. External trade transactions can be omitted or incorrectly recorded in the statistics. One way to identify these problems is to look at asymmetries in the statistics between those of a country (or trading group) and its trade partners; a country\u2019s export statistics rarely match the corresponding import data of the partner country 38 . A country\u2019s or trading group\u2019s trade with the EU can be examined through a \u2018reconciliation\u2019 or \u2018mirror\u2019 study. Such a mirror study aims to identify the main discrepancies between the two sets of data and why they come about. It should also propose measures to reduce or eliminate these problems. An example of \u2018Terms of reference\u2019 for such a mirror study is shown in Box 10.2. This example is based on those which were used in comparison of trade statistics between EU and COMESA and among COMESA Member States. 38 Even after freight and insurance costs have been allowed for \u2013 exports are usually evaluated fob (free on board) and imports as including cif (cost, insurance and freight). ",
        "D 183 External Trade Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Box 10.2: Example terms of reference for a trade reconciliation study In theory, a country\u2019s recorded exports are the mirror image of its trading partners\u2019 recorded imports. In practice, there are often discrepancies between the two. External trade statistics reconciliation studies are a systematic process of identifying and assessing the causes of disparities in trade flows published by two countries or regions. To achieve this, an initial analysis of concepts and definitions used is undertaken. The short term objective of a reconciliation exercise is to explain and assess the causes of discrepancies in trade statistics and hence obtain mutually agreed datasets of better quality. Longer-term objectives may include harmonising the conceptual framework of two sets of statistics, which could lead to the use of new procedures in trade data compilation. Structure of Assignment The lead consultant will have undertaken a previous reconciliation study. \u2022 A selected number of country statisticians based at COMESA country statistical offices and customs authorities will act as national study team \u2022 members. The aim is to build capacity among COMESA trade statisticians in reconciliation exercises. The lead consultant will explain the methodology to selected COMESA Member State statisticians and analyse the 2005 data provided by the \u2022 Member States to COMESA. A review of the results will be undertaken by the country statisticians. The team leader will provide guidance to the country statisticians on the methodological aspects as well as the proposed adjustments to the \u2022 2005 dataset. Roles of Team Members The lead consultant will define the work plan for the second phase of the reconciliation between EU data and selected COMESA Member States\u2019 \u2022 data. All data will be shared with the national statisticians in the selected COMESA Member States for further analysis. COMESA Member State Statisticians will act as team members for data related to his/her specific country. Issues raised by the lead consultant \u2022 pertaining to specific country data will be dealt with by him/her. If any methodological aspects described by lead consultant have not been fully explained to a Member State statistician to his/her satisfaction, the statistician must indicate this to the lead consultant and to the COMESA Secretariat. The COMESA Secretariat will coordinate between the lead consultant and Member State team members and will review the report. \u2022 EUROSTAT will play an advisory role including review of final report. \u2022 Activities Review the mirror statistics study previously undertaken for COMESA. \u2022 Undertake an EU-COMESA mirror statistics study for 2005 data. \u2022 Compare findings of earlier study that used pre-2005 data with results based on 2005 data. \u2022 Review 2005 results by COMESA Member State statisticians, COMESA Secretariat, Eurostat. \u2022 Design of reconciliation format with clearly defined methodology and structure for analysis. \u2022 Analyse discrepancies found by the lead consultant supported by national consultants. \u2022 Finalise report making concrete recommendations for areas of improvement. \u2022 Present report by national consultants at stakeholder workshop dealing with the trade negotiations and trade policy analysis. \u2022 The starting point is a top down examination of trade data for credibility, with the aim of identifying inconsistencies in recent data, especially data changes from year to year that are difficult to explain. The output is a list of sectors and / or trading partners where there are questions about the quality of the data. The procedure should then be repeated at increasingly greater levels of data disaggregation. Graphing the main changes can help to identify problems such as time period recording errors or errors in which goods are recorded as switching between different classifications. Quality information can be found for most countries for both external trade and balance of payments statistics on the website of the IMF General Data Dissemination System (GDDS \u2013 see section B.2.4.1.3.). The countries that subscribe to the IMF\u2019s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS \u2013 also see section B.2.4.1.3.) additionally have IMF reports that show how the country meets the main quality aspects of external trade data and balance of payments statistics . However, few low income countries subscribe to SDDS. International data quality standards are available from the IMF\u2019s Data Quality Assessment Framework (DQAF, introduced in section C.5.3) website and related pages. DQAF specific quality rules cover balance of payments statistics. General DQAF rules apply to the external trade statistics. Links are shown below in the \u2018To find out more\u2019 box. Eurostat publishes an annual Quality Report on International Trade Statistics which provides a detailed analysis of the quality of EU Member States statistics in this field. In general the most significant sources of errors when compiling foreign trade statistics are the following: undocumented shipments, \u2022 transiting goods, \u2022 underestimation of low-valued transactions, \u2022 late filing, \u2022 reporting errors, \u2022 data capture errors. \u2022 ",
        "D 184 External Trade Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 A quality based assessment of trade statistics starts with analysis of the data quality as above but must have the broader coverage of DQAF or another assessment framework. In particular, the institutional framework needs close attention: is the responsibility for collecting, processing, and disseminating the statistics clearly specified at every stage in the process? Data collection and transmission issues also need to be addressed in the assessment. These include, for example, statistical returns from remote customs posts and the potential for their estimation, unrecorded trade from porous borders and/or mis-recording of customs declarations arising from lack of knowledge or corruption. An NSI\u2019s capacity to analyse the data; their IT systems, staff issues and the means of dissemination of the resulting statistics must also be covered by the assessment. For more information on improving the capacity of statistical systems and NSIs, see chapter C.6.2. D.10.5. Improving sector statistics This subsection focuses on statistical actions to improve external trade statistics. The objective of any intervention in external trade statistics is to ensure comparable, accurate, complete and timely published data. The assistance provided has to address all the appropriate points in the chain of data collection and processing from customs point, or collection of survey data, to publication of statistics. Typically, more than one institution is involved in the production of trade in goods statistics, generally customs and statistics authorities, who may not have much experience of working together. As typical issues include the incorrect completion of customs declarations where there is no customs interest (for example, recording of exports and of quantities (weights or \u2018supplementary units\u2019),customs / revenue authorities need to be involved throughout the planning and implementation of any intervention. Effective coordination between customs authorities and the NSI is required on: data sharing (including the legal framework), \u2022 ensuring that the customs declaration forms take statistical \u2022 needs into account IT and communications systems \u2022 supervision of the actions of customs officers and their \u2022 training and data analysis. \u2022 A formal service-level agreement or memorandum of understanding between the organisations involved is often necessary to align the interests of the two services. Possible implementation actions include the training of customs officers as well as freight forwarders responsible for completing customs declarations. External trade statistics interventions are generally developed as regional projects, where they may play a part in support of regional integration, such as regional trade agreements. A regional economic community is therefore often designated as the focal point, responsible at a minimum for compiling and publishing comparable regional trade statistics. This initial responsibility can increase to cover training in the software used and in trade statistics generally and the provision of technical assistance to its members, notably in installing and maintaining the software. The publication of regional trade statistics on-line by the regional economic community requires a statistical database and leads directly to on-line publication of other regional economic statistics. This process can be seen in operation in, for example, COMESA in eastern and southern Africa. Computer systems for customs processing and trade statistics compilation are an important part of customs and trade statistics projects, a number of alternative systems being available for both processes. Two issues are particularly important: system compatibility and the linkage of systems with specific sources of advice. European Commission support is not limited to any specific software. One widely used customs processing software is ASYCUDA , the current version of which is \u2018AsycudaWorld\u2019, a system initiated and supported by UNCTAD, though some developing countries choose other customs software and sources of technical expertise. The decision is often linked to the systems used by main trading partners. A software package for external trade statistics compilation in developing countries is Eurotrace , developed by Eurostat. Eurotrace has already been installed and will be used in around 50 countries in the Western Balkans, in Western, Southern and Eastern Africa and in the Caribbean. Eurotrace\u2019s functions are: to import, validate and manage the data necessary for \u2022 the development of external trade statistics, in particular customs data (from ASYCUDA or other customs systems); to process this data, by carrying out quality controls and \u2022 ensuring international standards are complied with; to define and load data to aggregated datasets ready for \u2022 dissemination. The priority currently being discussed (June 2009) is to support the gradual migration of the Eurotrace application towards Open Source Software (OSS). This move is likely to be linked to an increased role for the user group, which is expected to play a major role in setting future strategy. Eurostat is currently responsible for maintenance and development of Eurotrace, although this may also be handed over to the user group. Further information on Eurotrace can be found on the Circa website . Registration is required for participation in the user group. ",

National Accounts, Economic Accounts and the Non-Observed Economy The chapter in brief The main focus of this chapter is National Accounts, dealing with topics like implementation of the 1993 System of National Accounts (1993 SNA) and update to the 2008 System of National Accounts (2008 SNA). This chapter also gives the definition of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Gross National Income (GNI). It gives a short overview of the institutional sector accounts, the Supply and Use Tables and input- output Tables, etc. It also gives an overview of statistical data required for the National Accounts compilation in current and constant prices. The monitoring of a country\u2019s economy requires up-to-date and reliable National Accounts information on the structure and developments of the economic situation. The National Accounts information should also be comparable with the National Accounts information for other countries in the same region and for other ACP countries. It should also comply with international recommendations as given in 1993 SNA and 2008 SNA. The Non-Observed Economy is discussed, as well as the production borderline which is drawing a line between what should be included in the National Accounts concept of production and what to exclude. D.11.1. Policy applications: what this data are used for Today\u2019s National Accounts are the core of a modern system of economic statistics. The National Accounts are the main instrument for observing the economy as a whole, the economic growth and the macroeconomic policy. The National Accounts are also a key policy indicator. International organisations, analysts and policy makers pay great attention to the evolution of GDP and to other National Accounts variables such as final consumption, capital investment, saving, etc. In addition to annual National Accounts figures, quarterly data are also available for some developing countries. The National Accounts figures are highly dependent on the quality of the statistical system that exists in a given country. For international comparisons it is important to remember that the quality of National Accounts is not the same in all countries. Box 11.1: Historic and prevailing versions of the System of National Accounts (SNA) and the European System of Accounts (ESA) The objective of both the System of National Accounts (SNA) and the European System of Accounts (ESA) is to provide a comprehensive conceptual and accounting framework for compiling and reporting macroeconomic statistics for analysing and evaluating the performance of an economy. The 1953 SNA was published under the auspices of the UNSC. It consisted of a set of six standard accounts and a set of 12 standard tables presenting detail and alternative classifications of the flows in the economy. The 1968 SNA (the Blue Book) extended the scope of the National Accounts substantially by adding Supply and Use Tables, input-output tables, complete institutional sector accounts and balance sheets. It was also giving more attention to estimates at constant prices. With the 1968 SNA, a comprehensive effort was made to bring the SNA and the Material Product System (MPS), used in the centrally planned economies, closer together. The 1993 SNA represented a major advance in national accounting and embodies the result of harmonizing the SNA and other international statistical standards more completely than in previous versions. 1993 SNA is co-signed by the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, the OECD, the World Bank and the European Commission. The ESA 1995 is compatible with the 1993 SNA, but include additional details. The EU member countries have been obliged to implement the 1995 ESA. The 2008 SNA, The United Nations Statistical Commission called for an update of the 1993 SNA in 2003 to bring the SNA into line with the new economic environment, advances in methodological research and user needs. The 2008 SNA was prepared by the Inter- Secretariat Working Group on National Accounts (ISWGNA) , which consists of: the IMF, the OECD, the UN Statistics Division and regional commissions of the UN, the World Bank and Eurostat. The 2008 SNA is published jointly by these five organisations. The ESA 2010 is compatible with the 2008 SNA and will be accompanied by a new ESA transmission programme, intended to provide the legislative basis for the EU member countries for the transmission of National Accounts data to Eurostat from 2014. Essential objectives of both the 1993 SNA and the 2008 SNA are harmonisation between the National Accounts system and the other related systems of statistics such as IMF Balance of Payment Statistics, IMF Government Finance Statistics and IMF Banking Statistics\u2019 Accounts.

        "D 192 National Accounts, Economic Accounts and the Non-Observed Economy Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Box 11.2: Luxembourg Recommendations on Global Implementation and Outreach for the System of National Ac- counts Following the request of the United Nations Statistical Commission , Eurostat and the UN Statistics Division organised a high level conference on \u201cInternational Outreach and Coordination in National Accounts for Sustainable Growth and Development\u201d in 2008. The conference adopted the \u201cLuxembourg Recommendations on Global Implementation and Outreach for the System of National Accounts\u201d . The Luxembourg Recommendations outline the principles and recommendations that will guide the global implementation and outreach programme for the SNA in developing countries in the coming years. The Luxembourg Recommendations are grouped in according to the three distinct principles of \u201cManaging for Development Results\u201d (see section B.1.3.2.): (a) Strategic planning principle \u2013 Mainstreaming strategic planning for the development of national accounts and related basic statistics at the national, regional and international levels Best practices are readily available on how to develop strategic planning frameworks for the development of statistics. One example is PARIS 21\u2019s guidelines on National Strategies for the Development of Statistics (NSDSs) (see section C.6.1.). The United Nations Development Assistance Frameworks (UNDAFs) , the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) as well as the World Bank\u2019s Country Assistance Strategies (CAS) and World Bank/IMF Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) provide other examples of strategic planning frameworks. Recommendation 1 \u2013 Strategic planning frameworks A strategic planning framework should be formulated for national statistical capacity in national accounts and other economic statistics. This should be integrated with balance of payments, government finance statistics and environmental accounting and statistics, etc. The framework should be a component of the National Strategy for the Development of Statistics (NSDS), be regularly updated and be consistent with the GDDS and other reference frameworks of the country. National, regional and international strategies on economic statistics should be synchronized, and actions determined by information from strategic planning frameworks and other mechanisms. Further alignments have to be pursued according to various frameworks (such as the RRSF in Africa and ECLAC\u2019s Strategic Plan 2005-2015) . (b) Coordination, monitoring and reporting principle \u2013 Coordinating the programming, monitoring of and reporting on the strengthening of the statistical infrastructure for economic statistics Recommendation 2 - Coordination, monitoring and reporting Regional Commissions, in collaboration with other regional partners, play a central role in the coordination, monitoring, reporting and maintenance of existing mechanisms. The aim is to enhance the efficiency of technical cooperation programmes and alignment with national commitments for development of official statistics. National donor groups on statistics should play a role in improving coordination, monitoring and reporting in statistical capacity building. NSIs or other agreed coordinators should coordinate the national statistical system to enhance effectiveness. South- South cooperation should be further developed. Recommendation 3 - Global governance A global governance structure should be created to develop coordination, monitoring and reporting procedures, avoid duplication, to assess performance of the implementation programme and the progress of countries/regions against set benchmarks. This structure could take the structure of the latest International Comparison Program (ICP) round as a model. Modular structures should be agreed and classifications for international, regional and national statistical capacity programmes used (including quality assessments). (c) Statistical system improvement principle - Improving the national, regional and international statistical system Recommendation 4 - National statistical capacity building National statistical capacity building in national accounts and related economic statistics should be achieved through a unified implementation programme. This includes development of statistical infrastructure, sustainable donor activities, technical assistance, training capacity and application of common software tools (e.g. SDMX, ERETES) . Common training modules in national accounts and related statistics, including distance learning, should be developed. Promotion and adaptation of national accounts data for policy purposes underpin strategic planning frameworks. Recommendation 5 \u2013 SNA Knowledge Platform: statistics, information technology and management A SNA knowledge platform should be established on statistical standards, training programmes and best practices, information technology tools and management for national statistical systems. An international network for economic statistics should be established through recognized \u201cCentres of Competence\u201d. The implementation of the Luxembourg Recommendations should result in improved national statistical capacity for developing countries, including enhanced quality of statistics, better conceptual compliance, harmonization and improved comparability of statistics, strengthened coordination, monitoring and reporting between donors and recipient countries and more intensive and appropriate use of national accounts in policy making. The Luxembourg Recommendations have lead to a Global Implementation and Outreach Programme for SNA, drafted by the ISWGNA in collaboration with regional and national partners and adopted by the UN Statistical Commission in 2009. Furthermore, the Regional Commissions in collaboration with regional and national partners have formulated regional implementation and outreach programs for SNA. ",
        "D 193 National Accounts, Economic Accounts and the Non-Observed Economy Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 D.11.2. Milestones for 1993 SNA imple- mentation Both the SNA framework and the ESA framework have two main sets of accounts: The institutional sector accounts, see \u2022 section D.11.3.2 The Supply and Use Tables with goods and services \u2022 accounts, see section D.11.3.3. Six milestones for 1993 SNA implementation were formulated by the ISWGNA (the Inter-Secretariat Working Group on National Accounts) , upon request from the UN Statistical Commission. According to these recommendations, the milestones should be: Milestone 1 : Gross domestic product (GDP) at current and constant prices by industries and also final expenditure accounts. Under Phase 1, the complementary data system giving \u201c Supply and Use Tables \u201d in current and constant prices is recommended in order to establish the consistency between the output approach, the expenditure approach and the income approach. The next 1993 SNA milestones are often developed later or have not at all been developed in many developing countries: Milestone 2 : The rest of the world account with external trade figures for imports and exports of goods and services fully consistent with the IMF\u2019s BoP system (BPM5). Milestone 3 : Production accounts and generation of income accounts for the institutional sectors and a full set of sector accounts for general government. (The production and generation of income accounts cross-classified both by institutional sectors and industries should provide direct links between the Institutional sector accounts and the Supply and Use Tables and ensure the consistency between these two parts of the national accounting system.) Milestone 4 : Institutional sector accounts for the household sector and non-financial corporations. Milestones 5 and 6 : Financial accounts and capital accounts for all institutional sectors . The ISWGNA listed as a minimum requirement for the implementation of 1993 SNA, the following annual tables and accounts: Value added and gross domestic product (GDP) at current \u2022 and constant prices by activity (industry) Expenditure of GDP at current and constant prices \u2022 Components of value added by activity (industry) \u2022 Sequence of the institutional sector accounts for the total \u2022 economy, (until net lending) Rest of the world account (until net lending) \u2022 The ISWGA also recommended: Annual Supply and Use Tables \u2022 Quarterly value added and GDP at current and constant \u2022 prices by activity (industry) A drafted plan for milestones for the implementation of the 2008 SNA, presented at the 41 session of UN Statistical Commission\u2019s meetings, New York 22.-25 February 2011, is following the same sequence as the milestones for the implementation of SNA 1993. D.11.3. National Accounts concepts and definitions D.11.3.1. Gross domestic product (GDP) and Gross national income (GNI) D.11.3.1.1 Gross domestic product (GDP) Gross domestic product (GDP) is the most commonly used economic indicator in the National Accounts. GDP can be compiled both by the production, income or \u2022 expenditure approach. GDP is the sum of gross value added by all resident \u2022 producers in the economy (institutional sectors or industries). GDP is calculated without making deductions for \u2022 depreciation of produced assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources. Gross value added for a sector or industry is a measure of the contribution to GDP made by the individual producer, sector or industry. Simplified: GDP = SUM Output \u2013 SUM Intermediate consumption = Sum Value added GDP by the production approach Output at basic value is defined equal to output at producers\u2019 \u2022 value minus taxes on products plus subsidies on products. Value added for all sectors or industries is calculated as \u2022 output at basic value minus intermediate consumption at purchasers\u2019 value. GDP is calculated as the sum of value added for all sectors \u2022 or industries plus taxes on products minus subsidies on products. ",
        "D 194 National Accounts, Economic Accounts and the Non-Observed Economy Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 GDP by the expenditure approach GDP is calculated as the sum of Final consumption \u2022 (Household Government, NPISH) + Gross fixed capital formation + Change in inventories + Exports - Imports, all valued at purchasers\u2019 prices. GDP by the income approach GDP is equal to the sum of incomes (compensation of \u2022 employees, gross operating surplus and gross mixed income of firms) increased by taxes net of subsidies on production. GDP in current prices per capita is used as a broad measure of living standards, although there are a number of international statistical initiatives to provide alternative and more inclusive measures. The European Commission released a Communication in 2009, GDP and beyond - Measuring progress in a changing world , which aims to address the need for complementary indicators (alongside GDP) covering social and environmental progress. GDP is also calculated in volume terms (based on previous year\u2019s prices or on prices of a base year). GDP in volume terms is intended to allow comparison of economic growth and development over time, since the impact of price developments (inflation) has been removed. Starting with GDP at current prices, some countries deflates (i.e. divides) GDP at current prices with a \u201cprice indicator\u201d (the GDP deflator) to obtain the GDP in real terms. Other countries deflate the National Accounts at a very detailed level (see section D.11.3.4.) Annual percentage growth rate of GDP in volume terms is an important indicator. The economic growth in many developing countries is very dependent on the agriculture sector. This is especially the case for small countries. The mining industries and the information and communication industries are also fast-growing industries in many African countries. D.11.3.1.2. Gross national income (GNI) The difference between the numerical values of GDP and GNI is that GDP refers to production (output) and GNI refers to primary income. Primary incomes are income directly linked to production or ownerships of assets that may be needed for purposes of production: The total primary income receivable to residents from non-residents minus The total primary income payable by residents to non-residents = Net primary income from abroad Thus: Gross domestic product (GDP) minus Net primary income from abroad = Gross national income (GNI) D.11.3.2. The accounts for the institutional sectors and rest of the world An institutional unit is an economic entity that is capable in its own right, of owning assets, incurring liabilities and engaging in economic activities and in transactions with other entities. The institutional sectors of SNA are groups of similar kinds of institutional units. The institutional sector accounts describe for each sector the stages of the economic process and how income is generated, distributed, redistributed and used for consumption or acquisition of assts. The main institutional sectors are: Non-financial corporations, \u2022 Financial corporations \u2022 General government \u2022 Households, \u2022 Non Profit Institution Serving Households (NPISH\u2019s) \u2022 Rest of the world account \u2022 A complete system of institutional sector accounts will have a more detailed grouping of the sectors as split between different types of non-financial and financial corporations. An overview of the sequence of accounts for institutional sectors; The production accounts \u2022 The distribution and use of income accounts \u2022 The accumulation accounts \u2022 Balance sheets \u2022 ",
        "D 195 National Accounts, Economic Accounts and the Non-Observed Economy Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 D.11.3.3. National Accounts with Supply and Use Tables (SUT) The SUT focus on the product balances: where products come from and where they are used. Products are both goods and services. Supply Table: Domestic production + Imports = Use Table: Intermediate consumption + Final consumption + Gross fixed capital formation + Change in inventories + Exports For some countries, Supply and Use Tables (SUT) are fully integrated in the National Accounts system and serve both statistical and analytical purposes (ref. SNA 93 chapter XV). According to the recommendations given by ISWGNA, the first milestones for a SUT project under 1993 SNA implementation would be: Balanced Supply Tables and Use Tables compiled \u2022 both according to the production approach and to the expenditure approach. For developing countries, the balancing of the Supply and Use Tables is often of particular importance for compiling National Accounts. The compiler can then use judgement to reach a balance by adjusting the components as necessary. Several developing countries (ACP countries) are using SUT as an integral part of the compilation of final annual National Accounts at current prices. They are also used as the framework for balancing National Accounts and compiling National Accounts aggregates. Some countries are also compiling SUT in previous year\u2019s prices. Others finish SUT after the final National Accounts aggregates are published. SUT compilation incorporates the components of the three approaches for measuring Gross Domestic Product (GDP): The production approach, the expenditure approach and the income approach. This enables a single estimate of GDP to be determined, both in current prices and in volume terms. SUT represent an integral part of and check on the economic statistics and the National Accounts estimates produced for the economy. They represent an important tool for constant price estimates (the double deflation technique), giving balanced SUT in both current year\u2019s and previous year\u2019s prices. SUT should also be converted to Input-Output tables (IOT), industry by industry or product by product tables. SUT and IOT represent statistical databases for econometric models and economic planning. Developed or developing countries following the old British national accounts tradition were compiling GDP by the Income and Expenditure method and had no tradition for compiling SUT. GDP was often calculated as an average of the GDP compiled in these two ways. Good administrative data are needed for calculating GDP by the Income method. Satellite accounts, such as the \u201cTourism satellite accounts\u201d and the \u201cEnvironmental accounts\u201d can also be developed with a direct link to the SUT. D.11.3.4. National Accounts with Supply and Use Tables (SUT) in constant prices When SUT are compiled for two years, constant price compilation can take place by converting the current year SUT into the previous year\u2019s prices. Alternatively, the SUT can be compiled in current and constant prices at the same time. Advantages of calculating values at constant prices in a SUT framework The use of a SUT calculation scheme supports the \u2022 calculation of values at constant prices, volume indices and price indices for transactions of goods and services in the National Accounts. SUT at current prices provide an excellent compilation \u2022 framework for constant price estimates. SUT give a readily available overview of transaction data, price indicators and volume indicators. When SUT at constant prices are established in an \u2022 accounting framework, they give volume indices and deflators of several variables and at different levels of aggregation, interrelated in a systematic way. D.11.3.5. Quarterly National Accounts Quarterly National Accounts could constitute the central instrument for short-term economic analysis. There is strictly no difference between the quarterly accounts and the annual accounts as regards the basic principles. The aim of the quarterly accounts is to provide at the earliest possible moment reliable figures for the changes in the major macroeconomic aggregates. The quarterly accounts are simplified compared with the annual accounts, but requires timely short term indicators. ",
        "D 196 National Accounts, Economic Accounts and the Non-Observed Economy Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 D.11.4. National Accounts statistical classifications D.11.4.1. Classification for Industries and Products The International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) Revision 3 (or Revision 3.1 ) is widely used for classifying activities (industries) in business registers and in Economic statistics for enterprises. In the NSI, statisticians may work with the statistical data at a very detailed level. The National Accounts will be compiled at a more aggregated level, but might specify in detail the most important industries in the country. Because of confidentiality rules, only aggregated data may be available to the public. Many countries are now in the process of revising the classification used in registers and the economic statistics to introduce the new International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) Revision 4 . The National Accounts have to be revised accordingly. The product classification used in Supply and Use Tables must also be changed from the Central Product Classification (CPC) Version 1.0 from 1998 to the new CPC Version 2.0 , revised in accordance with the new ISIC Revision 4. For the EU member countries Eurostat has adopted NACE as the statistical classification of economic activities and CPA as the statistical classification for products. From 2009 on, the revised classification NACE Revision 2 has replaced NACE Revision 1. The new CPA 2008 is revised in accordance with NACE Rev. 2. The EU member countries must change to NACE Rev. 2 and CPA 2008 for reporting of National Accounts in 2011. D.11.4.2. Classification for Final domestic expenditure The following classifications for the expenditure approach should be integrated in the National Accounts compilation: COICO \u2022 P classification for household consumption expenditure COFO \u2022 G classification for government final consumption expenditure COPN \u2022 I classification for final consumption expenditure of the non-profit institutions serving households (NPISHs) Gross fixed capital formation by industry \u2022 D.11.5. Sources of data for the National Accounts compilation D.11.5.1. Organisation of the statistics The National Statistical Institute (NSI) is responsible for the National Accounts in the majority of developed and developing countries, but we also find countries where the National Accounts work is the responsibility of the National Central Bank. A business register in the NSI should in principle cover all production units: However, in many developing countries the register has insufficient coverage and is not regularly updated. For the National Accounts (NA) compilation, the NA divisions are relying on a large number of statistics compiled by other divisions of the NSI or by other government departments. A mixture of statistical surveys and administrative data can be used as data source for the National Accounts compilation. Line ministries such as for agriculture, health and education will often have statistical services. A formal service-level agreement or memorandum of understanding between the NSI and other government departments compiling statistics is sometimes necessary to align the interests of the services. The compilation and balancing of the National Accounts implies in many developing countries that the National Accounts staff are both controlling and correcting different types of statistics used as input for the National Accounts compilation. D.11.5.2. Data sources for National Accounts D.11.5.2.1. Data sources for annual National Accounts in current prices In a developing country, all economic statistics and also relevant data sources from different government ministries should be used for the national accounts compilation. Important data sources are: Agriculture statistics and agriculture census (see \u2022 chapter D.17) Livestock censuses \u2022 Fisheries statistics (see \u2022 section D.17.2.7) Banking statistics and statistics for other financial \u2022 institutions Annual Economic Survey for large enterprises or for a \u2022 sample of enterprises (see chapter D.13) Energy statistics \u2022 Government Audited Accounts and Budget Documents \u2022 (see chapter D.19) Labour force survey (see \u2022 chapter D.27) External trade statistics with value and quantity data for \u2022 imports and exports (see chapter D.10) Integrated Household Survey \u2022 Consumer price indices (see \u2022 chapter D.12) Population Census, Housing Census (see \u2022 chapter D.22 and chapter D.16) ",
        "D 197 National Accounts, Economic Accounts and the Non-Observed Economy Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Banking statistics and statistics for other financial institutions Statistics for financial institutions are from the National Central Bank or from the Financial Market Supervising and Regulatory Agencies. Special rules are given for compiling and distributing the production from banks, based on interests received and paid, called \u201cfinancial intermediates services from banks\u201d (FISIM). FISIM allocation in the National Accounts is based on the monetary and banking statistics and information from the Balance of Payments (BOP) and the International Investment Position (IIP). General government budgets and accounts In the National Accounts, the value of the output of services from general government is calculated as the sum of the production costs: intermediate consumption, consumption of fixed capital and compensation of employees. On the expenditure side, gross output is equal to the sum of the government fees (sales of goods and services) and government final consumption expenditure (the residual). The government final consumption expenditure should be classified by the COFOG groups. Some countries are not able to compile figures for consumption of fixed capital for the government, and that will give an underestimation of value added for general government Integrated Household Surveys or Household Budget Surveys When they are available, data from Integrated Household Surveys or Household Budget Surveys can be used directly or indirectly as a data source for estimating Household Final Consumption Expenditure. Even with annual Household Budget Surveys, small samples and a high degree of non- response might make this important data source unreliable. For estimating the Household consumption figures, the results from the Household Budget Surveys have to be evaluated and compared or balanced with other data sources used for supply of goods and services. Imports and exports of goods and services Detailed data for imports and exports of goods and services are of great importance for the National Accounts and SUT compilation in developing countries. Eurostat has developed the EUROTRACE software package to manage data for external trade statistics (see chapter D.10). The balance of payments statistics should be the mirror of the Rest of the world account in the National Accounts. The current account of the balance of payments statistics measures all current transactions between a country and the rest of the world, including transactions in goods and services (the balance of trade); factor payments: income from capital and remittances by workers abroad; as well as international transfers. The definition given in the \u2018Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual, sixth edition (2008) (BPM6) for trade in goods\u2019 is consistent with the 2008 SNA definitions. Good routines for data sharing (including the legal framework) are required between the NSI and the Central Bank. In some countries the Balance of Payments is compiled within the NSI which should ensure full harmonisation between the National Accounts and the Balance of Payments figures. D.11.5.2.2. Data sources for quarterly national accounts For a developing country with scarce resources, production of regular and timely monthly or quarterly statistics can be very difficult or almost impossible. Main statistics which would be needed for timely quarterly national accounts are: Monthly production in agriculture, fishing, etc. \u2022 Monthly or quarterly index of industrial production, etc. \u2022 Monthly import and export statistics \u2022 Monthly producer price indices and consumer price \u2022 indices D.11.5.2.3. Price indices or volume data for compiling national accounts in constant prices Price or volume indices are needed for compiling supply of products and use of products in constant prices. The price indices can be based on Producer Price indices and Consumer price indices. Unit value indices can be calculated based on volume indicators. Input price indices can be used for government services where no relevant price or volume information exists. Producer Price indices (PPI) are mainly based on questionnaires from surveys where the prices are defined as sales price at the factory gate to the domestic market. Consumer price indices (CPI) are acceptable price indices for service industries, supplying services to the households. Unit value indices: When the product specification is so detailed that the products can be regarded as homogeneous products, unit value indices can be used. They are acceptable for deflating agricultural, forestry and fishing products and also mining products. Input price indices: Where no available price indices or volume indicators exist for business services, input price indices can also be used. The input price indices for the different industries should be compiled by weighting price indices for intermediate consumption and the wage indices for compensation of employees for the different industries. Price indices for imports and exports are important for calculating SUT in constant prices, ",
        "D 198 National Accounts, Economic Accounts and the Non-Observed Economy Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 For imports and exports of goods, special exports and imports price indices might be collected. Unit value price indices for ordinary homogenous products can also be based on customs declarations for imports and exports. D.11.6. Analysing data quality and iden- tifying problems D.11.6.1. Specific quality issues for National Accounts The quality of National Accounts data depends on the methodology used and the data coverage, how quickly statistics are published and their compliance with international recommendations. Delays, statistical errors and incomplete statistical data may require time consuming estimation of the National Accounts figures. Several versions of preliminary and corrected data from statistical surveys will also require corrections of the input data for National Accounts and new balancing of the National Accounts figures. Comparability between National Accounts in different developing countries is a huge problem. Some countries are still compiling National Accounts according to 1968 SNA or have only partly introduced 1993 SNA (see Box 11.1). Inclusion or exclusion of non- observed economy is also a problem for the comparability between National Accounts in different countries. To evaluate the National Accounts, IMF is conducting user assessments in both developed and developing countries to prepare the IMF\u2019s Reports on Observance of Standards and Codes\u2019 (ROSCs). The IMF\u2019s reports are focusing on topics as prerequisites of quality, methodological soundness and accuracy and reliability. D.11.6.2. The \u201cnon-observed\u201d economy D.11.6.2.1. Activities missing from statistical data collec- tion The economic activities missing from statistical data collections and from administrative sources have become known as the \u201cnon-observed economy\u201d (NOE ). NOE refers to productive activities that may not be captured in the basic data sources used for compiling national accounts. Elements not observed will include estimates for informal enterprises not covered in statistical enquiries and corrections to some measures of informal enterprises that are captured in statistical enquiries. The following activities should be recorded within the production boundary in the national accounts: underground activities, \u2022 informal activities, including production of households for \u2022 their own final use, illegal activities should be included in GDP but this is \u2022 difficult in practice. Different way of measuring illegal economy also reduces the comparability between countries. other activities omitted due to deficiencies in the basic data \u2022 collection program. Production of households for their own final use is defined as those productive activities that result in goods or services consumed or capitalized by the households that produced them. The following types of production by households are included within the production boundary whether intended for own final consumption or not: Production of goods for own final consumption, e.g. \u2022 of agricultural products and their subsequent storage, gathering of berries or other uncultivated crops, forestry and the collection of firewood, hunting and fishing. According to 2008 SNA also other kinds of processing such \u2022 as dressmaking and production of pottery and furniture should be included within the production boundary for countries where this is important. Own-account production of housing services by owner- \u2022 occupiers; Own-account construction, including that by households; \u2022 Production of services by paid domestic staff; \u2022 Domestic and personal services provided by members of a household for their own consumption are not included within the production boundary. This means that activities like cooking, housecleaning, and looking after children and elderly people are excluded from GDP. These services are only included if they are carried out by people paid for doing so. D.11.6.2.2. The informal sector and the non-observed economy The informal sector definition was adopted by the Fifteenth International Conference of Labour Statisticians in January 1993 and was linked to the conceptual framework of the SNA. The informal sector was considered a sub-sector of the SNA institutional sector \u2018households\u2019, but the expression \u201cinformal sector\u201d used in the context of the ILO work is used with a different meaning from the SNA grouping of institutional units. In the SNA, sectors are made up of complete institutional units. The ILO work focuses only on production activities and does not include the consumption and accumulation activities of the unit. Households having no productive activity are simply not included in the informal sector. ",
        "D 199 National Accounts, Economic Accounts and the Non-Observed Economy Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 The non-observed economy (NOE ) overlaps with, but is not the same as the ILO concept of the informal sector. The observed and non-observed informal sector involves in many least-developed and developing countries an important labour force, which contributes to economic production. The main aim of compiling statistics should be to cover as far as possible the productive activities belonging to the SNA. An exhaustive coverage of the National Accounts is an important quality aspect. The informal sector may be broadly characterized as consisting of units engaged in the production of goods or services with the primary objective of generating employment and incomes for the persons concerned. These units typically operate at a low level of organization, with little or no division between labour and capital as factors of production and on a small scale. Labour relations - where they exist - are based mostly on casual employment, kinship or personal and social relations rather than contractual arrangements with formal guarantees. Production units of the informal sector have the characteristic features of household enterprises. The fixed and other assets used do not belong to the production units as such but to their owners. The units as such cannot engage in transactions or enter into contracts with other units, nor incur liabilities, on their own behalf. The owners have to raise the necessary finance at their own risk and are personally liable, without limit, for any debts or obligations incurred in the production process. Expenditure for production is often indistinguishable from household expenditure. Similarly, capital goods such as buildings or vehicles may be used indistinguishably for business and household purposes. A restriction is that at least some of the production must be sold or bartered. Some of the household enterprises that the SNA treats as producing \u201cfor own final use\u201d are excluded from the informal sector if they produce exclusively for own final use . The activity of dwelling services produced purely for owner-occupation is excluded from the Informal sector. The informal economy is considered as comprising informal employment (without secure contracts, worker benefits, or social protection): Informal employment in informal enterprises (small \u2022 unregistered or unincorporated enterprises), including: employers, employees, own-account operators, and unpaid family workers in informal enterprises; Informal employment outside informal enterprises (for \u2022 formal enterprises, for households, or with no fixed employer), including: domestic workers, casual or day labourers, temporary or part-time workers industrial outworkers (including home-workers), and unregistered or undeclared workers. D.11.7. Improving the National Accounts D.11.7.1. Organisation of the work Difference in economic growth observed for different developing countries may not always be real, but due to insufficient economic statistics which have required estimation and even guessing. The NSI management and the National Accounts Divisions should have close contact, including regular meetings with other data producing agencies, such as the Central Bank and various ministries producing economic statistics for different sectors. It is important that other data providers understand and give priority to the data requirement for the National Accounts compilation. Turnover of staff is a big problem in the NSI in many ACP countries. Turnover of qualified and trained staff is very serious for the National Accounts. The compilation of National Accounts requires special knowledge about the country\u2019s economy, special training in the National Accounts compilation methodology and also knowledge about the coverage and quality of the different economic statistics required for the National Accounts compilation.

The aim of this Handbook is to support the implementation of the 2008 SNA in Least Developed Countries, small island and fragile states that are in Milestone 0 of the implementation process, i.e. countries that are either in the early phases of implementing 1993 SNA, still follow the 1968 SNA or do not follow any SNA at all. Follow-up activities include the setting up of a remote on-line helpdesk support for methodological question, as well as the preparation of an e-learning tool which is based on the Kangar\u00e9 module for National Accounts training and which is compatible with the \u2018Essential SNA\u2019 Handbook. The Handbook will also be the translated to French and Spanish, and each year 2 workshops will be facilitated in ACP and/or ALA. Eurostat anticipates that this \u2018Essential SNA\u2019 Handbook, aimed at users building the very basics of National Accounts in their countries, can be used as part of a package of standard SNA manuals covering all levels of SNA implementation needs. Based on input from regional organisations and from high-level experts in National Accounts, the Handbook presents the following key issues for basic implementation of 2008 SNA: Institutional issues : the necessity of creating a legal framework for National Accounts implementation and the strategy for developing the statistical system as base for National Accounts. This also includes dissemination issues; Technical issues regarding the statistical infrastructure , such as the business register and the classifications which should be used; Technical issues on statistical and administrative data sources required for National Accounts compilation, especially the use of data to compile National Accounts indicators; Specific issues for National Accounts compilation, common to all target countries. These include, amongst others, the informal sector and the compilation of National Accounts in the conditions of high inflation. Box 11.4: ERETES National Accounts software ERETES is an information system used for the elaboration of National Accounts according to the SNA. It is used in around 30 countries all over the world. Main programs concerning implementation are carried out in Africa and Latin America, funded by amongst others France, UNDP, etc. Eurostat is engaged in the transfer of knowledge to the community of users. In particular, 4 regular regional workshops are organised. Furthermore, the ERETES users group is established to define mid-term orientations. In line with the Luxembourg Recommendations suggesting using a common tool for the production of National Accounts, Eurostat continues its support to ERETES. The tasks during 2009-2012 include upgrading ERETES to 2008 SNA (including the balance sheet and the production of long time series), informal sector and quarterly National Accounts, as well as four regional or national workshops. ERETES operates from a database with the basic economic data around which different technical tools (commodity flows, branch accounts, matrices from whom to whom, summary tables) or organizational (follow-up of work, note pad, online help) allows coordinated and consistent teamwork. It reconciliates the data and allows calculation of GDP according to the 3 traditional approaches (production, expenditures, income). ERETES is available in English, French and Spanish. The monitoring is ensured by a Directors\u2019 Committee, consisting of the French national statistical institute INSEE and the copyright co- owners Eurostat and the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. D.11.7.2. Comprehensive revisions The 2008 SNA is intended for use by all countries, having been designed to accommodate need of countries at different stages of economic development. Many developing countries have not implemented the complete 1998 SNA and might decide to start directly with the 2008 SNA. The challenges for all countries, also developing countries are: Plan and complete the reclassification to introduce ISIC \u2022 Rev. 4 in the National Accounts. Correspondingly, the product classification in Supply and Use tables also has to be changed to the new Central Product Classification version 2 (CPC). Carry through the major revision for introducing \u2022 2008 SNA. These challenges also apply to the EU Member States in 2010-2014: Complete the reclassification and the revision required \u2022 to introduce NACE Rev. 2 in the National Accounts from 2011. Correspondingly, the product classification in Supply and Use tables also has to be changed to the new Statistical Classification of Products by Activity (CPA2008). Accomplish the major revision for introducing ESA 2010. \u2022 ",
        "D 201 National Accounts, Economic Accounts and the Non-Observed Economy Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Box 11.5: Technical advice and training in National Accounts: Institutional co-operation project in Malawi Norway is supporting Malawi through an \u201cInstitutional Cooperation Project\u201d, a twinning project between Statistics Norway and the National Statistical Office of Malawi , the Ministry of Economic Planning and Development and the Ministry of Finance. One goal of this project is to give technical advice and training for a sustainable National Accounts system. Improved quality and coverage of the National Accounts system should give a much improved basis for economic and social policy planning in the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Planning and Development. The objective of the project is to give training to the National Accounts and Balance of Payment Branch in NSI (NA/BOP branch) to introduce a sustainable methodology for the compilation of the National Accounts according to international recommendations (see Box 11.1). The staff of the NA/BOP branch has theoretical and practical \u201chands-on training\u201d by long- and short-term advisers from Statistics Norway. Some of the statisticians in the NA/BOP branch have also participated in IMF National Accounts training courses or on SADC courses. Based on available economic statistics in Malawi, it was decided to start with Supply and Use Tables (SUT), in accordance with SNA93. Important data sources were Crop production statistics, Annual Economic Surveys for large enterprises, Government accounts, Integrated Household Surveys and a planned Agriculture Census. For external trade statistics, the EUROTRACE application package gives detailed information about imports and exports. The Balance of Payments (BoP) figures in the NA/BOP branch cover import and export of services. The frame for the first benchmark SUT was considered carefully regarding the level of detail. The following assessments were important: Establishing an aggregated National Accounts Industry Classification relevant for Malawi, specifying around 100 industries based on ISIC 3.1; \u2022 Establishing a National Accounts Product Classification based on CPC, specifying around 400 products. Important food products in the Malawian \u2022 economy were specified, also with a split between products sold to the market and products for own use. Products as food aid have been given special product codes. The main data sources for the constant price compilation are price indices for agriculture products, consumer price indices and unit value price indices for imports and exports, based on value and quantity data from the EUROTRACE software. The methodology introduced, with constant price compilation in previous year\u2019s prices and chain price indices, was new to the Malawi government. However, it was accepted since it is the recommended methodology in SNA93. Excel work sheets are used for data input and the final tabulations. The NA/SUT data are stored in a database. The NA/BOP branch uses software provided by Statistics Norway which interacts with the Excel work-sheets to perform balancing of the SUT and to calculate the complex formulas of the SUT in current and previous year\u2019s prices and the Input-Output tables. In March 2007, revised National Accounts figures for the years 2002-2004 and preliminary aggregated figures for the years 2005 and 2006 were released. Comparison between old and new estimates showed that the level of GDP in current prices was revised up by 38.0 per cent in 2004 and 37.4 and 37.7 per cent in the two preceding years. The \u2018Malawi National Accounts Report 2002-2005\u2019 explains the concepts, sources and methods used. National Accounts figures for Malawi are also published by the Reserve Bank of Malawi in its \u201cFinancial and Economic Review\u201d and by the Ministry of Development Planning and Cooperation in the \u201cAnnual Economic Report\u201d. A further development has been to integrate the main parts of the Institutional Sector Accounts in the National Accounts System. An Excel workbook with the sequence of institutional sector accounts from Production account to Capital account has been developed. The data sources are from the SUT, the Government accounts and from Balance of Payments for the Rest of the World. The Non-financial corporations and Household sectors are combined and used as a residual. The \u201cNational Accounts and Balance of Payments Technical Committee\u201d are compiling preliminary annual National Accounts estimates after conducting a small Business Interview sample twice a year. A main revision of the National Accounts for Malawi is planned for 2011. The classification system will be based on ISIC 4 and CPC and some main aspects from SNA2008 will be introduced. Important new data sources are: A National Census of Agriculture and Livestock (NACAL) for 2007, the 2008 Population and Housing Census, revised data from the Annual Economic survey and an integrated Household Survey for the year 2010 (IHS-3). A team of economic and environmental experts was in 2010 engaged by the Ministry of Development Planning and Cooperation, financed by the UNDP, to assess the contribution of natural resources to the Malawi economy. A conclusion was \u201c\u201d the GDP figures understate the true contribution of forestry by not capturing the extensive use of wood for fuel \u201d. The team had also other examples; The NSO defended the NA figures, answering \u201c in any country in the world, some activities in the economy are not fully factored into the official GDP measurement \u201d.

These regional programmes are aligned with the global implementation programme for the 2008 SNA , covering three stages for the implementation of the 2008 SNA through a multi-year programme: Stage I: Review of strategic framework and detailing of national and regional implementation programmes; Stage II: Adaptation of classification frameworks, business registers and frames, surveys, administrative data sources and information technology infrastructure; and Stage III: Application of adapted frameworks and source data, backcasting and change-over to 2008 SNA.

        "D 207 Price Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 D.12. Price statistics The chapter in brief This chapter covers the full range of price statistics, concentrating on the main indicators. It starts with the policy applications of price data. The emphasis is on explaining the differences between the various measures of prices and inflation. The main price indicators and activities are presented. These are the Consumer Price Index, Harmonised Consumer Price Indices, the Producer Price Index, Export and Import Price and Unit Value Indices, prices in the National Accounts and Purchasing Power Parities. Each section starts with an explanation of the applications of the data. Emphasis is placed on issues relating to developing countries. The chapter then identifies the main national and international data sources for price statistics, which are relatively straightforward and accessible. The chapter then looks at how to examine the quality of price data. The chapter concludes with recommendations on how to improve price statistics. D.12.1. Policy applications of the data Prices are used everywhere and every day to measure the relative value of goods and services in terms of money. Price statistics are used to measure changes in the relative values of goods and services, to measure changes in the overall price level \u2013 inflation, price stability or disinflation \u2013 and to compare the overall level of prices between countries. The most widespread use of price statistics is to measure inflation. There is no single measure of price changes that is useful for all purposes. Instead, various indices are used for different purposes, including the following: The Consumer Price Index (CPI); \u2022 The Producer Price Index (PPI); \u2022 The GDP (Gross Domestic Product) deflator. \u2022 The CPI is the most common measure of inflation because it is available monthly in most countries, it is often published rapidly and its meaning can fairly easily be understood. The CPI is used to alter the price of commercial contracts in response to inflation \u2013 this is called price indexation. Contracts that include price indexation clauses can include rents, wages, social protection benefits or financial instruments such as interest payments. The CPI is also a mean for evaluating changes in living standards. The CPI is commonly used to represent the overall inflation rate of an economy, even though the index covers only consumer expenditure. The advantage of using the CPI is its frequency and rapidity of publication. Monetary policies, such as inflation targets, use the CPI for these reasons. Many developing countries compile a Producer price index PPI on a monthly or quarterly basis. This is a measure of the cost of goods as they leave the factory. The PPI is therefore an advance or \u2018leading\u2019 indicator of inflation. However, it is more difficult to produce an accurate PPI than the CPI in many developing countries. The GDP deflator is more demanding still to calculate. It is produced on a quarterly basis in developed and many middle income countries and in some low income countries, usually on an annual basis. Its production always takes longer than the CPI or PPI. Consumers, businesses, government and investors often need to understand whether a particular price, of petrol or telephone services for example, is increasing relative to other prices. In regulated sectors, there is a clear policy interest in analysing sector price changes relative to other sectors. Telecommunications is a good example, as are the prices of agricultural products (see section D.17.2.2). The CPI and PPI provide useful information for this purpose. Specific sector price statistics may also be published but this is not common in developing countries. External trade policy proposals require price information as an input to analysing the potential impact of trade liberalisation, for example. Export and import price indices or unit prices provide the necessary information. The CPI can also be used to compare inflation rates and hence inflation policy outcomes between countries. When economies are closely linked and share common policies, such as a common currency, comparing inflation rates becomes very important. To ensure that the comparisons are meaningful, the participating countries must harmonise their consumer price indices. Harmonising price statistics means adopting a common nomenclature and methodologies; national consumption baskets can be maintained. The EU harmonised index of consumer prices is known as the HICP. An HICP can also be used at sector level to compare the effects of changes in energy prices, for example, on each country\u2019s price level. Comparing price levels between countries is important for a variety of uses. One set of measures of relative price levels are known as purchasing power parities (PPPs). These are \u2018exchange\u2019 rates that are based on the actual cost of comparable goods and services. PPPs convert GDP and other measures of value into a common, technical currency, eliminating the effect of price level differences across countries. Currency exchange rates do not meet these policy needs because they are determined not only by price level differences, but by other factors as well. The PPP exchange rate is therefore a measure of the difference in the price level between countries. ",
        "D 208 Price Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 International and regional policy purposes where PPPs are used include: 39 International poverty headcount index (World Bank) \u2022 Comparing relative sizes of economies and estimating \u2022 weighted averages of regional growth rates (IMF) Allocation of structural and cohesion funds (European \u2022 Commission) Human Development Index (UNDP) \u2022 Gender empowerment measures (UNDP) \u2022 Health inequality assessment (World Health \u2022 Organization) Assessing per capita expenditures in education (U.N. \u2022 Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) Monitoring the welfare of children (U.N. Children\u2019s Fund) \u2022 Designing effective aid programs (International \u2022 Organizations) Other uses of PPPs include: Analysis of an economy\u2019s comparative advantage on prices and expenditures of goods or services (national policy makers) Evaluation of investment costs and industry growth potential across countries PPP adjusted cost of living allowances (users include EU, UN, OECD, NATO, international agencies, non-government organisations and multinational corporations) Selecting the price statistics that are based on the most appropriate concept is particularly important in analysing open developing economies. This is because prices in different parts of the economy can change considerably relative to one another. For example, consumer goods prices might increase much more slowly than investment goods prices after a currency devaluation. The policy profile of the CPI is among the highest of any official statistics because of its direct relevance to the population, its easily understood nature and its frequency. In many developing countries, the CPI is the only statistics series that is regularly updated on the National Statistics Institute\u2019s website. Newspaper reports of the CPI are common in many, perhaps most, countries. High or rising inflation as measured by the CPI is used as common basis for accusations of government policy failure, whether justified or not. It is also a common tactic to accuse governments of manipulating the CPI, once more whether this is justified or not. For these reasons, it is very important that the way that the CPI is measured is accurate and transparent. 39 World Bank: Major uses of PPP results The importance of the CPI to economic policy, its relative ease of collection and its public profile mean that it is usually accorded a high priority in developing countries. The PPI and related indices are also often given a fairly high priority, although achieving reasonable accuracy requires a considerable sustained effort. Import and export price indices often have a lower profile, partly due to the difficulties in their compilation. GDP deflator calculation is often accorded a fairly low profile in developing countries due to capacity constraints. D.12.2. Concepts and definitions D.12.2.1 Overview This chapter covers any statistical activity dealing with prices, like Consumer Price Indices (CPI), inflation, Producer Price Indices (PPI), price indexes for specific products and services (e.g. Information and Communication Technology products), Purchasing Power Parities (PPPs), and international comparisons of GDP. Not covered here are interest rates, wages and currency exchange rates. As we saw in the section above on uses of data, price statistics are designed to record price levels and changes in different parts of the economy: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures the changes \u2022 over time in the price paid for a basket of goods and services that is representative of consumer expenditure; The Producer Price Index (PPI) measures the average \u2022 change over time in the basic prices actually received by producers of goods and services. The GDP (Gross Domestic Product) deflator is a measure \u2022 of inflation in the whole economy, taken from national accounts data. Only the GDP deflator (and series related to it) is a measure of price changes in the economy as a whole. This comes at the cost of less frequent publication, a longer time needed for its preparation and increased complexity, hence its non- availability in some developing countries. Most price statistics series are usually indices. A price index can be understood as an aggregate price of all the different items (goods and services) that are included in a representative \u2018basket\u2019. In its base period a price index is given a value such as 100; index values for later periods indicate the subsequent average change in prices from the base period. The (CPI) consumption basket (or product list) is a weighted list of goods and services that are acquired or used by consumers, in the case of the CPI. The PPI basket is the weighted list of goods and services sold to domestic businesses. The weights are numbers that reflect the relative importance of each item as part of the total basket. ",
        "D 209 Price Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 How are the basket and its weights set up? In the base year, a detailed survey or census is used to collect precise information about the goods and services exchanged and the prices paid or received for them. A household expenditure survey is usually used for the consumer price index. A business census or detailed survey is needed for the PPI. The goods and services bought or sold are organised into elementary groups of similar items according to a standard classification . Within each elementary group, representative items are selected. Their price movements, taken together, provide a good estimate of the overall change in prices for the elementary group as a whole. The price change of the elementary group is calculated as the average change in the prices of these items from the base year average. The price changes of each elementary group are progressively aggregated to the overall index using the expenditure weights. The basket of representative goods and services needs to be changed to reflect changes in consumer preferences as well as the emergence of new products. Therefore, the basket should be updated as often as possible. In developed countries, the objective is to update baskets yearly. The data and resources required may be too onerous for some countries, so that updates occur at lower frequency. This issue is looked at in more detail in section D.12.2.2 below. The concept of \u2018representative\u2019 goods and services was introduced above at the level of the elementary group. Representative goods and services are selected for the baskets of national consumer and producer price indices. Where price indices are required to be comparable internationally, a weaker test is sometimes used to select goods and services than representativeness: their relevance . A good or service is relevant if it is commonly available in the usual markets. The characteristics of comparability and representativeness of goods and services are often not fully compatible. The ideas of random selection and of coverage are important for analysing the quality of consumer price surveys. For a price survey to be unbiased, the price of any given exchange of goods or services must have an equal probability of being measured than any other. This type of selection is known as random sampling . However, prices can vary between different parts of a country and between rural and urban areas. Prices can also be different in various outlet types within the same region. Outlets for the price survey are therefore selected to reflect the value of transactions that are made in each region and each type of outlet. The information on the value of purchases made in each region and each type of outlet should be taken from a household income and expenditure survey, supplemented with other data sources. Stratified random sampling requires that the price of any exchange of goods or services has an equal probability of being measured, while allowing for different categories or strata of transaction. The final concept that needs to be presented is timeliness: the rapid, consistent and predictable dissemination is perhaps more important in the field of price statistics than any other. Not all prices can be collected within the time horizon and estimations that use partial data are often compiled and disseminated. If estimations are used for the main CPI, then a revision may be published with the next month\u2019s data, the revised figure being final. D.12.2.2 The Consumer Price Index The international reference \u2018Consumer price index manual: Theory and practice\u2019 40 , defines the CPI as: \u201c... an index that measures the rate at which the prices of consumption goods and services are changing from month to month (or from quarter to quarter). The prices are collected from shops or other retail outlets. The usual method of calculation is to take an average of the period-to-period price changes for the different products, using as weights the average amounts that households spend on them. CPIs are official statistics that are usually produced by national statistical offices, ministries of labour or central banks. They are published as quickly as possible, typically about ten days after the end of the most recent month or quarter. \u201d In most countries, the CPI is based on a monthly survey in which price data is collected from points of sale. This data is supplemented by prices collected from service providers, such as electricity, telecommunications and postal services. In developing countries, the almost exclusive method of price collection is that statistical officers physically visit the points of sale. The usual process is that data is collected on paper forms, entered on computer, transmitted to the national centre and checked at various stages. The procedures vary considerably between countries, the logistics often being complicated. The use of hand-held computers or telephones to enter data is not yet common in developing countries but has been pilot tested, at least. 41 The consumer price index is so central to official statistics that it is worth a close look. The main text deals with the main issues from a general perspective. Box 12.1 examines in more detail how a CPI is produced. 40 Published 2 004 by the International working group on price statistics, consisting of ILO/ IMF/OECD/ UNECE/ Eurostat/ World Bank (p xix) 41 \u2018 The Use of Hand-Held Computers for the Collection CPI Price Data \u2019, David Fenwick and Ben Whitestone, African Statistics Journal, Vol 8 , 2009 ",
        "D 210 Price Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 The CPI basket of goods and services needs to reflect the detailed structure of all consumption of residents. The source of this information is a detailed national survey such as a household expenditure survey (HES). The Consumer price index manual notes that (pp 22-23): \u201c An HES is a sample survey of thousands of households that are asked to keep records of their expenditures on different kinds of consumer goods and services over a specified period of time, such as a week or longer. The size of the sample obviously depends on the resources available, but also on the extent to which it is desired to break down the survey results by region or type of household. HESs are costly operations .\u201d Household expenditure surveys are considered in greater depth in chapter D.25 Income and Consumption. The key issue here is that the HES needs to be designed with the consumer price index in mind. The nomenclature of consumer goods and services adopted in the HES needs to be compatible with the national classification of consumption transactions, normally COICOP. Since updating the CPI is not the primary purpose of the HES, the desired outcome requires the two departments both to appreciate the need for effective coordination and to carry it out. This is not always the case. In developing countries, HESs are undertaken and the weights recalculated at best every five years. The \u2018Consumer Price Index Manual\u2019 notes 42 that the \u201d 2003 ICLS [International Conference of Labour Statisticians] resolution proposes more frequent updates of the weights, such as once every five years, to ensure their relevance. Countries which are experiencing significant economic changes and thus more rapid changes in consumption patterns should update their weights even more frequently, say annually .\u201d Elsewhere, the manual suggests that adding small, targeted consumer surveys to the 5-year cycle can be beneficial. The Consumer price index manual also discusses the use of independent national accounts data to supplement HESs. However, this is not usually applied in developing countries, due to the capacity constraints in national accounts that were discussed in chapter D.11 \u2018National Accounts, Economic Accounts, Non-Observed Economy\u2019. National accounts data is one main source of the basket weighting system used in the HICP. The CPI should, as we have seen, cover all consumer transactions in goods and services. The price survey should therefore represent the geographical distribution of consumer transactions. However, in some developing countries, only urban areas are covered or even only the major city. Limiting geographical coverage gives the CPI an urban bias, which is detrimental to its accuracy. This is especially the case in countries where prices can change at different rates in different regions. 42 chapter 4, para 4.50 page 65 Box 12.1: Producing a consumer price index Consumer price indices provide regular measures of changes in consumer prices that need to be unbiased and comparable. There is a standard framework that allows countries to produce a CPI that reflects national needs and the available budget. This framework consists of: The classific \u2022 ation of goods and services; The methods used to define the basket of goods and services and \u2022 their weights; The calculations used to derive unbiased measures of the average \u2022 price changes The Classification of Individual Consumption by Purpose (COICOP, 1999 version) is the standard classification or nomenclature used to identify and classify all consumer transactions in goods and services. In the EU, a slightly modified version of COICOP is used for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices. These systems are tree-shaped or hierarchical: total consumption is represented by the trunk, sector aggregates of goods or services are represented by large branches and specific goods and services by the smallest branches. Specific, representative goods and services are selected from a household budget survey to cover a large proportion of household expenditure. Similar goods and services are organised into \u2018elementary\u2019 groups, using the classification system. In economic terms, each elementary group is made up of goods and services that are close substitutes for one another. The index for each elementary group of goods and services is calculated first. Weights may be calculated or estimated from the household budget survey to represent the proportional expenditure on each item and / or to take into account the amount spent in different types of points of sale. Weights may not be used at the elementary level if the household budget survey is not extensive enough to give sufficient knowledge about the relative amounts spent on each item. 43 The next step is to calculate price indices for higher level groups that cover a wider proportion of consumption. The overall consumer price index is calculated at the top level. At each level, the index is calculated as the weighted average of the changes in its components. The weights for these higher level aggregates are taken from the household budget survey. Regional consumer price indices are aggregated to a national index in much the same way. At each level, the aggregate index is calculated as the arithmetic or (preferably) the geometric mean of the relative price changes of each of its components. The method that is usually used for the CPI calculates the (weighted) average price change over time for a price of a basket of goods and services that was fixed in a base period, usually a base year . This is known as a Laspeyres price index . Although the CPI is often used as a measure of the cost of living, a Laspeyres price index is not a true cost of living index. This is because consumers are likely to buy more of goods and services that become relatively cheaper over time and less of those that become more expensive. As the base year becomes more distant in the past, the upward bias becomes greater. In some developed countries, the weights are now updated every year, a process called \u2018chaining\u2019. A true cost of living index can be calculated by using both the current year and the previous year as the base periods. The CPI is validated, tabulated, analysed and disseminated. As the CPI results can be presented in a quite compact table, dissemination via internet is fairly common. In many developing countries, the CPI is the only statistical dataset regularly updated on an NSI website. 43 43 Consumer price index manual: Theory and practice paragraphs 1.124 \u2013 1.126, page 15 ",
        "D 211 Price Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Clearly, extending the price collection survey to a wider area is costly and may be difficult to organise, especially outside major urban areas. On the other hand, consumption transactions are more concentrated in urban areas. Hence, only a relatively small geographical extension of the survey outside of major urban areas may be necessary. It is possible to analyse whether price changes are significantly different between regions on the basis of a pilot price survey or other data sets. Another type of restriction on CPI coverage occurs when only certain types of outlets are covered by the price survey: only traditional markets, for example, or only shops or supermarkets. Price levels and changes are often different in different outlet types. Full prices survey coverage therefore requires that all existing types of outlets, such as supermarkets, local or traditional shops, open markets, roadside stalls and itinerant hawkers need to be surveyed. As soon as internet- based sales become significant in developing countries, they also need to be included. Although the CPI needs to have national coverage, there exists a wide range of policy questions for which measures of price changes are needed that concern parts of a country\u2019s economy. The most evident of these are regional price indices, as well as indices that cover only urban or rural expenditure. Where there exists a large disparity in income and wealth between the richest and poorest of the country, the much greater expenditure of the wealthy will dominate the overall CPI. In this situation, one possibility would be to prepare \u2018sub-indices\u2019 based on, for example, the expenditure baskets of the lower quartile, the middle two quartiles and the upper quartile of the population by income. Alternatively, some countries exclude the expenditure of the highest earners 44 . In this case, the resulting index is better at measuring the cost of living as perceived by the majority of the population than it is at measuring overall inflation. Many goods and services are only available or only widely purchased during part of a year: seasonal fruits and vegetables and clothing are two obvious examples. The problem of \u2018seasonality\u2019 can be addressed, for example, by replacing seasonal goods by those of other seasons. The monthly changes in year-on-year price differences of seasonal goods need to be applied. Chapter 22 of the Consumer Price Index Manual considers the problem at length. A similar problem is that of quality change. For example, new models of mobile telephones, cars and computers have an improved performance than those they replace, in that consumers prefer the characteristics of the new product to the old ones. This is a particular problem in developing countries: new and improved products are continually introduced to the market and appropriate methods need to be applied. 44 One example is the UK Retail Prices Index (RPI), which also excludes pensioner households who are dependent mainly on state benefits. The UK CPI, a component of the European HICP does not exclude these groups. Statisticians need both training and experience to know how to identify and apply an appropriate solution to these problems. Developing countries can find it difficult to keep these skilled staff within price statistics units that are mostly involved in relatively routine operations. Compilation of the CPI is usually carried out using a software package based on a database. Some developing countries still use spreadsheets. The CPI software applies the methods used to average price movements. In some developing countries, the CPI compilation software was developed and implemented many years ago by external consultants using then-current databases. Even if the software was correctly documented and programmed, it may no longer be able to be updated and those using it may not understand its calculations. In a (theoretical) worst case situation, the classifications and basket weights may be fixed and the methods used to calculate the price aggregates not appropriate. D.12.2.3 Harmonised Consumer Price Indices Any discussion of the CPI needs to be completed by analysis of harmonised Consumer Price Indices. These are used for comparing policy outcomes and are particularly important for monetary policy in monetary unions. The Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), which is compiled by the European Statistical System (ESS), is inevitably a point of reference for harmonised CPIs. The Eurostat publication, \u2018Harmonized Indices of Consumer Prices (HICPs) - A Short Guide for Users\u2019 (2004) is a very useful source of information, including for this chapter. It is relevant for developing countries. The EU HICP has a number of differences from some member states\u2019 previously existing national CPIs. These are generally due to the HICP\u2019s objective of efficiently and correctly informing monetary policy. Some EU Member States, including the UK and Ireland, maintain distinct national consumer cost of living indices. They do so because of existing legislation that links prices of financial assets such as bonds, as well as pension payments, to these indices. There is a cost in maintaining two sets of price indices. In developing countries, harmonised CPIs are only embarked upon if there is an overwhelming policy need. The West African Economic and Monetary Union (Union Economique et Mon\u00e9taire Ouest Africaine, UEMOA) requires a harmonised regional price index to inform its monetary policy. The Indice Harmonis\u00e9 des Prix \u00e0 la Consommation (IHPC) (English: Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices) has covered the eight UEMOA members since 1997. Data is available monthly on the UEMOA website. Further information is given in Box 12.2. ",
        "D 212 Price Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Box 12.2: West African harmonised index of consumer prices The West African Economic and Monetary Union (Union Economique et Mon\u00e9taire Ouest Africaine, UEMOA) operates a harmonised regional consumer price index (Indice Harmonis\u00e9 des Prix \u00e0 la Consommation, IHPC) to inform its monetary policy. Eight countries participate. The regional consumer price index, national indices and regional sector sub-indices are published on the UEMOA website monthly, although sometimes with a time lag of up to three months. IHPC methodology is defined by UEMOA regulation 05/97/CM of 16 th December 1997. The IHPC covers the main urban area of each participating country, based on the common West African Consumption Nomenclature (Nomenclature de Consommation Ouest Africaine, NCOA). The consumption weights currently in use date from a 1996 household expenditure survey of 1000 households in each main urban area. A common methodology is required to be used in all eight member states. The definition of consumption is that of the national accounts. The reference population consists of all resident African households. The consumption basket covers at least 300 items, measured in at least 190 outlets through the urban area. It covers all types of retail outlet: markets, street stalls, shops, supermarkets, public and private service providers and others. A common software tool is used to calculate the indices: CHAPO (Calcul Harmonis\u00e9 des Prix par Ordinateur). Further details on CHAPO are given in Box 12.4. The UEMOA price index is calculated as the weighted average of CPIs of the UEMOA Member States. Each country\u2019s weight is equal to the share of its main urban area consumption expenditure in the total household consumption in the urban areas of all member states. A renewal of IHPC weights, outlets and calculation methods has been planned since 2009, under the coordination of Afristat. Sources: UEMOA IHPC website; Afristat IHPC website; IFZ.net IHPC website The Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) is adopting a Harmonised Consumer Price Index (HCPI-COMESA), based on a harmonised methodological and conceptual approach 45 . The HCPI-COMESA will be used for measuring regional price stability and macroeconomic convergence and for international comparison of inflation. This objective indicator of regional price changes is intended to act as a pointer to the regional market for the investment community. Regulations relating to key issues of the HCPI-COMESA were adopted in August 2010: product coverage; index formulae; data transmission and publications standards; coverage and sampling of outlet types; treatment of seasonal products and second hand goods; weights, the product sample and item substitution; and the application of the domestic concept. Month on month price changes for an interim HCPI-COMESA have been published on the COMESA website starting in 2011. A second stage HCPI-COMESA is expected in 2013. Technical papers, including a user guide, are available from the COMESA\u2019s COMSTAT website. 45 SADC is represented in the preparatory working groups, as is EAC. Tanzania, which is not a COMESA member, is expected to adopt the HCPI-COMESA in 2011. D.12.2.4 The Producer Price Index Producer prices are used to measure changes in the prices of intermediate goods and services in transactions between companies. The main use of the producer price index (PPI) is as an advance or leading indicator of inflation, although it does not always act as a leading indicator of the CPI. Another use of the PPI is to deflate company revenue streams in order to measure real changes in output. In the national accounts, the PPI is a data source used to deflate output or sales data and capital expenditure and inventory (stocks) data. PPIs and their components are also used to index long-term contracts, such as in materials costs. The PPI is used in current cost accounting. PPIs have supplanted the former Wholesale Price Indices (WPIs). The reference document for PPIs is the \u2018Producer Price Index Manual: Theory and Practice\u2019 . This was prepared by the Inter-Secretariat Working Group on Price Statistics (IWGPS) and published by the IMF in 2004 on behalf of the group. The Manual defines the PPI (p66) as \u2018an index designed to measure the average change in the price of goods and services either as they leave the place of production or as they enter the production process.\u2019 The relevant prices for a PPI should be the basic prices actually received by the producing establishment for sales within a country. 46 As with the CPI, the PPI is usually published monthly but in some countries quarterly. PPIs are usually available about two weeks after the end of the reference period. PPIs can be used to measure either output or input prices. As with the CPI, regional sub-indices can be calculated. An important sub-index is that covering the prices of investment goods and construction works, as these are used for the investment component in national accounts. Producer prices are collected as part of the business survey cycle, which is described in chapter D.13 Business Statistics. Specific surveys are often carried out for key sectors such as agriculture and mining, for construction and for other regulated sectors. These surveys also provide source data for the PPIs. The international product classification recommended by the Producer Price Index Manual for PPIs is the Central Product Classification (CPC) version 2 . (The EU equivalent is the Classification of Products by Activity (CPA)). The CPC Ver. 2 subclasses consist of goods and services that are predominantly produced in one specific class or classes of the ISIC Revision 4 classification of economic activities (see also chapter D.13 Business statistics). Statistical issues that the PPI shares with the CPI include seasonality and coverage. Some developing countries restrict coverage to key industries. Coverage issues specific to the PPI include how intra-company transfer prices and capital formation on own account are treated. 46 Producer Price Index Manual, Chapter 1, paragraph 1.201, page 37. ",
        "D 213 Price Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 To the discussion of the business survey in Chapter D.11 can be added that many lower middle income and lower income countries have significant difficulties in this area. Problems arise both in maintaining an up-to-date business register and in obtaining full and correct responses to the business surveys. The difficulties with obtaining responses to business surveys are partly due to a lack of understanding among business people of the need for statistics. They may partly also by due to concerns \u2013 justified or not - about misuse of the information provided. The Guide recommends that plans to support PPI or business survey improvement should be critically reviewed whenever there is reason to suspect that the information could be misused. D.12.2.5 Import and Export Prices The main uses of export and import prices are for the national accounts, to measure price changes in trade with the rest of the world, and as a short term indicator of changing prices in the external sector. For example, following a currency devaluation, a key policy issue is to know how quickly prices of imports are responding and affecting prices in the rest of the economy. The international reference document in this area is the \u2018Export and Import Price Index Manual: Theory and Practice\u2019, published by the IMF in 2009 on behalf of the Inter- Secretariat Working Group on Price Statistics (IWGPS) . This provides the following definition (Preface, page xiii): \u201c Export and import price indices (XMPIs) for a country measure the rate of change over time in the prices of exported and imported goods and services. An export price index (XPI) measures the rate of change in the prices of goods and services sold by residents of that country to, and used by, foreign buyers. An import price index (MPI) measures the rate of change in the prices of goods and services purchased by residents of that country from, and supplied by, foreign sellers .\u201d The Manual draws a key distinction between two methods of collecting prices for exports and imports: Export and import unit value indices, based on international \u2022 merchandise trade statistics; Export and import price indices, based on establishment \u2022 price survey data, as with PPIs. Unit values are average prices of similar exports or imports that are calculated from price and quantity data. The Manual recommends (page xiv) that: \u201c... countries using unit value indices with limited resources undertake a staged progression to price indices primarily based on establishment surveys. The initial stage will be to collect price data from establishments responsible for relatively high proportions of exports and imports, particularly those with a relatively large weight and whose unit value indices are at first view inadequate measures of price changes\u2026 It may be that the progression is much quicker, to prepare for the formation of a customs union and loss of intra-union trade data. If the country compiles a producer price index (PPI), much of the technical skills required, and the basis for data collection, will be in place .\u201d 47 This appears to be a very challenging recommendation for many low income and some middle income countries. As explained in section D.12.2.4 on PPIs, many developing countries find it difficult to collect data systematically from all but the largest companies. On the other hand, these major companies often carry out a large proportion of international trade. The strategy described by the Manual is based on starting trade price data collection with these companies. The remainder of this section is concerned with examining how international trade statistics are used to derive import and export unit value indices. Collecting the prices of imports and exports can also be difficult for many developing countries to implement consistently. Although it is possibly cheaper, the Manual considers that this method does not yield as accurate results as collecting trade price data from trading companies. Trade volume data (i.e. quantity in net mass or in supplementary quantity) is less widely collected and validated in some developing countries than is data on the money value of imports and exports. This situation could be more pronounced for exports than for imports in some countries because trade statistics systems are based on Customs reporting. Customs services have an inevitably greater interest in imports that attract tariff revenue than in exports. Moreover, since most tariffs are based on value, less attention is paid to volume data. Problems with collecting the volume data that are needed to calculate import and export unit values can be addressed through improved formalised co-operation with Customs organisations. In common with other trade statistics, unrecorded trade has a detrimental effect on the quality of import and export unit values. A standard check on developing country trade statistics is the use of reconciliation or mirror trade statistics. These are valued differently from directly measured trade statistics 48 and so their use is limited at best for export and import unit value indices. 47 A contrary recommendation is made in the Producer Price Index Manual (page 68, paragraph 2.48). However, the \u2018Export and Import Price Index Manual\u2019 is more recent. 48 cif for exports and fob for imports ",
        "D 214 Price Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 D.12.2.6 Prices in the National Accounts The national accounts and the SNA are covered in chapter D.11. National accounts use appropriate price statistics as \u2018deflators\u2019 to convert current price to constant price data series. Constant price data series are statistics where the effects of price changes between one period and the next have been removed. Change in GDP, one of the most commonly quoted statistics, is a constant price statistic. Constant price GDP requires the use of a wide range of deflators based on price statistics, including the CPI, PPI, export and import price indices and investment price indices. In developing countries where the full range of price indices is not available, the tendency is to substitute the CPI for the appropriate price concept. This introduces an inaccuracy into the national accounts and so into the measurement of GDP. D.12.2.7 Purchasing Power Parities Purchasing power parities (PPPs) are indicators of price level differences across countries. They indicate how many currency units a particular quantity of goods and services costs in different countries. PPPs are primarily used as currency conversion rates in order to convert expenditures expressed in national currencies into an artificial common currency. This eliminates the effect of price level differences across countries and ensuring international comparability. They can also be used to analyse the differences in price levels between countries. The International Comparison Program (ICP) is a worldwide statistical partnership. It collects comparative price data, compiles detailed expenditure values of gross domestic product (GDP) and estimates purchasing power parities (PPPs). The Eurostat-OECD PPP Programme is a distinct statistical partnership that cooperates closely with the ICP and provides the PPPs for European and OECD countries. Eurostat and OECD have jointly published a methodological manual on PPPs. Data on comparative price levels and GDP PPPs are published for the countries of the OECD region. PPP data is also available from EUROBASE, Eurostat\u2019s free dissemination database . The ICP is currently being implemented as a global initiative for the second time, with the reference year 2011. It will engage in methodological research and review, survey activities and data processing and analysis. The areas covered are price statistics, national accounts and fields related to estimating the PPPs of the world\u2019s principal economies. PPP data from the previous 2005 ICP round, as well as methodological and procedural papers are available from the World Bank\u2019s ICP 2011 website . The Global Office of the International Comparison Program is managed through the World Bank. Data from the 2005 ICP and previous rounds are available from their website. Regional programmes are managed by regional organisations. For example, ICP-Africa is managed by the African Development Bank (AfDB); ICP in Asia and the Pacific by the Asian Development Bank. ICP-Africa aims, in addition to producing PPPs, to strengthen national statistical capacity and assist countries to implement the 1993 System of National Accounts (SNA93). One application is a PPP- based poverty measurement research study that involves the compilation of a set of PPPs more appropriate for making the MDG USD1-USD 2/day poverty lines more operational. ICP-Africa implementation is organised through sub- regional organisations: Afristat , COMESA, ECOWAS and SADC. This procedure will enable uniform quality standards to be set, capacity building to be undertaken and the data becoming rapidly available locally for national analyses. D.12.3. Sources of data and metadata Data on the CPI is often the only national data series which is published on a developing country\u2019s website. The NSI is the usual producer of the CPI and PPI but in some countries these are published by the Central Bank. The primary global source of price statistics is the IMF International Financial Statistics publication and database . Line 63 covers Producer or Wholesale Prices. Line 64 covers the Consumer Price Index. Export and import unit values (lines 74 and 75) and direct export and import prices (line 76) compiled through the business survey, are included. The IMF is also the main source of metadata on price statistics through the GDDS : specific standards exist for CPIs and PPIs and country methodologies are posted. IMF data for CPIs is available via the World Bank. The International Comparison Program data and metadata are available from the World Bank website. On its website, Eurostat provides free data and methodological notes and guidelines on the Harmonised Indices of Consumer Prices (HICP) and Purchasing Power Parities (PPPs) . Data and information on the Producer Price Index and the Import Price Index are available in the web section on Short-Term Business Statistics . The OECD compiles and publishes consumer price indices, domestic and total producer price indices, and PPPs. ",
        "D 215 Price Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 D.12.4. Analysing data quality and identifying problems The quality of data depends on its coverage, the timeliness of the published figures and their compliance with the agreed methodology. For comparisons and analyses, international standards and classifications should be respected. For each price index or activity, the following analysis should identify any problem areas in: Conducting the price survey \u2022 Basket of goods and services and / or weights and / or \u2022 classification Price survey coverage and / or sample \u2022 Processing the price survey \u2022 Tabulation, analysis and /or dissemination \u2022 Metadata documentation \u2022 D.12.4.1 The Consumer Price Index Basic analysis of the Consumer Price Index is fairly 1. straightforward: Does the CPI appear every month at the same time? \u2022 Does it take less than a month to publish after the end of the reference month 49 ? Is the CPI monthly release readily available, preferably \u2022 both on paper and via the internet? Does the CPI release give price changes over the last \u2022 month and the last 12 months for both the CPI as a whole and for its major components? In the CPI release, is there a clear explanation of the \u2022 major price changes and a contact point for further information? Is the previous month\u2019s figure ever revised? Are revisions \u2022 clearly indicated? Is there an annual publication that provides a long CPI \u2022 time series? The next analysis looks at the coverage and the relevance 2. of the CPI survey: Is there a methodological or \u2018sources and methods\u2019 \u2022 document that is available? Is reference made to it in the monthly CPI release and the annual publication? What is the geographical coverage of the price collection \u2022 survey? Does price collection cover, for example, the largest urban area or areas; selected or all urban areas; or the whole country? Is the coverage clearly indicated in the monthly and annual publications? 49 The EU legal maximum period for the HICP is 30 days; actual publication is much quicker. The EU example is the only publication period explicitly mentioned in the \u2018Consumer price index manual\u2019 (Chapter 12, Organization and Management, paragraph 12.66). What is the base year of the CPI weights? Is it more than \u2022 five years ago? What are the weights for the main components of the \u2022 CPI and for the sub-components? Are these published in the monthly CPI release and/or the annual publication? When were the weights last updated? Are the weights based on a household expenditure survey or similar exercise? A more detailed analysis looks at information that should 3. be available from the methodological document. Failing this, the information should be forthcoming direct from the NSI or other organisation responsible for publishing the price statistics: What legal texts and administrative regulations cover \u2022 the CPI? What classification is used for the basket of goods and \u2022 services? Is it COICOP \u2013 version 1999 or earlier? Was the source for the weights a household budget \u2022 survey or other data? What formulae are used for aggregating the price \u2022 indices? Are all types of sales outlets covered by the price survey? \u2022 Are they selected randomly within each sales outlet type or purposively? How is the geographical sample constructed? Are there clear rules for replacing seasonal or discontinued \u2022 goods and for treating quality improvement? Are second hand goods, house rentals and house \u2022 ownership costs covered by the survey where these are important? What documentation exists that covers data collection, \u2022 transmission, error correction, data entering/saving and validation procedures? Is the index compilation software used fully documented, \u2022 especially for the validation procedures and the aggregation formulae? D.12.4.2 The Producer Price Index This section should be read together with the corresponding section from the business statistics chapter, section D.11.4. The basic analysis of the Producer Price Index is similar 1. to that presented above for the Consumer Price Index. Taking a first look at the coverage and the relevance of the 2. PPI immediately requires a look at the business survey cycle: ",
        "D 216 Price Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Are there methodological or \u2018sources and methods\u2019 \u2022 documents that are available for the business survey and for the PPI? What is the base year of the PPI? Is it more than five \u2022 years ago? What is the source of the weights for the components \u2022 of the PPI? Was the source a business census? Was this business census carried out in the base year or earlier? What classification is used for the PPI basket of goods \u2022 and services? Is it CPC version 2, ISIC Revision 4 or another nomenclature? 3. A more detailed analysis inevitably examines the quality of the business survey. Most lower and lower-middle income developing countries have particular difficulties with these surveys. As with the CPI, the information needed should be available from the methodological document. Failing this, the information should be forthcoming direct from the NSI or other organisation responsible for publishing the price statistics: How are businesses / establishments organised into strata \u2022 for business surveys? Does this reflect the structure of establishments / businesses in the country? How is the business register kept up to date in between \u2022 business censuses? Are the means of updating the register exhaustive or nearly so? How many businesses / establishments are currently \u2022 on the register in each stratum? Is this a reasonable number? How are businesses sampled in each survey? Is the \u2022 sample a random stratified one? Can previously sampled businesses be reselected, other than in the largest business stratum? Is the sample size realistic for surveys? How long are the questionnaires? Is the burden of response reasonable? What is the response rate? What means, including \u2022 sanctions, exist to ensure response? How are small and informal establishments surveyed? \u2022 Survey processing and price index questions also need to 4. be considered for the PPI: What legal texts and administrative regulations cover \u2022 the PPI? What formulae are used to aggregate the price indices? \u2022 Are there clear rules for replacing seasonal or discontinued \u2022 goods and for treating quality improvement? What documentation exists that covers data collection, \u2022 transmission, error correction, data capture and validation procedures? Is the index compilation software used fully \u2022 documented, especially for the validation procedures and the aggregation formulae? D.12.4.3 Import and Export Prices Import and export unit value indices are calculated in some countries by using international trade value and volume data. Before calculating unit value indices, the basic data should be validated to eliminate outliers and errors. The methodology should be documented. If any price indices have been established in developing countries that measure import and export prices through the business survey cycle, then the analysis for PPIs should be used here. D.12.4.4 Prices in the National Accounts Price data are incorporated in national accounts if they are considered to be reliable. Therefore, the exclusion of any price data as a national accounts data source should prompt questions about reliability or, alternatively, coordination. The most likely price data to be omitted from national accounts is the PPI, which many developing countries substitute with the CPI. In low income countries with no investment goods industry, capital goods prices data can be drawn from import prices, except for construction. The replacement of import and export prices by the CPI would lead to a considerable distortion. D.12.4.5 Purchasing Power Parities The quality of the data for purchasing power parities in developing countries is a function of how the International Comparison Programme (ICP- see section D.12.2.7 above) has been implemented in the country and region in question. The most effective way to collect PPPs is by integrating the process with the regular CPI exercise. This method is only undertaken by the Eurostat-OECD PPP Programme. Elsewhere, information on data quality must be drawn from ICP working papers. Data quality will be higher with more frequent data collection, which should preferably be at least quarterly throughout the reference year. The products covered should represent most or all of the (2-digit COICOP) product groups. There should also be multiple goods or services measured in each of the product groups. A precise product or service specification is also an indicator that price measurement can be carried out effectively. ",

Improving sector statistics An analysis can quickly identify the problem areas for price statistics compilation, processing and dissemination. Support is usually only requested when there is a need to update the goods and services basket and rebase the series. Issues that may need to be addressed include: Are price statistics a priority? Has their modernisation \u2022 been identified by an NSDS? Will updating lead to greater coverage and hence higher \u2022 recurring costs? Do the surveys, logistics, processing, error correction and \u2022 validation processes and the compilation software need to be updated? Do coordination issues exist with the household \u2022 expenditure survey for CPI and the business survey unit for the PPI? Are there any capacity issues that need addressing, such as \u2022 training or recruiting new skilled staff? Box 12.3: Example \u2013 Improvement of price statistics in South Africa Statistics South Africa thoroughly revised its CPI in 2009. The changes are extensively documented for statisticians and non-technical users. The previous basket of goods and services had been used since 2002. CPI renewal started in 2005, when price collection by statistical officers physically visiting the points of sale replaced information provided by the stores (see also section D.12.2.2). Prices of additional goods and services were collected as a result of this change. An Income and Expenditure Survey was conducted in 2005/06 over a twelve month period, using a diary questionnaire to record household expenditure. Survey results were published in 2008. A Statistics South Africa CPI revision web page was used to inform the public about the changes, to obtain feedback and provide transparency. Documents were provided on the website, for example, to ensure contract continuity from old to new measures of inflation. A draft of the new basket of goods and services was published on the website in September 2007. The basket is based on the COICOP classification (see section D.12.2.2). The weights for the new basket were published in July 2008. Coverage is now \u2018all urban areas\u2019, as opposed to the previous coverage of \u2018historical metropolitan and other urban areas\u2019. Price collection on both new and old baskets was continued throughout 2008. Methodological changes included the replacement of the interest rate on mortgage bonds by \u2018Owners\u2019 equivalent rent\u2019 as the indicator of housing costs, together with actual rents. \u2018Owners\u2019 equivalent rent\u2019 is collected during the quarterly rental survey. The Ministry of Finance responded to the changes by adopting the CPI for all urban areas as its inflation target. The new index was released in February 2009 and is now used for the year on year rates of change in the CPI. Source: Statistics South Africa: Consumer Price Index (CPI) ",
        "D 218 Price Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Box 12.4: Consumer price index software Calculating a CPI is complicated. A database application is needed to calculate the indices. Some developing countries still use spreadsheets Current database tools are more flexible and, especially those based on the industry standard SQL, are likely to remain accessible. Many developing countries, especially middle income countries, therefore prefer to update their CPI compilation software with an application tailored to their specific needs. Alternatively, a number of CPI compilation packages are now available. One of these is Price Index Processor Software (PIPS) , developed by the IMF but available from UNECE. This is based on the Consumer Price Index Manual: Theory and Practice (2004) and the COICOP classification . PIPS calculates indices as weighted averages of the price changes for a specified basket of consumer products. The application consists of five parts: (1) Data Entry, Editing; (2) Data Diagnosis and Validation; (3) Item Weights Creating, Editing and Distribution; (4) Index Imputation; and (5) Tabulation and Reporting. The application offers alternative formulae for calculating price averages. It can use SQL or Microsoft Access databases. CHAPO (Calcul Harmonis\u00e9 des Prix par Ordinateur) was developed in 1996 as a methodologically integrated module of the UEMOA harmonised index of consumer prices, as discussed at Box 12.2. CHAPO is also used by the CEMAC countries, Guinea, Mauretania and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. CHAPO is maintained by UEMOA on behalf of its members and is obtainable from Afristat. Statistics Portugal has developed a software application for production of CPI in Portuguese-speaking countries. This application, IPC, has been successfully installed in Mozambique and Cap Verde. The IPC software draws on experiences from EU harmonization, with some adaptations to the specific environment of developing countries. Among others, the software covers organisation of field work, data editing, validation, estimation, quality adjustment, computation of special aggregates (core inflation, CPI for services, for goods, etc.). The software allows graphic analysis according to the COICOP classification and export of all results to Excel. It also provides functionalities for automatic production of press releases. More details are available from Statistics Portugal. In 2011, Eurostat launched a project to develop a new software application for compilation of price statistics.

Business statistics The chapter in brief Business statistics is a key input to both the quarterly and the annual national accounts, both in developed and in developing countries. They are also vital for analysing the value created and the employment in the different economic sectors, as well as the development of these sectors. New statistical challenges for business statistics are globalisation (e.g. international sourcing), the growing importance of business services and the focus on innovation and entrepreneurship. Although these issues may not be the priority in the lowest income countries, they are of interest and importance in more advanced developing countries. Business statistics are produced for different type of users, from based on data collected either directly from the statistical units (enterprises) or from administrative sources (e.g. tax data). The two most central sets of business statistics are the structural business statistics (SBS), used mainly for structural analysis, and short- term business statistics (STS), used mainly for trend analysis. These two sets of statistics are distinct but interrelated. This chapter covers a wide area of general business statistics, but does not go into statistics for specific sectors such as transport (see chapter D.15.) or agriculture, forestry and fishing (see chapter D.17.). The chapter starts by identifying the main policy areas for which business statistics are used. It then provides a users\u2019 view of the statistics involved, including a description of the different kind of business statistics (annual versus short-term, enterprise versus establishments, etc). The chapter continues by identifying the main sources where the data and information about methods used can be found. Finally, the chapter discusses how to analyse the quality of the statistics and concludes with advice on and examples of how to improve business statistics in developing countries. D.13.1. Policy applications: what this data is used for Business statistics are in great demand for economic analysis by a large number of users: international organisations, aid donors, national governments and policy-makers, central banks, financial markets and economic analysts, private sector companies, NGOs, media and the citizens of the country. Among other things, there is an increasing need for data on globalisation (e.g. international sourcing), business services and on innovation and entrepreneurship. Even in low income countries, sourcing of production and services from the globally acting enterprises are of growing importance. In more advanced developing countries, data on business services and innovation and entrepreneurship are also in increasing demand for economic analysis and policy formulation. These are some of the most dynamic areas of developed and more advanced developing economies, especially in terms of their potential for growth and employment creation. Business statistics describe the economy through the observation of units engaged in an economic activity. Business statistics may be used to answer such questions as: how much wealth and how many jobs are created in a certain economic sector; is there a shift from the primary to and from the industrial sector to the services sector; in which specific sectors is this trend most notable; which countries are relatively specialised in the manufacture of which raw materials; what is the average wage of an employee within the energy production sector; how productive is the drink production sector and how does it fare in terms of operating profitability? Productivity is a key measure of economic efficiency, \u2022 showing how effectively economic inputs are converted into output; profitability is a key indicator for measuring enterprise success. There are several business statistics indicators that allow an analysis to be made of productivity and profitability. Business demography statistics, via demography of the \u2022 enterprises, allows analysis of the active population of enterprises, their birth, survival and death. Special attention is paid to the impact of these demographic events on employment levels. These data can be used for example to analyse the dynamics and innovation in different markets: for example, entrepreneurship in terms of the propensity to start a new business, or the contribution of newly born enterprises to the creation of jobs. Business services are a driver of the modern economy. Their \u2022 labour-intensive nature has also attracted interest in their potential as providers of new jobs. Globalisation and the increasing outsourcing of basic production and business services to low-cost (low wage) developing countries are increasing the need for business statistics. Technological progress and the Internet are also important factors that have provided new production possibilities and new modes of supply. Business statistics \u2022 include many of the key short-term indicators that are vital for analysis of recent and current economic developments and the development of monetary and economic policy, both in the developing countries themselves and in the global context. The profile and use of short-term business statistics is \u2022 expanding rapidly. Information flows have become global, and the latest news release for an indicator may have significant effects on markets or decisions taken by central banks and business leaders. Indicators provided in the form of indices allow rapid assessment of the economic climate within an economy. D.13.2. Concepts and definitions Business statistics cover economic statistics across different sectors, statistics on economic activities of enterprises, business demography, business investment, business services, demand for services, industrial performance, enterprises by size class, industrial production, commodities, structure of sales and services, outputs of the service industries, non- profit institutions, etc. ",
        "D 222 Business Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 The core indicators of business statistics are: Outputs \u2022 : turnover, production value, value added Inputs \u2022 : purchases of goods and services (incl. energy costs), personnel cost Employment \u2022 : number of employees and other persons employed, number of worked hours Investments \u2022 : gross investments in tangible goods. The decision of whether business statistics should be prioritised over the development of other statistics critically depends on the situation of the country and on the state of the national statistical system (see chapter C.5.). The priorities should be clearly defined and set within the frame of the national development strategy and the National Strategy for the Development of Statistics (NSDS) or similar (see section C.6.1.). D.13.2.1. The main types of business statistics D.13.2.1.1. Structural (annual) business statistics (SBS) Structural business statistics describe the structure, conduct and performance of economic activities, down to a detailed activity level. In most developing counties, the economic activities are defined according to the UN\u2019s International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC) (Rev. 3.1 or 3.0 in most developing countries) or a national adaptation of this. Structural business statistics normally cover the \u2019business economy\u2019, which includes industry, construction and services. In most developing countries, the non-registered (or non-observed) economy plays a large role in the economy and should be addressed. The purpose of structural business statistics is to analyse: \u2022 The structure and evolution of business enterprises\u2019 \u2022 activities; Production factors and other elements influencing business \u2022 activity, competitiveness and performance; The regional, national and international development of \u2022 businesses and markets; Business conduct; \u2022 Small and medium-sized enterprises; and \u2022 Specific characteristics of enterprises related to particular \u2022 breakdown of activities. In the EU, a harmonised system of Structural (annual) Business Statistics (SBS) has been developed. The SBS methodology is a valuable source of well-defined concepts and definitions, as well as of methodological approaches producing internationally harmonised quality business statistics. Subsets of the European SBS variables are available with a breakdown according to the size of the enterprise (small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)) and by region (regional structural business statistics). For further information on regional statistics, see chapter D.18.) D.13.2.1.2. Short-term business statistics (STS) Short-term business statistics include key short-term indicators that are vital for analysis of the current state of the economy and of economic trends. Amongst other, STS is a key information source for monetary and economic policy. Overall, the use of short-term business statistics is increasing rapidly and is widening to new areas of analysis and policy- making. Information flows have become global and the latest news release for an indicator may have significant effects on markets and on decisions taken by central banks, policy- makers and business leaders. Short-term indicators allow the rapid assessment of the economic climate within an economy. As an example, European Short-term business statistics (STS) provides eight of the nineteen Principal European Economic Indicators (PEEIs) (infra-annual macroeconomic indicators for the euro area and the EU). D.13.2.1.3. Manufactured products statistics Worldwide statistics on manufactured products , the Industrial Commodity Statistics , are compiled by the United Nations based on national data. The statistics are classified according to the UN\u2019s List of Industrial Products, which, as far as possible, is based on the definitions of the Central Product Classification (CPC) and the Harmonized System (HS). An important issue is that national or regional product classifications should be compatible with international product classifications , and in particular with the classifications used for trade statistics (e.g. HS, SITC). This makes it possible to combine production data with trade data for analysis of product markets. In the EU, the Prodcom statistics on products from mining, quarrying and manufacturing activities are based on the Prodcom product list. D.13.2.1.4. Other business statistics The objective of statistics on the structure and activity of foreign affiliates (FATS) is to provide a basis for the assessment of the impact of foreign-controlled enterprises on the national economy. In developing countries, such enterprises can have a large influence on the economy. It is therefore of great interest to analyse the structure and ownership of such enterprises, as well as their activities within the country. A foreign affiliate is defined as an enterprise in a country which is under the control of an \u2018institutional unit\u2019 not resident in the country. The FATS data also facilitates monitoring the effectiveness of regional common markets and the integration of economies within the context of globalisation. Examples of FATS statistics and the methodologies applied can be found in the EU foreign controlled enterprises (FATS) statistics. A globalisation trend that has received a great deal of political and media attention is the increase in outsourcing of production and services from developed countries to low-cost developing countries. This is closely related with the industrial restructuring which has been one of the main economic developments in Europe and other developed ",
        "D 223 Business Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 countries in recent decades. This is seen both in the context of deindustrialisation and concerns regarding social and environmental standards. Statistics on international sourcing provide policy makers at national and international level with information on the reasons for, the extent of, and the consequences of, international sourcing. The EU statistics on international sourcing presents this from a European view; in developing countries, such an approach must be adapted to their reality and their dependence on international sourcing. Outsourcing, subcontracting and globalisation of the production have seen the demand for services increase. Enterprises use service providers both for non-core activities (e.g. transport, marketing services) and for parts of their core activities to increase flexibility (e.g. labour recruitment services, international sourcing to low-cost countries). Other reasons include technological developments, which allow services to be delivered directly to customers anywhere in the world (e.g. internet sales, call centres, helpdesks, software development, billing services, etc.). These activities are very dynamic, and their labour-intensive nature has also attracted interest in their potential as providers of new jobs. Business services statistics provide information on service providers, types of service purchased, the location of the main service provider, barriers to purchasing services and so forth, as well as information on service related investments in intangibles (such as tradable rights, ICT, R&D, marketing and sales). EU business services statistics provide an example of how such statistics can be set up. While business demography statistics provide data on enterprise births, survivals, deaths and related changes in employment, the purpose of factors of business success statistics is to shed more light on factors that support or hamper the success of newly born enterprises. Such statistics provide information on the motivations for starting up a business, barriers and risks encountered during the first years of existence, the current situation of the enterprise, and business plans for future development. This information is relevant for better targeted policy-making to boost entrepreneurship. D.13.2.2. The framework for business statistics Statistical units are an essential component of the integrated framework of business statistics. With the use of common definitions of statistical units, integrated statistical information can be provided. The general practice is to use the enterprise as the statistical unit (observation unit). An enterprise may carry out one or more economic activities at one or more locations. A classification of economic activities is designed to categorise data for the \u2018units of activity\u2019. A unit of activity can be an individual factory or a group of factories comprising an economic entity (such as an enterprise or a division within a larger enterprise). The international reference classification of economic activity is the UN\u2019s International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC) . ISIC is currently available in Revision 4, but most developing countries use ISIC Rev. 3.1 or Rev 3.0 or a national adaptation of one of these. ISIC presents a coherent and consistent classification structure of economic activities, based on internationally agreed concepts, definitions, principles and classification rules. It establishes a comprehensive framework for collecting and reporting economic data, in a format designed for economic analysis, decision-taking and policy- making. Some regional variants of ISIC are also established, such as the EU\u2019s Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community (NACE) and the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) . The availability of business registers is vital to the compilation of both short-term and structural business statistics. Business registers is a key tool for the preparation and co-ordination of surveys, and for grossing up survey results. The Wiesbaden Group on Business Registers is an international expert group under the umbrella of the UN Statistical Commission. It is engaged in further development of business registers, survey frames and associated topics. One of the major topics for the group\u2019s current work is the challenges for business registers resulting from globalisation. In particular, the Wiesbaden Group is currently focusing on business registers and business statistics in developing countries. The European Statistical System has a leading role in the development of business registers and can serve as inspiration and basis. In particular, the Eurostat Business Registers Recommendations Manual provides a comprehensive overview of good practices in all key areas of statistical business register development. D.13.3. Sources of data D.13.3.1. Collecting and compiling business statistics The most common way of collecting data on businesses is for the NSI to carry out a (stratified) survey amongst registered enterprises. Samples for business surveys are drawn from a sampling frame such as a business register, ideally a register established and maintained specifically for statistical purposes. However, in many developing countries the \u2018informal sector\u2019 is of importance for the economy as a whole. The NSI should develop a strategy for covering value created and the employment of the \u2018informal\u2019 economy and include this in their national statistical strategy. When no business statistics are published by the NSI, there may be other sources for data on businesses: ",
        "D 224 Business Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Box 13.1: Alternative sources for data on enterprises The NSI: Data may not be published when the quality is not \u2022 acceptable or the confidentiality of information of individual business must be protected. Information originally collected for other purposes can sometimes also be of interest; Tax authorities: Quite detailed data on businesses are often held \u2022 by the tax authorities and are normally a secure long-term source of business data. However, it will only cover registered businesses, and the definition of variables may differ from the ones required for statistics. There may also be quality issues, as businesses will seek to minimize taxable income. Tax data provides NSIs with information for complementing survey information, for quality checking and for grossing up; Line ministries and other administrations: Within the scope of \u2022 their responsibilities, line ministries and other administrations often hold data on enterprises in specific sectors. The coverage, definition and reliability issues are similar to those of tax data. Data on publicly owned enterprises are often held by the responsible ministry or administration; Business federations: These often hold information on their \u2022 members. However, such information does not cover non- members, and sector federations only hold data on business in their own business sector; Annual reports and public accounts of enterprises: Such accounts \u2022 can be required by law or by stock exchange rules (for enterprises listed on the stock exchange). Such information is generally standardised (although simplified for small enterprises), and can be used to complement, verify and aggregate survey information; Credit information providers: These hold vast amounts of \u2022 enterprise data drawn from public sources, quality assured and analysed. However, such data may be quite costly to acquire. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are central to economic development and employment in most countries. Small enterprises are widespread in the informal economy, and these are not covered by surveys based on business registers. Even registered SMEs are commonly exempt from reporting obligations or report according to simplified rules, and are often represented by only a minor proportion in stratified business surveys. Given the diverse and often incomplete and deficient state of SME statistics, careful analysis of the raw data is important before attempting to draw policy conclusions. SME statistics are a sub-set of business statistics for the whole economy and should not be seen in isolation. For business statistics, huge gains in efficiency and data quality can normally be realised through the use of administrative data, either as data source, as basis for estimations or as benchmark for validation. A close cooperation and coordination between the NSI and other administrations that collect enterprise data, in particular the tax authorities, is therefore highly recommended. The advantages and prerequisites of the different data collection modes and sources are discussed in detail in section B.2.2.1. The annual Structural Business Statistics are mainly based on data obtained directly from the enterprises via statistical surveys, or data coming from administrative sources (e.g. taxation data (incl. VAT data), data from business registers, etc.). No matter what the source is, Structural Business Statistics describe the economy through the observation of units engaged in an economic activity. An enterprise carries out one or more activities at one or more locations and may comprise one or more legal units. Enterprises that are active in more than one economic activity are classified under the activity class (ISIC or national classification) that corresponds to their main activity, normally the one that generates the largest amount of value added. Main indicators of the Structural Business Statistics are: Number of enterprises, persons employed and employees; Turnover, production value, value added at factor cost and gross operating surplus; Purchases of goods and services; Change in stocks of goods and services; Personnel costs; Gross investments and sales of tangible investment goods. Most of the Structural Business Statistics is broken-down by sectors (industry, construction, trade and services), by region (according to the location of the enterprises) and by size class (according to the number of the employed personnel). Structural business statistics are used as one of the key inputs for the compilation of production-related annual National Accounts statistics. Short-Term Statistics indicators are tools for formulating and monitoring the economic and monetary policy. They generally have a monthly frequency and measure recent developments in each country. STS data are in great demand for economic analysis by national policy makers and central banks, international organisations and donors, private companies, financial markets, the media and other analysts. STS indicators provide information on how prices or turnover have risen or fallen in the previous month, the previous quarter, or the previous 12 months. These indicators are provided in the form of indices, which allow the rapid assessment of the economic climate within an economy. STS indices cover four major domains: industry, construction, retail trade and other services. These activities are defined in relation to a classification of activities, i.e. ISIC or national classification. Main indicators covered by STS are, dependent on the major domain: Production and/or turnover; Number of persons employed; Hours worked and gross wages and salaries (industry and construction); Prices. For the industry domain, new orders and turnover are broken down by domestic and non-domestic. For construction, production is broken down by production of buildings and civil engineering. In addition, construction costs and construction permits data are collected. Basically, STS data are derived from business surveys. However, also administrative data such as VAT data (which are normally collected with monthly, bi-monthly or quarterly frequency) or other sources outside the national statistical systems are used, either as data source or basis for estimation, or for complementing or validating the survey data. ",
        "D 225 Business Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Box 13.2: Indexes An index measures trends in a time-series. In the case of short- term business statistics, the indices represent the movements in an indicator between a base year or month and the current period. The index average is 100 for the base period; an index of 105 means that there has been a 5 % increase since the base period while an index of 97 means that there has been a 3 % decrease compared with the base period. Many economic activities are influenced by regular variation due to seasons or social conventions (e.g. weather effects for construction). Data should be adjusted to make them comparable from one month to another. A seasonally adjusted series is a time-series from which the effects of regular seasonal influences have been removed. In general, the seasonally adjusted series are smoother than the gross series and this further facilitates month-to-month comparisons. For some economic activities, the number of weekdays has a significant impact on the level of a series. For example, monthly activity in retail trade depends on the number of Saturdays during the reference month. Series are working-day adjusted when the effects linked to the number of days of different types in the reference month are removed from the series. Most STS indicators are adjusted for working days and/or seasonally adjusted by using TRAMO (Time series Regression with ARIMA noise, Missing values and Outliers) and SEATS (Signal Extraction in ARIMA Time Series) software, once the influence of working days or seasonal variations has been detected. Statistics on industrial products generally covers the products from mining, quarrying and manufacturing activities, in some countries also covering recycling products or utility products. The purpose of the statistics is to report, for each product, how much has been produced in the reporting country during the reference period. This means that the product statistics relate to products (not to activities), and they are therefore not directly comparable with activity- based statistics such as Structural Business Statistics. Product statistics differ from external trade statistics in that the latter can be thought of as event-based: each time a product crosses a border it is registered as a \u2018trade\u2019, and if the same product crosses borders several times it is recorded as several trades. The product statistics are normally annual, but may for specific industries or products be more frequent. Products are classified according to a standard classification, e.g. an international classification such as the Harmonized System (HS) or the Standard International Trade Classification (SITC) , or (most frequently) a national adaptation of such international classifications. These classifications normally are either a classification for international trade (such as the HS and SITC) or have a close connection to these, so that production data can be combined with import and export data for analysis of product markets. The product statistics are normally based on surveys of producing enterprises, requesting data on the physical volume of production and the value of production. Business demography statistics present data on the active population of enterprises, their birth, survival and death. Special attention is paid to the impact of these demographic events on employment levels. This data can be used to analyse the dynamics and innovation of different markets: for example, entrepreneurship in terms of the propensity to start a new business, or the contribution of newly-born enterprises to the creation of jobs. D.13.3.2. International sources for business statistics In cooperation with the OECD, the statistics branch of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) compiles detailed key industrial statistics with worldwide coverage. UNIDO\u2019s Statistics Unit also provides technical assistance to developing countries in strengthening their capacity for conducting industrial surveys, maintaining business registers and short-term statistical indicators and carrying out data analysis of industrial performance. UNIDO also designed the special National Industrial Statistics Programme (NISP) package for developing systems to collect basic industrial statistics on priority data items. UNIDO maintains the worldwide industrial statistical databases INDSTAT4, INDSTAT2 and IDSB and produces Statistical Country Briefs, all available on the UNIDO statistics website . The key statistical publication is the International Yearbook of Industrial Statistics. UNIDO strongly emphasises the quality of the statistics, in terms of international comparability, concepts and definitions, classification and coverage. The INDSTAT4 database contains data by country, year and ISIC at the 3- and 4-digit levels of ISIC (Revision 3), from 1990 on. The INDSTAT2 database covers, for 161 countries, historical time series data from 1963 to 2007 for the manufacturing sector at 2-digit level of ISIC Revision 3. The IDSB database contains data broken down by country, year and industry at 4-digit level of ISIC: one dataset according to ISIC Revision 2 and one dataset according to ISIC Revision 3. The data come from output data reported by NSIs, together with UNIDO estimates for ISIC-based international trade from the UN Commodity Trade Database (COMTRADE) . The United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD ) produced the structural industrial statistics before these were taken over by UNIDO; UNSD continues to maintain general industrial statistics information for mining activities and utilities activities (i.e. production and distribution of electricity, gas and water). UNSD is also the main source for worldwide statistics on manufactured products, the Industrial Commodity Statistics . The statistics cover physical ",
        "D 226 Business Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 quantities of major industrial products, classified according to the UN\u2019s List of Industrial Products . Furthermore, the UNSD produces monthly, quarterly and yearly indices of industrial production, collected through a questionnaire sent to NSIs. The indices are compiled according to the 2-digit level categories of ISIC Revision 4 (for countries that do not yet use ISIC Revision 4, data are still collected according to ISIC Revision 3). Eurostat is also an important source of business statistics. Within the frame of the accession process, Eurostat has a close cooperation with the Candidate and Potential Candidate Countries . With the support of Eurostat and the European Statistical System (ESS), these countries are working to bring their business statistics systems in line with the acquis in this field and ESS standards. Furthermore, through the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) Eurostat is also supporting and cooperating with the NSIs in the ENP East countries and the MEDSTAT countries in developing their statistical systems. Eurostat is also compiling key statistics based on international sources for Africa, the Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) and Asia and Latin America (ALA ); these data are available to European Commission staff only, through Login on Eurostat\u2019s website (see section B.3.4.). However, business statistics data are limited for these countries. D.13.4. Analysing data quality and iden- tifying problems D.13.4.1. Specific quality issues for business statistics Much of the discussion on the reliability of statistics focuses on issues of \u201cdata quality\u201d. Without going into too much detail, it is sufficient to say that it covers a number of dimensions, including accuracy, timeliness, relevance, accessibility and comparability (this is discussed in detail in section C.5.3.). User relevance of business statistics A central question concerning the quality of statistics is whether they are \u2018fit for purpose\u2019. In other words, are the statistics meeting the information needs of users (and potential users)? This can only be answered through consultations with users of the statistics concerned, be it through user surveys, direct consultations or permanent advisory groups of users. Key users of business statistics are national accountants and policy-makers and administrators involved in economic development policies. As economic development is seen as one of the central pillars of overall development, e.g. in the fight against poverty, donors, international organisations and NGOs also have a keen interest. Furthermore, business statistics is a key information source for economic analysis, involving businesses themselves, financial analysts, researchers, media and interested citizens. Timeliness and punctuality of dissemination For business statistics in general and short-term statistics in particular, the issue of timeliness and punctuality of publishing statistics is of great importance. Short-term statistics are used to analyse the business cycle and current economic trends, and the publication of new statistics can have rapid and significant impact on markets. The users\u2019 demand for up-to- date figures that are published frequently and on time at pre- established dates can best be met by establishing a release calendar for the statistics. A challenge in many developing countries is to set up and follow a release calendar for official statistics, both for business and other economic statistics and for other statistical areas. This is closely related with the issue of dissemination: it is not sufficient to have \u201cgood business statistics\u201d stored somewhere inside the statistical office; they must be available in an appropriate form to all potential users. A good practice example is the Eurostat free dissemination database , which is the main repository of business statistics in Europe. The importance of the statistical unit for business statistics Statistics for a given characteristic have the greatest usefulness when they enable reliable comparisons across countries and over time. Both are sometimes limited by methodological differences between countries and changes in methodology from one year to another. A main issue on business statistics is related to the definition of statistical units, the variables and terminology. The recommended statistical unit is the enterprise; however, for some purposes data is collected and disseminated by establishment or local unit. When data are made available to users, it should be clearly stated to what the data refers to. The enterprise is often defined as the Legal Unit (i.e. the legal entity), even in developed countries, as this makes the enterprises easy to identify and handle across different registers and sources. However, this should be done with caution, as changes in economic circumstances and legislation (especially tax legislation) can lead to split and/ or mergers of legal units without any changes in the real production structure. The problem of varying terminology Terminology used in business accounting may vary greatly from one country to another. For example, while the word \u201cturnover\u201d means total sales in the UK and many European countries, for OECD \u201cturnover\u201d means the sum of gross sales plus some other incomes but excluding revenues from rental of real estate, contributions and gifts, etc. In the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) of the United States, \u201cturnover\u201d is the number of times an asset is replaced during a financial period, often used in the context of inventory turnover or accounts receivable turnover. In securities, for either a portfolio or exchange, \u201cturnover\u201d is the number of shares traded for a period as a percentage of the total shares. ",
        "D 227 Business Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 The effects of accounting rules Business accounting principles may be the same in many countries, but actual accounting rules vary from one country to another. These rules affect the adjustment required for data collected from business accounts in order to use them for economic statistics. For example: Some countries require accountants to expense a. expenditures on software while others countries allow capitalization. In countries where capitalisation is not allowed, the expenses need to be imputed as output, which is then treated as gross capital formation. In business accounting, net assets are mostly valued as b. the sum of the historical value of gross capital formation less depreciation (based on historical value). One cannot derive gross capital formation by deducting values of assets in two adjacent periods, as assets in business statistics should be valued at replacement costs. A particular issue is the time period covered by business statistics versus the accounting periods. Annual business statistics generally follow the calendar year. However, some countries prescribe (or at least permit) accounting years different from the calendar year, e.g. from 1 May to 30 April of the following year. This causes problems for using tax and business accounts data as a basis for business statistics. Box 13.3: Example on solving inconsistency and miss- ing data The following example gives an indication how the inconsistency of data can be solved and the missing data can be estimated. Inconsistency We have data about the total Value Added Tax (VAT) for ISIC Rev. 3.1 class 5010 \u2018Sale of motor vehicles\u2019 and data on turnover is available for a given period of time. Knowing the level of taxation for that specific type of retail trade we can compare the VAT to Turnover ratio and detect the possible inconsistency: The VAT value is 200 and the Turnover value is 2000: VAT/Turnover \u2022 = 10%; However, the VAT level for this economic activity is 5% \u2022 The data should be checked using any supplementary information available, such as turnover data from public financial reports or turnover per employee ratio. Such ratios are constructed using information for similar businesses for which both variables are available and considered reliable. The average turnover per head ratios are then calculated based on economic activity and size. Turnover per person ratios can also be used to estimate the missing variables. In this specific case of motor vehicles, also data from national vehicle registration authorities can be a valuable information source for checking and completing the statistics. Using different surveys and sources to improve the business statistics In spite of all efforts to reduce the response burden on businesses, it is inevitable that some businesses will have to respond to more than one business survey. Especially the largest enterprises with an important impact on the national economy will be included in most business surveys. In addition, incorporated businesses are normally obliged to publish their key economic data. As long as it is possible to identify individual businesses, e.g. through specific identification numbers (VAT number, tax number), NSIs should utilise all available information on a business. By cross-checking surveys and other sources for validating data and impute missing values, significant gains in quality can be made. Some advanced NSIs have constructed integrated databases where all sources for data on businesses are directly available for cross-checking. However, gains in quality can be achieved by simply giving the staff responsible for a specific survey access to the paper questionnaires for the same business in other surveys and/or to the business\u2019 annual report. D.13.4.2. The informal economy An important issue is the informal sector , which in some developing countries can record a substantial share in the total economy and engage a large proportion of the workforce. Generally, the informal sector activities provide goods and services whose production and distribution are perfectly legal. In some countries, a large part of informal sector enterprises are actually registered in some way, or pay taxes, even though they may not be in a position to comply with the full range of legal and administrative requirements. According to the 15 th International Conference of Labour Statisticians (ICLS), informal sector enterprises are characterised by small size in terms of employment, non- registration of enterprises and non-registration of employees. Only enterprises without any of its employees registered should be counted to the informal sector. The UN Expert Group on Informal Sector Statistics (Delhi Group) has endeavoured to harmonise national definitions of the informal sector on the basis of the framework set by the international definition. The Delhi Group has recognised that there are limits to harmonisation; nevertheless, on the basis of the largest common denominator, the Group was able to identify a subset of the informal sector that could be defined uniformly and for which countries could make internationally comparable data available. Accordingly, the Delhi Group concludes that: \u201c Since the informal sector manifests itself in different ways in different countries, national definitions of the informal sector cannot be fully harmonised at present. International agencies should disseminate informal sector data according to the national definitions used. In order to enhance the ",
        "D 228 Business Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 international comparability of informal sector statistics, they should also disseminate data for the subset of the informal sector, which can be defined uniformly \u201d D.13.5. Improving sector statistics This section focuses on actions to reduce costs and the burden on respondents, the NSIs and other statistics producers. All new statistical requirements increase the burden on data providers (i.e. enterprises) and on the producers of statistics (NSIs). Given these pressures at national and international level, this must be tackled by each country and the most suitable solutions in the national context sought. Use of administrative data Businesses usually have an understanding of the reasons for supplying data for registration and taxation purposes, even if they do not like doing so. However, they often see statistical data requests as an extra, less necessary, burden. There is consensus that one of the best solutions is to use already existing data as far as possible, in particular administrative data. However, the information contained in administrative sources is not primarily collected for statistical purposes. Administrative data sources of special interest to business statistics are: Value Added Tax data; \u2022 Business/Profit Taxation data; \u2022 Register of Chamber of Commerce and National Business \u2022 Registration Authorities; Central Bank records; \u2022 Social Security data, etc. \u2022 The use of administrative data to produce statistics has both benefits and limitations. One of the main benefits is that data already exists and is (relatively) complete for the business population covered. The use of administrative sources also eliminates survey errors, removes (or significantly reduces) non-response, and provides more accurate and detailed estimates for various sub-populations. Because the administrative data are collected according to administrative concepts and definitions, there are normally differences between these and the statistical concepts. Therefore, the issue of matching and calibrating data is very important and resource consuming. The classification systems used within administrative sources may be different to those used in the statistical world, and these sources may not cover the whole population of interest (e.g. enterprises exempt from VAT are not covered by the VAT data). For Short-Term Statistics , the administrative data may be available too late in order to produce fresh data. To resolve such conflicts it is necessary to establish priority rules, by deciding which source is most reliable for a particular variable. Once a priority order of sources has been determined for a variable, it should be possible to ensure that data from a high priority source are not overwritten from a lower priority source. This process is made much easier if source codes are stored alongside variables for which several sources are available. Another important issue is the problem of missing data, which is not unique to administrative sources. It can also be due to full or partial non-response to statistical surveys, or even to the removal of data values during the editing process. However, with administrative sources, the issues can sometimes be different, particularly as the problem of missing data can often be more systematic. Often, problems concerning incomplete coverage of the statistical population or missing information on certain issues can be addressed through mixed mode data collection. This means that the administrative data is used as far as possible, but that information which is not available in the administrative data is collected by survey. Business registers To identify the businesses to be included in a survey, a consistent and reliable \u2018survey frame\u2019 is needed. This is normally a business register of some sort, ideally established or adapted for statistical purposes. However, in developing countries such a well-maintained and updated statistical register is normally not available. In this case, one should in the short term make use of any business registers available and seek to combine and harmonise them as far as possible. However, registers do not cover the informal economy. In the longer term, a business register for statistical surveys should be established. Critical is the sustainability of the register, i.e. that proper maintenance and update procedures and the associated resources are in place. The informal economy In many developing countries the \u2018informal sector\u2019 is of vital importance for employment and for the value created in the economy. However, the very nature of the informal economy makes it difficult to capture. The NSI needs to develop both a short term and a longer term strategy for capturing the activities of the \u2018informal\u2019 economy. This strategy should be integrated in the national statistical strategy. Box 11.5 presents best practices for collecting data on the informal economy. However, the approach should be adapted according to national priorities and the resources available. ",
        "D 229 Business Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Box 13.4: How to collect information on the \u2018informal\u2019 economy? The best way to measure the informal sector critically depends on the aims of the measurement. The OECD handbook Measuring the Non- Observed Economy provides valuable guidance on how to collect information on the \u2018informal\u2019 (non-observed) economy, dependent on what the information should be used for. If the aim simply is to monitor the informal sector employment in number as well as the characteristics and conditions of the work, the OECD Handbook recommends to: Add a few questions to the Labour Force Survey or similar \u2022 household survey to identify informal sector work. (However, informal sector employment is often the second job of the interviewed person, e.g. farming for the own family\u2019s needs. The interviewers should follow up on such issues in the interviews.) If the aim is to collect detailed structural information (e.g. number and characteristics of enterprises, production, employment, income, capital, etc.), a dedicated informal sector survey should be carried out: The OECD Handbook recommends a mixed household-enterprise survey as the most suitable approach to collect comprehensive data about the informal sector. In a mixed household-enterprise survey, a sample of households is selected and each household is asked whether any of its members is an entrepreneur, i.e., the sole proprietor of, or a partner in, an unincorporated enterprise. Data for the enterprises identified (or for a sub-sample) are then collected. Such a survey might be an independent survey, a module attached to a household survey or an Integrated survey. The design of the survey is multi-stage: Select a sample of geogra \u2022 phical areas; List or interview all households in these sample areas and identify \u2022 the owners of informal enterprises; Select the households with owners of informal sector \u2022 enterprises; Carry out main interview \u2022 s of these households and enterprise owners. An alternative to the mixed household-enterprise survey is an enterprise survey. However, this requires a \u2018sampling frame\u2019, i.e. a business register comprising also the informal enterprises or a recent census of the informal economic units. Box 13.5: Method for measuring the informal sector: 1-2-3 surveys The economic activity of the informal sector is not recorded through standard business surveys. Measurement of the informal sector has to consider and solve two main problems: The ambiguity \u2022 and unclear delineation of the informal sector; The difficulty in \u2022 capturing quantitative data for the informal sector. 1-2-3 surveys provide a precise definition and a way to measure the informal sector. They are \u2018modular mixed surveys\u2019, combining surveys on individuals, households and enterprises. This approach is considered the most appropriate as it collects more exhaustive information than a simple household or enterprise survey. The 1-2-3 survey is considered as a robust and proven method for the measurement and data collection on the informal sector and on informal employment. It is flexible and can be adapted to national circumstances. The method consists of three phases: Phase 1 (Labour Force Survey) \u2022 : Survey collecting data on the economic activities of individuals and households concerning the supply of employment (employment / unemployment) and the integration of individuals into the job market and workplaces (working conditions). This survey provides information on the functioning of the labour market, especially on employment in the informal sector and on informal employment in the formal sector. The information collected is also used as a filter for the selection of the sample for phase 2. Phase 2 (Survey of the Informal Sector; also called Informal \u2022 Production Unit Survey) : Survey on informal production units (IPU), from a supply-side perspective. This survey is based on a stratified sample according to the sector of activity and status of the leader of the informal production unit. The sample of production units is selected from households participating in Phase 1. Principal economic and activity characteristics can be measured (e.g. value added, financing, sector and place of activity). Phase 3 (\u201cMixed Survey\u201d) \u2022 : Combination of a household consumption survey and a survey on demand (i.e. survey from the demand-side perspective) in the formal and informal sector. The sample is taken as a subsample of households from Phase 1 and aims at results on consumption, formal / informal demand and poverty. This survey provides information for the estimation of household income and the scarcity of money of households which are necessary for the estimation of the living standard and poverty levels of households. There is extensive experience with the 1-2-3 survey methodology in Africa , e.g. the MADIO 1-2-3 survey project in Madagascar and 1-2-3 surveys in the UEMOA Member States . The French DIAL Development Economics research centre has developed the KIT 1-2-3 software and documentation database solution for 1-2-3 surveys in developing countries. ",
        "D 230 Business Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Box 13.7: Example: Improving the business statistics of Sierra Leone Sierra Leone is one of the poorest countries in the world. Its most pressing need is to reduce poverty and to progress towards the MDGs. Thus, the core priority of Sierra Leone\u2019s National Strategy for the Development of Statistics (see also section C.6.1.2 on NSDS) for the years 2008 to 2012 is to improve the quality, reliability and timeliness of data from the national statistical system especially with respect to these priorities. The three main sectors of the economy are agriculture, mining and trade. A large part of the value is created in the informal sector, which is providing employment to more than 70 per cent of the population. The NSDS\u2019s economic statistics programme is focused on providing robust economic indicators for development planning and the government\u2019s Poverty Reduction Strategy. Sound and transparent economic statistics are required on such issues as fiscal deficit, real sector growth, monetary stability and external sector performance. These statistics must also meet the data requirements of international and multilateral organisations (IMF, World Bank, UNSD, ECOWAS and others). In addition to improved national accounts and related statistics, the NSDS outlines the following key areas and actions for improving the business statistics: An improved and enhanced business register to provide a sound \u2022 basis for improved sample surveys of businesses. The register will be updated by a combination of administrative sources (e.g. from the National Social Security and Insurance Trust and the National Revenue Authority), feedback from survey staff in the districts and special \u2018proving\u2019 surveys. Small enterprises with less than 10 employees tend to be missing from the administrative sources. To counter this, a census of establishment is foreseen every 5 years, in order to capture also these enterprises; Annual data on employment and wages by industry in the formal \u2022 sector, based on tax data (Pay-As-You-Earn ; PAYE) from the national revenue authority (NRA); Expanded agricultural statistics, as agriculture is the mainstay of \u2022 the national economy; An informal sector business survey and report, as this is an \u2022 important element of economic activity not recorded through the standard business surveys. The \u2018Non Observed Economy\u2019 comprises informal sector production and production of households for their own use, as well as underground and illegal production. Due to its size and importance to the economy, informal sector statistics are needed for the national accounts and to monitor the small-scale business sector and devise development policies for the small and medium-sized enterprises. Information gathered should cover the informal sector\u2019s main actors and activities, its size in terms of employment and value added, key factors influencing this sector, etc. The response rate to the surveys is a problem. Statistics Sierra Leone (SSL) aims to improve these through a mixture of education, promotion, persistence and penalties for businesses that refuse to cooperate. A key message to the businesses is that the confidentiality of data is guaranteed by the Statistics Law and that neither the government nor the tax authorities have access to the statistical data. Box 13.6: Example: Improving the statistics on the informal sector in Cameroon Cameroon\u2019s National Strategy for the Development of Statistics for the years 2009 to 2012 expresses a strong need to improve the quality, reliability and timeliness of data from the national statistical system. A large part of the economic value in Cameroon is created in the informal sector, which accounted for more than 90 per cent of total employment in 2005. The NSDS\u2019s economic statistics programme is focused on providing robust economic indicators, especially concerning population and households, national accounts, environment, poverty and the informal economy. In order to provide reliable data on population, households and the informal sector (in particular in terms of value added and employment), Cameroon was one of the first developing countries designing and implementing a \u20181-2-3 survey\u2019 for the collection of data on the informal sector. It also uses some elements of the \u20181-2-3 survey\u2019 for other statistics and for the calculation of the weight of the informal sector in national accounts. The informal sector in Cameroon is defined as \u201cthe entirety of production units of goods and services without tax liability and / or without written accountancy in the sense of a standard form of accounts\u201d. Cameroon has carried out the 1-2-3 survey four times: in the Yaound\u00e9 urban area in 1993 (phases 1-2-3) and 1994 (only phase 1), and at national level in 2005 (phases 1-2) and 2007 (only phase 1). The data collected in phase 2 of the survey are most relevant to business statistics and national accounts, as the informal production units (IPUs) are the surveyed entities in this phase. The characteristics for each survey phase are as follows: Phase 1 (1993, 1994, 2005 and 2007) \u2022 : Household survey on labour supply and the integration of individuals into the labour market (e.g. information on activity and unemployment rates, salaries, education and qualifications of employees, mobility and occupational safety). Households were selected according to socio-economic strata, obtained from the population census, in two steps: selection of a clustered household sample of which a certain number of households was selected. Phase 2 (1993 and 2005) \u2022 : Survey of informal production units (IPUs), providing complementary information for the national accounts through the establishment of production accounts and the fragmentation / division of the informal sector. This survey phase also provides information to analyse the behaviour of persons working in the informal sector and the integration of the informal sector in the national production system. The sample was drawn from the sample used in phase 1, of entities identified as informal production units. For the survey in 2005, the sample was stratified so that the number of IPUs was proportional to the number of households in urban (with emphasis on a representative sample in Douala and Yaound\u00e9), semi-urban and rural areas. Phase 3 (1993) \u2022 : Household budget survey including questions on the consumption behaviour of households, i.e. origin of bought products (formal or informal sector) and on the main motivation for households to buy products at certain places. The survey sample is selected from the entirety of households but stratified according to the gender of the head of the household and the household\u2019s income. Cameroon notes that for the collection of reliable, high quality data, the execution of all phases of the survey at regular intervals and at national level as well as the selection of a consistent sample seem to be indispensable.

Environmental statistics The chapter in brief This chapter covers statistics and indicators relevant to the European Commission development cooperation in the field of the environment and sustainable management of natural resources. The present chapter on environmental indicators starts by listing the main contributions of environmental indicators to environmental and economic policies. It continues by identifying several key indicators used for the environmental issues or topics: Air \u2013 statistics on emissions to air and ozone depleting \u2022 substances Air quality indicators \u2022 Water \u2013 statistics on emissions to water and water resources \u2022 Water quality indicators \u2022 Waste statistics \u2022 Statistics on biodiversity \u2013 protected areas \u2022 Land use and land cover statistics \u2022 For each indicator mentioned, a brief definition is provided; the environmental issues and relevance for environmental policy are highlighted; the main international agreements and targets are also indicated. Environmental statistics are continuously being developed and improved according to new needs, findings and new requirements. This is reflected in the current chapter. Comments and suggestions for updates and improvements are appreciated ( ESTAT-INTER-COOP@ ec.europa.eu ). To be informed of the most recent developments in this statistics domain, it is recommended to follow the references given throughout the chapter. D.14.1. Policy applications: what this data is used for Environmental indicators should be statistics that are scientifically credible and representative of an environment issue. They should be key, powerful and cost-effective tools for environment assessment. Appropriately chosen indicators based on sufficient time series data can show key trends and help describe causes and effects of environmental conditions. They make it possible to track implementation of environmental policies and to assess their efficiency. Environmental indicators can be measured and reported at different scales. National governments use environmental indicators to show status and trends with respect to environmental issues of importance to develop or adapt their environmental policies and to inform their citizens. For example, a town may monitor air quality to estimate health impact on the population, degradation of buildings, etc., or track air quality along with water quality and count the number of rare species to estimate the health of the environment in their area. Environmental indicators contribute to: Identifying key factors that cause pressure on the \u2022 environment; Measuring environmental performance with respect to \u2022 environmental quality and environmental goals; they help set priorities and quantitative targets; Assessing compliance with national legislation, \u2022 international agreements and other commitments; Integrating environmental concerns in economic \u2022 and sectoral policies; they help update policies in environmentally significant economic sectors; Monitoring progress towards environmentally sustainable \u2022 development, including decoupling of environmental pressure from economic growth; Measuring material flows and resource productivity; \u2022 Informing the public about major environmental trends \u2022 and conditions: providing information on driving forces, impacts and policy responses is also a common strategy to strengthen public support for policy measures. Like other indicators they have to be interpreted in context and be complemented with country specific information to acquire their full meaning. Air and water quality indicators calculated and obtained from monitoring data describe the state of these two media (see Box 14.1). They are key indicators as they allow evaluation of the importance of the pressures exerted on air and water (pressure indicators), as well as evaluation of impacts on the environment and human health (impacts indicators). This in turn will allow develop and implement remedial actions (response indicators); the DPSIR approach is detailed in Box 14.2). ",
        "D 236 Environmental Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Box 14.1: Monitoring as a part of environmental management Environmental monitoring can be described to be repeated measurements, with certain intervals, of relevant characteristics with comparable (standardized) methods to follow changes and trends in nature and the environment due to anthropogenic activities over a period of time. The overall objective of monitoring is not to produce data but to create relevant information. Therefore it is essential to identify information needs and the users as well as to quantify the use of environment information for environmental management. Different information needs may require different monitoring objectives e.g. to assess average state in order to adjust management, to check compliance with standards or limit values and/or to detect and assess impacts (e.g. from point sources of pollution, etc.) etc. Regarding the decision makers, the information would in principle be used to detect problem areas where changes in environmental management are needed and to identify and prioritise efforts to be undertaken. The responsible public bodies, such as the Ministry of the Environment or an environmental agency, prepare tailor-made strategies for the implementation of monitoring activities between different authorities, institutes and other stakeholders. The strategies are based on information needs and encompass responsibilities and business rules between participating institutes, as well as setting monitoring priorities. Such strategies have to be revised on a regular basis (e.g. every 5\u201310 years). Keeping in mind that practical solutions should always be preferred, the basic rules for a successful environmental monitoring and assessment programme, as well as for the establishment of a useful monitoring network can be condensed to some key considerations: Information needs must be defined prior to the elaboration of \u2022 the monitoring programme itself. Adequate financial support must be secured. \u2022 Step-by-step approach can be used in implementing the \u2022 programme Technical details (e.g. pollutants to be monitored, sampling \u2022 frequency, measurement methods etc.) must be clearly defined n the programme. The programme must be evaluated periodically. \u2022 Background and other monitoring data (like meteorological \u2022 and statistical data) are nearly always necessary especially in the assessment and reporting phases. In addition, environmental indicators are intended to help: Improve environmental reporting at both national and in- \u2022 ternational levels; Make their national environmental assessments compara- \u2022 ble with other countries; Facilitate data gathering for future regional / national envi- \u2022 ronmental reports. Several international organisations have activities to develop frameworks and indicator sets for environmental issues, environment-sector integration and sustainable development issues. A list of these can be found in the \u2018To find out more\u2019 box at the end of this chapter. Criteria used in selecting environmental indicators are: Relevance to national environmental priorities; a. Relation to international environmental policy; b. Role as a means of communication for public awareness; c. Measurability; d. Availability of time series; e. Predictive ability: capacity to track the effectiveness of f. pursued environmental policy. Box 14.2: The DPSIR framework At present, most indicator reports compile sets of physical, biological or chemical indicators. They generally reflect a systems analysis view of the relations between the environmental system and the human system. According to this systems analysis view, social and economic developments are (i) Driving forces that exert (ii) Pressure on the environment and, as a consequence, the (iii) State of the environment changes, such as the provision of adequate conditions for health, resources availability and biodiversity. Finally, this leads to (iv) Impacts on human health, ecosystems and materials that may elicit a societal (v) Response that feeds back on the (i) Driving forces or on the state or impacts directly, through adaptation or curative action. This causal chain is the so-called \u201cDPSIR approach\u201d. From the policy point of view, there is a need for clear and specific information on these five elements. This is achieved by using environmental indicators reflecting the links between human activities and their ultimate environmental impacts as well as the societal responses to these impacts. Most sets of indicators presently used by national and international bodies are based on the DPSIR-framework or a subset of it. D.14.2. Air \u2013 statistics on emissions to air and ozone depleting substances D.14.2.1. Concepts and definitions Key environmental indicators in this environmental sector are ( UNECE classification ): Emissions of pollutants into the atmospheric air a. Greenhouse gas emissions b. Ambient air quality in urban areas c. Consumption of ozone-depleting substances d. Indicators related to air emissions concern pollutants causing harm to human health and/or to ecosystems but also substances contributing to greenhouse effect and to climate change. Main pollutants and substances considered are: sulphur dioxide (SO 2 ), nitrogen oxides (NO x ), ammonia (NH 3 ), particulate matter, carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), non-methane volatile organic compounds ",
        "D 237 Environmental Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 (NMVOCs), persistent organic pollutants (POPs, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxins/furans and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)) and heavy metals (cadmium, lead and mercury) emitted into the ambient air. An emission inventory is an accounting of the amount of pollutants discharged into the atmosphere. It usually contains the total emissions for one or more air pollutants, originating from all types of emission sources in a certain geographical area and within a specified time span, usually a specific year. Statistics used are the total emission volumes and the volumes broken down by economic activities as defined by the International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC) or by the Selected Nomenclature for Sources of Air Pollution (SNAP) . SNAP considers 11 relevant sectors: (1) combustion in energy transformation industry, (2) non-industrial combustion plants, (3) combustion in manufacturing industry, (4) production processes, (5) extraction and distribution of fossil fuels, (6) solvent and other product use, (7) road transport, (8) other mobile sources and machinery, (9) waste treatment and disposal, (10) agriculture and (11) other sources and sinks. The emission values are generally expressed in thousands of tonnes (Kt) or million of grams (Mg) per year, as appropriate for a particular pollutant. For cross-country comparisons, emissions may also be presented per km\u00b2 of the country\u2019s territory, per capita or per unit of gross domestic product (GDP). These emission inventories give a measure of existing and expected pressure on the environment in terms of emissions of harmful substances into the atmospheric air and \u201cdistance to target\u201d (if any). The main source for many pollutants is burning of fuels, particularly petroleum products. In some countries, agriculture and burning of savannas are also important contributors, but estimating these emissions is difficult and data are often not available. The key question to be answered is what progress is being made in reducing emissions of pollutants across the country/ region? The indicators on emissions to air are important for following manmade emissions substantially increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases but also for assessing pressure on atmospheric air quality in the country as a whole. They also allow identifying pressure from particular sectors like energy, transport, industrial processes, agriculture and waste management. Indicators on greenhouse gases emissions fall within the scope of the Kyoto Protocol, a protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) , aimed at fighting global warming and achieving the \u201cstabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. Information on pollutant emissions is also necessary for the assessment of transboundary air pollution and for international cooperation to address this problem. This aspect is addressed in the UNECE Convention on Long- range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP) : it requires implementation of measures to prevent, control and reduce emissions of air pollutants and to exchange information on them. At the European level, the IPPC Directive concerning integrated pollution prevention and control sets out the main principles for the permitting and control of installations based on an integrated approach and the application of best available techniques (BAT), which are the most effective techniques to achieve a high level of environmental protection, taking into account the costs and benefits. Also, the NEC directive on National Emission Ceilings for certain pollutants sets upper limits for each Member State for the total emissions of the four pollutants responsible for acidification, eutrophication and ground-level ozone pollution. Other important indicators are those concerning the production and use of substances which deplete stratospheric ozone (ODS): total amount produced, sold or consumed in a country. The issue is to know whether and to what extent the emissions of ozone-depleting substances are reduced according to the schedule agreed at the international level by the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer (1985) , its Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (1987) and the latter amendments of London, Copenhagen, Montreal and Beijing. The Montreal Protocol sets a target to eliminate the production and use of ODS. D.14.2.2. Source of data About emission inventories, CLRTAP and its eight protocols cover the methodology of data collection on emissions of pollutants into the air. Internationally agreed methodology and standards for estimating air emissions are included in the UNECE Emission Inventory Guidebook developed jointly by EMEP 50 acting under the CLRTAP and European Environment Agency CORe Inventory of AIR emissions (EEA CORINAIR). These methods are also linked with the revised 1996 Guidelines of the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC), which are the basis for reporting to the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change (UNFCCC). The guidebook and the IPCC guidelines are not only used as a reference by EU countries but also by, for instance, ENP East countries (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine), Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. 50 \u201cEuropean Monitoring and Evaluation Programme\u201d: Co-operative Programme for Monitoring and Evaluation of the Long-range Transmission of Air Pollutants in Europe ",
        "D 238 Environmental Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 In practice, two basic methods of emission inventory are generally applied in the EMEP guidebook: the first, detailed one is based on direct measurements of emissions, while the second is an estimation based on technological calculations through the use of surrogated statistics like data on production volumes, fuel and raw materials consumption. In this last case, the surrogated values are multiplied by an emission factor specific for each pollutant and each type of emission source. Input data and statistics are usually collected at the city and regional levels before being aggregated at the national level by government bodies in charge of environment, industry, agriculture and transport. They are also collated by the national statistical agencies. An essential source of data remains with: The information submitted by the companies for obtaining \u2022 environmental permits of exploitation; The monitoring data on emissions measured by the com- \u2022 panies themselves (self-monitoring) or by the institutions in charge of verifying the respect by the companies of na- tional emission limit values. As for the ozone depleting substances, data collection should cover substances in annexes A\u2013C and E of the Montreal Protocol, whether existing alone or in a mixture. Data on production, imports and exports of ODS are generally collected annually by national statistical agencies and/or national focal points responsible for reporting under the Montreal Protocol. The UNEP Ozone Secretariat has developed forms for reporting data under the Montreal Protocol, covering imports, exports, production, amounts destroyed and imports from and/or exports to countries who are not parties to the Convention. Consumption is calculated as production plus imports minus exports, destroyed quantities, and feedstock uses of a controlled substance, based on data reported in metric tonnes. Data are collected using a variety of methods, including registries or other collections from known producers and consumers, use of estimates and surveys, collecting information through (or from) customs, among other methods. National figures are used directly, without adjustment.

Air quality indicators D.14.3.1. Concepts and definitions A clean air supply is essential to our own health and that of the environment. But since the industrial revolution, the quality of the air we breathe has deteriorated considerably - mainly as a result of human activities. Rising industrial and energy production, the burning of fossil fuels and the dramatic rise in traffic on our roads all contribute to air pollution in our towns and cities which, in turn, can lead to serious health problems. For example, air pollution is increasingly being cited as the main cause of lung conditions such as asthma - twice as many people suffer from asthma today compared to 20 years ago. Major concerns relate to the effects of air pollution on human health, ecosystems, and buildings, and to their economic and social consequences. Human exposure is particularly high in urban areas where economic activities and road traffic are concentrated. It also happens around industrial zones. An important source of pollution in many urban areas is fuel combustion in motor vehicles. Further pollution sources are industry and household combustion of fuel (including wood). Generated pollutants include nitrogen oxides (NO x ), carbon monoxide (CO), sulphur dioxide (SO 2 ), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5 depending on their size) and heavy metals such as lead. On warm summer days the strong sunlight leads to a build-up of ground-level (or tropospheric) ozone (O 3 ). Ozone is formed through the reaction between other pollutants (oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as benzene in the presence of nitrogen oxides). However, due to the special atmospheric chemistry of ground-level ozone, levels are very often lower in urban areas than in the countryside. ",
        "D 239 Environmental Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Nowadays a major challenge in many urban zones is to further reduce emissions of local and regional air pollutants in order to achieve stronger decoupling of emissions from GDP and to limit the exposure of the population to air pollution. This implies implementing appropriate pollution control policies, technological progress, energy savings and environmentally sustainable transport policies. The key indicators in this domain are related to ambient air quality in urban areas, i.e. the concentration of the above mentioned air pollutants. The main pollutants monitored are ground-level ozone, particulate matter (PM 10 , and PM 2.5), sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and lead. Carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds including benzene (VOCs) can also be considered. Box 14.3 details the key aspects of monitoring data and indicators. Box 14.3: Monitoring data and indicators The collection and analysis of environmental data is necessary to provide objective, reliable and comparable information that shall enable actions needed to protect the environment and to ensure transparency in relation to the public. Primary data are data obtained from monitoring activities. Environmental monitoring generates huge amount of these primary data. An example is the hourly measured concentrations of pollutants in the air: measuring one pollutant on an hourly basis at one station over one year generates 8.760 data. As such, these data have very limited or \u201cneutral\u201d information value: one isolated data just tells what was the concentration of one pollutant at a certain time and at a certain location. In order to get more information, these primary data must be processed, aggregated and analysed in order to produce statistics and indicators. An indicator may simply be a selected statistic (like percentiles or mean values) or an aggregation of several statistics: for example, an air quality index. While primary data have relatively low information content, indicators are not \u201cneutral\u201d: they are linked to defined environmental management issues and allow to evaluate or assess the situation. Using for this assessment the DPSIR framework used by the EEA ensures that issues are handled in a comprehensive way and that all important aspects are covered. Unit of measurement is \u03bcg/m\u00b3, ppm or ppb, as appropriate. Knowing the concentrations of pollutants allows verification of whether limit values fixed to protect human health and/ or ecosystems are exceeded, as well as estimation of the exposure of ecosystems to acidification, eutrophication and ozone. The number of exceedances of limit values and exposure assessment are additional indicators included in the EEA Core Set of Indicators (see Box 14.11). The indicators on ambient air quality in urban areas are also closely linked to other indicators which relate to causes and sources of pollutants, effects (e.g. on health) and societal responses. These include, for example, the indicators on population growth rate, rate of growth of urban population, percent of population in urban areas, annual energy consumption per capita, emissions of sulphur oxides and nitrogen oxides, life expectancy at birth, share of consumption of renewable energy resources. At European level, the environmental quality of ambient air and monitoring falls mainly under the Ambient Air Quality Framework or CAFE Directive (2008/50/EC,) which requires air quality monitoring and the achievement of air quality objectives. World Health Organization (WHO) air quality guidelines exist for all the pollutants mentioned above. Many countries have established their own air quality standards for many of these pollutants. Box 14.4: Establishing an Integrated Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Framework (IAAQMF) and Developing an Air Quality Index (AQI) for Mauritius (2010) With the continually sustained economic growth in Mauritius, the Ministry of the Environment & NDU (National Development Unit) has registered an increase in number of complaints with regards to air pollution. Moreover with the advent of waste-to-energy power plants projects in the energy sector, baseline data for other important air pollutants such as Dioxin and Furans need to be established. The data obtained will be an essential tool for the Government in policy decision making. The Department of Environment needs to monitor the air quality around the island over a 24 hrs basis with the use of an Integrated Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Framework (IAAQMF) comprising of fixed and mobile stations linked through a central network system. Two mobile ambient air monitoring stations have been acquired in 2009 for measurement of Particulate Matter (PM 10, PM 2.5 and Total Suspended Particles) and gaseous contaminants (Sulphur Dioxide, Oxides of Nitrogen and Carbon Monoxide). The IAAQMF will enable the Department of Environment to develop an Air Quality Index (AQI) for Mauritius which will inform the public about the air quality and the level of pollution, including the associated health hazards. With the introduction of an Air Quality Index (AQI), the citizens of Mauritius will thus be better informed about the quality of air they are breathing. The latter applies also to the tourism sector (i.e. Eco-tourism or Sustainable tourism) as well as the Integrated Resort Scheme (IRS), which could lead to higher direct investment inflow. The following specific actions will be achieved: To carry out an analysis of the existing ambient air monitoring \u2022 system; To develop an Air Quality Index for Mauritius; \u2022 To establish a data management system for the AQI. \u2022 To propose a mechanism for the implementation of the IAAQMF; \u2022 To develop a 5-year strategic plan, including financial, technical, \u2022 human resource requirements, policy and structural reforms with time schedules By establishing an Integrated Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Framework (IAAQMF) the Ministry will be in a better position to effectively execute its roles and functions as Enforcing Agency for Air Quality, as Mauritius seeks to be recognized internationally as a country where the ambient air quality is good and safe for living.

Sources of data In many countries, data on ambient air pollution concentrations is routinely collected by national or local monitoring networks which include several monitoring stations where samplings (and measurements in case of automatic stations) are made. Most of the time, these networks are managed by public authorities at the national, regional or municipal levels. At the national level, monitoring of air quality and its management falls under the responsibility of the Ministry of the Environment or the Ministry for Health and their agencies. Data can also be collected for research purposes by universities and research institutes. In addition, industries can be obliged to monitor air quality in their surrounding area in accordance with the obligations specified in the environmental permit granted by the competent authorities. Monitoring stations can be classified according to the main sources of pollution affecting air quality in their surroundings (mainly industrial, traffic or background oriented stations). They can be located in urban, suburban or rural zones. Monitoring data must be representative both in terms of time representativeness (i.e. covering a representative time period) and of spatial representativeness (i.e. representing a significant area and/or population exposure). Indicators aggregating the monitoring data may be designed and constructed in a number of ways. Examples of statistics used for air quality indicators are: the annual mean and percentiles values, the number of days or hours with concentration exceeding a certain value, etc. Where monitoring data are unavailable, estimates of pollution levels may be made using air pollution models or other methods (e.g. monitoring campaigns with diffusion tubes, bio- indicators etc.). Air quality data and statistics from the EU-27 Member States and from other associated countries are compiled in Airbase , a database maintained by the EEA with the assistance of the thematic centre on air and climate change (ETCACC).

Water \u2013 statistics on emissions to water and water resources D.14.4.1. Concepts and definitions Major key environmental indicators in this environmental sector are: Renewable freshwater resources a. Freshwater abstraction b. Household water use per capita c. Water losses d. Reuse and recycling of freshwater e. Polluted (non-treated) wastewaters f. Water quality in urban areas (covered in a separate chap- g. ter) Renewable fresh water resources are defined as the total volume of river run-off and groundwater generated under natural conditions, exclusively by precipitation within the country, and the actual flow of rivers and groundwater coming from neighbouring countries. The measurement units are million cubic metres (m 3 ) per year. The development of this indicator provides a measure of the state of renewable freshwater resources in a country. The total volume of surface and ground freshwater abstracted annually is another indicator: total, by economic activity (in accordance with ISIC) and as a percentage of renewable freshwater resources (the country\u2019s water exploitation index, or WEI). The indicator provides, in relation to total resources available for abstraction, a measure of the pressure on the environment in terms of abstraction of freshwater resources. It can reflect the extent of water resource scarcity and the distribution of abstracted water among different economic activities. Since water quality is often linked to water quantity - e.g. flow or volume affects quality by influencing concentration of pollutants - the relation of freshwater abstraction to renewal of stocks is a central issue in sustainable freshwater resource management. The indicator can show to what extent freshwater resources are already used and any need to adjust supply and demand management policy. Changes in the WEI help to analyse how changes in abstraction affect freshwater resources by increasing pressure on them or making them more sustainable. The WEI threshold that distinguishes non- stressed regions from stressed ones is around 20%. Severe water stress can occur where the WEI exceeds 40%. Main concerns relate to the inefficient use of water and to its environmental and socio-economic consequences: low river flows, water shortages, salinisation of freshwater bodies in coastal areas, human health problems, loss of wetlands, desertification and reduced food production. Pressures on ",
        "D 241 Environmental Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 freshwater resources are exerted by overexploitation and by degradation of environmental quality. Household water use per capita is the quantity of water used to cover the household and related utility needs of the population The unit is cubic metres per year and per capita (or litres/day per capita). This indicator provides a measure of the pressure on the environment in terms of water abstraction from different water sources. The indicator \u2013 to be considered in relation with available resources - is one of the major ones defining the level of development of water economy services and the degree of water accessibility to cover all household needs of the population. This indicator helps identify trends in rational water use in a particular location. Water losses are defined as the quantity and percentage of freshwater lost during transport (owing to leakage and evaporation) between a point of abstraction and a point of use. The amount of water lost during transport to users is an indicator of the efficiency of a water management system, including technical conditions affecting water supply pipelines. The share of reused or recycled water in the total volume of water used to cover production needs defines the percentage of water saved by applying recycling and reused water supply systems as a national total and broken down by economic activities. At the international level, the Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes requires that the parties introduce sustainable water management, including an ecosystem approach and the rational and fair use of transboundary waters. In the European Union, the Water Framework Directive obliges the Member States to promote sustainable use based on long-term protection of available water resources and to ensure a balance between abstraction and recharge of groundwater, with the aim of achieving \u201cgood groundwater status\u201d by 2015. D.14.4.2. Source of data Renewable freshwater (surface and groundwater) resources are replenished by precipitation (less evapo-transpiration) falling on a country\u2019s territory that ends up as runoff to rivers and recharge to aquifers (internal flow), and by surface waters and groundwater flowing in from other countries (inflow). Climatic, ecological, economic and other limitations on the availability of these resources for abstraction are reflected in the variable \u201cregular freshwater resources 95 per cent of the time\u201d. Data on renewable freshwater resources are usually collected at selected hydrological stations both at the national level and at the levels of main river basins. The values are calculated on the basis of long-term measurements of levels, flow rates and inflows/outflows carried out on rivers and lakes as well as groundwater horizons and countrywide precipitation. The indicator is the major one used to define the water balance of a country. Water is abstracted by public or private bodies whose main function is to provide water for various uses (the \u201cpublic water supply\u201d). It can also be directly abstracted from rivers, lakes, wells or springs by industries, farmers, households and others for their own use (self-supply). The indicator incorporates data on abstraction of freshwater, broken down according to the main activity of the water abstractor as defined by ISIC/NACE. The water abstraction indicator calculations are based on the data on quantity of abstracted water reported by water users to the relevant authorities. The quantity of water abstracted is either measured or calculated on the basis of energy consumption for pumps. In some cases it is necessary to apply a calculation method using models for some water users (household and agriculture). The WEI (Water Exploitation Index) is the ratio of annual total water abstraction to long-term annual average renewable freshwater resources, expressed as a percentage. The WEI provides a good national-level overview of the pressures on resources in an easily understandable format, and it shows trends over time. Data and information concerning the use of WEI in African countries are available in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report: Climate Change 2007 . Household water use per capita can be determined based on the measured volume supplied mainly through the public water supply systems. Use of water by the population not supplied by public water supply systems needs to be calculated. Households\u2019 water use per capita is calculated by dividing total water consumption in the community by the respective number of inhabitants. The indicator is based on data submitted by associations, enterprises and organizations supplying households with water and by local public administration bodies. In many countries around the world, data on household water use are still collected by the government branch dealing with housing and municipal services. WHO has been collecting estimates of national average figures from governments as part of its water supply and sanitation monitoring activities, published by the WHO and UNICEF. The selected indicators provide information related to \u201c Goal 7: Ensure environmental sustainability\u201d of the MDGs , in particular with respect to whether Goal 7c \u201c Halve, by 2015, the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation \u201d are being reached (see also section B.1.1 and section B.4.1). When working with water losses, the most important issue is to have data on the quantities of freshwater lost from water supply systems between a point of abstraction and a point of use due to leakage or evaporation The indicator is estimated and defined as the absolute and relative difference between the amount of water abstracted and the amount delivered to users (households; agriculture, forestry and fishing; manufacturing, the electricity industry and other economic activities).

Water quality indicators D.14.5.1. Concepts and definitions Water quality is about what is in water and how quality affects its usefulness. It is a precondition for human, animal and plant life as well as an indispensable resource for the economy. Water also plays a fundamental role in the climate regulation cycle. Rivers have often been treated unwisely as a convenient way of transporting waste to the sea, affecting the biodiversity of thousands of kilometres of waterways, harming human health, and in the end polluting coastal and marine waters. Protection of water resources, of fresh and salt water ecosystems and of the water we drink and bathe in is therefore one of the cornerstones of environmental protection. The stakes are high and the issues transcend national boundaries and concerted action between countries is very often necessary to ensure an effective protection of water basins. Key water quality indicators are: Indicators related to drinking water quality a. BOD (biochemical oxygen demand) and concentration b. of ammonium in rivers Nutrients in freshwater c. Nutrients in coastal seawaters d. Water for drinking should be free of disease-causing microorganisms, harmful chemicals, objectionable taste and odour problems, and excessive levels of colour and suspended material. Since many water supplies receive no treatment, it is important that the indicator reflects the effectiveness of management of the whole water supply system including the water catchment, storage and distribution system. The indicator provides a measure of the risk of negative impacts of poor drinking water quality on human health and shows the extent to which the drinking water supply conforms to sanitary requirements and standards. The EU Drinking Water Directive (98/83/EC) sets standards for the 48 most common parameters, based on the WHO guidelines, including selected microbiological and chemical quality parameters are measured. Commonly measured parameters of water quality are: total coliforms, thermo-tolerant coliforms, nitrate, trihalomethanes, heavy metals, pesticides, acidity (pH), aluminium, colour, turbidity, total dissolved salts, hardness, iron, manganese. For each parameter, the proportion of drinking water samples analysed that fail to comply with the relevant standards is calculated. BOD and concentrations of ammonium in rivers provide a measure of the state of rivers in terms of biodegradable organic load and ammonium (NH 4+ ). BOD is a key indicator, expressing the amount of oxygen consumed by organisms in water and sediment to break down organic matter present in the water. Ammonium concentration also exerts a demand on oxygen in water as it is transformed to oxidised forms of nitrogen. It is toxic to aquatic life at certain concentrations (in relation to water temperature, salinity and pH). High BOD and ammonium concentrations are usually a result of organic pollution, caused by direct discharge of wastewater, discharges from wastewater treatment plants, industrial effluents and agricultural run-off. In most European countries, the BOD5 test is used (oxygen consumption is measured after 5 days incubation under controlled conditions). In other countries, the BOD7 test is used (samples are incubated for 7 days). Annual average BOD is expressed in mg O 2 consumption per litre and annual average total ammonium concentrations in micrograms of nitrogen per litre. Information on the quality of surface waters in terms of substances which cannot be degraded biologically (or chemical oxygen demand - COD) could be considered as well. Nutrients in freshwater provides a measure of state of freshwater (rivers, lakes and groundwater) in terms of nutrient concentration (phosphates and nitrates). Large inputs of nutrients to freshwater bodies from urban areas, industry and agricultural areas can lead to eutrophication of water bodies with subsequent oxygen depletion. As for high BOD and ammonium concentrations, this causes ecological ",
        "D 243 Environmental Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 changes that can result in a loss of plant and animal species and have negative impacts on the use of water for human consumption and other purposes. Concentrations of nitrates are expressed as mg of nitrates/litre, and concentrations of phosphate and phosphorus as mg of phosphorus/litre Nutrients in coastal seawater provide a measure of the state of coastal seawaters in terms of nutrient concentrations. Nitrogen and phosphorus enrichment can result in a chain of undesirable effects, starting with excessive growth of plankton algae, which increases the amount of organic matter settling to the bottom. The consequent increase in oxygen consumption can lead to oxygen depletion, changes in community structure and death of the benthic fauna. Eutrophication can also increase the risk of algal blooms, some of them consisting of harmful species. Concentrations of major biogenic substances are expressed in mg/litre. At European level the environmental quality of surface waters with respect to organic pollution reflected by the BOD and ammonium as well as the reduction of the loads and impacts of these pollutants are objectives of several directives including: the Drinking Water Directive (98/83/EC) which sets standards for BOD and ammonium content of drinking water, the Nitrates Directive (91/676/EEC) aimed at reducing nitrate and organic matter pollution from agricultural land, the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive (91/271/ EEC) aimed at reducing pollution from direct discharge of untreated or insufficiently treated wastewater, from sewage treatment works and certain industries, the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control Directive (96/61/EEC and 2008/1/EC) aimed at controlling and preventing the pollution of water by industry, and the Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) which requires the achievement of good ecological status or good ecological potential of rivers across the EU by 2015.

The basin covers different climatic and topographic zones and land use types, including protected areas. The four countries co-operate in managing their water resources through the Limpopo Water Course Commission (LIMCOM). An on-line tool, the Limpopo River Awareness Kit, has been designed to support capacity development in LIMCOM and raise awareness for trans-boundary water issues in southern Africa. As the river basin passes through various geographical regions and biomes and supports a wide array of water demands, there is a great need for Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM). IWRM is challenging, even more so in a trans-boundary setting. At a basin or sub-basin scale, the priority is often on monitoring and management of water quantity . However, the monitoring and management of water quality is equally important. Maintaining water quality is critical for communities throughout the Limpopo River basin. Protection of water quality in the river system directly or indirectly contributes to the achievement of several Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and their associated targets: Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger; \u2022 Reduce child mortality; \u2022 Combat disease, including HIV/AIDS, malaria, and waterborne diseases; \u2022 Ensure environmental sustainability: halve, by 2015, the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic \u2022 sanitation. Monitoring plays a crucial role in determining sustainable abstraction volumes, the feasibility of developments, and strategy for efficient overall resource management. Meteorological and hydrological data collection is done at the national level, primarily for use at the national level. One recommendation is to develop a trans-boundary monitoring network, including a comprehensive surface water and groundwater monitoring program consistent in quality. A key issue is freshwater quality: While there is often a focus on water quantity (maintaining dam volumes, stream flow, water supply, etc.), less attention has been paid to water quality, especially to policy instruments to protect and manage this critical aspect of freshwater. River runoff comprises the most essential data for water resources management. The overall water quality situation in the Limpopo River basin is described as impacted, but not severe. Land use management and developments within this basin have altered water quality when compared with the baseline/un-impacted conditions. Water resources in most of the sub- catchments in the Limpopo River basin are impacted by the following (Ashton et al, 2001): Mining and minerals processing. As the Limpopo River basin includes numerous mines, active and abandoned, the environment is under \u2022 significant threat from acid mine drainage; the metals and chemicals typically found in acid mine drainage can cause serious illnesses in humans and animals; Non-point impact from commercial or subsistence agriculture, irrigation and redistribution of river waters; \u2022 Erosion. Soil erosion, resulting from poor tillage and land use management can result in an increased sediment load in rivers, as soils and \u2022 sediments wash away during heavy or sustained rainfall events; Uncontrolled and wild landfills and solid waste disposal sites; \u2022 Disposal of liquid and effluent, fuel loss and litter on roadways; \u2022 Non-point domestic effluent via soak-aways in rural areas. \u2022 Another issue is groundwater quality: The impacts of changes in surface water quality can often be seen directly and the causal chain is often clear. It is not always evident where impacts on groundwater quality originate. However, it is equally important as it is often used for drinking water and domestic consumption. One of the primary sources of human-caused groundwater pollution in urban areas is leakage from pit-latrines in areas with poor sanitation. Agriculture (irrigated cultivation and livestock) is another important source of groundwater contamination because of the pesticides, herbicides and fertilizers used.

Sources of data Data on water quality is often routinely collected by national or local monitoring networks at several sites where sampling is made. Chemical analyses are carried out in laboratory. In most countries, the agency responsible for the surveillance of drinking-water supply services is the Ministry of Health (or a public health Agency) and its regional or departmental offices. In some countries, it may be an environmental protection agency. Local environmental health authorities also often play an important role in managing water resources and drinking-water supplies. Besides drinking water, water quality monitoring is usually under the responsibility of the Ministry of the Environment or the Ministry in charge of water management and their agencies. In practice implementation is done by several institutions. Monitoring data must be representative both in terms of time representativeness (i.e. adequate sampling frequency) and of spatial representativeness (i.e. representing average conditions). Monitoring must also reflects the hydrological importance of particular rivers, lakes and groundwater zones. Data are aggregated and generally presented in the form of tables which include the annual average concentrations of BOD and ammonia, of nitrates, phosphates, total phosphorus and total nitrogen, compared with national water quality standards or international water quality targets (relevant sea- related conventions or national targets). Data on drinking water quality are usually presented in the form of a table which consists of selected microbiological and chemical quality parameters measured, the total number of samples, the number of non-compliant samples and the percentage of non-compliant samples in each category. The UNSD International Environment Statistics Database provides some data transmitted by national statistical agencies. International Recommendations for Water Statistics (IRWS) were developed to assist countries establish and strengthen information systems for water which in turn support the design and evaluation of better water policies for Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM). Among others, these recommendations provide the necessary information for deriving coherent and consistent indicators, enabling comparisons over time and between countries from an agreed list of data items. The data received from countries, together with data from other sources, feed into UNSD\u2019s evolving environment statistics database. At the European level, the Water Information System for Europe \u2013 or more commonly known as WISE \u2013 is the European gateway to information on European water issues.

Waste \u2013 statistics on waste gen- eration, movements of hazardous wastes, recycling and disposal D.14.6.1. Concepts and definitions Key environmental indicators in this environmental sector are ( UNECE classification ): Waste generation a. Transboundary movements of hazardous wastes b. Waste reuse and recycling c. Final waste disposal d. Waste generation is the amount of waste generated in a country \u2013 in total, per unit of GDP, by sector (industrial and municipal solid waste) and by negative impact (hazardous waste). It is expressed in million metric tonnes per year. Total waste intensity should be presented in kilograms per unit of GDP at constant prices, and municipal waste intensity should be expressed in kg per capita or in m 3 per capita. It can also be presented in terms of waste (kg) generated per unit of production (tonne, kWh, etc.) The waste intensity represents a driving force indicator and shows response to anthropogenic activities. Waste generated per unit of GDP (total waste intensity) shows whether there has been any decoupling of waste generation from economic growth. Municipal waste generation per capita allows comparisons of countries. For each indicator, the ",
        "D 246 Environmental Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 two time series should be shown together (i.e. on total waste generation and on development of GDP, on municipal waste generation and on the number of population) to get the full benefit of the indicator. Box 14.6: Evaluation of composition of waste and routine data collection Pilot Study implemented by the EU CARDS project \u2018Development of a National Environmental Monitoring System for Bosnia and Herzegovina (RANSMO)\u2019 (2005) The amount of waste generated within a municipality in Bosnia and Herzegovina is established by estimation. The best method of establishing waste density is by the use of a weighbridge. However, very few municipalities have a mechanism for bulk weighing, let alone a weighbridge at the dump site. In addition, density does not give you total volume \u2013 which is necessary for evaluation of the long-term capacity of the landfill site. Each municipality has its own methodology for estimating waste volumes. The three most common methods used, which each have significant limitations, are: Number of containers collected x size of container = volume \u2022 Compaction is rarely performed at the container level, so a container could be filled by a very small amount of waste (i.e. empty boxes). This would give an inaccurate result of total volume of waste produced. Number of truck collections performed x size of collection vehicles = volume \u2022 Compaction is rarely performed at the truck level, so a truck could be filled by a very small amount of waste (i.e. empty boxes). This would give an inaccurate result of total volume of waste produced. Estimated volume x estimated density for generic (household or industrial) waste = tonnes \u2022 The density of waste varies greatly dependent on what it is (e.g. plastic is lighter (less dense) than sawdust). Using a single figure to calculate waste density without knowing the type of waste present would give an inaccurate total density of waste produced. A pilot study was undertaken to evaluate different methods of assessing household waste generation by Communal Enterprises as well as looking at the different types of waste arising from different generators (households, schools and institutions). The approach was based on the need to provide better information on the composition of waste, to allow a more accurate calculation of volume and density, and to establish better mechanisms for treatment, recycling and compliance to legislative requirements. Three methods for the evaluation of composition were therefore used: Simple questionnaires completed by the driver/ collectors of waste \u2022 Separation of waste at source in a \u201ccontrolled\u201d (i.e. school or hospital) environment \u2022 Physical sorting exercises performed on collected wastes at the landfill. \u2022 The pilot study was implemented in 14 municipalities. They were chosen to be representative of the overall socio-cultural context. This ensures that the results can be interpolated to the whole country. Each study was performed twice, to cover the winter and summer periods, as seasonal influences are perceived by municipality staff to be very pronounced. The specific methodologies implemented for assessment of wastes from each of the different producers (households, schools and medical facilities) were designed to gather data on: Composition of wastes \u2022 from a given source Volume \u2022 of each waste type Weight \u2022 of each waste type Density conversion factor \u2022 of volume to weight for a given waste type. This is particularly useful for estimation of Municipal Solid Wastes (domestic type wastes) as the lack of compaction vehicles yields a MSW density different to those in countries that have many compaction vehicles. Data collected: N\u00b0 of population / households, volumes of waste (kg and m\u00b3/capita/day) Transboundary movements of hazardous wastes relates to the total amount of hazardous waste, expressed in metric tonnes per year, exported and imported by a country. Trends in a country\u2019s export of hazardous waste show its response to the need to minimize the generation of hazardous waste and to reuse or recycle it domestically. Toxic, explosive, oxidizing, corrosive, flammable, irritant, teratogenic, mutagenic, carcinogenic, ecotoxic and infectious waste are recognized as hazardous waste. ",
        "D 247 Environmental Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Waste reused or recycled as a share of the total waste in a country \u2013 in total, by sector (industrial and municipal solid waste) and by negative impact (hazardous waste) is another indicator. Waste reuse and recycling is an important component of sustainable use of resources in general and sustainable solid waste management in particular. Final waste disposal is the share of the total amount of waste generated \u2013 in total, broken down by sector and broken down by negative impact \u2013 that is finally disposed of by incineration (without energy recovery or use as a fuel) or land filling on a controlled site. The indicator provides a measure of the pressure on the environment and the response to the efficiency of the waste management system. In the EU, the waste framework directive provides for increased efforts to prevent and reduce waste generation, recover wastes and develop new techniques for final disposal of waste. The European Union\u2019s approach to waste management is based on three principles: waste prevention; recycling and reuse; improving final disposal and monitoring. D.14.6.2. Source of data The precise definition of what constitutes waste varies. According to the Basel Convention , whose framework agreements were also signed by several developing countries (e.g. Senegal, Nigeria, Indonesia, Trinidad and Tobago), wastes are substances or objects which are disposed of or are intended to be disposed of or are required to be disposed of by the provisions of national law. Principally, waste is materials that are not primary products (i.e. produced for the market), for which the generator has no further use, and discards, or intends to or is required to discard. Waste statistics should group waste according to main economic activities (ISIC). Industrial waste covers waste generated by mining and quarrying, manufacturing industries, energy production and construction. Waste from industrial activities that is removed by municipal waste collection should be reported under the respective sector of generation. Municipal solid waste includes all municipal waste collected plus the estimated amount of municipal waste from areas not served by a municipal waste collection service. The amount reported under \u201ctotal waste generation\u201d should be equal to the sum of the waste amounts reported as industrial waste, waste generated by other economic activities (e.g. agriculture and forestry) and municipal solid waste. Hazardous waste includes those of the above-mentioned categories which should be controlled according to the Basel Convention. Data on the generation of industrial waste are usually collected by authorities responsible for the environment or by NSIs, while data on municipal waste generation are collected by NSIs. Countries report data on internationally agreed types of hazardous waste to the Secretariat of the Basel Convention and waste generation data to UNSD in their response to the UNSD/UNEP Questionnaire on Environment Statistics . Data on municipal waste collected are usually gathered through surveys of municipalities or from transport companies that collect waste and transport it to a disposal site. Such surveys deliver fairly reliable data. However, amounts of waste will vary, depending on the extent that municipal waste collection covers small industries and the services sector. Waste collected by the informal sector, waste generated in areas not covered by the municipal waste collection system or illegally dumped waste, are not included. Caution is therefore advised when comparing countries. Data on transboundary movement of hazardous wastes are collected by customs offices and by environmental protection authorities in frontier areas. The most reliable and complete information can be obtained from Basel Convention focal points or competent authorities, which are responsible for reporting to the Convention secretariat. Some horizontal information, also for a number of developing countries, is available on the Internet site of the United Nations Statistics Division . Reuse and recycling is defined as any reprocessing of waste material in a production process that diverts it from the waste stream, except reuse as fuel (energy recovery). Assessment of reused and recycled waste requires precise assessment of total waste and the specific category of waste (industrial, municipal or hazardous). The indicator of waste reuse and recycling is derived by dividing the quantity of waste reused and recycled by the total quantity of waste and specific-category waste generated. For municipal waste, the proportion of reused and recycled waste may be presented as a percentage of reused and recycled components, such as metals, plastic, paper, glass, textiles or organic materials. Data on reuse and recycling of waste are usually collected by ministries responsible for urban affairs and the environment and by NSIs. To measure the proportion of waste disposed of by different methods, a combination of several methods can be used. Data on final disposal of waste are collected by ministries responsible for urban affairs and environment and by NSIs. Data on generation and disposal of industrial waste are usually collected by the authorities responsible for the environment, while data on municipal waste generation and disposal are collected by NSIs. The UNSD/UNEP Questionnaire on Environment Statistics provides a methodology for calculating waste generation by sector, for calculating waste reuse and recycling as well as for calculating final disposal. The Basel Convention has established an internationally agreed methodology for calculating the amount of hazardous waste generated. ",

Concepts and definitions Indicators on biodiversity and protected areas are a vital part of environmental statistics. The protected areas indicator shows the areas of land, water surfaces and adjacent air layer protected in compliance with national legislation. It includes the area of highly protected territories and their share in the total area of the country. Additional indicators can be developed for the categories of natural territories which have a special World Conservation Union (IUCN) status and for the national categories of protected areas to demonstrate their respective extent and share in the total area of the country. The indicator is expressed as total area in km 2 and as a percentage of the total country territory as well as by IUCN category. The indicator provides a measure of the response to the degradation of ecosystems and the loss of biodiversity in a country. It demonstrates the extent to which areas important for conserving biodiversity, cultural heritage, scientific research (including baseline monitoring of processes in the ecosystems), recreation, natural resource maintenance and other environmental values are protected from incompatible uses. Sustainable development depends on a sound environment, which in turn depends on ecosystem diversity. Protected areas, especially the full range of IUCN Protected Area Categories, are essential for conserving biodiversity and contributing to sustainable development. Measures to conserve or restore biodiversity are taken at different geographical and policy levels (international, European and national). These measures may have different criteria and objectives but can be complementary. Thus the indicator concentrates on the trends of designated areas according to these different policy instruments and how effective they are in reaching objectives (sufficiency index). At the international level, the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) aims at the establishment and maintenance of comprehensive, effectively managed and ecologically representative national and regional systems of protected areas. Recommendation 16 of the Fourth World Congress on National Parks and Protected Areas establishes a target of 10% protected areas for each biome (major ecosystem type). The Streamlining European 2010 Biodiversity Indicators (SEBI 2010) and its 26 indicators is a pan-European initiative, launched in January 2005 to develop appropriate indicators to assess achievement of the 2010 target at European level. Data are currently available for 22 of the 26 indicators. Over the last 25 years, a vast network of has been built up, covering nearly 26.000 protected areas in the EU Member States and a total area of more than 850.000 km 2 , representing approximately 18% of total EU terrestrial area. This vast array of sites is known as the Natura 2000 network - the largest coherent network of protected areas in the world. The legal basis for the Natura 2000 network comes from the Birds Directive , which dates back to 1979, and the Habitats Directive from 1992. Together with the Communication from the Commission Halting the loss of biodiversity by 2010 \u2014 and beyond , these Directives constitute the backbone of the EU\u2019s internal policy on biodiversity protection. D.14.7.2. Source of data It is necessary to have maps of designated areas and inventories of all protected areas of the country showing their location, size, date of establishment and protection regime in accordance with national legislation and relevant international requirements. For inter-country comparisons, protected areas could also be grouped by the IUCN categories. Monitoring is done on an annual basis. The size of the protected area (its \u201cextent\u201d) is the officially documented total area provided by the national authority or as listed by the World Database on Protected Areas and may be generated from spatial (GIS) boundary data. In the EU, the Natura 2000 network contains an overview over special protected areas (birds sites, habitat sites and marine environment) according to biogeographical regions (Atlantic, Alpine, Boreal, Continental, Mediterranean and Macaronesian). IUCN defines six management categories of protected area falling into two groups. Totally protected areas are maintained in a natural state and are closed to extractive uses. Partially protected areas are managed for specific uses (e.g. recreation) or to provide optimal conditions for certain species or communities. This methodology is increasingly used for land ecosystems, less so for marine ecosystems, and least for inland water ecosystems. Inland water ecosystems are usually lumped with land in a terrestrial classification. The methodology for this indicator has not been standardized. ",
        "D 249 Environmental Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 In cooperation with the UNEP World Conservation Monitoring Centre , IUCN\u2019s World Commission on Protected Areas compiles the UN List of Protected Areas, which provides the name, IUCN category, location, size and year of establishment of all protected areas meeting the IUCN definition, regardless of size and whether or not they have been assigned an IUCN category for all countries. This information is also included in the World Database on Protected Areas . The World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) is compiled from multiple sources and is the most comprehensive global dataset on marine and terrestrial protected areas available.

Land cover and land use statistics D.14.8.1. Concepts and definitions Land Cover/Land Use (LC/LU) information is basic information needed in many statistical fields: in agriculture statistics (covering Utilised Agricultural Area) to provide information on production areas and to estimate agricultural production, in forestry statistics (covering wood production areas) to estimate timber production (with forest inventory data) (see chapter D.17. on agricultural, forestry and fishing statistics), in urban statistics to calculate population density (see chapter D.18. on regional and small areas statistics), in environment statistics to inform agri-environmental indicators, biodiversity, landscape diversity, water quality, soil quality and soil erosion, etc. Further fields of application are spatial planning, urban and rural development, climate change, damage assessment in case of natural or man-made hazards, etc. (see chapter D.26. on sustainable development indicators). LC/LU data is required at various spatial and administrative levels, i.e. local, regional, national and global. Depending on the application, the level of detail of the LC/LU classification varies from rough classifications (e.g. about 10 classes for Kyoto Protocol reporting on Land use and Land Use Change and Forestry ) down to more than 80 LC/LU types for biotope/habitat mapping (e.g. EUNIS European Nature Information System Habitats for European countries). Land For land cover, the reference area is above the surface. This is not so obvious for land use, e.g. in view of complex multi- purpose use of buildings (parking areas, shops, offices and apartments on different floors of the same building) or of mine deposits (is the complete underground oil field the reference area or only the dwell?). Another important aspect is the consideration of inland waters within the \u201cland\u201d definition. Eurostat excluded the inland water from the statistical definition of the \u201cland area\u201d within the Demographic Statistic domain due to the impact of inland water areas on indicators such as population density (e.g. 17% of the territory of the Netherlands is inland water). Eurostat recommends including inland waters and tidal flats in Land Cover/Land Use information . In general, the definition of the reference area (\u201cland\u201d) needs to be taken into account when using LC/LU data from multiple different sources. Although the LU/LC methodology has been developed in a European context, it builds on general concepts and approaches. Thus, this methodology and its basic principles may be applied in any developing country. In particular, the issue of inland waters and tidal flats is relevant in many developing countries. Land cover and land use Most of the existing information on LC/LU is mixing land cover and land use . Natural and semi-natural vegetation are described in terms of land cover, while agricultural and urban areas are described in terms of land use (see the CORINE Land Cover classification ). However, these are two different issues: distinction between land cover and land use is fundamental, though often ignored or forgotten. Confusion and ambiguity between these two terms lead to practical problems, particularly when data from the two different dimensions need to be matched, compared and/or combined. An example of a clear separation in land cover and land use is represented by the LUCAS nomenclature. ",
        "D 250 Environmental Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 The Eurostat \u201c Manual of Concepts on Land Cover and Land Use Information Systems \u201d defines these terms as follows: Land cover \u2022 corresponds to a physical description of space, the observed (bio-) physical cover of the earth\u2019s surface. This description enables various biophysical categories to be distinguished - basically, areas of vegetation (trees, bushes, fields, lawns), bare soil (even if this is a lack of cov- er), hard surfaces (rocks, buildings) and wet areas and bod- ies of water (sheets of water and watercourses, wetlands). Land Cover is \u201cobserved\u201d, meaning that observation can be made from various \u201csources of observation\u201d at different distances between the source and the earth\u2019s surface. Land Use \u2022 corresponds to the description of areas in terms of their socio-economic purpose: areas used for residen- tial, industrial or commercial purposes, for farming or for- estry, for recreational or conservation purposes, etc. Links with land cover are possible; it may be possible to infer land use from land cover and conversely. But situations are often complicated and the link is not so evident. Contrary to land cover, land use is difficult to \u201cobserve\u201d. For example, it is difficult to decide if grasslands are \u201cnatural\u201d (or semi- natural), so not used, or if they are used for agricultural purposes. The information coming from the source of the observation may be sufficient, e.g. indications on the pres- ence or absence of cattle, or may require additional infor- mation, for example from the land owner or the farmer. The LUCAS manual has been designed for the European level, but its overall methodology could be applied in any other region/country of the world. The definitions of \u201cland cover\u201d and \u201cland use\u201d may need to be adapted in response to the particular situation in individual countries. D.14.8.2. Source of data There are two main approaches for collection of land cover / land use data: The mapping approach: land cover/use of the \u2018Area of 1. Interest\u2019 is exhaustively (\u201cwall-to-wall\u201d) mapped on the basis of topographic or cadastral maps or aerial photo- graphs or satellite images such as GLOBCOVER (covers countries worldwide, e.g. China, Mexico, Argentina, Democratic Republic of Congo, Burkina Faso and other African countries) and CORINE Land Cover ; The statistical (sampling) approach: sample of units are 2. observed and the land cover/use estimated. These units can be selected from a list of administrative or socio-eco- nomic entities (list frame surveys) or can be represented by a portion of land \u2013 polygons, lines (transect), points (area frame surveys). An example of a list frame survey on LC/LU in EU is the Farm Structure Survey . AGRIT in Italy, ESYRCE in Spain , Countryside Survey in the UK, TerUti in France, Eurostat\u2019s Land Use / Cover Area frame statistical Survey - LUCAS are examples of area frame surveys in individual countries in Europe. Exhaustive mapping of land cover/use is required when spatially explicit information is needed, for example in regional/physical planning or calculation of indicators on spatial patterns of a landscape (e.g. fragmentation). Land use/ cover mapping can be time and cost intensive, depending on the size of the area to be covered and the level of detail in terms of land use/cover types and geometry, i.e. the scale of the resulting map. A detailed biotope mapping of a small natural conservation area is best carried out by field survey, for example by botanists going on the ground and map the areas occupied by specified plant societies in the dedicated area. Such a field survey is time consuming and cost intensive. If there are a number of similar biotopes within a country, surveying a representative statistical sample of such areas allows estimating the areas covered by the same type of biotope at the level of the country. An additional method to collect spatially explicit LU/LC data is remote sensing. Energy reflected or emitted from the earth\u2019s surface is recorded by cameras or digital sensors (CCDs) mounted on airplanes, helicopters, balloons or satellite platforms, recording the energy in a multitude of bands of the electromagnetic spectrum. Satellite images cover large areas with a stable geometry, yielding easier handling of the data for geo-referencing (projecting the image onto map coordinates). Satellites fly regularly over the same area with the same specifications, making data processing a routine task and monitoring of changes much easier. The dependency of optical sensors of the weather is overcome through RADAR sensors, which can \u201csee\u201d through clouds. The geometric resolution of airborne digital images allows a larger mapping scale than space borne data, but the difference in resolution is decreasing. The remote sensing approach requires ground- truth data for calibration. List and area frame surveys represent a common approach to gather land cover and land use data. In contrast to mapping techniques, they provide quantitative statistical results with precision indicators attached to them. Based on the visual observation of a sample of units, estimates of the extent of land cover/use classes are computed. The list frame surveys are mainly used when the scope of the analysis is a specific domain (i.e. agricultural areas). If the scope is extended to all the dimensions of LC/LU, usually the area frame approach is chosen. The implementation of an area frame survey can go through different steps. For example, in the case of the LUCAS EU survey , first a hypothetical grid is laid over the EU territory. The grid nodes are super-imposed over aerial photos and satellite images, with the land cover on these points photo- interpreted and pre-classified (stratification phase) with a very broad aggregation. For receiving the necessary detailed classification and avoiding errors due to photo- ",
        "D 251 Environmental Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 interpretation, a sample of these points is physically surveyed on the ground. The results, which the surveyors report to the office, are combined with the outcomes of the stratification, for calculating area estimates on the land cover and land use classes all over Europe. The Eurostat \u201c Manual of Concepts on Land Cover and Land Use Information Systems \u201d 51 is a reference for further reading on land information methodologies, data collection approaches and survey methods. Box 14.7: Examples of Land Information Systems GlobCover is an ESA initiative in partnership with JRC, EEA, FAO, UNEP, GOFC-GOLD and IGBP. The GlobCover project has developed a service capable of delivering global composite and land cover maps, using as input observations from the ENVISAT satellite mission. The GlobCover Portal provides access to satellite data and land cover products at global and regional level according to the FAO \u201c Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) \u201d. The US Geological Survey (USGS) , together with the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), provides global coverage of digital satellite images from the US Landsat satellites. Based on this data, historic monitoring of land cover/use can be carried out. The GEO Data Portal is the authoritative source for data used by the UNEP Global Environment Outlook (GEO) and other integrated environment assessments. Its online database holds more than 450 different variables, as national, sub-regional, regional and global statistics or as geospatial data sets (maps), covering themes like Freshwater, Population, Forests, Emissions, Climate, Disasters, Health and GDP. The Africover Project is establishing a digital geo-referenced database on land cover and a geographic referential for the whole of Africa, including geodetical homogeneous referential, toponomy, roads and hydrography, in the Multipurpose Africover Database for the Environmental Resources (MADE) . The core strategy of Africover is to reinforce national and sub-regional capacities for establishing, updating and using geographic referential and land cover maps and spatial data bases. This methodology has been adopted to ensure an operational approach and the sustainability of the initiative. The European Environment Agency coordinates the \u201c CORINE Land Cover \u201d project, covering about 32 European countries. The data is photo-interpreted on the base of satellite imagery. There are currently 3 data sets available (1990, 2000 and 2006). Eurostat collects information via its \u201c Land Use / Cover Area frame statistical Survey - LUCAS \u201d. LUCAS is a field survey, carried out on sample points spread over the entire territory of the Member States. Data on land cover and land use is collected and landscape photographs are taken, enabling detection of changes in LC/LU and in European landscapes. There are currently 2 datasets available (2006, 2009). 51 Currently under revision To find out more\u2026 European Environment Agency: \u2022 CORINE Land Cover and Indicator reporting on the integration of environmental concerns into agricultural policy (IRENA) Eurostat \u2022 52 : Manual of Concepts on Land Cover and Land Use Information Systems and the Land Use / Cover Area frame statistical Survey (LUCAS) FAO: \u2022 Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) The \u2022 Africover Project with the Multipurpose Africover Database for the Environmental Resources (MADE) 52 D.14.9. Analysing data quality and identifying problems Environment problematic is a horizontal issue in the sense that all human activities are concerned to some extent. Developing environmental indicators thus requires information related to a wide range of activity sectors. Like all indicators, the quality of environmental indicators and statistics relies on the quality of data and statistics used as input (see section C.5.3. for a more detailed discussion of statistical quality). Generally, more than one institution or body is involved in gathering data and information necessary to establish environmental indicators; each of them is responsible for compiling information on specific activities, potential emission sources, monitoring environmental parameters etc. All these institutions, at all levels from local to national, have or should follow harmonised procedures to ensure quality and inter-comparability of the data they are collecting as well as of the statistics they are producing. Good quality and reliable indicators should meet some basic and inter-related criteria: Reliability of sampling and measurement: sampling and \u2022 measurement should follow standardised international procedures like ISO/CEN standards. It is an asset to use certified and trained personnel for sampling, especially when samples for laboratory analysis are being obtained. Ideally there should be one reference laboratory at the national level accredited ISO 14025, the main standard used by testing and calibration laboratories. Representativeness and completeness: the indicator \u2022 integrates all input data needed in terms of e.g. spatial and time coverage. (For example, emission inventories will cover all SNAP sectors.) Collecting adequate and precise information on the sampling/monitoring location is therefore of utmost importance in order to evaluate results. 52 A focal point on land cover/use statistics has been created in Eurostat with the mandate to revise and harmonize existing sources in EU. In this framework a dedicated section of the website on LUCAS is going to be set up and an amended version of the manual is foreseen. ",
        "D 252 Environmental Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Consistency and coherence: the environmental indicator \u2022 should be meaningful and should not be in contradiction with other related indicators or statistics. For example, the water losses indicator should be consistent with those on a freshwater abstraction and on water usage, and the ambient air concentration for one pollutant should be consistent with the corresponding emission indicator. Comparability: this is ensured by using similar and \u2022 harmonised definitions and methodologies at the national level but also in line with international standards in order to allow comparison between countries. The use of standardized methods as far as feasible (depending on costs and complexity) ensures not only data quality as explained above, but also comparability of results both within a country and internationally. For example, national definitions of hazardous waste may change over time, as national legislation is revised. Therefore, the definition of hazardous waste varies greatly from one country to another, and sometimes also over time. Traceability: reliable and full documentation is of utmost \u2022 importance when updating or repeating an exercise, e.g. for another year in order to allow trend analysis. Lacking traceability and documentation may limit data quality and comparability. To this end, quality control procedures covering the different aspects related to these different criteria should be developed and implemented at the different levels of the data chain, from sampling and data acquisition to the final compilation. Cross-checking, expert judgment and quantification of uncertainties are important tools in order to evaluate fulfilment of the above criteria but also to identify possible data and knowledge gaps. This is illustrated in Box 14.8 where data quality requirements for the European Air Quality monitoring network (EuroAirnet) are defined. In Box 14.9, uncertainties associated to emission inventories are presented. This example concerns the emissions of green house gases, but this also applies to the emission inventories described in section D.14.2. ",

The closeness of agreement between independent test results obtained under stipulated test conditions. Notes: Precision depends only on the distribution of random errors and does not relate to the true value or the specified value. \u2022 The measure of precision is usually expressed in terms of imprecision and computed as a standard deviation of the test results. Less precision \u2022 is reflected by a large standard deviation. \u201cIndependent test results\u201d means results obtained in a matter not influenced by a previous result on the same or similar test object. Quantitative \u2022 measures of precision depend critically on the stipulated conditions. Repeatability and reproducibility conditions are particular sets of extreme conditions (ISO 5725-1, 1994). \u2022 Repeatability \u2022 : Precision under repeatability conditions (ISO 5725-1, 1994). Repeatability conditions \u2022 : Conditions where independent test results are obtained with the same method on identical test items in the same laboratory, by the same operator, using the same equipment within short intervals of time (ISO 5725-1, 1994). Reproducibility \u2022 : Precision under reproducibility conditions (ISO 5725-1, 1994). Reproducibility conditions \u2022 : Conditions where independent test results are obtained with the same method on identical test items in different laboratories, with different operators, using different equipment (ISO 5725-1, 1994). Accuracy . The closeness of agreement between a (one) test result and an accepted reference value. Note : The term accuracy, when applied to a set of test results, involves a combination of random components and a common systematic error or bias component (ISO 5725-1, 1994). Correctness . The closeness of agreement between the average value obtained from a large series of test results and an accepted reference value. Notes: The measure of correctness is usually expressed in terms of bias. It was referred to as \u201caccuracy of the mean\u201d which is not recommended (ISO 5725-1, 1994). Representativeness . This parameter expresses the degree to which the air pollution measurement data are adequately representative, both of the location in which monitoring is taking place, and of the time period to be covered. The location (spatial) part can be quantified by the area of representativeness: the area in which the concentration does not differ from the concentration measured at the station by more than a specified amount. The temporal part is covered by the data capture and time coverage indicators below. Data capture . The percentage of measurements made which are judged to be valid measurements. Time coverage . The percentage of time covered by the operational time of the measuring device. Comparability . This is a qualitative parameter expressing the confidence with which one set of air pollution measurement data can be compared with another. Data representative of air pollution levels of a location should be possible to compare with measurement data of another similar location. It should be noticed that data of known precision and accuracy and with a high degree of representativeness and completeness can be compared with confidence.

        "D 254 Environmental Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Box 14.9: Identifying uncertainties in emission inventories In inventories of emissions, it is important to consider the estimated uncertainty of emissions from individual sources (e.g. power plants, motor vehicles, dairy cattle). This may depend on the way emission data are measured; how data are fitted with other information and how often measurement is carried out. More often, the uncertainty comes from a combination of the uncertainties in the factors affecting the emissions from a source and the activity of that source (e.g. the production at a power plant, the kilometres driven by motor vehicles). The uncertainties in the emission factors and in the data on activity should be described using so-called \u2018 probability density functions \u2019. A detailed overview of this issue which is also applicable in developing countries is given in \u2018 Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories \u2019 published by the IPCC Task Force on this topic. Uncertainties affecting emission inventories may be associated with: Continuous monitoring of emissions, which is usually consistent \u2022 with good practice for the specific type of emission source. Direct determination of emission factors. In some cases, emission \u2022 measurements may be available at a site. If these measurements can be linked to activity data, it is possible to determine a site- specific emission factor. This can be a complex task, as emissions may be dependent on e.g. start-up and shut\u2013down as well as load. Emission factors from published references. When site-specific \u2022 data are unavailable, good practice will usually be to use emission factors drawn from scientific literature. However, there are uncertainties both associated with the original measurements and whether these fit to the actual site. Activity data, which are closely linked to economic activity and \u2022 are normally well defined, e.g. through tax and accounting rules. Activity data therefore tend to have lower uncertainties. Activity data are usually collected regularly by NSIs. Expert judgement, which should be used when empirical data are \u2022 lacking. D.14.10. Improving sector statistics As mentioned earlier, more than one institution is possibly involved throughout the monitoring and in generating indicators. In many countries, however, there is no or not a fully developed structure to manage environmental information. A first step would then be to set up a structure responsible for collating and compiling environmental information. The structure must comprise for each environmental sector (air, water, waste ...) all institutions or bodies in charge of: generating the necessary information and data (including \u2022 those carrying out monitoring of environmental param- eters); collating and compiling information and data. \u2022 The responsibilities must be clearly identified in terms of area(s) of competence (including international commitments) and duties. These bodies may not have experience in working together and/or authority of sharing information. So coordination and connection channels will be established if necessary in order to ensure effective data and information sharing. This may require the development of memoranda of understanding and even in some cases the amendment of legal instruments ruling the functioning of public services. Box 14.10: DG EuropeAid: Environmental Integration Handbook for European Commission Development Co-operation DG EuropeAid\u2019s \u201c Environmental Integration Handbook for EC Development Co-operation \u201d provides an introduction to the rationale and concepts for environmental integration. It outlines an operational framework covering the three main aid delivery modalities. To enhance the efficiency of development activities, it is crucial to consider environmental issues already in preparation of the Country Strategy Paper (CSP) and National Indicative Programme (NIP) has to address this topic. In order to adequately inform this process, the key tool is the Country Environmental Profile (CEP). The CEP is a report that contains a description and broad assessment of a country\u2019s environmental situation, policy and regulatory framework, institutional capacities and environmental co-operation. The CEP is primarily meant to facilitate the integration of the environmental dimension in the country analysis, response strategies and multi-annual programming. The CEP should also be used to underpin policy dialogue. The Handbook provides an example of Terms of Reference for developing a CEP (Annex 2). However, whereas the Handbook defines the key areas that should be covered by the CEP, it does not define specific indicators. In this process, existing indicators and methodologies should be applied as far as possible. The EEA core set of environmental indicators, presented in Box 14.11 below, could be used as reference and basis. Another critical issue is to identify the indicators which need to be generated. There are hundreds of environmental indicators in use over the world. In practice it is not realistic or even necessary to generate all of them.

Box 14.12: Environmental accounting The environment has an important impact on every economy and has to be considered in the context of globalisation. Environmental accounting is an indispensable tool to measure the role played by the natural environment in the economy. It should highlight both the contribution of natural resources to economic well-being and the costs of pollution and resource degradation. Environmental accounts are designed as \u201csatellite accounts\u201d to accompany the System of National Accounts (SNA). However, they show results in monetary terms only in a few cases. In general, environmental accounts are divided into the following sections: Economic environmental accounts; \u2022 Physical environmental accounts; \u2022 Environmental asset accounts; \u2022 Production and consumption structures. \u2022 At EU level, environmental accounting has been endorsed into the Statistical Programme in 2003 and resulted in a proposal for a Regulation on European environmental economic accounting in spring 2010. An expansion of environmental accounts statistics with high quality, reliability and timeliness is also required in the conclusions on the Europe 2020 strategy by the European Council. Methodologies for all sections mentioned above need to be developed. Eurostat has data on environmental accounts , which are divided into \u201cmonetary flow accounts\u201d and \u201cphysical flow and hybrid accounts\u201d. Both datasets are still being improved and enhanced. Data availability is slowly improving. Although environmental accounts provide a wealth of detailed statistics, data availability is not yet sufficient to deliver headline indicators. Beside the already existing indicators, Eurostat, the European Environment Agency, the OECD, the WWF and the Club of Rome are involved in additional environmental accounting projects on land cover accounts, ecosystem capital accounts, water accounts as well as sustainable consumption and production analysis. Methods on environmental accounting statistics are not yet agreed internationally or are still under development. However, due to the strong links between the environment and the economy in many developing countries, they should keep the data needed for environmental accounts in mind when designing their statistical strategies. A condition for the collection of these statistics is a sound methodology for the collection of national accounts data and the availability of the main datasets for national accounts. Based on these data, developing countries may follow the European Union\u2019s approach and prepare data for the indicators which can be derived from the national accounts system. These are environmental (protection) expenditure and investment by the public and by economic sectors, as well as environmental tax revenues. Some developing countries, for example Chile, Ecuador, India, the Philippines, Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe have already some experience in environmental accounting. Information on the work and results achieved by these and further developing countries is provided by the United Nations Statistics Division . ",

Transport statistics The chapter in brief Transport infrastructure and networks play an important role in economic and social cohesion. Transport networks are important for trade and economic development by bringing goods and services to customers and by bringing passengers to work, schools, etc. Transport is also a key dimension of external trade (see chapter D.10.). This chapter covers a wide area of transport statistics, such as infrastructure, equipment, enterprises, traffic flows, passengers and freight, accidents, etc. It starts by identifying the main policy areas for which these statistics are used (see also section B.1.5.1 on the European Consensus on Development and Box 4.4 (section B.4.3) on the relationship between policy areas and statistics fields). The chapter provides an overview over the different transport statistics collected and information about the most important definitions and methods. The main sources of data are presented, followed by advice on how to analyse the quality of transport statistics. Most importantly, the chapter concludes with advice on how to build or to improve transport statistics in developing countries. D.15.1. Policy applications: what transport data is used for Transport statistics have a wide variety of uses and allow monitoring of a wide range of areas: Transport plays a crucial role in the economy, bringing \u2022 goods and services to customers: mobility of goods is necessary to facilitate trade and economic growth. The ability to move goods safely, quickly and cost-efficiently to markets is important for international trade, national distributive trades, and economic development. Strains on infrastructure, demonstrated by congestion and delays, as well as the constraints of disparate standards, technical barriers, poor interoperability and governance could all impact on economic development. All dimensions of sustainability - environmental, economic and social - are strongly impacted by transport activity. Transport is also necessary to take passengers to work \u2022 or school (but also to shops or leisure activities). Within cities, transport infrastructure, norm setting, congestion and traffic management, public transport services, infrastructure charging, urban planning, safety and security have to be managed and improved. In addition, inter- urban passenger travel by rail, road or airplane, can also be strengthened by improvements to the infrastructure. Transport infrastructure and networks play an important \u2022 role in economic and social cohesion, by linking island, landlocked and peripheral regions with more central regions, through interconnecting and interoperable national networks by land, air, sea and inland waterways. Better integration of national networks fosters regional cooperation and integration between neighbouring countries. From a regional perspective, an extensive network of roads, motorways and railway links is a prerequisite for economic development and interregional competitiveness. Growing mobility has an undesirable impact on safety, \u2022 on congestion and on the environment. Thus transport statistics are also needed to address the underlying issues and make it easier to model them. In particular, the transport sector is the fastest growing consumer of energy and producer of greenhouse gases. Improvements in safety and security in transport is a very \u2022 important question and statistics are needed to monitor it. Intermodal freight transport policy supports the efficient \u2022 \u2019door to door\u2019 movement of goods, using two or more modes of transport, in a highly integrated transport chain. Each mode of transport has its own advantages either in terms of potential capacity, levels of safety, flexibility, energy consumption, or environmental impact. As such, this intermodal transport allows each mode to play its role in building transport chains which overall are more efficient, cost effective and sustainable. Box 15.1: Links between transport and Millennium Development Goals The 2005 African Union Summit recognised the important role of transport infrastructure and services in meeting the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). A number of targets were set for the transport sector, covering each of the eight MDGs. (See section B.1.1. and section B.4.1. for more information on the MDGs.) These targets, to be reached by 2015, include: Have the proportion of rural population living beyond 2 km of an \u2022 all-season mode of transport, in order to improve access to inputs and markets and generation of employment opportunities; Narrow down the difference in average transport cost within \u2022 Africa by 50 percent as compared to Asia; Reduce rate of accident fatalities arising from road and other \u2022 means of transport by half; Have the number of urban and rural residents for whom mobility \u2022 problems severely constrain access to employment and essential services; Promote environmental sustainability in all transport operations \u2022 and development programs; Phase out the production and use of leaded petrol; \u2022 Dismantle all physical and non-physical transport barriers that \u2022 increase journey time, customs clearance and border delays and impede the flow of goods and services; Take into consideration the phenomenon of desertification and \u2022 sand movement in the transport policies and programs.

        "D 260 Transport Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 D.15.2. Concepts and definitions The statistics covered in this section are defined by section 2.4.4 \u2018Transport\u2019 of the new UNECE Classification of International Statistics Activities, which was introduced in section B.4.3. This area covers statistics on all modes of transport \u2013 air, rail, road, inland waterways, sea - and includes topics like transport infrastructure, equipment, traffic flows, personal mobility, safety, energy consumption, transport enterprises, passengers and freight transport, transport sector trends, road traffic accidents. It excludes transport prices. Transport statistics collect information on traffic (in vehicle- kilometres), transport measurement (number of passengers and tonnes) and transport performance (passenger- kilometres or tonne-kilometres) by the individual modes: road, rail, inland waterway, sea and air. Aggregated statistics are also available on enterprises, employment, infrastructure and means of transport. The aim is to measure the transport activity either on the territory of an individual country or across a multi-country region or sub-region. A multilingual glossary of transport statistics is maintained and developed by Eurostat in collaboration with two international partners, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) and the International Transport Forum (ITF) , in order to promote common definitions and concepts for transport statistics. This glossary provides reference definitions for transport statistics for all modes and meets the need to harmonise transport statistics at the international level. Numerous statistical indicators are collected in order to give a complete overview of transport activity in a country. The main ones are: Infrastructure \u2022 : length of railway lines operated, length of motorways and other roads, length of navigable inland waterways, length of pipelines operated; Transport equipment \u2022 : number of road vehicles (motorcycles, passenger cars, motor coaches and buses, lorries and road tractors), number of locomotives and wagons, number of self-propelled vessels, tugs and pushers, and dumb and pushed vessels; new registrations of vehicles during the year; Transport enterprises \u2022 : number of enterprises, number of employees; Traffic \u2022 : vehicle-kilometres; Transport measurement \u2022 : number of passengers and tonnes carried, passenger-kilometres, tonne-kilometres. Several classifications are needed for transport statistics. In particular, it is necessary to know the type of goods carried. The NST 2007 (Nomenclature uniforme des marchandises pour les statistiques des transports) is the commodity classification used for the European Union statistics on transport. NST 2007 takes account of the economic activity from which the goods originate. This means that each of its items is strongly interrelated with an item of the European CPA (Classification of Products by Activity) and NACE (statistical classification of economic activities) , which are themselves consistent with CPC and ISIC , their counterparts at UN level. In addition, specific classifications \u2013 ADN (for inland waterways) and ARN (for road transport) - have been introduced for dangerous goods. In transport statistics, the place of loading/unloading of the goods or the place of embarkation/disembarkation of passengers plays also an important role. This coding should be done according to the lists of administrative regions of each country. Member States of the European Union use the NUTS (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics). It can also be useful to have information on the type of cargo. For this purpose, the classification of cargo types and the \u201c Codes for types of cargo, packages and packing materials, Recommendation 21 \u201d were adopted by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe.

Sources of data Transport statistics are obtained from various sources. Information related to infrastructure and means of transport are available from administrative sources (road administration, vehicle registers, etc.) Data on enterprises are obtained from structural business statistics and data on employment from the labour force survey. Traffic, transport measurement and transport performance are obtained through specific data collections that need to be implemented by the competent national authorities. The following data providers have the source information that allows producing statistics on transport measurement for the different modes of transport: Road freight transport statistics: road transport \u2022 enterprises; Rail transport: railways undertakings; \u2022 Air: airports; \u2022 Sea: maritime ports authorities; \u2022 Inland waterways: inland waterways ports authorities. \u2022 For the collection of road passenger transport, traffic and transport performed are produced using a combination of different sources: household survey, passenger mobility survey, census on road traffic (traffic counts), odometer readings, energy statistics on fuel consumption. Box 15.3: Creation of new statistical data collections Developing countries might need to implement new data collections. The success of a new data collection is linked to a good collaboration with data providers. With this aim, the following actions can be taken: Involve all stakeholders: ministries, transport associations and \u2022 enterprises, port and airport authorities Sign service level agreements for data exchange or memorandum \u2022 of understanding with data providers Obtain access to administrative registers to get administrative \u2022 data needed for transport statistics Organise workshops with all partners to define the statistics to be \u2022 produced and organise the data collection Collaborate with managers of other surveys \u2013 household, LFS \u2013 \u2022 to obtain information to be used to produce transport statistics (possibly new questions needed for transport statistics could be added to these surveys questionnaires) A new data collection can be implemented according to the following steps: Institutional building \u2022 Achieve agreements with data providers \u03bf Implement tools to ensure access to data needed \u03bf Development of methodologies for the production of requested \u2022 statistics Collection of documentation on best practices \u03bf Adaptation to the national specificities \u03bf Regarding the dissemination of transport statistics, various international organisations publish transport statistics for their member countries. The International Transport Forum (ITF) , an inter- governmental organisation within the OECD, publishes annual reports on transport statistics and provides free access to its database on transport statistics. Key indicators are available for 52 countries on: freight transport by rail, road, inland waterways and oil pipelines; passenger transport by rail and road; road accidents; infrastructure investments and maintenance. The International Road Federation (IRF) publishes the annual \u201cWorld Road Statistics\u201d. This publication includes road and transport statistics for more than 185 countries, compiled from a large number of sources (including Eurostat). It comprises statistics on road networks, traffic, multimodal traffic comparisons, vehicles, accidents and road expenditures. In addition, it covers production, imports, first registrations and exports of motor vehicles as well as energy in connection with road traffic. The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) disseminates transport statistics for 57 countries. Several indicators are available for the following domains: road traffic accidents; road traffic; road vehicle fleet; railways traffic; railway vehicles; railway employment; inland waterways traffic; inland waterways vessels; oil pipeline transport; transport infrastructure. Eurostat publishes EU Member States transport statistics for rail, road, inland waterways, oil pipeline, maritime and air in its free dissemination database. For each of these domains, an exhaustive list of indicators is published: infrastructure; equipment; enterprises, economic performances and employment; traffic; transport measurement for goods and passengers; accidents. NSI publish also on their website transport data for their country. For example, the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) provides very complete information on transport in the United States. ",
        "D 262 Transport Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Box 15.4: Sources for African transport data Sub-Saharan Africa Transport Policy Program The Sub-Saharan Africa Transport Policy Program (SSATP) is a partnership of African countries, regional economic communities, African institutions, national and regional organizations as well as international development partners. These partners are all dedicated to ensuring that transport plays its full part in achieving poverty reduction, pro-poor growth, and regional integration in Sub-Saharan Africa. One serious obstacle to the development of effective policy is the lack of reliable and accurate data on the transport sector. SSATP has addressed the lack of reliable transport data in the region and has supported the development of a common set of transport indicators. Since the launch in 2004, SSATP has been involved in 3 cycles of data collection, covering up to 21 countries. This initiative has helped countries build capacity in data collation, analysis and management in order to improve performance monitoring of the sector. Through the exercise, it has been possible to develop and agree on a minimum requirement for indicators for the transport sector. The indicators are accompanied by standard definitions and methodology for collection. Based on these experiences, SSATP develop guidelines for the establishment of efficient and sustainable Transport Sector Data Management Systems (TSDMS). SSATP current work and priorities are described in the SSATP Second Development Plan. Africa Infrastructure Country Diagnostic The Africa Infrastructure Country Diagnostic (AICD) project expands the knowledge of the physical infrastructure in Africa. It provides a baseline against which future improvements in infrastructures can be measured, making it possible to monitor the results achieved from donor support. It also provides a better empirical foundation for prioritizing investments and designing policy reforms in Africa\u2019s infrastructure sectors. AICD collected detailed economic and technical data on infrastructure in 24 African countries. The project has produced a series of reports on public expenditure, spending needs, and sector performance in each of the main infrastructure sectors: energy, information and communication technologies, irrigation, transport, and water and sanitation. These are available through the AICD Document Library . The main findings are summarised in the AICD flagship report Africa\u2019s Infrastructure\u2014A Time for Transformation , published by the World Bank in November 2009; the transport sectors (transport; roads; railways; ports and shipping; airports and air transport) are summarised in chapters 9 to 13. The AICD database can be accessed online. It provides cross-country data on network infrastructure for, amongst others, air transport, ports, railways and roads. The database covers 24 countries (status as of November 2009). Phase 2 of AICD, which is underway, will cover most of the remaining countries; the data collected will be incorporated into the database. The data gathered as part of AICD is being transferred to the African Development Bank (AfDB) for the development of an infrastructure database. This is in line with the efforts to merge all continental initiatives on infrastructure into the Programme for Infrastructure Development in Africa (PIDA ) (2010). D.15.4. Analysing data quality and identifying problems The quality of transport statistics depends on the data coverage, the harmonisation of the definitions and methodologies across the countries of a given region or sub-region, as well as their compliance with international recommendations and classifications. For example, in the EU, the adoption of legal acts for the provision of transport statistics was an important factor for the improvement of data quality in terms of data availability and comparability across Europe. One way to identify problems is to look at asymmetries in transport reported by two reporting units (e.g. multi-country regions or sub-regions, individual countries, ports, airports, sub-national territorial units, etc.), one being the place of loading of the goods or embarkation of passengers and the other one the place of unloading of goods or disembarkation of passengers. This is in particular the case for maritime and air transport statistics where data for incoming and outgoing transport are available for each port / airport with the information of the origin and destination port / airport. Thus a country\u2019s transport can be examined through \u2018mirror\u2019 checking, which aims to identify the main discrepancies between the two sets of data, the reasons for their existence and to propose measures to reduce or eliminate these problems. The short-term objective of mirror checks is to explain and assess the causes of discrepancies in transport statistics and hence to obtain datasets of better quality. Longer- term objectives may include harmonising the conceptual framework of two sets of statistics, which could lead to the use of new procedures in data compilation. ",
        "D 263 Transport Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Box 15.5: Example: Mirror checks for air passenger transport statistics In theory, the number of passengers arriving in a country\u2019s airports is the mirror image of the number of passengers leaving the airports of the countries of origin \u2013 the airport of origin can also be located in the same country as the airport of destination, it is then referred to as national transport. The same theory applies for the number of passengers leaving a country. In practice, there are often discrepancies between the two. Thus mirror checks are a systematic method of identifying problems in air transport data reported by a country. This can be applied to check the statistics produced by any country or multi-national region/sub-region. The check is run both for national and international transport at airport level. The following formula is used for the calculation of the deviation for a given airport-to-airport route (for example transport between airport A located in country A and airport B located in country B): Pax country A = number of passengers arriving and leaving airport A to/from airport B, as reported by country A Pax country B = number of passengers arriving and leaving airport A to/from airport B, as reported by country B Studies have allowed defining thresholds for the detection of the abnormal deviation according to the size of the flow. National transport of passengers Data range Thresholds over which data are suspicious >= 2000 passengers < 5000 passengers 100% >= 5000 passengers < 35000 passengers 10% >= 35000 passengers < 160000 passengers 2.5% >= 160000 passengers 1.5% International transport of passengers Data range Thresholds over which data are suspicious >= 2000 passengers < 5000 passengers 100% >= 5000 passengers < 15000 passengers 40% >= 15000 passengers < 65000 passengers 15% >= 65000 passengers 5% Pax country A - Pax Country B Pax country A + Pax Country B 2 Deviation Mirror = X 100 Time series analysis consists in the comparison of data collected over different time periods. If the comparison leads to significant variations between the time periods considered, the data under consideration could be considered as suspicious. Usually, the analysis of variation of yearly or quarterly data for consecutive years allows detecting the main problems in the transport data studied. In the case of quarterly data, different types of analysis can be envisaged, for example checking the growth rate of road data between the following time periods: Variation of yearly data for two consecutive years; \u2022 Variation of quarterly data (same quarter) for two \u2022 consecutive years, for example Q1 2009 with Q1 2008; Variation of quarterly data between the four quarters of a \u2022 year: In order to implement a time series analysis, it is necessary to determine the threshold above which the variation in the compared data should be considered suspicious. Usual statistical methods can be used for the calculation of thresholds to be applied. The absolute variation between two time periods (|(V2-V1)| / V1) is then calculated for and the variations above the threshold are then considered as suspicious. ",
        "D 264 Transport Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 D.15.5. Improving sector statistics NSIs collect transport statistics from various sources. Thus it is very important to establish a good collaboration with data providers in order to obtain source data with good quality. This is typically the case for sea and air transport, where a good cooperation with airports and port authorities is necessary to get data for the transport occurring in airports and ports. A formal service-level agreement or memorandum of understanding between the organisations involved is often necessary to align the interests of the two services. It could also be useful to organise workshops with the data providers in order to explain the statistical needs and the data to be provided. These meetings can be used to define an action plan, set up timetables and prepare recommendations on methodologies to be implemented. Some of the transport data are obtained from administrative sources; in these cases it is also very important for the NSI to have a good cooperation or agreement with these institutions. Employment data are obtained from labour force surveys; in this case it is necessary to have contacts with the persons responsible for the questionnaire in order to ensure that the questions will allow derivation of the data needed for transport statistics. This is also the case for the collection of road traffic data that might require adding specific question to the labour force surveys questionnaire. For the creation of a new data collection, the following actions might be necessary: identification of sources; institutional building and development of methodology to compile the statistics to be produced. It is also very important that the NSI implements basic credibility and consistency checks during the collection and preparation of transport statistics. This is a vital factor in the improvement of quality of transport statistics. First, basic validation checks need to be implemented. They are used to check the format of a dataset, as well as codes of indicators, to ensure that values are positive, etc. Such tools are very useful to detect basic errors in the data, in particular coding mistakes and can be integrated in countries\u2019 IT systems used for data production. For example, Eurostat has developed such a tool, GENEDI, for the data validation. Then consistency checks have to be implemented in countries\u2019 IT systems in order to check: Totals for breakdowns in each table (validation of data \u2022 within a dataset); Coherence between different datasets: for example, \u2022 variables appearing in different tables should have the same value; Plausibility of values: for example, distances need to be \u2022 positive; weight of goods is linked to the load capacity of a lorry, etc. Credibility and consistency checks allow detecting errors in the calculation procedures and help in assessing the coherence of data.

As the total number of units in most countries is very large, sample surveys are carried out to collect information from a representative selection (sample) of this population. In this way, the desired attributes of a population can be estimated to a known precision according to standard statistical theory. EU Member States carry out quarterly sample surveys and record the road goods transport undertaken by vehicles registered in their country. Thus each reporting country reports all activities of a road motor vehicle inside and outside its national territory. Micro-data are obtained through questionnaires sent out by each reporting country to a sample of hauliers for vehicles registered in their country. These micro-data concern the vehicles themselves, their journeys and the goods that were transported. This section presents guidelines for the implementation of such surveys. Sampling register used for the survey Register: Register of road vehicles if available, else such a register needs to be created. Organisation maintaining the register: Ministry of Transport, Ministry of Interior, Road administration, etc. Frequency of access to draw the samples: The NSI needs to have an agreement with the organisation maintaining the register for its access. Access is needed at least once a quarter. Arrangements for accessing the register: A replication of the statistical version of the register of road vehicles can be made for the NSI at least each quarter, in compliance with the agreement between the NSI and the organisation maintaining the register. Before each quarterly sampling, the register of motor vehicles can be matched with the Business Register to obtain information on activity and address for owners and users of vehicles \u2013 if this information is not available in the road vehicles register. Information obtained from registers: Register of Motor Vehicles: identifier of the owner/user, type of ownership, registration number, type of vehicle, body type, load capacity, maximum permissible laden weight, number of axles, date of first registration, date of first registration in the country, type of fuel used, etc. Business Register: Main activity of the operator, name of the owner/user, address of the owner/user. Example of procedure for reminders: First reminder \u2013 4 weeks after the surveyed week Second reminder \u2013 7 weeks after the surveyed week, with a new copy of the questionnaire sent out Third reminder - telephone call to key respondents 1 week after the second reminder. Penalties procedures might be launched. Sampling methodology Statistical unit: Goods road transport vehicle or the transport enterprise. Special types of units can be excluded: Agricultural, military and public service vehicles and special purposes vehicles. Vehicles with load capacity below 3.5 tonnes or maximum permissible laden weight below 6 tonnes might be excluded from the survey: light vehicles represent a high proportion of vehicles, but represent a very small share of tonnes carried. Therefore, excluding them from the survey reduces the costs of the survey without losing much information. Time unit: at least half a week; 1 week is recommended Stratification: Many variables can be used to stratify the survey. The most efficient ones are: Load capacity; country\u2019s regions; type of transport (own account or hire or reward); type of body; year of first registration or age of vehicle; type of ownership; type of licence; etc. Calculation of weighting factors: In the cases of a survey carried out over 1 week and for all 13 weeks of a quarter, : N Weighting factor = 13 * _ S N = Number of vehicles in the register (in a stratum) S = Number of questionnaires used in analysis Quality aspects Several indicators are used to measure the quality of road freight surveys: register quality; non-response rate, standard error. These indicators allow to identify the weaknesses of the survey and thus to take actions for the improvement of their quality. ",

Human settlements and housing statistics The chapter in brief Human settlements and housing statistics measure the improvement of the quality of the social, economic, environmental and living conditions for all the population. This chapter covers these statistics as defined by section 1.7 of the UNECE Databases for International Statistical Activities (DISA 2010) and section B.4.3 of this Guide . It covers a wide area of Human settlements and housing statistics, such as living quarters, conventional dwelling, Housing units with piped water, etc. The main issues on the statistics on human settlements and housing are the large spectrum of sources from which the data is obtained; this can influence the quality of the data, in particular for international comparisons. This chapter begins by identifying the main policy areas for which these statistics are used. It then provides an overview of the different statistics available on human settlements and housing as well as information on the key definitions. The main sources of data are presented, followed by guidance on how to assess the quality of these statistics. Most importantly, the chapter concludes with suggestions on how to build or to improve human settlements and housing statistics in developing countries. D.16.1. Policy applications: what housing data is used for The objective of human settlement is to improve the quality of the social, economic, environmental and living conditions (in particular housing and basic amenities) for all the population. In order to achieve this objective, a technical collaboration should be established between the public and private sectors and the civil society; this will help in designing coordinated and sustainable actions. In addition, as human settlement development implies a move from a natural environment to a man-made environment, there are environmental implications and these have been discussed principally in the international review \u201cEnvironmental Perspective to the Year 2000 and Beyond\u201d . Statistics on human settlement and housing are collected mainly at the national and/or sub-national levels. Thereafter the aggregation of the data is generally done by international institutions. These statistics are critical in helping to: (a) design, implement, monitor and evaluate housing settlement policies; and (b) assess the improvement in living conditions as well as the environmental impact of human settlement policies. Specifically, human settlement and housing statistics enable decision makers to design urban planning policies and assess the impact of population growth on the natural environment. These statistics can also assist in addressing several challenges that arise from a country\u2019s socio-economic development. Such challenges include: Migration and urbanization Inadequate shelter (squatting and housing shortages) and \u2022 basic amenities; Urban decay following over-urbanization; \u2022 Environmental degradation through pollution (notably \u2022 water pollution) Lack of services and related infrastructure in rural and \u2022 urban settlements, especially water and sanitation. Box 16.1: Links between Human Settlements and Mil- lennium Development Goals, Target 11 The United Nations System assigned the UN-HABITAT the responsibil- ity to assist Members States monitor and gradually attain the \u201cCities without Slums\u201d Target, also known as \u201c Target 11 \u201d. Target 11 is among one of the three targets of Goal 7 (\u201cEnsure Environmental Sustainabil- ity)\u201d of the Millennium Development Goals. The objective of \u2018Target 11\u2019 is: to have achieved a significant improvement in the lives of at least 100 million slum dwellers, by 2020. Goal 7 Target 11 comes in response to one of the most pressing chal- lenges of the millennium. By dealing with the people living in the most depressed physical conditions in the world\u2019s cities, Target 11 is a direct recognition that slums are a development issue, which needs to be addressed.

Concepts and definitions There is no internationally agreed classification on human settlement statistics and therefore this chapter is based on the global consensus. Human settlement can be defined as a combination of two factors: physical construction and access to basic services. The physical element is mainly shelter that is constructed by humans for security, privacy and protection. Access to basic services includes education, health, culture, welfare, recreation and nutrition. Development of human settlements and shelter delivery are intrinsically linked and thus require a coherent and comprehensive policy within a common framework. Numerous statistical indicators are collected in order to give a complete overview of human settlement systems. The main indicators, as defined by the Conference of European Statisticians and the Committee on Housing, Building and Planning, UNECE and UN Habitat, are: Total number of living quarters: \u2022 Commonly, a living quarter is a separate and independent place of dwelling intended for habitation by one household. However, a living quarter can also not be intended for habitation, but can be occupied as living quarters (e.g. by squatters) at the time of the census. ",
        "D 272 Human settlements and housing statisticss Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Number of conventional dwellings: \u2022 A conventional dwelling is a room or a suite of rooms in a permanent building, which is intended for habitation by one household and is not, at the time of the census used for other purposes besides habitation. A conventional dwelling may be either occupied or vacant. Dwelling stock: \u2022 The dwelling stock includes only conventional (permanent) dwellings, whether occupied or not. The simple term \u201cdwelling\u201d is generally used instead of \u201cconventional dwelling\u201d. A rise in the dwelling stock implies an increase in the number of dwellings due to new construction and increases due to other types of building activity (restoration, extension, conversion). Decreases in the dwelling stock could result from several factors, including: dwellings becoming definitely empty (due for instance i. from migration); dwellings fit for habitation are demolished; ii. dwellings destroyed by fire, floods, land erosion or iii. other natural catastrophes; reduction in the number of dwellings resulting in the iv. conversion of two or more dwellings into one dwelling or of one or more dwellings into non-residential accommodation. Housing units with piped water: \u2022 Percentage of occupied housing units with piped water. Piped water refers to water provided within a housing unit by pipes from community- wide systems or from individual installations such as pressure tanks and pumps. \u201cWith piped water\u201d means water supply inside a housing unit or outside the unit, but within 100 meters from the door. Housing \u2022 units with toilet: Percentage of occupied housing units with toilet facilities of any type. \u201cToilet of any type\u201d refers to an installation arranged for humans to discharge their excreta. Owner occupant households: \u2022 Percentage of households occupying the housing unit as owner. An owner occupant is one who owns the housing unit he/she occupies, including those who pay a loan for a housing unit, or whose house is under mortgage. Household \u2022 renter : Percentage of households that rent either government or private owned housing units, to the total number of households in housing units (rented and owned). Population with access to safe water: \u2022 Percentage of the total population with access to an adequate amount of safe drinking water located within a convenient distance from the user\u2019s dwelling. It is important to note that the definitions of \u201caccess, adequate amount, safe, convenient distance\u201d vary from country to country. Population with access to sanitation: \u2022 Percentage of the total population with access to a sanitary facility for human excreta disposal in the dwelling or located within a convenient distance from the user\u2019s dwelling. It is important to note that the definitions of \u201caccess, sanitary facility, convenient distance\u201d vary from country to country. Marginal Housing Units: \u2022 The identification of marginal housing unit slums and squatter settlements is an issue that is not adequately covered by the statistics and indicators discussed in the chapter. Slums \u03bf generally refer to older housing, which is underserviced, overcrowded, and dilapidated. Squatter \u03bf settlements are areas where housing units have been constructed on land to which the occupants have no legal claim. These types of settlements are usually located in suburban areas, particularly at the peripheries of principal cities. ",
        "D 273 Human settlements and housing statisticss Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Box 16.2: The City Development Index (CDI) Definition: The CDI is a measure of average well-being and access to urban facilities by individuals. The high statistical significance and usefulness of the index indicates that it is actually measuring something real. It appears that the CDI is actually a measure of depreciated total expenditure over time on human and physical urban services and infrastructure, and it is a proxy for the human and physical capital assets of the city. It is used in this report as a benchmark for comparative display of several of the key indicators from the UNCHS (Habitat) Global Urban Indicators Database. The CDI is, to date, the best single measure of the level of development in cities. Construction : The technique used to construct the City Development Index (CDI) is similar to that used by UNDP for their Human Development Index (HDI). Separate sub-indices are constructed and combined to create a composite index. Thus, the CDI is in effect the reflection of five sub-indices \u2013 City Product, Infrastructure, Waste, Health and Education - the base values range from 0 to 100. Calculating the CDI: The CDI is calculated according to the formulae in the table below. It has separate sub-indices for Infrastructure, Waste Management, Health, Education, and City Product, which are averaged to form the CDI. Each sub-index is a combination of several indicators that have been normalized to give a value between 0 and 1. For meaningful ranking of cities, the index requires data that are essentially complete, robust and precise \u2013 so, not many variables are suitable. All the underlying data thus has to be checked for accuracy and completeness. Where there is missing data (or data is obtained on inaccurate estimates), these can be replaced by using data from another national city of similar geographical size or development level. If the latter is not available, country-wide figures (or national urban data if available) can be used. Index Formula Infrastructure 25 x Water connections + 25 x Sewerage + 25 x Electricity + 25 x Telephone Waste Wastewater treated x 50 + Formal solid waste disposal x 50 Health (Life expectancy - 25) x 50/60 + (32 - Child mortality) x 50/31.92 Education Literacy x 25 + Combined enrolment x 25 Product (log City Product - 4.61) x 100/5.99 City Development (Infrastructure index + Waste index + Education index + Health index + City Product index)/5 CDI Vs HDI: The CDI is positively linked with the national Human Development Index (HDI), but because there is considerable variation between cities in any particular country, it provides a better measure of real city conditions than the national-level HDI. The CDI has been cited as a good index of urban poverty and urban governance . Health, education and infrastructure components are particularly good variables for measuring poverty outcomes in cities. Similarly, infrastructure, waste and city product components are key variables for measuring the effectiveness of governance in cities. The CDI correlates strongly with the city product; other things being similar, a high-income city will have a higher CDI. Source: Adapted from UN Habitat D.16.3. Sources of data Data on human settlements originate from a wide variety of national and international sources. At national level, the sources of statistics include periodic censuses, surveys (population and housing), administrative records of municipalities, land registries, construction permits and licences, and consumer prices\u2019 lists. However, it should be noted that the most important source of human settlement statistics comes from the baseline data collected at the national level for population and housing surveys. Ad hoc surveys, such as the quality of life, Demographic and Health surveys (DHS) may also provide baseline data but are done less frequently. Human settlement statistics are collected mainly by National Statistical Institutes, housing and urban development ministries or institutes, planning ministries or institutes, construction industry chambers, trade associations (colleges, associations or federations of engineers and architects), banks or agencies that help finance social housing and academic or research institutions related to the sector. One can also consult related companies such as construction firms and the producers and sellers of building materials, Trade and industry associations, classified advertisements in local newspapers, Property and real estate brokers, and insurance companies. At international level, human settlement statistics can be obtained from: (i) United Nations statistical yearbooks or compendiums, such as the Statistical Yearbook for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), the Compendium of Human Settlements Statistics (New York), the Construction Statistics Yearbook (New York) and the United Nations Development Programme\u2019s Human Development Report (UNDP); (ii) International institutions and organisations such as the African Development Bank (AfDB) , the Asian Development bank (ADB) , the Latin American and Caribbean Demographic Center (CELADE) , the headquarters and sub-regional headquarters of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), the Women in Development Unit of ECLAC, the United Nations Programme for Human Settlements (Habitat/Kenya), the United Nations Statistics Division (New York) and the Organization of American States (OAS/ Washington). In an effort to harmonise human settlement data, UN- HABITAT has been assigned the responsibility to assist United Nations Members States in monitoring and eventually attaining the global \u201cCities without Slums\u201d target of improving the lives of at least 100 million slum dwellers by the year 2020. 53 To proceed with this task, UN-HABITAT 53 The main documents outlining the mandate of the organization are the Vancouver Declaration on Human Settlements, Habitat Agenda, Istanbul Declaration on Human Settlements, the Declaration on Cities and Other Human Settlements in the New Millennium and Resolution 56/206 .

        "D 274 Human settlements and housing statisticss Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 has consulted a number of experts to develop generic and operational definitions of terms and concepts related to urban poverty and slums for use by National Governments, policy makers and their advisors, planners, local authorities, statisticians, survey specialists and the academics. The Agency is also keen to collect data globally in order to generate statistically-valid figures and estimates that quantify the magnitude and characteristics of slums as a necessary first step for formulating policy recommendations and actions at the global level. 54 Other sources of housing and settlement data include: World Bank: \u2022 World Bank Data & Statistics . Urban Development data with link to World Bank online databases. UNECE Environment and Human Settlements Divisio \u2022 n . This database is maintained by the Environment and Human Settlements Division, with specific reference to data on housing and building. Data are collected for the ECE Bulletin of Housing and Building Statistics and through the Country Profiles on the Housing Sector from a number of both national and international sources. Global Urban Observator \u2022 y , UN-HABITAT. Includes Urban Indicators, Statistics and City Profiles. Eurostat: the main source of housing data is provided by the \u2022 Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) instrument (see also chapter D.21. Living conditions and poverty statistics).

Current population figures for cities, towns, and administrative divisions of all countries. European Mortgage Federatio \u2022 n . 54 For instance, for European countries, most of the housing and building data come from replies to the ECE housing questionnaire supplied by national statistical offices. In addition to being used for the Bulletin , the collected data are also used for other ECE publications. Box 16.3: Agenda 21 Agenda 21 is a comprehensive plan of action to be taken globally, nationally and locally by organizations of the United Nations System, Governments, and major groups in every area in which human impacts on the environment. Agenda 21, the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development , and the Statement of principles for the Sustainable Management of Forests were adopted by more than 178 Governments at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 3 to 14 June 1992 (see chapter D.26. Sustainable Development Indicators). The Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) was created in December 1992 to ensure effective follow-up of UNCED, to monitor and report on implementation of the agreements at the local, national, regional and international levels. It was agreed that a five year review of Earth Summit progress would be made in 1997 by the United Nations General Assembly meeting in special session . The full implementation of Agenda 21 , the Programme for Further Implementation of Agenda 21 and the Commitments to the Rio principles were strongly reaffirmed at the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) held in Johannesburg, South Africa from 26 August to 4 September 2002. Source: Adapted from United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA) D.16.4. Analysing data quality and identifying problems Data on human settlements and housing are collected from a wide range of sources. Several issues may impact the quality of these data for international comparison, mainly at the methodological and collection levels (for general aspects of statistical quality, see section C.5.3.). The methodological issues of human settlements data quality include: the distinction between rural and urban settlements i. that has not yet been resolved satisfactorily. There is no internationally agreed upon classification that can be used to define a settlement as \u201crural\u201d or \u201curban\u201d, because characteristics that set apart these areas vary widely from country to country. low-income settlements defy generic definition and ii. classification because of the widely differing characteristics of \u201cslums\u201d and illegal settlements and their complex relationships to \u201cinformal sector\u201d activities. At the collection level, disparate sources of data availability and collection are a continuous problem of human settlements statistics, particularly in attempts to assess \u201cmarginal\u201d settlements\u2019 conditions and to relate monitoring data to more conventional socio-economic statistics. The geographical breakdown of data is essential for human settlement statistics analysis. ",
        "D 275 Human settlements and housing statisticss Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Environmental impacts occur in and through components and processes of ecosystems, and even urban systems have been considered as ecosystems in \u201cintegrated ecological approaches to human settlements planning. Another issue at the data collection level is the periodicity. Even if most of the statistics are presented on an annual basis, some of them use different time periods such as decades (for census), daily and monthly. D.16.5. Improving sector statistics Several methodological issues have to be addressed at an early stage of any data collection, including: the distinction between rural and urban settlements; i. the identification of marginal housing units, for example, ii. slums or squatter settlements; resolution of problems of data compatibility and data iii. currency.

Agricultural, forestry and fishing statistics The chapter in brief This chapter covers statistics in the areas agriculture, forestry and fishery, which are all policy areas covered by the European Consensus on Development (see section B.1.5.1). Due to the importance of these areas to central policy issues such as poverty reduction, hunger prevention, rural development and sustainable management of natural resources, international organisations are actively seeking to improve statistics as basis for decision-making, monitoring and evaluation. A key challenge for these statistics is that subsistence farming and fishing often make up a large part of these sectors in developing countries; both production and employment are not captured by standard surveys and registers. Other ways to capture the real scope of agricultural, forestry and fishing production and employment must thus be explored. The chapter covers a wide area of statistics on agriculture, forestry and fishery, as well as satellite national accounts and price statistics for these areas. The chapter starts by identifying the main policy areas for which these statistics are used and continues by providing a user\u2019s view of the statistics involved. The chapter then identifies the main sources of data and information about methods, continues by discussing how to analyse the quality of the statistics in these fields and concludes with information on complementary sources. D.17.1. Policy applications: what this data is used for Agriculture, forestry and fisheries statistics have a wide variety of uses, including: Providing timely information on agriculture, forestry and \u2022 fisheries, which are key sectors for income, employment and provision of food and basic materials in most developing countries. These statistics cover both the structure of the sectors and their production of goods; Analysis of the production processes of the agricultural, \u2022 forestry and fishing industries and the primary income and employment generated by them; Supporting trade policy for agricultural, forestry and fishing \u2022 goods, providing information on bilateral and multilateral trade issues and the impact of individual policies (for more information on trade statistics, see chapter D.10); Monitoring and evaluating policy instruments for \u2022 developing these sectors in developing countries, as defined in the European Consensus on Development; Monitoring sustainable use of natural resources such as \u2022 fish-stocks and forests, protection of the environment (e.g. organic farming, soil degradation, etc.) (for more information on environmental statistics, see chapter D.14); Provision of information for research, analysis and impact \u2022 assessments on topics related to agriculture, forestry and fishing, e.g. for quantitative studies including short, medium and long-term forecasts of agricultural and fishing commodity markets. D.17.2. Concepts and definitions There are currently several initiatives ongoing on international level regarding concepts and definitions for agriculture, forestry and fisheries statistics. The key initiatives are briefly described and references in the form of hyperlinks given to websites and central documents. As most of this work is ongoing, it is recommended to follow these references to be informed of the most recent developments. The statistics covered in this section include a wide range of agriculture, forestry and fishery related statistics, including: agri-monetary statistics (economic accounts for agriculture \u2022 and agricultural price statistics); agricultural structures (farm structure, labour input, \u2022 structure of vineyards and orchards); agricultural production statistics; \u2022 agri-environmental indicators; \u2022 wood and wood product statistics; \u2022 forest resources assessment and forest fires; \u2022 trade in wood products; \u2022 fisheries. \u2022 This chapter does not deal with statistics on land use/land cover (see chapter D.14) or statistics on rural development (see chapter D.18). Neither does it cover the specific statistical methodology and organisation of censuses and surveys in the areas covered. Several different areas and types of statistics are covered (e.g. structure, production, trade). The specific concepts and definitions may vary from statistics to statistics, as explored in section D.17.2.1 to section D.17.2.7 below. However, these concepts and definitions might be over-ambitious in developing countries. Dependent on the specific situation of the individual country, some areas may be of limited relevance, e.g. due to a large share of subsistence farming and fishing, climate and weather, physical landscape (altitude, fertility and type of soil), whether the country is landlocked or coastal, etc. Internationally developed concepts and definitions should be used as far as possible, but adapted to the needs and the situation in the individual country. Especially the importance of subsistence farming and fishery, i.e. that the production from agriculture and fishery is directly used to feed the farmers/fishers and their families, is of huge importance for the establishment and development of agricultural statistics ",
        "D 280 Agricultural, Forestry and Fishing Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 in developing countries. The OECD handbook \u2018Measuring the non-observed economy\u2019 presents different approaches for measuring and estimating the scope and value produced by the \u2018informal economy\u2019, i.e. also covering subsistence activities. Approaches are presented both within the frame of national accounts and for statistics on normally non- observed structures, production and employment. The data collected should focus on information required to analyse the situation in a country with respect to its agricultural policy (e.g. economic importance of the agricultural sector for the country, main products produced). Agricultural data are generally collected with different frequencies (monthly, quarterly, annually, every three years). The frequency of agricultural data collections in developing countries should be adapted to the information (policy) needs and to the resources available for collecting data. In the \u2018Global Strategy to Improve Agricultural and Rural Statistics\u2019 presented at the 41 st session of the UN Statistical Commission (2010), the World Bank defines a core set of economic indicators to be collected regularly for agriculture, forestry and fisheries. This indicator set covers groups of variables on output, input, stocks, trade, prices, final expenditure, agro-processing, rural infrastructure and international transfers. In the following sections, more details on individual variables and groups of variables are given. Several efforts provided input to the Global Strategy, including the FAO, World Bank and Global Donor Platform for Rural Development (GDPRD) sourcebook of indicators for monitoring and evaluation: \u2018Tracking results in agriculture and rural development in less-than-ideal conditions\u2019. In developing countries, the proposed \u2018core set of indicators\u2019 should be considered as a basis. Dependent on the national development strategy and priorities, some core indicators might be of high priority whereas others might be of limited relevance. On the other hand, additional indicators which are not part of the proposed core set might be of national interest. Consequently, each country needs to set its own priorities regarding the inclusion of core indicators in its national system. D.17.2.1 Economic Accounts for Agriculture (EAA) Statistics play a key role in the design, implementation and monitoring of agricultural policy, as well as in the evaluation of measures addressed at the economic and financial situation of the agricultural community. In the EU, the Economic Accounts for Agriculture (EAA) has been developed to provide such statistics (a detailed methodology can be found in Annex I of Regulation (EC) N o 138/2004 , amended by Regulation (EC) No 212/2008 ). The EAA is a satellite account to the national accounts ( European System of Accounts - ESA95 ), providing complementary information and concepts adapted to the particular nature of the agricultural industry (see also section B.2.4.1.3). Although their structure very closely matches that of the national accounts, their compilation requires the formulation of appropriate rules and methods. EAA collect economic accounts and data on agricultural labour input (ALI). The EAA accounts consist of a sequence of inter-related accounts: the production account; \u2022 the generation-of-income account, and; \u2022 the balancing items \u2018value added\u2019 and \u2018operating surplus\u2019, \u2022 respectively. The EAA covers agricultural products and services produced over the accounting period. The main indicators are labour input, output, intermediate consumption, gross and net value added, compensation of employees, other taxes and subsidies on production, net operating surplus or net mixed income, property income, net entrepreneurial income, etc. at current and at constant prices. The EAA framework is a very strong methodology for analysing the value added and labour input in the agricultural sector. It also provides information on interdependencies between different parts of the agricultural sector. As such, the EAA methodology constitutes a strong basis for developing agricultural accounts within the national accounts also in developing countries. However, the full EAA framework is ambitious, requiring complete and high quality input data. In developing countries, this should be simplified and adapted to the national setting, building on existing information sources and the most pressing needs for data to formulate, implement and monitor policies in and for the agricultural sector. An important limitation of the EAA framework in developing countries is that it covers only registered businesses, such as state farms and plantations, major food producers and other organised and registered businesses (e.g. the export- oriented flower producers in East Africa). However, in many developing countries, a large share of agriculture production and employment takes place in households producing crops and livestock for their own use (subsistence farming). This production, which is of vital importance in the context of poverty reduction and the MDGs, is not covered by ordinary surveys and national accounts approaches. To get better and more complete accounts of the agricultural sector, strategies to improve the coverage and the measurement of this part of the agricultural sector are required. A strategy for setting up a survey of the informal sector is presented in Box 13.4 in chapter D.13; a strategy for assessing non-observed agricultural activities in the national account setting is outlined in Box 17.1 below: ",
        "D 281 Agricultural, Forestry and Fishing Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Box 17.1: Non-observed agricultural production and employment The OECD\u2019s Handbook on Measuring the Non-Observed Economy presents strategies to improve the national accounts, as defined by the System of National Accounts 1993 (SNA93), in particular with the goal of reducing non-observed and non-measured activities. This is a key issue for the agricultural sector in many developing countries, as it is normally characterised by a large share of unregistered household production for own final use. A national statistical system should have a measurement programme for the non-observed economy. It should have clear objectives, roles and responsibilities for national accountants and for survey statisti- cians. The major data users should be informed and involved. Exhaus- tive coverage is an important aspect of quality, thus the non-observed economy measurement programme should be integrated with other quality management and improvement initiatives. The proposed measurement strategy is defined in five lines of action: Identify an appropriate conceptual and analytical framework for 1. assessing the non-observed sector; Assess the basic data supplied to the national accounts and the 2. compilation methods. Identify the extent of non-observed and non-measured activities and establish priorities for dealing with them; Identify potential improvements in the national accounts 3. compilation process that will reduce non-measured activities through model based adjustments and the results of supplementary surveys. As a short term solution, such indirect measurement methods can be introduced relatively quickly and cheaply in comparison to changes to the basic data collection programme that may require substantial additional resources; Identify potential improvements in the infrastructure and content 4. of the basic data collection programme that will reduce the incidence of non-observed activities by bringing the programme into line with international standards and best practices. This is the long-term solution to many data problems; Develop an implementation plan that includes consultations 5. with users, prioritising potential improvements, ensuring good communication between survey statisticians and national accountants, and dealing with revisions to national accounts estimates that may occur as a consequence of the changes. D.17.2.2. Agricultural Price Statistics (APS) Agriculture is crucial to maintain food supply and basic subsistence for a large share of the population in many developing countries. One important input for the formulation of agricultural policy is information on agricultural prices. For small farmers, prices of the inputs to production (e.g. fertilizers) and the prices given for their products by market traders, production cooperatives and other channels are critical to their economic survival. Thus, price information is vital for specifying targets of agricultural policy, for defining the means to implement the policy and for monitoring progress and evaluating the outcomes. Differences in prices between regions, variations in prices over time and the level of key prices are of interest. Basic tools for the measurement of price variations and price trends are absolute agricultural prices and agricultural price indices. The main use of absolute agricultural prices is to compare price levels between regions or countries and to study sales channels. In contrast, agricultural price indices are used primarily to analyse price developments and the effect on agricultural income. Provided that methodological compatibility is given, absolute agricultural prices and agricultural price indices can also be used in the Economic Accounts for Agriculture (EAA). The purpose of the price indices is to provide information on trends in producer prices of agricultural products and purchase prices of the means of agricultural production. They permit a comparison of trends between various regions or countries and between different products within a country. They also facilitate comparisons between trends in producer prices and trends in prices of the production means. They cannot, however, express differences between regions or countries in terms of absolute agricultural price levels. Agricultural Price Indices (output and input) comprise: An index of producer prices of agricultural products; \u2022 An index of purchase prices of the means of agricultural \u2022 production. While the agricultural price indices reveal trends in the prices of individual agricultural products or product groups, statistics of absolute agricultural prices are used for comparisons between regions or countries and for economic analyses. Absolute agricultural prices (especially aggregated prices) are needed for many model calculations and for the determination of price elasticities. Two objectives should be met with the collection of agricultural price statistics. The first one is that absolute prices should be comparable between regions or countries. The second is that the products for which the prices are to be recorded are of economic relevance for the respective country. In other words, focus must be on collecting the prices of those products that are of key importance for the country, either for supplying food for the population, for providing basic income to farmers, for generating export income, or for other central policy targets. These two objectives are not necessarily compatible and some compromise may be necessary. Especially the comparison of time series for actual agricultural prices between countries has to be made with caution. Differences in the prices may reflect methodological differences (for example different forms of commercialisation of the products concerned) and not in every case factual differences in the prices themselves. ",
        "D 282 Agricultural, Forestry and Fishing Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 An example of methodology for APS, including the target definition, can be found in the Handbook for EU Agricultural Price Statistics. As in all domains, the statistics on agricultural prices should follow international classifications (e.g. on crops, livestock, economic sector) and good practices, but be adapted and focused to meet the most pressing information needs for the agricultural policy in the specific country. D.17.2.3 Agricultural structures (farm structure) International statistics on agricultural structures are collected using censuses and surveys based on the \u2018agricultural holding\u2019. An \u2018agricultural holding\u2019 is an agricultural production unit with one owner (either an individual or a group of individuals). In developing countries, in addition to data on agricultural holdings, data on households producing crops and livestock for own use and local markets are necessary to get exhaustive information about the agricultural sector. Consequently, all units producing for the agricultural market should be considered in the scope of agricultural statistics. In the case of agricultural holdings, this should be done in the censuses and surveys, while data for households should at least be collected in censuses. In recent years, increasing efforts have been made towards the better integration of statistical activities for agriculture. Integration means that each statistical collection is carried out as a component of the national statistics system (see section B.2.3). To carry out an agricultural survey, a \u2018sampling frame\u2019 such as a farm register is necessary to identify the production units and draw a sample of them for the survey. In many developing countries, there is no farm register or similar overview of production units or it is not maintained and up-to-date. An agricultural census provides such an overview and can be used for establishing a farm register for future surveys. An agricultural census should be carried out every ten years. A census of agriculture collects data on the structure of agriculture, covering the whole or a significant part of the country. Typical structural data collected in a census of agriculture are size of holding, land tenure, land use, crop area harvested, irrigation, livestock numbers, labour and other agricultural inputs. The FAO\u2019s World Programme for the Census of Agriculture 2010 is detailed in \u2018System of Integrated Agricultural Censuses and Surveys - World Programme for the Census of Agriculture 2010 \u2019. This publication presents guidelines for censuses to be carried out by countries between 2006 and 2015. FAO has encouraged countries to develop and implement their census of agriculture tailored to their unique situation, but to be mindful of the need to collect a minimum set of data for international comparison purposes. A new objective of the 2010 round of agricultural censuses is to monitor progress towards global development targets, in particular MDG 1, through a food security module. The need for statistical information has to be balanced against the resources required to produce the statistics. A census of agriculture is very costly and highly demanding on technical and other resources. Where statistical systems are not well developed, there has been a tendency to use the opportunity provided by the census of agriculture to collect a wider range of data than would normally be the case in such a census. In the EU, the farm structure surveys are the backbone of the agricultural statistical system. They provide micro-data on the agricultural labour force, land use, livestock, equipment and non-agricultural activities. They are also the statistical basis for sample surveys on land use, livestock and agricultural income. For classification of agricultural holdings, the EU typology of agricultural farms (holdings) could serve as a framework. This framework needs adaptation to the national conditions in developing countries, which might be different from one country to another. Especially the size of the utilised agricultural area, which is used for the definition of a holding, might have to be adapted to the national situation. In case there is no farm register 55 , it has to be created. Farm structure surveys should be carried out as sample surveys at regular intervals (e.g. in the EU every three years). Regarding non-observed agricultural producers, e.g. subsistence farmers and other small production units, the collection of data in the framework of population censuses is a good means to cover this group of agricultural producers. However, additional data collection between two censuses would be desirable for the completeness of statistics on agricultural structures (see Box 13.4 in chapter D.13). Micro-data should consist of a set of records containing information on individual respondents or on economic entities and cover the following main data: Labour force data, which cover all persons having \u2022 completed their compulsory education (having reached school leaving age) who carried out farm work on the holding under survey during the 12 months up to the survey day; Livestock for breeding, dairy, draught, etc. consists of \u2022 livestock that are produced / cultivated for the products they provide year after year; Land use, which provide data on areas used for different \u2022 crops (see chapter D.14); Other gainful activities of the holding; \u2022 Support for rural development. \u2022 Special attention should be given to the definition of the labour force. This definition should be adapted to the national situation in each developing country. 5 5 More information on the development of farm registers is available in the \u201c Global Strategy to Improve Agricultural and Rural Statistics \u201d. ",
        "D 283 Agricultural, Forestry and Fishing Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 D.17.2.4 Agricultural production statistics (crop and animal production) Agricultural production statistics cover three main output categories: production of crops and livestock, yield of crops and core livestock, areas harvested and planted (only for crops). Production statistics play a key role in the design, implementation and monitoring of agricultural policy, and also contribute to ensuring food safety. Data collection on crop and animal production in developing countries should be limited to the core crops and animals. Subsistence farming is an important aspect for providing food security in many developing countries. It is therefore important to develop strategies for capturing or estimating also this agricultural production. Both the \u2019Global Strategy to Improve Agricultural and Rural Statistics \u2019 and the indicators sourcebook \u2018 Tracking results in agriculture and rural development in less- than-ideal conditions\u2019 addresses statistics on crops and livestock and approaches to prioritise different statistics and products. Crop production statistics cover the field of cereal production and other field crops and of fruits and vegetables. They also cover supply balance sheets, which focus on resources and uses of a specific commodity (i.e. changes in stocks, products used for processing, products used by the producers, etc.). The major groups are cereals, other main crops, vegetables, fruit, fodder and horticultural crops. Crop statistics cover also structural data on orchards and vineyards. As an example, methodologies for data collection in the EU are given in Crop production \u2013 Glossary 2001 and Crop production \u2013 Manual for current statistics (2001 edition) . The objective of statistics on animal production is to provide data on livestock, meat and milk production. This comprises e.g. cattle, pigs, sheep and goats livestock surveys; meat production; trade of live animals; production forecasts; supply balance sheets, activity, trade and structure of hatcheries. As a good example of a comprehensive methodology, Regulation (EC) No 1165/2008 concerning livestock and meat statistics describes in detail the collection, validation and dissemination of data, analysis of methods and update of metadata information. Information on methodologies for data collection in individual EU member states and in candidate countries is given in \u2018Methodology of animal statistics\u2019 . D.17.2.5 Forestry statistics In the context of climate change, the state of the world\u2019s forests is increasingly coming into focus. Data on deforestation and reforestation, i.e. changes in land use/cover in forest areas, is an important input to this discussion by providing evidence for monitoring and policy initiatives. The platform Reduce Emission from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD) shows how this information can be used. REDD could be used together with statistics on land cover and land use (see section D.14.6) to advocate the importance of forest statistics, both in the context of sustainable use of natural resources and in the context of climate change. Developing countries should as a minimum aim to collect the indicators recommended by the \u2019Global Strategy to Improve Agricultural and Rural Statistics\u2019 : Area in woodlands and forests, removals and prices for \u2022 land associated with agricultural holdings. Area in woodlands and forests, removals and prices for \u2022 products from non agricultural holdings and respective utilization. To avoid duplication of efforts, work on forestry statistics on international level is coordinated between Eurostat, FAO, UNECE and the International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO). The annual Joint FAO/UNECE/Eurostat/ITTO Forest Sector Questionnaire (JFSQ) collects production and trade data for wood and wood products. The main products covered are: Roundwood \u2022 Sawnwood \u2022 Wood-based panels (veneer sheets, plywood, particle \u2022 board) Pulp (wood pulp, recovered fibre pulp, pulp from fibres \u2022 other than wood) Paper and paperboard including packaging materials \u2022 In the EU, annual data is also collected on economic accounts for forestry and logging, following the new concepts of \u2018Integrated environmental and economic accounts for forests\u2019 (IEEAF). The Economic Accounts for Forestry (EAF) are satellite accounts of the European System of Accounts ( European System of Accounts - ESA 1995 ), and provide complementary information to the ESA95. The concepts have been adapted to reflect the nature of the forestry industry. A detailed methodology for EAF can be found in the Manual on the economic accounts for Agriculture and Forestry EAA/EAF 97 (Rev.1.1) . FAO and the Ministerial Conference on the Protection of Forests in Europe (MCPFE) collect data on forest resources, ownership, and selected economic, employment and sustainable forest management variables. The data covered are similar and the reference years are identical, but the type of data is different. FAO collects forecasts on a global level, while MCPFE collects definitive data on Europe including Russia. The FAO exercise is called Forest Resources Assessment (FRA) , while the MCPFE exercise is called State of Europe\u2019s Forests (SoEF). According to the information needs, data collection could follow either the FAO or the MCPFE concept. ",
        "D 284 Agricultural, Forestry and Fishing Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 D.17.2.6 Agri-environmental statistics In most countries, agriculture is the largest user of water, a cause of chemical pollution and soil degradation, and a contributor to climate change. However, agriculture plays a positive role in capturing carbon, managing watersheds, preserving biodiversity, and providing feed stock for biofuel production. Information on many of the production inputs that are used in measuring productivity is agro- environmental. Agri-environmental statistics are thus of great interest for environmental policy and the sustainable development of the world economy. As such, they are closely related to sustainable development indicators (see chapter D.26) and Agenda 21 . Poverty is a major cause of food insecurity. Increased food production, including staple food, should take place within the framework of sustainable management of natural resources. These issues are important to developing countries, as they seek to reduce poverty and increase food security, while at the same time facing the effects of climate change and degradation of soil and other natural resources. Environmental problems are generally global issues, thus agri-environmental data should be comparable worldwide. Consequently, data collection in developing countries should use already developed and fixed international standards. New developments regarding additional indicators and or data collection methodologies should be considered. As a starting point for the creation of agri-environmental statistics, developing countries may concentrate on data on agricultural inputs such as quantity of water used for agricultural irrigation, quantity and value of fertilizers (by core crops) and pesticides (by category such as fungicides) used, as well as seeds. A tentative list of indicators was presented in the FAO paper \u2018Agri-environmental statistics for compilation of indicators, accounts and meeting other needs of decision\u2019 . In the EU, agri-environmental statistics are in a development stage where concepts and definitions of a proposed list of indicators are being fixed. The resulting system of agri-environmental indicators should monitor the integration of environmental concerns into agricultural policy. There are also further efforts required for conceptual and methodological improvement of existing indicators and for collection of the necessary data. In the framework of this development, there is for the moment a focus on collection of data on fertilisers, nutrient (N, P) balances, plant protection products/pesticides, and landscape indicators. D.17.2.7 Fisheries Information on the status and trends of capture fisheries and fishery resources is a key to sound policy-making and responsible fisheries management. Fish is a major source of food and household income. This includes the capture of fish in the open sea, captures in coastal zones managed by each country, captures from rivers and other fresh water sources, as well as aquaculture. Fisheries directly utilizes and impacts on national resources and environments. Countries are responsible for providing statistics on all fisheries and aquaculture within their national jurisdiction, including their exclusive economic zone as well as conducted by vessels which sail under their flags. FAO collects, analyses, interprets and disseminates statistics relating to various aspects of world fisheries, such as fishery production from capture fisheries and aquaculture, trade of fishery commodities, preserved and prepared production of fishery commodities, apparent fish consumption, fishery fleets and employment in fisheries. Fisheries statistics are usually obtained from national reporting offices. Regional Fishery Bodies have been formed to coordinate the data collection and management of fishery resources and fisheries with open access, including high seas areas and species. Data collected by Regional Fishery Bodies generally contain detailed information on operational and biological aspects of capture fisheries. The \u2018 Global Strategy to Improve Agricultural and Rural Statistics \u2019 recommends focusing on statistics which give information on food supply: Quantity of fish landed and discarded, number of days \u2022 fished, amounts processed for food and non-food uses, prices, and imports and exports. For aquaculture: area cultured, production, prices, and net \u2022 trade of imports and exports FAO has a central role in the development of methodologies for statistics on fisheries and aquaculture . To develop fishery statistics in a developing country, the following documents present an overview of good practices and international standards, especially with a view to developing a comprehensive strategy in the area: FAO \u2022 \u2018Strategy for Improving Information on Status and Trends of Capture Fisheries\u2019 The Coordinating Working Party on Fishery Statistics \u2022 (CWP) Handbook of Fishery Statistics Standards \u2018Global Strategy to Improve Agricultural and Rural \u2022 Statistics\u2019 Data collection could also follow the guidelines on fishing statistics in the EU, which form the basis for a comprehensive statistical system in this area. The Eurostat fisheries statistics are designed to meet the policy-related data requirements of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). At the moment, the main focus is on the collection of data necessary for the control and support of sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources covering catches and landings of fishery products as well as aquaculture. The further goals include resource management, sustainability of fisheries, structural policy, socio-economic impact and market policy. The EU fishery ",
        "D 285 Agricultural, Forestry and Fishing Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 statistics might in future place greater emphasis on data which have until recently received relatively little attention. This covers e.g. employment data and supply balance sheets on fisheries products statistics. An overview over methodologies and good practices in the EU and in the individual member states can be found in \u2018Collection and compilation of fish catch and landing statistics in member countries of the EEA\u2019 and in \u2018Collection and compilation of fishery statistics in EU Candidate Countries\u2019 . \u2018Ramon\u2019, Eurostat\u2019s Classification Server contains detailed information on classifications. Box 17.2: Eurostat\u2019s statistics system for agriculture, forestry and fisheries The primary aim of collecting of agriculture, forestry and fishing statistics in the EU is to provide data for the analysis of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). These data come from a variety of sources and are of different nature. They come from economic accounts, balance of payments, agriculture, forestry, fishing, rural development and environmental statistics. Consequently, the data collection methods vary considerably for the different sets of statistics. The statistics system includes data collected according to commonly agreed methods used for a long time, such as the European System of Accounts. It also includes data based on surveys such as the Farm Structure Survey (FSS), orchards and vineyard surveys. The statistical information and quality therefore depends on data collected using varied but well-established data collection methods. Key data for agriculture: Economic accounts \u2022 Agricultural output (million EUR) \u2013 of which crop output and \u03bf animal output in %; Gross value added at basic prices (million EUR); \u03bf Agricultural input expressed as total intermediate consumption \u03bf (million EUR); Agricultural income \u2013 Indicator A (% change on previous year). \u03bf Farm structure \u2022 Holdings \u2013 number (of which UAA < 2ha, ESU < 1, holder < 35 \u03bf years, holder > 64 years, each in %) and UAA per holding in ha; Labour force \u2013 persons in holdings of more than 1 ESU (of \u03bf which holders and women in %), agriculture as % of total employment. D.17.3. Sources of data and metadata International organisations publish agriculture, forestry and fishery transport statistics for either their member countries or for almost all countries of the world. The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) belong to the first and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) to the second group. The most important data source for worldwide statistics on agriculture, forestry and fishery is the FAO, which publishes statistics on agriculture, forestry and fishery in its FAO Statistical Database . This on-line database contains time- series from over 210 countries and territories, covering statistics on agriculture, nutrition, fisheries, forestry, food aid, land use and population. For each of these domains there are separate datasets available. The main ones are \u2018 FAO Stat \u2013 Agriculture\u2019 , which provides data on crops, livestock, irrigation, land use, fertilizer, pesticide consumption, and agricultural machinery. \u2018 FAO Stat \u2013 Fisheries \u2019 provides statistics on fish production and primary products, while \u2018 FAO Stat \u2013 Forestry \u2019 provides statistics on imports and exports of woods and paper. In addition to these main datasets there are some detailed datasets on other specific topics available (see Box 17.3). FAO has initiated a programme called CountrySTAT . CountrySTAT is a web-based information technology system for food and agriculture statistics at national and sub-national levels. It provides decision-makers and interested parties access to statistics on production, prices, trade and consumption. This supports analysis, informed policy-making and monitoring with the goal of eradicating extreme poverty and hunger. Through national and regional CountrySTAT projects, FAO forms partnerships with statistical offices and the ministries of agriculture, fisheries and forestry to introduce the system and build the national capacity to use it. In each country, the national government makes a substantial contribution to ensure its deployment and continued training and maintenance. ",

The system is owned and maintained by the country itself. CountrySTAT gathers and harmonises scattered institutional data, so that the information becomes consistent within the country and compatible with data at the international level. GLIPHA The Global Livestock Production and Health Atlas (GLiPHA), is a user-friendly, highly interactive electronic atlas using the Key Indicator Display System (KIDS) developed by FAO. The atlas provides a scalable overview of spatial and temporal variation of quantitative information related to animal production and health through the combination of maps, tables and charts. Forestry Country Information The Forestry Country Information contains statistics on forest and forestry issues on a country by country basis including forest cover, plantations, volume and biomass as well as fires. AQUASTAT AQUASTAT is FAO\u2019s global information system of water and agriculture developed by the Land and Water Development Division of FAO. AQUASTAT provides users with comprehensive statistics on the state of agricultural water management across the world, with emphasis on developing countries and countries in transition. Fishery and Aquaculture Statistics The Fisheries and Aquaculture Department of the FAO provides advice and objective information to its members to help promote responsible aquacultures and fisheries. Therefore data collections are compiled, analysed and disseminated. UNECE disseminates forestry statistics and some data on agriculture for about 50 countries. Several indicators are available for forestry statistics: forest resources, forest health and vitality, productive functions, biological diversity, protective functions and socio-economic functions. The OECD collects and publishes data on agricultural policies and trade, sustainable agriculture, pesticides and fisheries on its web site. However, most of the data are not disseminated in the form of statistical tables on the website, but presented in publications and policy papers. The World Bank collects and publishes data collected in the framework of the \u2018Living Standards Measurement Study \u2013 Integrated Surveys on Agriculture (LSMS-ISA) \u2019 project. This project covers seven Sub-Saharan African countries and aims at the generation of nationally representative, household panel data with strong focus on agriculture and rural development. EUROBASE, Eurostat\u2019s free dissemination database provides free access and free data to all since October 2004. It provides rich and high quality information agriculture, forestry and fisheries in Europe, as well as a range of methodological notes and guidelines. D.17.4. Analysing data quality and iden- tifying problems The quality of data for agriculture, forestry and fisheries depends on the data coverage, the timeliness of the published figures and their compliance with the agreed methodology. For comparisons and analyses, international standards and classifications should be respected. A critical factor for the completeness of agricultural and fishery statistics in developing countries is the strategy developed for handling subsistence farming and fishery (see Box 13.4 and Box 17.1). Timeliness is especially important for agricultural production statistics; for example, data about a record harvest have little information value if they become available only a year after the harvest. Therefore, nowcasting and forecasting techniques are used to estimate current and future trends in agricultural production, soil quality, deforestation, fish stocks, etc. When the collection of data is based on legal acts or international agreements, these often specify the data collection methods. In these cases, this should be used as a starting point for developing the validation procedures. For several international datasets, quality checks are also described in the relevant Handbooks. When quality checks are not explicitly described for a dataset, general principles for quality should be applied (see section B.2.1.2 and section C.5.3). A valuable tool for validating results is to use mirror techniques. For example, production data for a specific crop can be validated against data from markets, cooperatives and wholesale buyers in order to assess differences in data between the two sides of the crop market. The following analysis of these differences should lead to a strategy to improve accuracy and methods, step by step leading to better data and better estimates. A tool for validating data on production areas, degradation of soil and deforestation is the use of remote sensing data. The Africover project has been prepared to assist in the development of reliable and georeferenced information on natural resources required at sub-national, national and regional levels, amongst others for early warning, food security, agriculture, forest monitoring, watershed management, etc. Such data can be used to cross-check data from on-the-ground surveys. Based on Africover, the Global Land Cover Network initiative has been launched by FAO and UNEP. (For more information on land use and land cover, see section D.14.6.) ",
        "D 287 Agricultural, Forestry and Fishing Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Box 17.4: Using new technology to improve quality: LSMS-ISA The Living Standards Measurement Study \u2013 Integrated Surveys on Agriculture (LSMS-ISA) seeks to improve agricultural data in Sub- Saharan Africa. At the heart of this project is engagement with both line ministries and national statistical offices to design and implement panel household surveys emphasizing agriculture. Besides supporting the production of high-quality household-level data, the project emphasizes the validation of measures and indicators and promotes research in data collection methods. Some of the areas being considered include improved methods for quantification of agricultural production (particularly for difficult-to-measure crops such as tubers and vegetables); measurement of agriculture and non- farm self-employment income; and for understanding how farmers are adapting to and mitigating the effects of climate change. The new surveys employ state-of-the art techniques and methods, including GIS technologies and the use of Computer Assisted Personal Interviews (CAPI) to provide more accurate estimates and reduce the time lag between data collection and dissemination. D.17.5. Improving sector statistics Agriculture, forestry and fisheries are key sectors in developing countries, providing food and basic energy and building materials to the population. The objective of any intervention on statistics in these areas is to improve the quality (see section C.5.3), including timeliness and completeness. The basic quality criteria is whether the statistics are \u2018fit for use\u2019, in other words whether they meet the information needs of the users. Interventions should address any critical points in the data chain, from data collection and processing to the publication of statistics. Due to the critical role of these sectors, much attention is given internationally to improving these statistics. Links to key initiatives and strategy papers can be found in the \u2018To find out more ...\u2019 box at the end of this chapter. Data on agriculture, forestry and fishing are often collected both by the NSIs and by ministries of agriculture, rural development, environment, etc., and associated administrations. Estimates of e.g. crop production and area may be published both by the NSI and the responsible line ministry, often with different results. An efficient use of resources requires that data collections are not duplicated. It is therefore vital to establish a close cooperation between the institutions concerned. Whether the NSI should publish statistics based on the administrative data or the administration should publish the data themselves depends on the structure of the national statistical system. A formal service-level agreement or memorandum of understanding, especially for statistical activities not covered by legislation, is often necessary to align the interests of the two services. A very useful tool is to organise working groups, task-forces or workshops with key users and data providers. A key issue is to clarify the users\u2019 needs for statistics on agriculture, forestry and fishing. These meetings can be used to define an action plan, set up timetables and prepare recommendations on methodologies to be implemented. The user group should not only comprise international organisations and national authorities responsible for food safety, agricultural development and natural resources, but also NGOs involved in these fields as well as independent researchers and analysts. The data providers comprise both large private and state estates, as well as small-scale farmers and fishers. New technologies may prove valuable for augmenting existing surveys. An example is the use of GPS and satellite data in the monitoring of crop producing areas, deforestation and desertification. Another example is the use of robust low-cost laptop computers in computer-assisted personal interviews (CAPI), which could significantly improve coverage, timeliness and quality of household-based surveys. However, new technologies are normally costly. The expected benefits must be assessed against the costs, the users\u2019 information needs and especially against the priorities of the national statistical strategy. A key quality issue is that the NSI at least implements basic credibility and consistency checks on the data. These checks are especially important to agriculture, forestry and fisheries statistics, which normally draw on several different sources. In particular, methods and coverage should be compatible between the organisations that collect these different data. In developing countries, the handling of agriculture, forestry and fishing in the informal sector is also of huge importance for the completeness and information value of the statistics. ",

Regional and small area statistics The chapter in brief This chapter covers information on how to develop regional and small area statistics relevant to the European Commission development cooperation. Regional and small area statistics can be developed for any statistical field, but need to be based on a consistent (in the best case officially agreed and used) regional and small area classification. The present chapter on regional and small area statistics begins by giving information on why these statistics are needed. It continues with a description of the main concepts used and how these concepts could be transferred and applied in developing regions and countries. Information on a basic set of regional and small area indicators is also given. In developed countries, a vast variety of high quality statistics with a structured regional breakdown is produced. It is very difficult for developing countries to reach this quantity and quality of regional statistics. Indeed, it is mostly not required for developing countries to reach that level; for the core analysis of the situation and development of regions, a dataset covering the main economic and social indicators is normally sufficient. Finally, some information is given on how to improve regional and small area statistics step by step and where to get additional information on individual topics related to regional and small area statistics, such as small area estimations and data collected on city level. D.18.1. Policy applications: what this data is used for Over the last decades, the development of regions has emerged as an important issue in the public debate worldwide. There is a strong need to develop strategies to guide this development, within the European Union and other regions of the world. A number of factors have contributed to this: Increasing formal and informal functional ties between \u2022 regions and between countries; Increasing co-operation with partners sharing the same \u2022 interest and facing similar challenges; Creation of networks; \u2022 Regional policy needs in view of limited public resources. \u2022 All these factors have called for new, unifying frameworks that make it easier to secure convergence and co-ordination between sectoral policies. At regional level, a crosscutting, multi-sectoral perspective can be developed, forming a basis for co-ordination and functional balance in spatial planning. It is necessary to develop instruments enabling reliable and comparable analysis of regions, definition of clear medium- term aims and targets and adequate co-ordination, delivery, monitoring and assessment mechanisms. The European Spatial Development Policy (ESDP) - a EU framework for policy guidance to improve cooperation among sectoral policies with regional impact \u2013 could be used as a model for regional cooperation between developing countries. The idea behind the ESDP was that the work of the EU member states complemented each other best if directed towards common objectives for spatial development. The ESDP has three main aims: Economic and social cohesion; \u2022 Sustainable development; and \u2022 Balanced competitiveness of the European territory. \u2022 A similar strategy for regional development and co- operation has been established in Africa. The SDI (Spatial Development Initiative) was developed in South Africa in 1996 and established by the African Union (AU) in the framework of NEPAD (New Partnership for Africa\u2019s Development). The SDI process is essentially a methodology, rather than a policy. It can be applied to facilitate investment- led growth and development in any locality. SDI represents an understandable and reasonably objective way to prioritize regional infrastructure projects, stimulate investments into productive capacity and achieve economic densification in order to optimize \u2013 amongst other aims \u2013 regional economic development and co-operation. One must analyse if and where support is needed before decisions regarding specific actions and their implementation can be made. This analysis is mainly based on regional and small area data. Analysis of regional data supports regional cohesion and is necessary to assess the eligibility for financing/funding. Regional data is the source for applied structural research and projections (forecasts) for regional development. To carry out such analysis, there is a need for reliable data at the regional level. As far as possible, these data should be harmonised and comparable between countries, regions and smaller areas (e.g. cities). One aspect of this is the use of common international classifications and best statistical practices. Another key aspect is that the data cover regional entities of similar structure and size. In the EU, the European Commission has developed the Nomenclature of Statistical Territorial Units (NUTS) . For OECD countries a different regional classification called OECD regional typology is used (see also Box 18.5). Based on either regional classification/ typology, data for different statistical domains are collected in the member countries of these two organizations, ranging from horizontal statistics (e.g. national/regional accounts) to sector specific statistics (e.g. demography, labour market, agriculture, health, education, tourism). Regionally comparable data are vital for analysis of disparities and cohesion between regions also in other parts of the world, especially in those that receive EU aid or financial support. Such support is partly given to the state and partly directly ",
        "D 294 Regional and Small Area Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 to local projects. Thus, there is a need for regional/local statistics to evaluate the need for aid and to assess the results of this support. For example, DG EuropeAid funds regional integration activities and micro-finance initiatives in many regions worldwide, with the aim of strengthening regional macroeconomic stability and convergence, establishing free trade areas and customs unions as well as creating synergies and support activities to increase intraregional trade. Urban development has become a topic of growing importance for policymakers in both developed and developing countries, in particular in view of the migration from rural to urban areas. Cities are key sources for economic development and competitiveness. At the same time, cities have to deal with their own processes of economic restructuring and major issues of social inclusion within the city itself. Within the EU, the so-called \u201cUrban Audit\u201d has been designed to provide a greater insight into the economic potential and the social imbalances of European cities by collecting statistical information, on a consistent pan-European basis, for a wide range of data at the level of the cities, their wider urban areas and their sub-city districts. The Urban Audit covers cities both within and outside the EU. The data collected in the Urban Audit system allow analysis of the situation of each city, comparisons between cities and establishment of urban typologies. The methodology developed for the Urban Audit is designed to apply to a wide variety of cities and can in principle be applied to cities and urban regions also in developing countries. D.18.2. Concepts and definitions Regional and small area statistics are statistics going below the national level. They often serve as basic information for the calculation of national aggregates. In this context, a region refers to \u201ca tract of land with more or less definitively marked boundaries, which often serves as an administrative unit below the level of the nation state\u201d. The term \u201csmall area\u201d generally refers to a small geographical area such as a county, a municipality or even smaller. There are several criteria possible to define the limits of a region: Natural boundaries (e.g. rivers, mountains, sea, industrial \u2022 regions such as coal mining, etc.); Historical boundaries (e.g. dukedoms, kingdoms, free \u2022 cities, etc.); and Administrative boundaries (e.g. communes, counties, \u2022 etc.). Regions defined according to natural boundaries are also called analytical or functional regions, because they group together zones using geographical (e.g. altitude, type of soil) or socio-economic (e.g. homogeneity, complementarities of regional economies) criteria. Regions defined according to historical and/or administrative boundaries can be summarised under the terms normative/ institutional/administrative regions. They reflect political will and their borders are fixed according to the tasks allocated to the territorial communities, according to the size of population necessary to carry out these tasks sufficiently and economically. Administrative regions From a statistical point of view, each of these two breakdown types has strengths and weaknesses. Administrative regions usually have a statutory existence in the administrative practice of the country concerned. They are clearly defined, usually universally recognised and relatively stable. They comprise the structure within which certain levels of government exercise their powers, particularly where regional policy is concerned. Normative or administrative regions are therefore generally adopted by the national statistical systems as the most appropriate geographical units for data collection, processing and dissemination. The drawback of this approach is that the administrative and historical grounds for defining these regions differ widely from country to country. International comparability is therefore difficult to achieve, even in terms of area and population. Functional regions A functional (analytical) concept could be tailored according to the region in which one is particularly interested. This concept is often applied for the analysis of e.g. cross-border regions, functional economic areas (such as tourism regions), or larger urban zones. However, the definition of regions and small areas according to a functional method is often based on an administrative regional classification, which serves as a regional basis for data collection, because such data are normally reliable and actually available. The main weakness of the analytical concept is that information between two different regions or small areas can be compared only to a limited extent. The decision regarding which regional concept (analytical or normative regions) should be applied has to be made according to the situation in each country where the regional (small area/local) data collection should be carried out and the intended use of the statistics. For practical reasons, the normative (administrative) concept is often preferable as this is commonly collected in all countries and the regional coverage is complete and clearly defined. However, this administrative concept is not always realistic in the case of cities and of city districts. Where the city, defined as an urban zone, covers several administrative regions, a mixture of administrative and functional data might be preferable (depending on the purpose of the data collection). For example, an industrialised region might include several cities and towns and some \u2018hinterland\u2019 of those, each closely linked to a certain industry or to several industrial branches. In this situation, a separate definition of the region could be created, ",
        "D 295 Regional and Small Area Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 based on either the concept for a functional region or an administrative classification or a mixture of both. Nomenclature of Statistical Territorial Units (NUTS) At EU level there are two types of statistics broken down below the national level. Statistics collected according to the \u2018 Nomenclature of Statistical Territorial Units\u2019 (NUTS) and statistics collected in the framework of the \u201cUrban Audit\u201d. Both sets of data are described in the \u2018 European Regional and Urban Statistics Reference Guide \u2019 (2009). The NUTS classification is based on Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 May 2003 on the establishment of a common classification of territorial units for statistics (NUTS) . Since its adoption, the NUTS Regulation has been amended several times, following changes in the administrative regions in the Member States and enlargement of the European Union. The most recent amendment, Regulation (EC) No 176/2008 , followed the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the EU. NUTS is a good example of a classification which divides countries into spatial areas based on an administrative/ institutional concept. This concept requires appropriate administrative structures. NUTS is a three-level hierarchical classification, subdividing each country covered (all EU member states and some other European countries) into three NUTS categories (NUTS 1, NUTS 2 and NUTS 3), with each lower level fitting exactly in all levels above (more details in Box 18.1). Box 18.1: The NUTS classification \u2013 definition of levels NUTS subdivides each EU member state into a number of regions at NUTS 1 level. Each of these is then subdivided into regions at NUTS level 2, and these in turn into regions at NUTS level 3. Leaving aside the local level (municipalities), the internal administrative structure of the Member States is generally based on two of these three main regional levels. This existing national administrative structure may be, for example, at NUTS 1 and NUTS 3 levels (e.g. the L\u00e4nder and Kreise in Germany), or at NUTS 2 and NUTS 3 ( r\u00e9gions and d\u00e9partements in France and Comunidades aut\u00f3nomas and provincias in Spain). Providing a complete breakdown, i.e. at all three NUTS levels, therefore means identifying a regional level for each Member State in addition to the two main levels mentioned above. This additional level thus corresponds to a regional structure that is less extensively used for administrative purposes \u2014 or which may indeed be instituted solely for this statistical purpose, without having any administrative function whatsoever. Depending on which levels already exist, the additional level may be created at the missing of these three NUTS levels. France, for example, has functional administrative units at levels 2 and 3, thus the additional level is introduced at NUTS level 1. By contrast, the additional \u201cnon-administrative\u201d level is at NUTS level 2 for Germany and the United Kingdom and at NUTS level 3 for Belgium. The NUTS Regulation lays down the following minimum and maximum population thresholds for the average size of the NUTS regions: Level Minimum Maximum NUTS 1 3 million 7 million NUTS 2 800 000 3 million NUTS 3 150 000 800 000 All levels are defined according to administrative boundaries, which have to be appropriate and stable. Appropriate boundaries give the guarantee that these are accepted by the people administered, as well as homogeneity and a suitable size of the unit. Stable boundaries permit data collection over a longer period (time series) and more meaningful units. However, administrative reforms in countries might lead to a disruption of this pattern. For the definition of regions, it has to be considered that political power is often highly centralised. ",
        "D 296 Regional and Small Area Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Box 18.2 How to apply a nomenclature of territorial units There are several stages in applying a regional classification to a particular country. First, the administrative structure of the country has to be analysed. Next, a check has to be made of whether regional data are collected and disseminated on the basis of this regional breakdown, which is often the case. The average size (mainly in terms of population) of the units of the existing administrative levels is then analysed, in order to determine where these administrative levels should be placed in the nomenclature hierarchy. There are two possible outcomes: The average size of the level examined corresponds more or less \u2022 to one of the nomenclature levels. In this case, the administrative structure in question could be adopted in its entirety, without change, as the statistical regional breakdown at this level. Of course, given the historical development of the regional structure, this may mean that the size of individual units in the country differs considerably from the average/typical size of units registered at this nomenclature level; No administrative structure has an average size similar to the typical \u2022 average for this level of the nomenclature; in this case an ad hoc breakdown, called \u201cnon-administrative units\u201d , is constructed by grouping together existing smaller administrative units. As there are no historical constraints on this regional breakdown, much closer attention has to be paid to whether all of these regions comply with the population thresholds defined in the territorial unit nomenclature. The principles of the European NUTS classifications are well established and have a solid methodological basis. These principles provide a very useful starting point for developing classifications of spatial units elsewhere. Box 18.3: Small areas below NUTS 3 level \u2013 SIRE data- base SIRE (European infra-regional information system) is a dataset, maintained by Eurostat, on regional levels below the lowest NUTS level. SIRE consists of a classification for local administrative units (LAU levels 1 and 2 ) below NUTS level 3 and statistical data from population censuses. The dataset is not publicly available. Since there are frequent changes to the local administrative units, there is a need to follow its development from year to year. Some countries make very frequent changes to their LAUs, while others virtually never change them. No attempt is made to link data from different censuses in any comprehensive manner. Links to the regional NUTS levels are stored in the SIRE database. SIRE contains statistical data from the population and housing censuses with updates every 10 years. Censuses are not held on the same date in every Member State. The time lag between the earliest census in a particular round and the last is about three years. The new Census Regulation (EC) No 763/2008 obliges Member States to submit data for numerous essential population and housing topics at LAU level 2. The Urban Audit The Urban Audit is another example of a dataset containing data on a lower level than the lowest level of NUTS. It covers urban spatial units and collects data with a direct or indirect reference to a specific location or geographical area. Data collected in this project may already exist in databases of NSIs or administrative registers or they may have to be collected from the cities directly. The Urban Audit Reference Guide gives detailed information on the dataset and the variables collected. Urban Audit statistics contain data collected on a voluntary basis for more than 300 cities in European countries both within and outside the EU. The data collection is based on the Urban Audit Methodological Handbook and the \u2018European Regional and Urban Statistics Reference Guide 2009\u2019. Eurostat coordinates the Urban Audit through a network of national coordinators (normally in the NSIs). The methodology of the Urban Audit has been developed to across diverse cities and across diverse countries; it should form a strong basis for developing urban statistics also in other parts of the world. The Urban Audit system distinguishes between three different levels of urban spatial units: \u201cCentral\u201d or \u201ccore city\u201d, i.e. the administrative unit; \u2022 \u201cLarger urban zone\u201d (LUZ) is used to gather information \u2022 that also covers the hinterland of a city; and \u201cSub-city districts\u201d (SCD), taking intra-urban discrepancies \u2022 into account. In general, a \u201ccity\u201d can be designated as an urban settlement (morphological or functional concept) or as a legal entity (administrative or normative concept). The Urban Audit mainly uses the latter concept and defines the \u201ccore city\u201d according to political and administrative boundaries. Since there are a number of key variables which cannot be sensibly limited to the boundaries of the \u201ccore city\u201d (e.g. air pollution), the spatial level is extended to the \u201clarger urban zone\u201d, which is defined in terms of commuter flows (i.e. a functional region). It includes the \u201ccore-city\u201d and the so-called \u201ccommuter belt\u201d. \u201cSub-city districts\u201d are the different parts of a core city. Data about these sub-entities enable analysis of disparities within a core-city. ",
        "D 297 Regional and Small Area Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Variables to be collected Both regional and small area statistics should contain a basic set of core variables, providing required background information for definition and implementation of regional development programmes. A further aspect is the monitoring and evaluation of the results of programmes launched (e.g. financial assistance for candidate and potential candidate countries, EDF community aid for development in ACP countries). Especially regional accounts data (namely GDP per head in a region) is used to define regions in need of development support and specific actions. The core data at regional level comprise demographic, economic accounts, agriculture, education and labour market statistics. For further details on these statistical areas, see the specific chapters, e.g. chapter D.13 Business statistics, chapter D.17 Agricultural, forestry and fishery statistics, chapter D.28 Social protection statistics, etc. Other regional or small area data could be collected to respond to explicit policy priorities for regional development and cohesion, applying the concepts and definitions for data collection described. For further discussion of correspondence between development strategies and statistics, see chapter C.6.1. Collection of data for small areas is of high importance if it is impossible to collect an indicator/variable nationwide. This is for example the case when data are collected using gauging stations (e.g. precipitation amount, waste collected, measurement of ozone concentrations). The main characteristic for this kind of data is that they cannot always be aggregated to national levels. Box 18.4: Small area estimations There is an increasing need for small area statistics within governments for policy making and distribution of funds. Official statistics produced in an NSIs cannot always cope with these needs. Due to several constraints (e.g. lack of human and financial resources, lack of administrative sources such as registers, etc.), NSIs are sometimes unable to produce the quality and quantity of small area statistics demanded by using standard survey methods. Small area estimation methods get around this problem by making use of model-based or model-assisted techniques to predict the values of target variables at small area level. However, the use of the methods developed for small area estimations require very good knowledge of applied statistics. Small area estimation is any statistical technique involving the estimation of parameters for small sub-populations, generally used when the sub-population of interest is included in a larger survey. In this context, the term \u00absmall area\u00bb generally refers to a small geographical area such as a county. It may also refer to a \u00absmall domain\u00bb, i.e. a particular part of a population within an area. A nation- wide survey normally has very few (if any) observations in each small area. To provide estimates of the variable(s) of interest for each of these small areas, advanced statistical methods are applied. These often involve using information from previous surveys in the region, from similar or neighbouring regions and/or any other useful auxiliary information (e.g. from population and housing registers, tax registers, etc.) The availability of such information varies greatly from country to country, thus the small area estimation methods must always be adapted to the national setting. Methods for small area estimations are subject to intensive research. European researchers and NSIs are at the forefront of this research area. An important research project at European level was EURAREA (Enhancing small area estimation techniques to meet European needs). EURAREA brought together experts from academic institutions and NSIs, carrying out substantial methodological development, as well as testing and simulation with real data from the NSIs. Key conclusions of the EURAREA project were: At NUTS 3 level: model-based estimators achieve comparable or \u2022 slightly better levels of precision than design-based estimators; At LAU level: model-based estimators \u2022 substantially outperform design-based methods, even when the models have fairly limited predictive power; The gain from using model-based methods increases substantially \u2022 with the availability of explanatory covariates that are highly correlated with the target variable. Software routines for small area estimation, developed by NSIs in the EURAREA project, are available for free download from the download section of the EURAREA website (zipped SAS programme code files with PDF documentation).

        "D 298 Regional and Small Area Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 D.18.3. Sources of regional data There are two main internationally recognised classifications for regional and small area statistics: the NUTS classification of the European Union and the regional statistics system of the OECD. However, for most EU countries the OECD classification is identical to NUTS. Both systems can be used to define regions and small areas. For the small area level (below NUTS 3 level), the European Union uses two different systems: a combined functional/administrative approach applied for the Urban Audit dataset and purely administrative approach (LAU 1 and 2) in line with the NUTS classification. Within the European Union, the NSIs collect and provide regional statistics according to the NUTS-system. The OECD, on the other hand, \u201cregionalises\u201d the data according its own classification (see Box 18.5). Box 18.5: Other examples of regional typologies/clas- sifications OECD regional database The OECD regional database is a source of statistical information at sub-national territorial level for all OECD countries. It is based on a functional approach and currently encompasses time-series for around 40 indicators on demography, economic accounts, labour market, social and innovation themes. For EU member states, all this data is sourced from Eurostat\u2019s database. In any analytical study conducted at sub-national levels, the choice of the territorial unit is of prime importance. Regions in OECD Member Countries have been classified according to two territorial levels (using the administrative concept) to facilitate international comparability. The higher level (Territorial level 2) consists of macro-regions, while the lower level (Territorial level 3) is composed of micro-regions in the OECD member countries. These levels are officially established, relatively stable and correspond in most countries to the levels used for implementing regional policies. For most EU countries the OECD classification is identical to NUTS. Regions of OECD member countries have been classified into Predominantly Urban, Intermediate and Predominantly Rural regions to take into account the geographical differences among them. Comparing the socio-economic performance of regions of the same type (whether urban or rural) across countries is useful in detecting similar characteristics and development paths. This typology has been used by the OECD in its analytical work (see, for example, the series OECD Regions at a Glance ), as well as in analysis carried out by other institutions, such as NSIs and the European Commission. ESPON typology compilation ESPON (European Spatial Planning Observation Network) is a programme under the EU structural funds initiative European Territorial Co-operation objective . The aim of the program is a European applied research network which observes the spatial development of the European Union. It intends to provide policy makers on the European, national and regional level with knowledge on territorial trends and impacts of spatial policies. Amongst many subjects, ESPON has also carried out research on functional typologies , e.g. on rural and urban areas and on cross-border regions. D.18.4. Analysing data quality and identifying problems Regional and small area statistics cover many statistical domains of different nature and structure. They range from economic and social statistics to environmental statistics and cover a large number of human activities. The quality of regional data relies first of all on a harmonised regional classification and secondly on the quality of data and statistics used as input. Generally, more than one institution or body is involved in gathering data at regional and small area level. In principle, all these institutions, at all levels from local to national, have (or should have) developed their own procedures to ensure the quality of the data they are collecting and the statistics they are producing. Good quality and reliable indicators should meet some basic and inter-related criteria. Thus, quality check procedures have to be developed and implemented at the different levels of the data collection chain, from the data acquisition to the final compilation. In this context, the most important validation rule for regional and small area statistics is that the sum of data from a lower regional level should (in general) not exceed the value at the higher regional level. This rule applies for all absolute values. For example, the value of the sum of the population reported by all communities (lower level) in a district cannot be larger than the value for the total population reported for the same period by the district (level directly above). However, this principle does not always work in practice. In the case of ratios (indices, etc.), such as regional gross domestic product per inhabitant, the value for a lower level (e.g. city or municipality) can be either bigger or smaller than the value for the next higher level(s). In such cases, other data validation checks should be applied, such as standard deviation, lower and upper thresholds around a mean, etc. The following main quality criteria should be considered (see also sections B.2.1.2 and chapter C.5): Reliability of input data: in the case of administrative data, \u2022 this is in general controllable. In the case of survey data, it depends on a number of factors; the training, experience and motivation of the staff involved is one of the key factors. It is important that the staff is motivated and equipped to carry out the survey(s) with the highest possible accuracy. Other key factors for the quality range from the quality of the sampling frame (e.g. population register), via the survey design to data processing and analysis. Representativeness and completeness: the indicator \u2022 integrates all input data needed in terms of spatial coverage and reference period(s), of the phenomena (variables) that are being addressed. Consistency and coherence: the indicator should be \u2022 consistent over time and coherent (i.e. not in contradiction with other related indicators or statistics). For regional ",
        "D 299 Regional and Small Area Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 statistics based on normative regional units, national reforms of the administrative structure and changes in the administrative regions will lead to breaks in the time series. When such reforms mainly involve merging small administrative regions (e.g. municipalities) inside the larger regions, this has limited impact. Larger-scale changes in the major regions or redefinitions of the whole system of administrative regions will cause severe breaks in the comparability of regional statistics over time. Comparability: this is ensured when the same principles \u2022 are applied for defining all regions surveyed and all regions apply the same definitions of the collected variables. A critical factor for regional statistics is that the regions at the same level of the classification are of comparable size (in terms of population). Traceability: reliable and full documentation is of utmost \u2022 importance when updating or repeating an exercise, e.g. for another reference year. Any suspicious changes in data should be explained by the metadata information. This meta-information makes it possible to compare data and shows divergence in the concepts of data collection, which is necessary for the interpretation of data. D.18.5. Improving regional statistics As mentioned earlier, more than one institution might be involved throughout the process of data collection at regional level. However, in many countries institutional structures are not settled or are subject to frequent changes. Another critical issue is the identification of indicators of interest. Often, from a theoretical viewpoint, a large number of different indicators could be collected. In practice, it is not realistic or even necessary to generate all of them. The selection of indicators depends on the need (of national institutions, donors and others) for information at regional and local levels of the country. In many cases, the selection is also influenced by which data are already available in the country. A careful selection of appropriate indicators should be carried out, based on the priorities for regional policies and actions and on the particular subject of interest at regional level. The data collected should at least have a high level of comparability within a country, and preferably between countries. One main objective of regional statistics should be to establish a regional classification comparable with that of other countries (at least the countries in the same geographical area, e.g. West Africa), enabling meaningful comparisons of regions between countries as well as within the same country. Once such a classification is established, it should be kept unchanged over a longer period of time in order to get reliable datasets for analysis of longer-term developments in the individual regions. The principles of the European NUTS classifications are well established and have a solid methodological basis; NUTS may well inspire nomenclatures of spatial units in other parts of the world. Once a classification of regions is established, the main variables required for evaluating the socio-economic development in the regions needs to be defined. This basic dataset (ideally covering several subsequent years) should be subject to steady improvement (e.g. data for the most recent year to be added on an annual basis and filling data gaps for previous years) and extension with variables to meet the information requirements of new policy areas. In order to achieve a good quality level in regional statistics, it is necessary to cooperate with different institutions (different responsibilities) involved. These bodies may not have experience in working together and/or authority of sharing information. Coordination and connection channels may need to be established in order to ensure effective sharing of data and information. This may require the development of memoranda of understanding or other formal arrangements for the cooperation with regional public services. In regional statistics, a good cooperation with regional bodies is also valuable for improving quality. Such bodies have in- depth knowledge of their region and can be of very good help in verifying statistical results and to detect problems in the data. Another way of improving regional statistics is to identify auxiliary data that can be used as basis for estimations at regional level, for calibrating the survey data, for complementing the indicators or for verifying results.

Government finance and public sector statistics The chapter in brief This chapter covers statistics on the finances of government and public sector, informing fiscal policy both at national and sub-national level. The methodology of the budget compilation at national or sub- national (regional, local) level varies from country to country. It may also be modified from year to year. Thus, data taken directly from the national budgets may not be directly usable for international comparison. In some instances, time series within the same country are also not comparable. Therefore, there are advantages in the use of statistical methodology over the use of budget data, as the statistical methodology provides a unified and transparent tool for macroeconomic analysis of fiscal processes. The different principles of government budgeting and accounting are explained. The difference between government finance statistics and public financial management is also clarified. Practical advice is given on how to develop government finance statistics in developing countries. In particular, this advice relates to different types of public budgeting, emphasising comparability across countries and over time. The chapter also touches upon the problem of how to measure the level and volumes of government services. This is a crucial issue for evaluating the efficiency of public services. D.19.1. Policy applications: what this data is used for There are a number of important reasons for the great interest in government finance and public sector statistics: Governments redistribute a large part of the national \u2022 income through the budget, so it is important to know for which policy purposes/fields the money is spent. The level and the composition of the tax burden is a key \u2022 area for policy making and analysis. Governments are usually good debtors; they are able \u2022 to absorb liquid financial assets, crowding out private investors. In developing countries, the availability of reliable fiscal \u2022 statistics is a central element for development planning. Public debt is a burden for coming generations. This is why \u2022 public deficits and debt levels should be kept under strict control, so that a sustainable fiscal position is maintained in the long term. The liabilities of social security pensions are another (implicit) burden for future generations. The public sector is a large employer; its behaviour has a \u2022 significant impact on employment and wages at national level. In many countries, government debt is mainly financed by \u2022 foreign investors. Thus, the level of government deficit and debt may influence international financial markets. In recent years, policy interest in improving the efficiency \u2022 and productivity of government services has been growing. For this purpose, there needs to be a value set for the output of government services. D.19.2. Concepts and definitions D.19.2.1. Accounting principles: Cash basis versus accrual basis There are two different accounting principles used in budgets and by budget units, cash basis accounting and accrual basis accounting. National budgets are usually compiled on cash basis; this is generally the case in developing countries. Cash basis The cash basis of accounting recognizes transactions and events only when cash is received or paid by the budget unit. For example, under the cash basis the payment of current income tax is recorded when the payment is actually done, usually some months after the end of the reference year. A budget based on cash basis only records monetary flows. Financial statements prepared under the cash basis provide information on the sources of cash raised during the period, the purposes for which cash was used and the cash balances at the reporting date. The financial statements focus on measuring cash balances and the changes in them. Notes to these financial statements may provide additional information about liabilities and some non-cash assets. Under the cash basis, the payments of government debt are recorded when interest or down- payments are actually paid. Under cash basis accounting, debt is only captured for debt service and \u201cdrawing\u201d (i.e. raising cash by taking up debt, issuing government bonds, etc.). In other words, current transactions are captured, liabilities not. In order to assess a country\u2019s ability to handle further borrowing, separate records are needed to keep trace of the nominal value of the country\u2019s debt stock. Debt management and reporting is a critical issue in many developing countries, not only in the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) . The International Public Sector Accounting Standard (IPSAS) for Cash Basis details the financial reporting under the cash basis of accounting in the public sector. Accrual basis Under the accrual basis of accounting, transactions and events are recorded when amounts to be paid are built up. For example, the payment of current income tax is recorded within the reference year, when the income is earned. Interest payments on the government\u2019s debts are recorded when the payable amounts are built up. Accrual accounting also covers non-monetary transactions, such as distribution of goods or assets free of charge, the assumption or cancellation of debt. ",
        "D 304 Government Finance and Public Sector Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Accrual accounting is often considered the best basis for analysing enterprises, measuring cost, income and net worth. However, cash based accounts are useful for example for purposes such as liquidity management. It is possible to adjust from cash based to accrual based financial statements or the other way. Although the main guidelines for government finance apply accrual accounting (see section D.19.2.2. below), even developed countries often use cash basis accounting in their national budgets. However, more and more countries move towards accrual accounting, based on international accounting standards and recommendations. In any case, a good cash based system must be in place first of all. Such a move should be a part of overall reform and not an end in itself, and each step should be useful in itself. D.19.2.2. Guidelines for government finance statistics Government has special power, motivations and functions in the economy; this is reflected in the statistical methodology of government finance. At the same time, government activities have a great influence on the economy; to follow this impact, the methodology of government finance is consistent and coherent with the rules of national accounting. Two main internationally accepted government finance guidelines exist. One is the Government Finance Statistics (GFS) , prepared by the IMF. The second methodology is the European System of Accounts (ESA) , managed by Eurostat, and its supplementary detailed regulations for the accounting of the performance of the government sectors. ESA is based on the UN\u2019s System of National Accounts (SNA) . The presentation of the two systems is different, but the stocks and flows are defined and valued in the same way. The balancing items are either identical, or can easily be deducted from each other. The conceptual differences are of minor importance. In addition, the International Public Sector Accounting Standards Board (IPSASB) publishes International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS), both for cash basis accounting and accrual accounting in the public sector. All IPSASs are contained in the 2010 IFAC Handbook of International Public Sector Accounting Pronouncements . The IMF, the European Union and the IPSASB work to eliminate as many differences as possible. However, it is inevitable that some differences will remain because the purposes of the various reports are different. Example of minor differences between GFS and ESA The GFS does not record separately the value of financial services paid as part of the \u2018interest margin\u2019, i.e. the difference between the bank interest rate charged for credits and the interest rate paid on deposits. This item is called FISIM: Financial Intermediation Services Indirectly Measured. D.19.2.3. The coverage of the government sector and of the public sector In government finance statistics, economic criteria are used to define the government sector, not legal criteria. This means that the coverage of the government sector in government finance statistics does not necessarily coincide with the coverage of the official budget. Thus, the definition of the government sector for statistics is: The Government sector consists of entities/institutional \u2022 units that implement public policy, through the provision of non-market services and/or through the redistribution of income and wealth (this redistribution is regarded as a form of provision of non-market services.) Two criteria decide whether an institutional unit belongs to the government sector or not. The units in the government sector: should be non-market producers, and \u2022 should be controlled by the government. \u2022 Production is called \u2018non-market\u2019 if the majority of the production costs are not covered by market sales, but financed from other sources. \u2018Control\u2019 is the ability to determine the general policy or program of an institutional unit. Box 19.1: The government sector and the public sector In statistics, the government sector usually differs from the set of units covered by the national and sub-national budgets. Universities, the national broadcasting agency, or units engaged in public transport investments (road development) are good examples of borderline cases; these units are outside the budget, but are mainly financed directly from government sources and controlled by government units. The public sector consists of all institutional units controlled by government entities: that is, the government sector plus those corporations in which the government owns the majority of equity. Public transport companies, public utilities etc. usually belong to the public sector. Currently, only a few countries compile statistics on the public sector. Depending on administrative and legal arrangements, there may be more than one level of government within a country. In public finance statistics, a maximum of three levels of government is defined: central government, state/regional government and local government. Social security funds may be treated as a separate subsector. In some countries, the budget only covers a general fund, without institutional coverage. In such a case, only taxes, social contributions and dividends (if applicable) are recorded on the revenues side. The expenditures are classified as transfers, grants within levels of government and interest payments. In this case, wages and salaries of government employees are ",
        "D 305 Government Finance and Public Sector Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 not recorded separately but included in the total amount of transfers. In order to compile government finance statistics, data are required both for the institutions included in the budget and for other units classified to the government sector. The unit types that should be included in the statistics on the government sector are: General government State (budgetary core unit) \u2022 On-budget entities: budgetary institutions, budgeted \u2022 funds Off-budget entities: budgetary institutions, extra-budgetary \u2022 funds Public corporations and non-profit units, controlled and \u2022 mainly financed from government sources Public non-financial and financial corporations, controlled by government Central bank (only for central government) \u2022 Public financial corporations, controlled by central, state/ \u2022 regional or local government Non-financial corporations, controlled by central, state/ \u2022 regional or local government For Social security funds, treated as a separate subsector: Social security funds \u2022 Fund managers \u2022 D.19.2.2. The analytic framework The complete public finance statistics comprise the balance sheet at the beginning and end of the year, as well as the accounts that record the changes of the balance sheets (flows) during the year. On the asset side, the value of financial and non-financial assets is presented. The liability side shows the value of government liabilities. Net worth is the difference between the value of assets and liabilities. Example The value of the stocks of government-owned buildings may change during the year due to: New buildings are constructed \u2022 Existing buildings are sold or demolished \u2022 The value of the buildings increases because of inflation \u2022 The value of the buildings declines as a result of physical \u2022 deterioration and of being obsolete. Many countries are not yet able to compile the complete balance sheet, because it is a difficult process to value non- financial assets. In many developing countries, the problems may be even more basic: a first challenge and priority may be simply to have a comprehensive and up-to-date asset register available. A central issue in developing countries is to assure that the basics are in place and functioning. Government debt Government debt is the sum of all liabilities of the general government sector. It is valued at market value. Usually, consolidated figures are reported: treasury bills and bonds held by local governments are consolidated and interest payments on them netted out. For analytical purposes, domestic debt and foreign/external debt should be distinguished. In statistics, foreign debt is defined as debt held by non-resident entities; in practice, debt is normally labelled according to the currency in which it is denominated. Debt should be classified also according to maturity: a high share of short term debt may cause difficulties in liquidity management. In the case of negotiable debt, the difference between the nominal and market value may be significant. Box 19.2: Capacity building and training in govern- ment debt statistics The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has established a Debt Management and Financial Analysis System (DMFAS) programme , providing technical cooperation and advisory services in debt management. The programme helps governments to improve their capacity to manage debt and has worked directly with a large number of low and lower-middle income countries. The DMFAS programme is a concrete example of how capacity is built at country level, in support of good governance, development and poverty reduction. It provides countries with the means to improve their management of public liabilities, and consequently public resources, through the strengthening of their institutional capacity in this area. The programme builds capacity not only through UNCTAD\u2019s DMFAS software, but also through increased human and institutional capacity to manage the operational, statistical and analytical aspects of debt management. The capacity-building is delivered through in- country and regional training, including debt validation, debt statistics and debt portfolio analysis. To formulate effective debt strategies, one must build a comprehensive debt database. On this basis, reliable reports and statistics can be produced and analysis carried out. DMFAS encourages south\u2013south cooperation and sharing best practices. It regularly uses proficient DMFAS users from developing countries to train new users in other developing countries. Revenue and expenditure Government finance statistics present government operations in the same way as they are presented in the budget. Government revenue and expense are defined as: Revenue \u2022 is all transactions that increase the net worth of the government sector Expense \u2022 is all transactions that decrease the net worth of the government sector. ",
        "D 306 Government Finance and Public Sector Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 The main types of government revenue are: taxes, social security contributions, dividends from public companies, grants from abroad. Taxes and social security contributions are defined as compulsory transfers to the government, without direct service in return. In fiscal analysis, tax revenue plus compulsory social security contribution as a per cent of GDP is called fiscal burden . In ESA and GFS, the classification of taxes is different. The ESA has provisions for compilation of (i) taxes on production and imports; (ii) current taxes on income, wealth, etc.; (iii) capital taxes. The GFS classifies taxes according to the base on which the tax is levied. Six major groups are defined: (i) taxes on income, profits and capital gains; (ii) taxes on payroll and workforce; (iii) taxes on property; (iv) taxes on goods and services; (v) taxes on international transactions; (vi) other taxes. The main types of government expense are: salaries and wages for government employees; purchase of goods and services for providing government services; social benefits paid to households; interest paid on government debt; subsidies to enterprises. Social benefits are provided as social insurance or as social assistance. Whereas social insurance is a collective scheme that requires membership, social assistance is provided by government based on specified social needs (statistics on social protection is covered in more detail in chapter D.28). The social insurance system operated by the government is called social security. Employers or insurance companies may operate other forms of social insurance. The contribution to and benefits from the social security system is divided between pensions and all other forms of insurance. Social security pensions are frequently funded on a pay-as-you-go basis; the contributions received in a period are used to fund the benefits paid in the same period. There is therefore no saving recorded, neither for the government nor for the individuals participating in the scheme. An important concern is that the benefits may exceed the contributions and that the situation will worsen when the population ages. There may be a great variety of other forms of pension schemes (see the System of National Accounts 2008 , Chapter 17, Part 2). Balancing items The balancing items are the difference between revenue and expense. Three core balancing items are used as measures for fiscal policy: Net \u2022 and gross operating balance equals total revenue minus total expense. The gross operating balance excludes depreciation costs from the expense (the value of the depreciation of fixed assets is difficult to measure). Net lending/borrowing \u2022 equals the operating balance minus the acquisition of non-financial assets. In other terms, net lending/borrowing also equals the difference between new financial assets and new debts. Primary balance \u2022 equals net lending/borrowing minus interest paid on debts. The ESA uses the category expenditure: expenditure includes all transactions that worsen net lending/borrowing. On other words, expenditure equals expense plus the acquisition of non-financial assets. Revenue Expense Balancing item Total revenue Total expense Operating balance Total revenue Total expense + acquisition of non- financial assets Net lending / borrowing Total revenue Total expense + acquisition of non- financial assets \u2013 interest paid Primary balance Beside these core balances, a number of other balance concepts may be used for policy analysis. The most frequently used are: Cash surplus/deficit \u2022 : the net cash inflow from operating activities, minus the net cash outflow from investments in non-financial assets; Overall fiscal balance \u2022 : net lending/borrowing, adjusted by items that are for public policy purposes. For example, subsidies given in the form of loans would be recognised as an expense; Adjusted overall fiscal balance \u2022 : overall fiscal balance, adjusted to exclude from the revenue any grants and other large and infrequent transactions that could distort the fiscal analysis. A detailed classification of expenditure is crucial for fiscal analysis. Two classifications are used in combination: An economic classification and a functional classification. The economic classification identifies the different types of expenses/expenditure for providing \u2018non-market products\u2019 (public services and goods) and for redistribution of income (taxes, social benefits, grants, subsidies). The functional classification identifies the social or economic purpose of the expense/expenditure. The OECD has developed the Classification of the Functions of Government (COFOG) system. At the first level of COFOG, 10 divisions are distinguished: General public services; \u2022 Defence; \u2022 Public order and safety; \u2022 ",
        "D 307 Government Finance and Public Sector Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Economic affairs; \u2022 Environmental protection; \u2022 Housing and community affairs; \u2022 Health; \u2022 Recreation, culture and religion; \u2022 Education; \u2022 Social protection. \u2022 Consolidation Consolidation ignores (or nets out) certain flows and stocks between the units belonging to the same sector. As a general rule, the entries in the ESA are not consolidated. The GFS, on the other hand, prefers consolidation. Consolidation usually involves the elimination of stocks and flows in debtor-creditor relationship. For example, that central government securities owned by local governments are not included in the consolidated government debt. Thus, intergovernmental interest payments are also excluded. Current and capital transfers paid between subsectors of government may also be netted out. For analytical purposes, consolidated figures for the government are more relevant: they present the relation of the government as a whole to the national economy. Consolidated figures for revenue and expense are significantly lower than unconsolidated figures. Data for the public sector could be presented in two ways: public corporations as a separate sector, or consolidated with the general government. D.19.3. Sources of data and metadata With some minor exceptions, government finance statistics rely on administrative sources. Important sources are the annual and quarterly reports of budget units and the data of the report on execution of the annual budget. In developing countries, this may already be a challenge. Data on taxes and social contributions come from the tax authorities. In most countries the State Treasury manages all cash transactions of the budget units. This data source is appropriate mainly for short-term statistics. Often, a special unit manages the financing of the government debt, providing data on government bonds and treasury bills and the interest paid on them. Government finance follows the accounting principle of \u2018substance over form\u2019. Thus, certain transactions in the budget are: Netted (e.g. netting of VAT flows of government units) or \u2022 grossed (e.g. of the net cash flow of two transactions in different directions). Imputed (e.g. social benefits provided by government \u2022 employers to their employees in a nature, similar to social security benefits); Re-routed (e.g. social security contributions paid by \u2022 government employers are presented as if they were paid as wages and employees then pay them into the social security system). These statistical adjustments require extra data collection if the budget accounting is on a pure cash basis. Fiscal transparency and public sector accounting standards require that the accounting rules and accounting basis attached are disclosed. Data availability A comprehensive set of fiscal data for developing countries is collected by the IMF. The Statement of Government Operations (SOGO) and supplementary tables are published in the IMF Government Finance Statistics Yearbook . SOGO provides the main aggregates of transactions, like revenue and current expenses and net acquisition of non-financial assets. Statistical discrepancy is presented, between the value of net-lending-borrowing compiled from current and capital accounts on one hand and as the balance of financial accounts on the other. The share of this discrepancy to total expenses may indicate the reliability of the estimates. Most developing countries do not report a complete balance sheet for SOGO; data on the stock of non-financial assets are often missing. The amount of liabilities corresponds more or less to gross debt. Data and methodological notes on IMF Government Finance Statistics (GFS) are available on the IMF website. Box 19.3: Metadata for government finance statistics The IMF\u2019s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) provides guidance for the overall development of macroeconomic, financial, and socio-demographic data. Through the GDDS framework, countries are encouraged to improve data quality, evaluate needs for data improvement and set priorities in this respect, and disseminate reliable statistics (see also Box 5.9). One of the data categories covered by GDDS is government finance statistics. For many developing countries, key metadata for government finance statistics (e.g. who is responsible for compilation, accounting basis, key classifications, plans for improvements, etc.) can be found under \u2018Fiscal statistics\u2019 on the IMF GDDS topics website . However, this information may be out-of-date. The IMF and AFRISTAT GDDS project for West Africa covered ten countries, including members of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA). A program of activities on government finance statistics was developed in response to countries\u2019 requests, relating mainly to expansion of the coverage of government financial operations tables (TOFE) and its harmonization with regional standards, restoration of capacity to compile and disseminate GFS, and training of officials. Furthermore, courses and regional workshops on the implementation of the 2001 Government Finance Statistics Manual were organised. ",

Analysing data quality and iden- tifying problems The quality of statistics on government finances and the public sector critically depends on the quality of government and public finance management (PFM) and the accounting principles and practices. PFM and frameworks for assessing and improving PFM are not the same as government finance statistics. However, government finance statistics use data from government budgets and accounts. Therefore, weaknesses and quality problems of PFM are directly reflected in government finance statistics, causing problems in preparing accurate and internationally comparable statistics. However, PFM and frameworks for assessing and improving PFM are outside the scope of this chapter. Because fiscal policy plays a central role in promoting development, the methodology of fiscal management in developing countries is regularly scrutinised by international organisations. There are various diagnostic and assessment methodologies for Public Financial Management (PFM), specifically suited to developing countries. These methodologies do not concern the system of government finance statistics directly, but the quality of PFM does influence the availability, integrity, timeliness and other characteristics of the sources used to compile government finance statistics. Box 19.4: The Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability methodology The Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) methodology for assessing public finance management is a modern and up-to-date initiative. PEFA has been applied to more than 60 countries through collaboration of local authorities and donor institutions. PEFA examines the country practices from the following dimensions: Credibility of the budget: the budget is realistic and implemented \u2022 as intended; Comprehensiveness and transparency: the fiscal risk is highlighted \u2022 and information available to the public; Predictability and control in the budget execution: the budget is \u2022 implemented in an orderly manner; Accounting, auditing and reporting: adequate information is \u2022 produced and disseminated to meet control, management and reporting purposes; External scrutiny and audit. \u2022 The PEFA PFM framework uses 28 indicators, scored on a scale from A (highest) to D (lowest).It is structured into the categories: Comparing actual expenses and revenues to the original approved \u2022 budget; Comprehensiveness and transparency of the PFM system; \u2022 Budget cycle: performance of key systems, processes and \u2022 institutions within central government. The framework also assesses donor practices and the extent to which they affect the PFM performance. There are several indicators that have direct relevance for assessing the quality of public finance statistics. Using the codes of PEFA, some of the most important indicators are: (PI-5) Classification in the budget: whether the budget applies administrative, economic and functional classification and the content of the classes are documented; (PI-6) Comprehensiveness of information included in the budget: if all revenue and expense of budget units are covered; (PI-7) Extent of unreported government operations: It may happen that extra-budgetary funds are not included in the budget. Government finance statistics should cover those funds as well; (PI-8) Transparency of inter-governmental fiscal relations: the existence of regular information flows among budget units is a precondition of providing short\u2013term and annual statistics; (PI-9) Oversight of aggregate fiscal risk from other public sector entities: such entities should either be classified to the government sector, or the transactions should be rerouted through the government sector; (PI-10) Public access to key fiscal information; (PI-24) Quality and timeliness of in-year budget reports; (PI-25) Quality and timeliness of annual financial statements. The indicators PI-7, PI-9, PI-26 and D-2 cover in part activities of central government implemented outside the budget. ",
        "D 309 Government Finance and Public Sector Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 The Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) programme was a forerunner to PEFA. It was a joint initiative of the World Bank, IMF and regional development banks, launched in 1996. HIPC uses 15 benchmarks to assess the budget management and to what extent the country is able to plan and execute programs and report on results. These benchmarks assess: the comprehensiveness of the budget, \u2022 the classifications used in the budget and to what extent \u2022 poverty-reducing expenditure are identified, the quality of multi-year expenditure projections, \u2022 the quality of internal audit, and \u2022 the timeliness of reporting. \u2022 Another diagnostic tool to assess strengths and weaknesses in a country\u2019s PFM system is the Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) , developed by the World Bank. Its purpose is to assess and manage the risk that public funds may be used for non-intended purposes: identify the key risks, capacity gaps and constraints to progress; help the government develop a strategy for reform; and assist in designing a program to improve financial management capacity in the public and private sectors. The scope and level of the CFAA\u2019s coverage takes account of the country\u2019s size, stage of development, and relationship with development partners. The website of the African Development Bank contains a number of CFAA country reports , both for African and other countries. IMF regularly assesses the quality of government finance statistics, concerning timeliness, completeness, reliability, accessibility and consistency with statistical methodology. For more information and for country reports, see IMF\u2019s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) website. However, SDDS mainly covers developed and countries and countries in transition. More information can also be found in section B.2.4.1 and section C.5.3 of this Guide. Measuring productivity and efficiency of government services raises important quality challenges. One has to establish quality-adjusted output measures, expressed mainly in physical terms. \u2018 Total output in constant value \u2019 is defined as the sum of these quantity indicators, combined using weights that reflect the costs of producing them. The output indicators should be defined in sufficient detail to ensure that they are kept homogeneous in time. Health and education are the two areas where quantity indicators are most easily available. Government accounts do not use outcome indicators, but for policy analysis they may be more relevant than output measures. The efficiency of government services is measured as the ratio of output to costs of production at constant prices. Labour productivity is the ratio of output to labour input. To measure total factor productivity (TFP), capital input should also be estimated. For more on measuring non-market output in national accounts, see SNA 2008 paragraphs 15.111-15.120 and the OECD handbook on \u201cMeasuring Government activity\u201d . Administrative data from the budget of government and other public entities are usually audited. Therefore, one normally assumes that these data are relatively accurate and reliable. However, in order to produce statistics they must be modified according to the statistical accounting rules. Which way the budget data should be modified depends on the accounting rules used in the budget and by the budget units. For example, ESA and GFS apply accrual accounting whereas national budgets, especially in developing countries, are usually compiled on cash basis. To produce internationally comparable statistics, data from the legal budget may have to be transformed from cash basis to accrual basis. Other associated issues may be the inclusion of non-monetary transactions and the exclusion of flows not regarded as revenue (e.g. payments received from privatisation or revaluation of assets, most of all on reserve assets held in foreign currencies). However, in many developing countries other more basic issues might be more pressing. D.19.5. Improving sector statistics Statistics on government finance and public sector is closely related to public finance management. The quality of the statistics is closely connected to the quality and definition of the data from government budgets, which form the basis for the statistics. Therefore, government finance statistics should be developed in coordination with budget support, activities to strengthen PFM and other administrative reform. Government finance statistics is important information for development planning, and is thus of vital interest both to governments in developing countries and to their development partners. A further aspect is whether funds are used efficiently and for the purposes intended. PFM in each country is based on national legal and administrative traditions. Government finance statistics reflect this. It is therefore difficult to give advice for improvement of government finance statistics that will apply in each developing country. Instead, the approach must address the specific issues in the individual country, based on some general principles. First of all, the development of government finance statistics must go hand in hand with PFM development. In this process, the statistics should be developed in direction of compliance with the international statistical standards and concepts. A strategy should be devised for data collection and dissemination for the complete government finance accounts. It is a key issue to bring together all stakeholders to discuss the information needs, core challenges and a common strategy. The stakeholders include the NSI, the Ministry of Finance and the central bank, as well as the treasury, line ",
        "D 310 Government Finance and Public Sector Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 ministries and other key public institutions. The exact round of stakeholders is dependent on the national administrative system. The stakeholders also include donors. The strategy should be developed within the frame of the NSDS and be integrated with any plans for administrative reform. For statisticians, access to administrative budget data is important for developing good and comprehensive statistics. In this perspective, a number of issues should be addressed. However, the priorities critically depend on the national context: Clarify differences between budget concepts and \u2022 government finance statistics concepts; The information system of the budget compilation should \u2022 allow statisticians access to basic administrative data at a level as detailed as possible; Verify that all relevant transactions are registered in the \u2022 budget data; Establish an asset register; if existing, update and assure \u2022 maintenance; Establish a register of government units that are outside \u2022 the budget coverage; if existing, update and assure maintenance; Assure that data from all relevant budget units are available; \u2022 set up regular data collection on government units that are outside the budget; Assure that budget data are available within a reasonable \u2022 time after the end of the budget year; if serious delays, develop strategy with responsible institutions to bring delay down; Investigate whether other sources, e.g. on financing, \u2022 be used to cross-check and assess and calibrate data on government finance. A close co-operation is required between the NSI, the ministry of finance and the central bank to establish and maintain good quality government finance statistics. Establishing a permanent forum of budget experts from these institutions is recommended. This forum should streamline cooperation, resolve conceptual problems and oversee development and maintenance. The methodology of government finance statistics is sophisticated. Through statistical techniques and combination of data from multiple sources, government finance statistics may offer a fuller and more harmonised picture of government and public sector finances than budget data alone. However, government finance statistics require special knowledge and highly qualified staff. Specialised and tailored training courses are required to provide and keep up this knowledge. Furthermore, an active personnel policy for key staff is recommended in order to avoid \u2018brain drain\u2019 amongst key experts. Box 19.5: How to build a statistical action in public finance in a former planned economy Formerly planned economies inherited fairly developed statistical systems. However, these were tailored to the needs of central planning. For instance, no clear distinction was made between administrative sources and statistical surveys. In Serbia and Montenegro, in the past the NSIs collected data on budget units in the same way as on business enterprises. The compilation of the budget execution relied on administrative sources. As it is very troublesome to regularly reconcile different data sources at micro level, a serious cause of data error is inherent in such data collections. Within the EU funded national CARDS 2004 project on national accounts, a project component was devoted to provide estimates on the provision of government services and on their final consumption in compliance with the requirements of ESA95 methodology, taking into consideration the limited resources. For the production of GDP estimates, data on government output and on government final consumption are indispensable. The project suggested not to constrain the efforts on the compilation of the government output and final consumption, but to set up a strategy on how to build a data collection and dissemination mechanism for the complete government finance accounts. The strategy included: The establishment of a forum at management level for those 1. government agencies that collect and use data on government transactions in their daily work. The NSI, the Ministry of Finance (MoF) and the National Bank (NB) are the core participants. The inclusion of other agencies \u2013 like the Treasury and line ministries - depends on how the institutional responsibilities are divided. Data on elementary revenue and expense transactions are managed in the MoF. Usually, the NB collects data on financial flows and stocks in the frame of monetary statistics. The NSI is engaged in national accounts and is responsible for submitting data on government accounts to international institutions. The establishment of a permanent working group at expert level, 2. including the staff of the relevant agencies engaged in data collection, processing and analysing. Good quality government finance statistics necessitates the continuous close co-operation of NSI, MoF and NB. It provides the opportunity to check data on government finance from \u201cmirror sources\u201d; data coming from the official budget can be checked with data on financing, usually collected by the NB. Government accounts should be reconciled with data of other national accounts sectors compiled by the NSI. Organisation of training courses in government finance for the 3. staff of statisticians and budget experts. Government finance is a sophisticated methodology, so to implement it requires special knowledge.

Justice and crime statistics The chapter in brief This chapter covers statistics which relate to the nature and extent of crime and the operation of the criminal justice system, providing a short overview of the subject. Justice and crime statistics cover a very wide area of actors including: the law enforcement agencies, the prosecution authorities, the courts, correctional institutions. The section begins with a short description of the various components of a typical criminal justice system. It then identifies the main policy areas for which justice and crime statistics are used. It continues with a description of the many different types of justice and crime statistics before providing links to some of the more important sources of existing statistics for illustrative purposes. It then turns to some quality issues. It concludes with a discussion of some of the main aspects which need to be considered in building a sustainable justice and crime statistics system. The aim is to provide guidance on how to build up or strengthen the capacities for the establishment of meaningful and reliable statistics in the field of crime and criminal justice (for general aspects of statistical capacity building, see chapter C.6.2.) Because of the considerable differences in the forms of policing and criminal justice, it is possible only to provide a broad overview. A more detailed treatment of the subject is available in the UN Manual for the Development of a System of Criminal Justice Statistics. D.20.1. Policy applications D.20.1.1. The criminal justice system History, customs and traditions, religious beliefs, civil conflict, economic and political factors, and values all play a fundamental part in the development of a country\u2019s criminal justice system. There are, therefore, a large variety of criminal justice systems in the world today. The two major models in the Western world are based on civil and common law traditions. 56 The civil law tradition is the older and more influential and forms the basis of criminal justice systems in Europe, Latin America and African countries. It developed on the basis of Roman law and seeks to encourage rules of conduct linked to the ideas of justice and morality. It is inquisitorial and relies on a written code. The common law tradition has its origins in England and forms the basis of criminal justice systems in many former colonies of the British Empire. It is derived from precedent and custom although written laws are also important. Judges play a central role and the system is adversarial. A third important model is shari\u2019ah law based on traditional Islamic thought and is derived from the divine revelations of the Qur\u2019an and the examples and sayings of the Prophet Muhammad. Some countries have a mixture of different models of criminal justice and the picture is further complicated depending on whether the nation\u2019s government is unitary, federal or 56 For a more extended discussion of different models of criminal justice systems, see for example: Robertson, C. and Das, D.K. (2008) An Introduction to Comparative Legal Models of Criminal Justice , London: CRC Press. confederate. Moreover, there are many informal systems of justice based on customary and indigenous traditions, which exist alongside the more formal systems. A typical formal criminal justice system is made up of a complex system of actors dealing with crime, offenders and victims. The police component is often made up of national, regional and local police agencies and a variety of specialised policing bodies dealing with drugs, traffic, health and safety, business, tax and environmental violations. The prosecution component is usually composed of a separate public prosecutor\u2019s office and public prosecutors in various government departments. The court component is made up of a range of different types of courts with varying levels of jurisdiction, a number of specialised courts, such as juvenile courts, and appellate courts. The prison component includes all types of custodial institutions from pre- to post-trial. The non-custodial section embraces a range of organisations responsible for supervising measures, such as probation or community service. A comprehensive system of justice and crime statistics collects statistics on the decisions made and outcomes for all the separate components as well as capturing through-put information, monitoring case outcomes and conducting victim surveys. D.20.1.2. What these data are used for Justice and crime statistics have a wide variety of uses including: To provide a picture of the nature and extent of crime in \u2022 society and the effectiveness of the response to it. Alongside other statistics on social harm, justice and crime statistics can serve as a social barometer on the well-being of a nation and the levels of harm and insecurity experienced by its citizens. To assess the extent to which the goals, objectives and \u2022 targets of the whole as well as each part of the criminal justice system - the police services/law enforcement agencies, prosecution authorities, the courts and the custodial institutions - are being accomplished and whether the resources are being used efficiently and effectively. To plan for policy changes within different parts of the \u2022 system or from outside the system. For example, if a law is passed to increase the severity of the sentence for a particular category of offence, it may be important to be able assess the impact on the size of the prison population. To inform budget and personnel decisions. For example, \u2022 if the number of people being prosecuted decreases substantially, it may be necessary to reduce the number of people working in the courts and control institutions. To ascertain that all decisions and activities are compliant \u2022 with international human rights obligations \u2013 including the duty not to wrongfully discriminate. ",

D.20.1.3. Types of justice and crime statistics Many countries already collect a range of justice and crime statistics for each of the major agencies within the criminal justice system. Police statistics may include information on: recorded crime, \u2018clear-up\u2019 figures, and police use of selected powers, such as stop and search, arrest and detention. Prosecution statistics typically cover caseload data and show the number of cases not proceeded with, the total number of suspects prosecuted and outcome of cases. More sophisticated systems may collect statistics on specific issues, such as racially motivated offences or domestic violence as well as monitoring a range of performance indicators. Court statistics record the number of cases dealt with, the type of plea entered, the outcome of each case, any sentence given and some characteristics of those prosecuted such as age, sex, education and ethnic background. Punishment or disposal statistics record details of the number and characteristics of those sentenced to different forms of punishment such as imprisonment or probation. In addition, most systems collect a range of resource data on the number and characteristics of persons employed in each section and on levels of expenditure.

        "D 317 Justice and Crime Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 The criminal \u2018event\u2019 forms the key element of any system of criminal justice and of crime statistics. It involves three components: a criminal act, an offender and a victim. Criminal acts are defined within the criminal laws of each state. There are sometimes important differences between countries in the types of behaviour considered to be criminal. Every single criminal event may involve more than one criminal act, more than one offender and more than one victim or a series of acts against the same victim. The victim may not be an individual but an organisation such as a shop, bank or even the state itself. Classification schemes are used to categorise the legally defined behaviour groupings (see section D.20.4.) and clear and comprehensive instructions are required for recording criminal events involving a series of criminal acts and persons. Information on the offender can be obtained at various stages in the criminal justice process. The most comprehensive information is normally collected on offenders in prison. As well as age, sex, residence, national origin \u2013 information which is normally routinely collected by the police \u2013 a range of detailed information, such as educational attainment, physical and mental health, membership of a criminal organisation, can also be collected on individual offenders. Thus, the further along the criminal justice process the richer the information which is typically obtained. However, information gathered at this stage is unlikely be representative of the offender population in general because of tendencies towards the differential treatment of specific groups in the population, such as the poor, mentally ill or those from ethnic minorities. For crimes where the victims are individuals, the characteristics of victims and the type and severity of their experiences have been given much greater emphasis in recent times in common law systems. In a number of countries police now routinely collect victim information. The most important development, however, has been the introduction of victim surveys, in part because of the limitation of police recorded crime statistics (see section D.20.3.). These surveys are based on a random sample of the population and focus on ascertaining whether or not the respondent has been a victim of a crime over their life course or in the last year. One of the most difficult decisions is whether or not to collect information on the ethnic origins of those who come into contact with the police or are subsequently dealt with in the criminal justice system. On the one hand, this information provides a means to monitor the performance of people working in the system in their duty to avoid discriminating against any persons on the ground of ethnicity. On the other hand, there are risks that the information collected could be misused. It is therefore imperative that if the information is collected there are measures to prevent misuse and stringent data protection measures built into the criminal justice statistics system (see section D.20.5.). Box 20.2: Indicative list of information collected in victim surveys Victimisation in last five years and last year, by type of crime \u2022 Victimisation in last five years and last year, by age, sex \u2022 Attitudes towards police and crime prevention and punishment \u2022 Attitudes towards crime and security \u2022 Household and personal characteristics \u2022 Other agencies outside of the criminal justice system may also collect a range of statistics which enhance the understanding of criminal activity. They include, for example, statistics on drug production and consumption, trafficking of persons, arms and drugs, and money-laundering and insider trading. D.20.2. Sources of Data and Metadata: Data available from international sources A range of justice and crime data are available at international, national and regional level. A few of the main sources are provided here to provide an illustration of the type and range of criminal justice statistics which are routinely collected. Since 1977 the United Nations has conducted periodic surveys on Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems (CTS) initially covering five yearly intervals from 1970. The aim of the surveys is to collect data on the incidence of reported crime and the operations of criminal justice systems with a view to improving the analysis and dissemination of the information globally. Over the years the content and focus of the questionnaires have altered but they have always covered the main components of the system \u2013 police, prosecution, courts and prisons. The time period was reduced from 5 to 3 years from 1995. Data from the Tenth CTS survey covering the period 2005-2006 is available for the 86 countries which had responded by 10 December 2008. The Eleventh CTS survey is currently being conducted for the period 2007-2008. In 1989 the first International Crime Victim Survey (ICVS) was carried out in 14 industrialised countries. Further sweeps were carried out in 1992, 1996, 2002 and 2004-05. By the end of 2005 over 140 surveys had been completed in more than 78 different countries with over 300,000 people being interviewed. The aim of the international victim surveys is to move beyond the limitations of police recorded crime data to provide more robust comparative measures of the extent of crime and victimisation as well as people\u2019s perceptions of crime and attitudes towards the criminal justice system. A standard list of offences is used in each country surveyed overcoming the problem of attempting to compare police crime data which are based on different national definitions. ",
        "D 318 Justice and Crime Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 On how to carry out a victim survey, see the UNODC-UNECE Manual on Victim Surveys , which will be published in 2010. There has been increasing international awareness and concern about the extent of violence against women, so this has been a focus of data collection in recent years. In 1997 the European Institute for Crime Prevention and Control, affiliated with the United Nations (HEUNI) together with a number of international experts in the field started developing a comparative and standardised survey tool for measuring violence against women worldwide. The first International Violence Against Women Survey (IVAWS) was conducted in 2003. The survey covered women\u2019s experiences, the consequences of violence and background information. It used a number of screening questions to establish lifetime victimisation followed by more detailed questions on prevalence and incidence. Crime and criminal justice statistics have been available for the European Union since the Hague Programme gave a specific mandate to Eurostat in 2005 \u2018to establish European instruments for collecting, analysing and comparing information on crime and victimisation and their respective trends in Member States, using national statistics and other sources of information as agreed indicators\u2019. A series of measures for developing such instruments was outlined in a Communication from the Commission on Developing a comprehensive and coherent EU strategy to measure crime and criminal justice . The results obtained in the context of this development are published by Eurostat on its website and in several short publications in the series Statistics in Focus. In addition, a prototype EU survey on victimisation has been developed and successfully piloted in most of the EU Member States, which will lead to the implementation of a fully-fledged European Security Survey in 2013. A complete system of statistics on crime and criminal justice to include comparable data for all Member States is currently being put in place under the Stockholm Programme . These EU developments provide a useful example not only of crime related statistics but also of their collection on a regional as opposed to merely on a jurisdictional basis. Two important sources of information on organised and transnational crime are Interpol and Europol . Interpol facilitates cross-border police co-operation to help prevent and combat international crime. It represents 188 member countries facilitating cooperation within the limits of the laws existing in the different countries and in the spirit of the \u2018 Universal Declaration of Human Rights \u2019. It can help even where diplomatic relations do not exist between member states. Europol is a similar body encouraging and facilitating cooperation among European members states to prevent and combat terrorism, unlawful drug trafficking and other serious forms of organised crime. D.20.3. Quality aspects The concept of quality in statistics is extensively covered in chapter C.5. of this Guide and in the European Statistics Code of Practice (see section B.2.1.2.). Quality of statistics is often defined as \u2018the fitness for use\u2019 by end users. It covers the institutional and organisational environment, statistical processes and statistical outputs. Important institutional or organisational factors include: the extent of professional independence, the mandate for data collection, the adequacy of resources, the quality commitment, statistical confidentiality, impartiality and objectivity. In terms of statistical processes, consideration must be given to the utilisation or development of sound methodologies and appropriate statistical procedures. The burden on respondents should not be excessive and it should be cost- effective. In terms of statistical output, the statistics must be relevant, accurate and reliable, timely, coherent, comparable across regions and countries, and readily accessible by users. The most important quality issue in justice and crime statistics relates to how well the statistics measure the nature and extent of crime and offending behaviour in society. The key problem is that criminal events are difficult to capture and both police recorded crime statistics and victim surveys have a number of important limitations. Similarly, prosecution and court statistics are a record of decisions taken rather than a representative picture of crime, victims and offenders. Therefore it is crucial to always be aware of the different limitations of and problems with each kind of crime-related statistics. Police recorded crime statistics, for a variety of reasons, capture only a proportion of the total crimes committed. Many crimes are not reported to the police: the victim does not consider the crime to be serious; they do not want to be involved in the criminal process; they do not consider that the police could do anything about the crime; their previous contacts with the police have been negative and they have no confidence in them; the crime was humiliating and they do not want to add to their humiliation; they do not want to self-incriminate themselves as they were involved in the crime. Moreover, often for a variety of reasons the victim is unaware or unwilling to report that a crime had been committed. For example, women may be unwilling to report domestic abuse. There are a growing number of \u2018new\u2019 types of crime including for example cybercrime, fraud, counterfeiting, human trafficking, money-laundering and terrorism. Many of these criminal activities are in fact not new but they have taken advantage of technological developments to assume different forms. Traditional methods of recording such crimes are often unsuitable for measuring their incidence, as victims are frequently unable (as in the case of sexual or labour exploitation) or unwilling (as in the case of financial crimes directed against businesses) to report them. ",
        "D 319 Justice and Crime Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Such \u2018new\u2019 crimes typically display a high degree of criminal organisation, so they are sometimes categorised under the heading of \u2018organised crime\u2019. This term is the subject of a formal definition by the United Nations, but it is difficult to implement for unsolved crimes as some of the criteria involved require a conviction to have been obtained. Another term met with in this context is \u2018transnational crime\u2019, reflecting the fact that many criminal organisations have adopted modern communication methods which make national borders largely irrelevant. It is precisely because of these characteristics that international bodies like the United Nations and the European Union are in the forefront of attempts to combat these crimes, and collaboration at international level is therefore important in the development of the appropriate statistical indicators and measurement instruments. Another quality issue is that there will always be gap between the actual amount of crime committed and what becomes known to the police. This gap is often referred to as the \u2018dark figure\u2019. But even if a crime is reported to the police it may not be recorded or proceeded with for a variety of reasons. The principal reason is that the police on further investigation do not consider that the reported behaviour is, in fact, a crime. Other possible reasons for non-recording include: the officer who received the information forgot or lost it or there is a police culture which discourages recording in order to hide the extent of crime in the area and to present the police in a good light. Because of all these problems with police recorded crime, crime victimisation surveys have been developed to provide a complementary data source to police statistics. But victimisation surveys also have a number of limitations. Typically, surveys cover only people aged 16 and over and exclude those of no fixed abode. They rely on the memory of the respondent to recall criminal events. The format of the questionnaire, with its emphasis on crime harms, may compel the respondent to exaggerate or make up crime events or their fear of crime, to please the interviewer. Different cultures, classes and social groups both nationally and internationally report similar experiences differently suggesting that a respondent\u2019s understanding of victimisation may be very different. As with police recorded crime, victim surveys will seldom capture organised as well as many types of financial and economic crime. Justice statistics relating to the police, prosecutions and the courts also have their limitations. They are basically records of decisions taken at different stages in the criminal justice process and are made in different social and legal contexts. They are products of interactions and demands within and beyond the system and subject to judgements, manipulations and disputes. They provide much useful information on the operation of discretion or the workload levels in different parts of the system, but how far they can be considered representative of criminal and offending behaviour, is very much a matter of debate among criminologists. There are two important difficulties with justice statistics. First, is the fact that a crime reported to the police and classified/ qualified under the criminal code, is often subsequently re- qualified by the prosecution service or later the court, with the consequence that it will figure under different qualifications in the police and the justice statistics, which are generally kept separate and where no cross-checking takes place. For example, a crime registered as a murder by the police might be re-qualified by the court as an involuntary homicide, but it will probably continue to stay in the crime statistics of the police as a murder. Second, the information recorded by the police in one year will relate to court cases in a following year making it difficult to make comparisons between police and justice statistics. A broader concern with both policing and criminal justice statistics is that they may be misused. Levels of crime and the effectiveness of the police and the courts in preventing and detecting criminal behaviour are very sensitive issues in any society. There will therefore always be pressure to present the data in the best possible light and to play down or not publish trends which indicate deterioration in public security. It is therefore imperative that robust systems are put in place to prevent the misuse of these sensitive statistics. (see chapter D.20.4. below). D.20.4. Key issues in building a system This subsection focuses on some of the broader issues involved in building a system of justice and crime statistics (for building statistical capacity in general, see chapter C.6.2). Any system of justice and crime statistics must reflect the offences defined under the national criminal law, but also the needs and customs of the country and its system of governance. It must also take into consideration the availability of people with the necessary legal, statistical and computing skills, the level of technical resources and existing demands on public expenditure. In addition, international norms should be taken into consideration. These elements will influence the type of organisational structure which is chosen. There is no standard structure. Some countries have a centralised approach, where one governmental agency has responsibility for the collection, processing and dissemination of all justice and crime statistics. The agency may be part of the justice ministry or in the national statistics office or totally independent of government. Alternatively, the responsibilities may be devolved to agencies at regional level. This decentralised approach is often found in countries with federal structures. (For the organisation of statistical systems, see chapter B.2.3.) In making the decision on the form of organisational structure, it is important to consider which form will best ",
        "D 320 Justice and Crime Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 achieve professional independence, statistical confidentiality and impartiality and produce the best quality data within the necessary resource constraints (see section B.2.1.2.) To avoid any possibility of the misuse of crime and justice statistics serious consideration should be given to placing the responsibility for their collation and dissemination in a totally independent agency. Whichever form is chosen a key aspect is the development of strong set of relationships between the statistical agency and all parts of the criminal justice system as well as with outside bodies, such research institutes and universities. As the criminal justice system is made up of a complex system of actors it is essential to define the scope of justice system statistics. It is impossible to collect statistics on all aspects without considerable costs. First, it is necessary to define clearly the purposes of the system. Is it to cover administration, planning, policy, research and analysis or it is to have a more limited remit? Second, the users, both current and potential, need to be identified. Thirdly, decisions need to be taken about what types of information are to be collected and by whom and how the information is to be transformed into statistics and submitted to a central system. Finally, once the statistics have been collated, decisions need to be made about which government agencies should receive the data, how often, in what form and how and when the statistics should be published. Most systems of criminal justice and crime statistics provide information on the following main substantive areas: the nature, extent and trends in crime; the characteristics of offenders and victims; the volume of activity in the system \u2013 crimes reported, stop and search, arrests, and summons, prosecutions, disposals and offenders in custody or under supervision; and resources deployed, including personnel and expenditure; and citizen\u2019s views and attitudes about crime and criminal justice. These statistics need to be related to social, economic and demographic information to produce rates of the phenomenon of interest. For example, it is normal practice to show the number of offences or the number of people in prison per 100,000 of the population. Similarly, criminal justice expenditure figures may be represented in relation to the size of the population in different areas. At the heart of all systems of justice and crime statistics is a detailed legal definition of criminal offences which is used at all stages in the criminal justice process. Criminal laws generally first distinguish between categories of crime such as: violent crimes, property crimes, drug offences, traffic offences, etc. In each category are then included the specific legal definitions of each offence. For example, violent offences generally cover legal definitions for criminal offences such as: Homicide, Robbery, Kidnapping, Sexual Assault, Non- Sexual Assault. The way criminal behaviour is defined will depend on the country\u2019s legal system. Increasingly, defining crimes in terms of the gender of the offender and victim is viewed as important in order to assess the level of violence against women. As all the segments in the criminal justice system are connected and the decisions taken at one stage in the process will affect the decisions taken at the next stage, it is important to develop statistics which are able to monitor the movement of suspects, cases, charges or crimes through the system. This involves making decisions about which to monitor. At each stage different information is collected. Typically, the police keep details on crimes, suspects, charges and victims. The courts deal in cases, charges and convictions and prisons and non-custodial institutions collect information on inmates and offenders. A criminal act reported to the police may involve a number of crimes, offenders and victims. It may produce a number of cases in the court and a number of offenders sent to prison. People, provided the police suspect who committed the crime, form the most important common unit at all stages in the process. Through the use of a person identifier, it is possible to link the different parts of the system together. People are not, however, the only monitoring unit of interest. Crimes, charges, cases and disposals are also important. Devising a criminal justice and crime statistics system is complex and requires an incremental approach and a detailed assessment of the cost and purpose of each data element. It also requires a careful analysis of the type of information which is already routinely collected by different parts of the system and how this could be adapted to meet broader requirements. Demands for more detailed information are often likely to exceed the resources available. D.20.5. Data protection The collection and processing of data on policing and criminal justice should only be carried out under suitable specific safeguards in order to eliminate errors, to prevent misuse of the data and to uphold the privacy rights of the individual. Data security needs to be built into the system at all levels and detailed protocols are required in terms of data use and exchange. Europe provides a model for the protection of data. Under the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, Article 8 states: Everyone has the right to the protection of personal data 1. concerning him or her. Such data must be processed fairly for specified purposes 2. and on the basis of the consent of the person concerned or some other legitimate basis laid down by law. Everyone has the right of access to data which has been collected concerning him or her, and the right to have it rectified Compliance with these rules shall be subject to control by 3. an independent authority. In 1981 the European Union strengthened individual rights with regard to automatic processing of personal information because of the increasing use of computers for administrative purposes. Under Article 6 of the Convention for the Protection of Individuals with Regard to the Automatic ",
        "D 321 Justice and Crime Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Processing of Personal Data: \u2018personal data revealing racial origin, political opinions or religious or other beliefs, as well as personal data concerning health or sexual life, may not be processed automatically unless domestic law provides appropriate safeguards. The same shall apply to personal data relating to criminal convictions\u2019.

Living conditions, poverty statistics The chapter in brief This chapter on living conditions and poverty statistics gives an insight on design and uses of statistics in the assessment of households\u2019 poverty situation in relation with the standard of living. It elaborates on cross-cutting social issues \u2013 including multidimensional methods to measure poverty, living conditions in the broad sense, social inclusion/exclusion, social indicators, and social situation. With the diversity of living standards, it is technically impossible to have one definition of poverty that applies to both industrialized and developing countries, as well as to rural and urban areas within a country. While international assessment of poverty levels generally focuses on the notion of absolute poverty, disparities in living conditions suggest to take different factors into account and to introduce a more realistic notion of relative poverty. The broader sense of this concept requires the use of complex statistical surveys in order to gather information for poverty analysis. The concept of poverty depends on evolving economic, social and environmental factors affecting standards of living in a country. Therefore, what could be considered as a poverty situation in one part of a country may not be relevant for another part and, moreover, what is pictured as a poverty condition in country A may not apply to country B. Understanding the living conditions of populations involves in-depth assessment of their participation in economic activities and the benefits they gain from the country\u2019s wealth. The first part of this chapter presents main uses of statistics on living conditions and poverty in terms of policy formulation. The second section defines concepts, notions, and indicators considered in poverty assessment. The last two sections cover data issues and ways to improve these statistics. The related topic of income and consumption statistics is covered in chapter D.25. Social sustainability is also a pillar of sustainable development, which is covered in chapter D.26. D.21.1. Policy applications: what this data is used for Poverty statistics play a significant role in policy formulation. They help orienting processes to identify and target recipients of poverty alleviation programs. In many areas of national planning, policy makers use statistics on income distribution to monitor living conditions of the population, and in particular the poor. Some of the key questions addressed by living conditions and poverty statistics are: Who are the poor? \u2022 Where do they live? \u2022 What do they do for a living? \u2022 How do they use their resources? \u2022 How can their living conditions be improved? \u2022 Living conditions and poverty statistics are used in a wide range of policy areas. Some of these are: Targeting beneficiaries of poverty reduction projects \u2022 and programs: Many national and international projects are designed with a goal to alleviate poverty in a given geographical area. Identifying who the poor are and where they live is essential to target the poorest populations and channel resources to them for better impacts. Priority setting in project design or piloting: Knowing \u2022 poverty characteristics of municipalities in a country provides a statistical base for deciding where to act first or which localities have the ideal conditions for piloting a poverty reduction project. By conducting poverty surveys, decision makers will have the necessary tools to identify priority issues to address and how to tackle them. Planning for local development is essential for improving \u2022 living conditions of poor populations. Through poverty statistics, structural information on local populations set the base for planning future initiatives in targeted areas. Survey results on poverty related issues are used for budgeting, setting milestones for the implementation and evaluation of projects in favour of vulnerable populations. Monitoring and evaluation: With information on \u2022 conditions of living of targeted populations, poverty statistics are necessary before, during and after a project is implemented. They help identify areas of improvement in living standard where development projects are active, in comparison to similar places where such projects are not. They are crucial to evaluate how a specific policy impact on its beneficiaries. A major international policy application of poverty statistics is the poverty map concept supported by a number of international organizations and governments around the world. More than half of the world population live in rural areas. It is estimated that one fifth of the world population live with less than a dollar a day. More than one third lives with less than two dollars a day. These analyses are provided by the World Poverty Map initiated by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) . The situation of individual countries may vary, but this global picture is the base to key poverty alleviation initiatives in many regions. A concrete example of national use of poverty and living conditions statistics is given in Box 21.1. 57 57 For a further example of national use of statistics on poverty and living conditions, drawn from an African country, one may consult \u2018 Poverty analysis in Kenya: Ten years on\u2019 by John Thinguri Mukui (2005). ",
        "D 326 Living Conditions, Poverty Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Box 21.1: Use of poverty statistics in the Philippines In 2009, the National Statistical Coordination Board (NSCB) of the Philippines carried out an analysis of the \u2018Actual policy uses of poverty statistics\u2019 . It was noted that the poverty statistics played a significant role, especially in policy formulation and targeting. In particular small area estimates of poverty, an output of an NSCB project funded by the World Bank, have been of high value to users. Key areas where poverty statistics is used in the Philippines include: Targeting beneficiaries for programs and projects Poverty statistics have been used to identify the poorest municipalities, collect data from residents and determine the beneficiaries of poverty reduction programs. They have been used for regional poverty- related programs to identify common priority areas and convergence municipalities. Poverty statistics have also been used for different livelihood projects, e.g. on management of agricultural resources and fishery communities. Further uses include delivery of social services, school sponsoring for indigent children, enrolment in sponsored health insurance programs and development of micro-enterprises. Policy formulation and planning The small area poverty estimates have been used in regional development programs, and in particular for studies of socio- economic reconstruction and development of conflict affected areas. Poverty monitoring Usage of poverty statistics at local level covered monitoring local MDG attainment, setting local MDG targets and preparing local MDG action plans. National authorities have used poverty estimates to assess interventions to the poorest municipalities and identify future targets for action to reduce poverty. The small area poverty estimates have also been used to assess the local nutritional situation. Other uses The intra-censal small area estimates of poverty have, amongst others, been used to set priorities in the National Household Targeting System for Poverty Reduction and the Conditional Cash Transfer Program . They have also been used for a project to provide health care to the 1000 poorest rural municipalities by mobilising and training unemployed nurses. D.21.2. Concepts and definitions Generally, economic growth has not always translated into improving citizens\u2019 lives. Without properly targeted policies, populations with relatively high level of wealth tend to accumulate more while conditions of vulnerable populations tend to worsen. However, definition and implications of poverty must be addressed in order to better understand the concept. What does it mean to be poor? Is there any universal concept of poverty? Should poverty be defined through studying conditions of living of populations? Is wealth or economic comfort a determining factor? Poverty is generally assessed under two different ways 58 : absolute (or extreme poverty) vs. relative poverty. 58 See for instance \u2018Analysing and Measuring Social Inclusion in a Global Context\u2019 (UN, 2010) at: http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/publications/measuring-social-inclusion.pdf A household is in a situation of absolute or extreme poverty when its members lack the basic necessities for survival. Such households may be starving, lacking of clean water, proper housing, sufficient clothing or medicines. In many developing countries a large part of the population struggle to live on a day-to-day basis. Pockets of poor populations can also be found in developed economies. In 2000, United Nations designed the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) with the objective of eradicating extreme poverty in the world by 2015. Eradicating extreme poverty is the first of the MDGs. In practical terms, it is translated into the target of reducing by half the proportion of people living on less than a dollar a day. Living with less than a dollar a day was the internationally agreed threshold for absolute poverty (poverty line) at the inception of the MDGs. An application of the one dollar poverty line in Malawi is shown in Box 21.2. Recent research shows that, given the heterogeneity of poverty situations, the global trend in inflation, and differentials in purchasing power around the world, a reasonable level of poverty line in 2010 should be adjusted to 1.25 dollar a day . But what does it mean for an individual to live on 1.25 dollar a day in Soweto, Beijing or Stockholm? Can this threshold define the concept of absolute poverty without taking other factors into consideration? In wealthier economies, policy makers consider instead the concept of relative poverty in the assessment of social exclusion. Relative poverty is a situation where people\u2019s disposable income level - which generally directly influences their standard of living - is too low compared to the general standard of living in the relevant country or region. This describes the status of people struggling to live a normal life and unable to participate in ordinary economic, social and cultural activities. With this definition, relative poverty may vary from country to country, depending on the income level enjoyed by the majority of citizens. While not as extreme as absolute poverty, relative poverty is still very serious and harmful in all countries. The EU\u2019s Social Inclusion Process uses a relative definition of poverty 59 to address vulnerability of population. Given these different concepts, what are the most appropriate statistical indicators to be used to assess poverty around the world? Empirical analysis of poverty requires sound statistical measurement. 59 The leading indicator in the European Union, the at-risk-of-poverty rate, counts as poor individuals those living in households where equivalised (i.e. per unit of consumption) disposable income is below the threshold of 60% of the national equivalised median income.

        "D 327 Living Conditions, Poverty Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 D.21.2.1. Measuring poverty through income and consumption needs In this Guide , poverty is described under three main dimensions which are: poverty, inequality, and vulnerability. With respect to these factors, three questions need to be answered: 1. Do individuals have enough resources or ability to meet their daily needs of consumption of goods and services? 2. Are distribution of income, consumption or/and other attributes equal or rather unequal across the population? 3. What is the probability or risk of being in poverty today \u2013 or falling deeper into poverty \u2013 in the future? (For a more detailed discussion on statistics on income and consumption statistics, see chapter D.25.) 60 Box 21.2: Measuring poverty in Malawi \u2013 A multilateral statistical project The first Millennium Development Goal aims at reducing by half the proportion of people living on less than a dollar a day. Three statistical indicators are agreed upon to measure the progress towards this goal: 1. The proportion of population below $1 per day in Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) terms; 2. The poverty gap ratio 60 ; 3. The share of the poor- est 20% (quintile) of the population in national consumption. Measuring the number of people who are living in extreme poverty may be challenging in countries with limited capacity of their statis- tical systems. Detailed information is needed about each household group income and expenditure, as well as about the prices of food and goods in the country. A survey must cover enough households to generate reliable esti- mates. Questions need to be asked at different times of the year to take account of possible seasonal differences in household well-be- ing. Many Sub-Saharan African countries do not have the funds or skills to undertake these surveys on their own. In Malawi, the UK Department for International Development (DFID) has joined up with the World Bank, the Norwegian Embassy, Irish Aid and the German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ) to support the Malawi National Statistics Office (NSO) to deliver its third Inte- grated Household Survey (IHS3) . The World Bank\u2019s Living Standards Measurement Study-Integrated Surveys on Agriculture (LSMS-ISA) (see Box 17.5) supports the design and implementation of the sur- vey where 12,288 households in 768 enumeration areas - divided into cross-sectional and panel samples - were interviewed over a 12 month period as part of this survey, which kicked off on 23 March 2010. The outcome will provide data on demographic characteristics, nu- trition, labour force and employment, income, expenditure, assets, household enterprises and access to community services. This infor- mation is critical to the Government of Malawi\u2019s planning and deci- sion making, and to monitoring progress against the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy and the Millennium Development Goals. The data will also be used to update the Malawi national poverty line. Between the last two surveys, in 1997/98 and 2004/05, there was only a small reduction in the number of people living in poverty, from 54% to 52% of Malawi\u2019s population. Recent estimates suggest that the country has since made strong progress, with poverty falling to around 40% - but we won\u2019t know this for certain until we have the latest household survey results. With only little time left until the 2015 deadline for achieving the Millennium Development Goals, this survey will give Malawi an up- to-date picture of its progress and indicate where efforts to reduce poverty should be focussed. 60 The poverty gap is the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line (counting the \u2018not poor\u2019 as having zero shortfall), expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. Having enough to meet daily needs requires setting a standard - or threshold - where we estimate that individuals fail to meet the definition of well-being 61 . To define a poverty measure we need to know: a) What is the accepted poverty line? and b) What indicator shall we use to assess the poverty level? From these two notions one could count the number of people living with less than the poverty line, say one dollar a day (poverty count). In the context of relative poverty, people could be poor not only because they earn less than the national threshold, but also because they do not have an acceptable standard of living. Relative poverty is sometimes the only way to understand how people with a relatively high level of income \u2013 in comparison to other areas \u2013 may not be able to live a descent life in their environment. As an example, the lowest hourly pay in the metropolitan area of Washington DC is about seven dollars. On the basis of eight working hours a day and twenty working days a month, this translates into more than one thousand dollars a month. In some developing countries, this corresponds to the upper layer of monthly government pay. Another concept associated with the measure of poverty relates to inequalities and the distribution of earnings across the whole population. The Gini coefficient is an interesting tool for this type of analysis. In the European Union, the preferred indicator for measuring inequality of income distribution is the income quintile share ratio. Also known as the S80/S20 , this ratio is calculated as the ratio of total disposable income received by the 20 % of the population with the highest income (the top quintile) to that received by the 20 % of the population with the lowest income (the bottom quintile). Measuring vulnerability is the third dimension of poverty. The probability (or risk) of being in poverty today or to fall into deeper poverty in the future is known as vulnerability. This plays a key role in the notion of relative poverty. Uncertainty in future income, e.g. inability to cope with severe weather conditions such as droughts, is a basic aspect of vulnerability. In the EU, the indicator of vulnerability is the at-risk-of- poverty rate . For vulnerable people, the economic environment becomes a factor of poverty when today\u2019s participation in economic activities does not guarantee a decent standard of living conditions in the future. Therefore, there is a need to statistically assess living conditions. 61 United Nations University provides description of relationships between poverty, inequality, and well-being in a policy brief entitled Measuring Human Well-being: Key Findings and Policy Lessons.

        "D 328 Living Conditions, Poverty Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 D.21.2.2. Statistics on living conditions With diversity in definition and application of poverty concepts, income-related measures of poverty need to be analysed together with other measures of living conditions \u2013 such as material deprivation \u2013 in order to have a better understanding of poverty. Material deprivation rate expresses the inability to afford a fixed consumption basket of items considered by most people to be desirable or even necessary to live an adequate life. The indicator distinguishes between individuals who cannot afford a certain good or service, and those who do not have this good or service for another reason, e.g. because they do not want or do not need it. Material deprivation rate provides a headcount of the number of people who cannot afford to pay for specific items. In the EU, the criterion is that one cannot afford at least three from a list of nine items (1. rent, mortgage or utility bills; 2. keeping their home adequately warm; 3. face unexpected expenses; 4. eat meat or proteins regularly; 5. go one week on holiday; 6. have television set; 7. have a refrigerator; 8. have a car; 9. have a telephone.). Those who lack four or more of these items are considered to be severely deprived 62 . Another indicator of living conditions is the share of persons living in a household with low work intensity. The work intensity of a household is defined as the ratio between the number of months that all working age household members have been working during the income reference year and the total number of months that could theoretically have been worked by the same household members. The share of persons living in households with low work intensity is defined as the share of persons living in households with work intensity below a threshold set at 0.20. In other words, those active people (of working age) who work less than 20% of the potential annual working time in a year. In June 2010, the European Council adopted the Europe 2020 strategy which includes social inclusion as one of its five headline targets. This was labelled \u2018 promoting social inclusion, in particular through the reduction of poverty, by aiming to lift at least 20 million people out of the risk of poverty and exclusion \u2019. The reference population for this EU-wide policy target refers to the number of persons who are either at risk of poverty or in a situation of severe material deprivation or living in a household with low work intensity (both defined as above). Member States have adopted their own national targets based on the same or more appropriate indicators. D.21.2.3. Measuring social inclusion/exclusion Poverty in developed countries is often seen as the inability to attain a decent standard of living. Hence, the lack of a subsistence level of nutrition, clothing and housing provides a standard for assessing the relative poverty situation of a household. What is considered as adequate and what are generally perceived as needs will vary over time and differ 62 Eurostat: Statistics Explained \u2013 Material deprivation across societies. Social inclusion/exclusion refers to the ability/inability for a household to meet the set standard at one point in time in a country. In a broader geographical context, designing indicators to measure social inclusion may be more challenging than in the EU or in other developed countries. The United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA) report Analysing and Measuring Social Inclusion in a Global Context suggests that, given the diversity of country concerns and the differences in levels of development on a global scale, an international portfolio of social inclusion indicators has to be designed flexibly. The portfolio has to conform to agreed principles while recognizing the diversity of needs and priorities. One way in which this could be achieved is through the creation of a three-tier structure set up as follows: Tier 1 \u2022 would consist of a restricted number of lead indicators (no more than 10) for the main fields relevant to all countries, including income poverty, material deprivation, lack of education, lack of productive role, poor health, and poor housing. The lead indicators have to reflect the various key dimensions of social inclusion. This is important not only because it would serve to concretely recognize and emphasize the multidimensionality of poverty and social exclusion, but also because it helps countries\u2019 Governments to take action to tackle the issue of poverty of their citizens. Tier 2 \u2022 would contain supporting indicators, providing greater detail and describing other dimensions of the problem, and covering dimensions of social inclusion not (yet) included in the tier 1 list. It would also contain useful contextual information, both quantitative and qualitative. There would be no limit imposed on the number of tier 2 indicators and on the contextual information provided, but one should avoid unnecessary proliferation, since each additional indicator increases the statistical and other resources required. Topics covered could include, for instance: access to justice, social and political participation, civil rights, security and justice, well-being, information and communications, mobility, leisure and culture. Tier 3 \u2022 would consist of indicators and contextual information that individual countries themselves decide to include, in order to highlight specificities in particular areas and to help interpret the tier 1 and tier 2 indicators; no doubt, these national indicators will provide a source of ideas and experience about new indicators which may be adopted at tier 1 or tier 2, in time replacing those initially proposed. Therefore, the rule in any international framework for analysing and measuring social inclusion is flexibility. This Guide follows this recommendation both for social inclusion/ exclusion and for social indicators and development. ",
        "D 329 Living Conditions, Poverty Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 D.21.2.4. Social indicators and development The need for quantitative evidence of social well-being rose from acknowledgement of the development community to include social dimension as part of the assessment of the level of development of countries. Depending on the organization, a list of social indicators is established to monitor the trend in social development across countries. Among the most used social indicators of development are the European Union Social indicators , the OECD indicators as published in Society at a Glance , and the World Bank Labour & Social Protection indicators. Broadly, social indicators of development are a selection of indicators covering areas of development including employment and self-sufficiency, health, social cohesion including life satisfaction, and inequity indicators including poverty. Social situation statistics are also necessary to measure and address poverty issues in a country or region. D.21.2.5. Social situation indicators The social situation in the European Union is measured through indicators developed under the Open Method of Coordination (OMC) in the field of social protection and social inclusion , a set of indicators on key aspects of social exclusion and poverty which was first agreed by the Laeken European Council in December 2001. A revised set of indicators was adopted by the Social Protection Committee in June 2006 and regularly revised afterwards. These indicators cover areas such as population; education and training; labour market; social protection; income, social inclusion and living conditions; gender equality, health and safety. The annual Social situation report has presented this set of indicators and their trends in EU Member States. From 2011 on, this report is being replaced by an annual report on employment and social situation. D.21.3. Sources of data and metadata Several scientific national and international initiatives are emerging as sources of data and metadata for poverty analysis. The World Bank has prepared poverty assessments in countries where it is active. In its database, the World Bank provides statistical data on poverty, living conditions and poverty alleviation . In addition, detailed poverty data by country are available. The World Bank data include measures of both population living below the national poverty line and population living below the international poverty line. This international poverty line is adjusted to hold the real value of the line constant across countries and over time. The World Bank data also include income distributions and urban and rural poverty rates. The World Bank was the initiator of the Living Standards Measurement Studies (LSMS) , initiated in 1980 and the 1-2-3 Surveys System . LSMS is an important tool in measuring and understanding poverty in developing countries (see section B.2.2.1. and Box 2.5) and the 1-2-3 surveys measure consumption and source of income \u2013 namely employment and its origin, with focus on the informal sector. The World Bank has recently also established a Poverty Reduction and Economic Management Network (PREM) . This source of information is not comparable with the source of information used in the European Union (EU-SILC) and the quality of the data collected is an issue. Together with other social issues, poverty is in focus for many international organizations. Amongst these are the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) with its OECD.Stat Database , the International Labour Organization (ILO) with its compendium of statistics on poverty and income distribution and Key Indicators of the Labour Market (KILM) and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe\u2019s (UNECE) forthcoming statistics on living conditions, poverty and cross-cutting social issues . Further statistical initiatives exist, aiming at collecting data on living conditions and poverty, each one targeting specific objectives. For example, the UN\u2019s lead project on disaggregating poverty statistics through Poverty Maps is operational in Africa , Asia and Latin America . The international income inequality survey is active in practically all regions of the world, assisted by the United Nations and the International Labour Organization (ILO) . The World Income Inequality Database (WIID) of the United Nations University \u2013 World Institute for Development Economics Research (UNU-WIDER) contains data on income inequality for developed, developing, and transition countries. The World Development Indicators (WDI) is a key international data source on development issues. WDI includes data on poverty, living conditions and income distribution. National experiences are also used to assess poverty levels as well as structure of income, employment and welfare. An example of a national approach is given in Box 21.3, presenting the determination of the poverty line in Dominica. 63 As for sector statistics on poverty, the experience of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) is interesting. This association of research institutes around the world have engaged significant levels of resources to assess the policy implications of poverty and food security. The organization has invested in developing databases on agricultural poverty mapping in Asia, Africa and Latin America. 63 For a further example, see e.g. the analysis of \u2018 Urban poverty in Nigeria: a case study of Agege area of Lagos state\u2019 by Tokunbo Simbowale Osinubi (2003).

        "D 330 Living Conditions, Poverty Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Box 21.3: Determining the poverty line in Dominica Dominica is small Eastern Caribbean island with an estimated population of 72,500 (July 2009). It has one of the lowest per capita GDP rates of the Eastern Caribbean states (2008). Dominica\u2019s economy is heavily dependent on tourism and agriculture. The agricultural sector is highly vulnerable to weather conditions and to external events affecting commodity prices. The macroeconomic situation is very volatile. In 2002, Dominica conducted a Country Poverty Assessment. This assessment was aimed at determining characteristics, extent and causes of poverty in Dominica and to identify effective strategies, programmes and projects to reduce the incidence of poverty. The Country Poverty Assessment had three (3) major components: Survey of Living Conditions; \u2022 Participants Poverty Assessment; \u2022 Institutional Analysis. \u2022 The Survey of Living Conditions was conducted by the National Statistics Office, based on a sample frame from the 2001 census. A systematic sample of one in every ten occupied households in May 2001 was drawn from this sample frame for every second Enumeration District (ED). The original sample size was 1,182 households from a Census household population of 24,000. The overall response rate was 80%, rising to 86% when vacant and closed dwellings were excluded. For the Participants Poverty Assessment, seven communities were chosen. These represented different levels of deprivation, social and economic orientation and background and location. The community studies involved a range of techniques including direct observations and transect walks, group discussions with community members, social mapping, focus group discussions, key informant interviews with local experts and case studies of poor individuals. The Institutional Analysis involved visits to institutions, interviews with key persons and review of relevant documents. This component was conducted to determine to what extent current policies, strategies, programmes and projects target the poor. The Country Poverty Assessment was conducted mainly on the basis of a national poverty line. This poverty line was derived on the basis of a minimum cost food basket. This was constructed for an adult to achieve a diet of 2,400 calories per day, taking into account local dietary preferences and the need for a balanced diet. The total cost of this basket for an adult was EC$ 2,000 per year. The indigence line is defined as the cost of the minimum cost food basket. Adults with total expenditure below this amount are classified as indigent or extremely poor, essentially unable to satisfy even basic food needs. In addition to the minimum cost food basket, the poverty line includes a component for non-food expenditure. The non-food element was calculated as the average per capita non-food expenditure of the 40% of households with the lowest per capita total expenditure. From the 2002 Survey of Living Conditions, this was EC$ 1,400 per year. The resulting adult poverty line was therefore determined at EC$ 3,400 per year, corresponding to the annual costs of the minimum cost food basket (EC$ 2,000) plus the non-food expenditure of the poorest households\u2019 (EC$ 1,400). Source: \u2018Disaggregating poverty statistics \u2013 The promise of poverty maps \u2013 Dominica\u2019 by S. Carrette (2004) In the European Union, the main source of data and metadata for poverty and living conditions analysis is the Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) instrument. EU- SILC is the EU reference source for comparative statistics on income distribution and social inclusion at European level. It provides cross-sectional data with variables on income, poverty, social exclusion and other living conditions, as well as longitudinal data on individual-level changes over time, observed periodically over a four year period. The EU-SILC methodology may serve as an inspiration for coordinated regional social surveys; it is based on the idea of a common \u201cframework\u201d rather than a common \u201csurvey\u201d. The common framework defines the harmonised lists of target variables; common guidelines and procedures; common concepts (household and income) and classifications aimed at maximising comparability of the information produced. It currently covers EU and EFTA countries plus Turkey, while Croatia, FYROM, Montenegro and Serbia are testing its implementation. ",
        "D 331 Living Conditions, Poverty Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Box 21.4: The challenge of safeguarding the confidentiality of individual data The concept of confidentiality is crucial to the operation of national statistical institutes. The quality of the information provided by individuals to the NSIs\u2019 surveys, indeed whether they respond to the surveys at all, is critically dependent upon the respondents\u2019 trust in the NSI to keep the information confidential and assure that it is not misused. Therefore, rules and safeguards on the confidentiality of individual data are normally included in the Statistical Law and other relevant legislation. The importance of this is obvious in the case of business statistics, where large economic interest can be involved. However, it is just as important in statistics on living conditions and poverty and other social statistics. For example, information on individuals\u2019 ethniticity or economic situation is highly sensitive. In addition to legal restrictions on access to individual data (also called microdata), the security of technical systems such as IT networks and servers is important. There is also the danger that NSIs inadvertently reveal individual information when publishing statistics, i.e. that individuals can be identified based on certain characteristics or that suppressed individual data can be recalculated on the basis of the other data published. To minimize the risk that individual data can be identified or recalculated, NSIs use so-called \u2018statistical disclosure control\u2019 . Two strong software packages for this purpose, \u00b5-Argus and t-Argus , have been developed by the NSIs of the Netherlands, Italy, Germany and Canada together with renowned academics. Both software packages are provided free of charge. \u00b5-Argus is specialized for protection of microdata, whereas t-Argus is used to produce safe tables. The two main techniques used for this are global recoding and local suppression. In the case of global recoding several categories of a variable are collapsed into a single one. The effect of local suppression is that one or more values in an unsafe combination are suppressed, i.e. replaced by a missing value. However, the value of collected statistics is critically dependent on their usability for analysis. Thus, most statistical legislation allows the use of microdata specifically for scientific analysis. However, researchers must comply with the same technical and statistical safeguards that apply to the NSIs, to guarantee that no individual data are disclosed. Generally, the research project and the specific purpose for the data access must be assessed by a confidentiality committee or similar authority. As an example, researchers may get access to EU SILC microdata for scientific purposes on strict conditions. The European Social Survey (the ESS) is a social survey aimed at explaining the relations between Europe\u2019s changing institutions and attitudes, beliefs and behaviour patterns of its people. The ESS covers more than 30 countries in Europe, and is a good example of a well-designed - and organised - regional survey with stringent common methodology, including sampling strategy, translation of questionnaires and documentation. The survey includes a wide range of social variables, including media use; social and public trust; political interest and participation; socio-political orientations; governance and efficacy; moral; political and social values; social exclusion, national, ethnic and religious allegiances; well-being; health and security; human values; demographics and socio-economics. The methodology is documented on the ESS\u2019s main web site and the data are available through the ESS Data website . D.21.4. Analysing data quality and identifying problems Living conditions and poverty statistics are new compared to many other areas of statistics compiled by national and international statistical agencies. Because of the specificity of this topic and the need for immediate action, living conditions and poverty analyses are generally based on survey data. Key quality aspects in this area are sampling and non-sampling errors. (General aspects of statistical quality are presented in section C.5.3.) A good example of how specific quality aspects are handled for surveys on social inclusion, poverty and living conditions is EU-SILC, which is documented in the Eurostat Statistical Book on Income and Living Conditions in Europe . The potential for statistical errors in poverty and living conditions data affects comparability across countries and over time. In-depth assessment of data quality will lead to better statistics in such surveys. More importantly, this will allow for better policy formulation in favour of the beneficiaries of projects designed to improve the living conditions of people. Measures of data quality are important for the evaluation and improvement of survey design and procedures. The respondents\u2019 trust in the confidentiality of information provided (see Box 21.4), as well as a continuous monitoring and improvement of the data quality of household surveys, is particularly important. A short typology of survey errors encountered on poverty statistics covers direct measure and estimation errors. Direct measure errors arise from the fact that what is measured on the units included in the survey can depart from the actual (true) values for those units. These errors concern the accuracy of measurement at the level of individual units enumerated in the survey, and focus on substantive content of the survey: definition of the survey objectives and questions; ability and willingness of the respondent to provide the information sought; the quality of data collection, recording and processing. This group of errors can be studied in relation to various stages of the survey operation. Estimation errors occur in the process of extrapolation from the particular units enumerated in the survey to the entire study population for which estimates or inferences are required. They originate from sample design and implementation, and include errors of coverage, sample selection and implementation, non-response, and also sampling errors and estimation bias 64 . 64 Data quality issues in household sample surveys are covered in \u201cHousehold sample surveys in transition economies \u2013 An introduction\u201d , by Vijay Verma, University of Siena, Italy ",
        "D 332 Living Conditions, Poverty Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 D.21.5. Improving living conditions and poverty statistics Living conditions and poverty statistics are important in national strategic planning as well as for channelling international cooperation projects to needy beneficiaries. They are used by international organizations but also by central and local government, especially in the context of implementing projects aiming at improving people conditions of life. Improving relevance, accuracy and timeliness of living conditions statistics to meet international statistical standards will increase their value to the users. It will critically improve the evidence used for policy formulation and monitoring by national and international decision makers. Many means can be used to improve living conditions and poverty survey estimates. The development of international standards, establishment of international experts groups and convening international workshops to share experience and discuss data quality issues are all valuable elements in this process. Developing international standards for existing surveys is a major task to enhance comparability of data collected on poverty and standard of living. Development of sound metadata will give users necessary documentation to understand the issues covered by living conditions statistics, access to definition of indicators, and tools for interpretation and extrapolation of survey variables. A very valuable tool is the creation and animation of expert discussion groups to share experience and best practices on the issue of improving living conditions and poverty statistics at both national and international levels. An example of such initiatives is the UN- backed Rio Experts Group on Poverty Statistics . National or regional workshops should be encouraged to discuss survey methodologies, questionnaire design, data processing and analysis. A good example of such a workshop to discuss common challenges was the African Union and European Union joint workshop \u201cSocial protection in Africa \u2013 Sharing Experience on the Informal Economy\u201d , held in Nairobi in March 2011 (see also Box 28.2). Moreover, elaboration of household survey guides and standards are critical to ensuring robustness of income and consumption statistics (see chapter D.25.). To assure the accuracy of poverty statistics, National Statistical Institutes are encouraged to explore ways to improve the response rate of their household surveys. It is critical that they guarantee the confidentiality of such data through national statistical acts and that they build the trust of the respondents in this confidentiality (see Box 21.4). The preparation of the United Nations\u2019 Handbook on Poverty Statistics (see Box 21.5) was welcomed by poverty analysts, statisticians and policy makers. This Handbook gathers in one document information and guidelines on how to plan, implement, and evaluate poverty statistical surveys, whether in developing countries or elsewhere. The Handbook also proposes a questionnaire to assess poverty related surveys in selected countries. Box 21.5: The United Nations\u2019 Handbook on Poverty Statistics A major United Nations endeavour in the area of poverty statistics is the preparation of the Handbook on Poverty Statistics (2005), which is a key reference document for international poverty assessment.

Population and migration statistics The chapter in brief This chapter covers population and demographic statistics. The main challenge is to make available comprehensive vital statistics in low income countries. The data are used to prepare indicators in policy areas covered by the European Consensus on Development (see section B.1.5.1). However, population was not itself identified as a key policy area by the Consensus. Improvement of population and demographic statistics has been made a priority in Africa by the UNECA. The chapter starts by identifying the main policy areas for which these statistics are used. It continues by providing a user\u2019s view of the statistics involved. The chapter identifies the main sources of data and information about methods. The chapter presents the details of an exercise to project population statistics based on census data in a West African country. The chapter concludes by discussing how to analyse the quality of the statistics in these fields and provides pointers to mounting effective projects in key areas. D.22.1. Policy applications: the uses of this data Population statistics and demography \u2013 the analysis of the population statistics - lie at the base of public or official statistics. Everyday comparisons are made between countries and over time by dividing economic and social indicators by the total population. Population statistics are used for planning, monitoring and evaluating public programmes in most social and economic fields. Population data are used to ensure an equitable regional and local allocation of government funds. Population statistics are used in most democracies to apportion electoral areas. 65 Other policy uses of population statistics include the following: Analysis of population ageing and its effects on sustainability \u2022 and welfare Evaluation of fertility as a background for family policies \u2022 Evaluation of the economic impact of demographic \u2022 change Development and monitoring of immigration and asylum \u2022 policies In major emergencies, population data helps rescue planning. The Introduction to this Guide asks: 65 See for example: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_One_of_the_United_States_ Constitution and http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circonscriptions_l%C3%A9gislatives_%2 8France%29 \u2018 If you think that statistics are important but bread is more urgent, please ask yourself on what information you base your answers to these questions: \u2018How much bread?\u2019 and \u2018Where is it needed? \u2019\u2019 Population statistics can provide some of these answers. Statistics on births and deaths are used to analyse fertility and so to estimate the future size and structure of a population (population projections). These \u2018vital statistics\u2019 are also used for statistics of mortality, including, where possible, by cause of death. The data inform analysis of the health status of a population and provides the basis for epidemiological studies. Population projections are also used to address long-term concerns. These include climate change and global and regional population pressures on resources, such as water and energy supplies. Food policies can also be informed by regional, national and global population projections. Although the policy needs are different in their details, the demand for population and demographic data is remarkably similar between developed and developing countries. However, developed countries have easier ways to collect accurate data than do developing countries. The private sector increasingly uses demographic data to analyse consumer trends. Political parties and interest groups use the information to analyse public opinion. These activities are increasing in developing countries, especially middle income ones. D.22.2. Concepts and definitions D.22.2.1 Overview This chapter covers population and demographic statistics. The sector includes demography; vital statistics; population structures and growth; demographic projections; families and households (marriages, divorces and household size); and migration, refugees and asylum seekers. Other subjects covered include population density; urbanisation; and ethnic and cultural identities. The chapter excludes causes of death; and the methodology and organisation of population censuses. Two sets of statistics are needed to answer common policy questions: the numbers, age, sex, location and other characteristics of \u2022 the population; the changes in the population: the numbers of births and \u2022 deaths (vital statistics) and the numbers of people entering and leaving a country or region, migrants in particular. ",
        "D 338 Population and Migration Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Demography is the statistical study of human populations. It includes long-term projections of the structures of local, national and global populations. In most areas of statistics, statistical institutes carry out only very short-term projections. Population statistics produced by Eurostat present the range of published statistics and demographic projections: Demographic data on population and various demographic \u2022 events (births, deaths, marriages and divorces) broken down by several characteristics such as age, gender, legal marital status and educational attainment; Demographic indicators such as total fertility rate, life \u2022 expectancy at birth, age-dependency ratios, crude rates of births, deaths and population growth; Statistics on the population and housing censuses, offering \u2022 regional detail and several cross-tabulated data, are available every ten years from the censuses conducted in EU Member States; Population projections at national and regional level, \u2022 providing information on the likely future size and structure of the population, according to different what-if scenarios Migration and citizenship, including information on \u2022 population stocks by citizenship and country of birth, on migration flows by citizenship, country of birth and country of previous/next residence, and on acquisition of citizenship; Residence permits granted to non-EU citizens, \u2022 disaggregated by citizenship, length of validity and reasons for the permit being issued; Asylum statistics, including data on asylum applicants, first \u2022 instance and final decisions on applications, taking back or taking charge of asylum seekers; Statistics on the enforcement of immigration legislation, \u2022 providing data on non-EU citizens refused entry at the EU external borders or found to be illegally present, and on removals of non-EU citizens whose presence was unauthorised. The section on migration explains why differences exist between the statistics produced by migrant origin and destination countries. Population and demographic data come from a number of sources: population censuses; \u2022 population registers; \u2022 civil registration; \u2022 other administrative records; \u2022 social and demographic surveys. \u2022 In most countries, using a census to count the number of people present is still a main method of collecting population statistics. It is the main or only data source in many developing countries. The population census gives information about the numbers of people, their gender, age and location. The population census also provides the sample frame from which representative samples of the population are drawn for surveys. Surveys permit more frequent and detailed statistical analyses at lower cost than census questions. The description of the people in the population census provides the information used in setting up the sample frame. Correct response to the census is a legal requirement, in order that the population can be described accurately. Censuses may include questions about relationships, education, citizenship, previous residence, place of birth, ethnicity, language use and religion. Especially sensitive census questions may in certain circumstances be non-mandatory. Each extra question increases the census cost. The population census is the most likely statistical operation to be challenged politically, whether rightly or wrongly. It is therefore essential that the census is undertaken in a manner that is correct, coherent and transparent. For international comparison purposes, international recommendations exist for the conduction of censuses. A web portal has been set up for the 2010 World Population and Housing Census Programme to assist countries to share knowledge and information on census taking. This website also contains a Census Knowledge Base which provides guidance to countries. The global Marrakech Action Plan for Statistics (MAPS), discussed in section B.1.3.3, provided support to the 2010 census round. Key elements were: Develop an overall strategy for funding and conducting \u2022 censuses in low income countries. Research methods to estimate population regularly \u2022 Assist national statistical offices in census advocacy \u2022 Build national technical and management capacity \u2022 The 2010 World Population and Housing Census Programme website presents the outcome of these actions. D.22.2.2. Data sources: population registers; civil registration and vital statistics; and other data sources A vital statistics system is defined as the process of: collecting information by civil registration or enumeration a. on the frequency of occurrence of vital events, as well as relevant characteristics of the events themselves and of the person or persons concerned, and compiling, processing, analysing, evaluating, presenting b. and disseminating these data in statistical form. ",
        "D 339 Population and Migration Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 The vital events of interest are: live births, adoptions, legitimations, recognitions; deaths and foetal deaths; and marriages, divorces, separations and annulments of marriage. Civil registration is defined by the United Nations Statistics Division as: \u2018... the continuous, permanent, compulsory and universal recording of the occurrence and characteristics of vital events pertaining to the population \u2026. Civil registration is carried out primarily for the purpose of establishing the legal documents provided by the law. These records are also a main source of vital statistics. Complete coverage, accuracy and timeliness of civil registration are essential for quality vital statistics. A civil registration system refers to all institutional, legal, technical settings needed to perform the civil registration functions in a technical, sound, coordinated, and standardized manner throughout the country, taking into account cultural and social circumstances particular to the country .\u2019 The core document for vital statistics and civil registration is the United Nations Statistics Division publication Principles and recommendations for a vital statistics system, Revision 2. Its preface notes that: \u2018 Civil registration is a major foundation for a legal system for establishing the rights and privileges of individuals in a country. Where it is comprehensively maintained, it is the main source of vital statistics. \u2019 A population register records information, drawn from civil registers, about each member of the resident population. The population register can provide timely information about the size and characteristics of the population. In some developed countries, particularly in Scandinavia, population registers are accurate enough to be used to replace the population census. Although civil and population registers can be held on computers, few if any low income countries manage to maintain accurate records. Citizens may not comply with or even be aware of their obligation to register births and deaths. Registration is often impractical, especially for those who live in rural areas. Alternative data sources can be added to a vital statistics system. These include questions on fertility and mortality in population censuses or household sample surveys. Other sources are vital records from sample registration and health records. In some countries, indirect techniques of demographic estimation have been applied to these data sources. The resulting statistical indicators are used for planning purposes, mainly at the national level. Box 22.1: Improving civil registration and vital statistics in Africa In 2010, improving civil registration and vital statistics became a continental priority for statistics in Africa. Political support was given to the development and implementation of practical solutions through the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA). A workshop on civil registration and vital statistics took place in Tanzania in 2009. In August 2010, the First Conference of African Ministers Responsible for Civil Registration was convened. The ministers agreed that a functional civil registration system is the basis for building modern legal and public administration systems. It is the first step in collecting reliable vital statistics that are necessary for evidence-based policies for national development. Vital statistics compiled from civil registration systems are the building blocks to establish sustainable demographic and health statistics databases. The resulting information can be used to measure and monitor development results, including the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) (see section B.1.1.). Civil registration and vital statistics information are needed to implement the Reference Regional Strategic Framework for Statistical Capacity Building in Africa and the Marrakech Action Plan for Statistics. At the 6 th Africa Symposium on Statistical Development (ASSD) in November 2010, the National Statistical Offices of African States resolved to strengthen National Civil Registration and Vital Statistics Systems over the five years beginning in 2012. The Africa Centre for Statistics is supporting the improvement in African Civil Registration and Vital Statistics Systems (CRVS) . A medium term plan and work programme is being carried out.

The basic dataset consisted of the general population censuses of 2006 and of 1996. Two sets of projections were carried out: national and regional /provincial. The Spectrum Demproj software , which had been developed for the USAID Health Policy Initiative, was used for the projections. The 2006 census was used to estimate the population in mid-2007, keeping the values for births, deaths and migration. This was the starting point for the national projections. Fertility estimates were derived using Bongaarts fertility differential model. This is based on indices of marriage, contraception, induced abortion, and fertility after childbirth (postpartum fecundability). Contraceptive prevalence was estimated using the Burkina Faso 2003 Demographic and Health Survey . Future projections for contraceptive prevalence assumed values for increasing prevalence and effectiveness. Similarly, assumed values were imposed for marriage and fertility after childbirth. In the absence of data, abortion was assumed to be zero. The increase in life expectancy was imposed. The figure for migration was taken from the 2006 census. The regional and provincial population projections were based on the national projections. This was partly because these exist and partly because internal migration movements are difficult to model. The ratio method was used: this method projects forward the relative ratio or weight of each sub-national area. These ratios were then used to reconstruct the corresponding forecasts. This process required six steps: Projection of ratios and derivation of total numbers by region, 1. based on the census values of 1996 and 2006; Derivation of the total numbers by sex and by region; 2. For both sexes, derivation of numbers by age and by region; 3. Combination of the forecasts for both sexes; 4. Projection of ratios and derivation of total numbers by province, 5. based on the census values of 1996 and 2006; For both sexes, derivation of numbers by age and by province on 6. the basis of the regional gender ratios.

International Migration Statistics The core reference document is the Recommendations on Statistics of International Migration, Revision 1. This was published in 1998 by the United Nations Statistics Division in co-operation with Eurostat. The publication was a response to the growing size and importance of international migration. Governments wish to identify migration flows, measure the number of migrants and monitor changes over time. The statistics are intended to provide governments with a factual basis on which to formulate and implement sector policy. The \u2018Recommendations\u2019 recognise that migration statistics are currently often either non-existent or hard to interpret. Implementing the \u2018Recommendations\u2019 is needed to publish conceptually sound and comparable statistics. The document itself notes that this \u2018will take time\u2019. The range of government policies that can be affected by international migration is wide. Policy in reception countries tends to regulate immigration and manage migrants\u2019 stay, focusing on integrating migrants into the economy and society. The main interest in reception countries tends to be in the number of new arrivals and in the total number of foreigners present. There is usually less interest in the numbers of foreigners departing, unless this is a specific policy objective. Reception countries may therefore wish to collect statistics about: The numbers, characteristics and location of migrants. \u2022 The utilization of local services such as schools, health \u2022 facilities, welfare services, accommodation, etc.; The effect of migration on local employment and the \u2022 national labour market; The impact on the social security and pension systems and \u2022 their future liabilities. Tracking studies can be used to analyse the integration process. To protect their citizens abroad, countries of origin may wish to monitor migrants\u2019 arrangements prior to departure and living conditions afterwards. These countries may also want to collect information about intending and actual migrants and whether their stay is likely to be temporary or permanent; historically, they were less interested in their returning citizens. Emigration countries may also wish to collect information about migrants\u2019 remittances and their impact on savings, investment and local development. These policy considerations also apply to non-permanent migrants who work for defined time periods ranging from a few months to many years in reception countries, and who may or may not gain residency rights. These are often groups of workers organised on a bilateral basis between the origination and reception countries. Although these people are, by definition, usually not permanent migrants, the migration statistics framework needs to identify them correctly. The policy objectives of reception and emigration countries are therefore very different. This means that the two groups of countries are likely to collect different data. Nevertheless, there is a common interest in comparable and reliable migration data, as there is a common need to forecast the future actions of migrant populations and to understand the relation between migration and development. The \u2018Recommendations on Statistics of International Migration\u2019 identify (page 10) many of the key questions of interest to governments that migration statistics aim to answer. Not all of these questions will be relevant to each country but they provide a framework for the development of comparable statistics: What is the overall annual net gain or loss of population a. through international migration? How many international migrants are admitted annually? b. Which are their countries of origin? In countries having free establishment provisions for the c. citizens of selected States, how many migrants exercise such a right over the course of a year? What are their countries of origin? How many citizens emigrate every year? Which are their d. countries of destination? How many emigrant citizens return every year? From e. which countries are citizens returning? How many migrant workers are admitted annually? How f. many leave the country for good every year? How many persons in search of asylum arrive annually? g. How many international migrants are admitted on humanitarian grounds (including refugees)? How many persons are admitted for family reunification h. over a year? How many persons who do not qualify as tourists are i. admitted for periods shorter than a year? Among them, how many are allowed to work in the receiving country? What is the total number of international migrants in the j. country? How many of those international migrants are economically active? How many foreign citizens acquire citizenship of the k. reception country? Countries do not use the same criteria to determine who is an international migrant. This situation has long been recognized as a key source of inconsistency in international migration statistics.

        "D 342 Population and Migration Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Box 22.3: Definition of country of usual residence, of long-term international migrant and of short-term international migrant Country of usual residence The country in which a person lives, that is to say, the country in which he or she has a place to live where he or she normally spends the daily period of rest. Temporary travel abroad for purposes of recreation, holiday, visits to friends and relatives, business, medical treatment or religious pilgrimage does not change a person\u2019s country of usual residence. Long-term migrant A person who moves to a country other than that of his or her usual residence for a period of at least a year (12 months), so that the country of destination effectively becomes his or her new country of usual residence. From the perspective of the country of departure the person will be a long-term emigrant and from that of the country of arrival the person will be a long-term immigrant. Short-term migrant A person who moves to a country other than that of his or her usual residence for a period of at least 3 months but less than a year (12 months) except in cases where the movement to that country is for purposes of recreation, holiday, visits to friends and relatives, business, medical treatment or religious pilgrimage. For purposes of international migration statistics, the country of usual residence of short-term migrants is considered to be the country of destination during the period they spend in it. Source: \u2018Recommendations on Statistics of International Migration\u2019, Revision 1, United Nations Whereas migration flows can be defined in terms of the numbers of people changing their country of residence, stocks of migrants within the overall population can be defined according to citizenship or country of birth. Wherever possible, citizenship and country of birth should not be used as proxies for each other. Citizenship is widely recorded in administrative systems as this frequently impacts on a person\u2019s rights to enter, reside and work in a country. However, migrants can and often do change citizenship, often being granted the right to acquire the citizenship of the new country of residence after a number of years or following marriage to a national citizen. Depending on the specific national rules for acquiring citizenship, national citizens of the reporting country may also include many people who are foreign born and who were previously recorded as foreign citizens. It is therefore useful to collect statistics on acquisition of citizenship. Defining migrant stocks according to country of birth has the advantage that a person\u2019s place of birth is fixed and will not change. However, country of birth may not be well recorded in some administrative data sources. It should be noted that native-born persons might be foreign citizens \u2013 as many countries do not automatically grant citizenship to children born in their territory, with children instead taking the citizenship of their parents. Section 2.A of the \u2018Recommendations\u2019 (pages 19-24) provides \u2018A taxonomy of international inflows and outflows of people\u2019. This defines 18 categories of migrant inflows and outflows according to the entry status established by the receiving state. Box 22.4 is based on this categorisation; the basic concepts for migration statistics are those that are presented in Box 22.3. ",

        "D 344 Population and Migration Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 The following potential data sources for migration statistics are identified by the Recommendations: Population registers \u2022 Registers of foreigners \u2022 Issuance of residence permits \u2022 Issuance of work permits \u2022 Official clearance of departing migrant workers \u2022 Processing of requests for asylum \u2022 Records from regularization drives \u2022 Border statistics \u2022 Censuses \u2022 Household surveys \u2022 Reports to tax or social security authorities \u2022 Establishment business surveys \u2022 Registration of individuals in special insurance schemes \u2022 Reports from labour recruitment agencies \u2022 Apprehension and deportation statistics \u2022 Administrative statistics on foreign citizens acquiring the \u2022 citizenship of the destination country These can be summarised as: Administrative registers \u2022 Other administrative sources \u2022 Border collection \u2022 Household based field enquiries \u2022 The \u2018Recommendations\u2019 do not guide the user on how to obtain acceptable measures of undocumented or irregular migration. Involuntary migrants are usually undocumented. They are unlikely to leave a statistical trace such as by registering, sending remittances or using health facilities. Some national statistics institutes publish data on irregular migration. These should be considered to be estimates rather than statistics. D.22.3. Sources of data and metadata The key global source on population statistics and forecasts is the UN World Population Prospects database, 2008 revision . This is produced by the UN Population Division. It provides indicators and projections of total population and major demographic measures for the period 1950-2050 for all countries and regions. The United Nations Demographic Yearbook is produced by the UN statistics division. It provides more demographic variables than the Population database. Population projections are limited to two years. Occasionally, special topics are covered. Most recently this was the 2000 census round. Other global demographic publications are available from the UN Statistics Division\u2019s Demographic and Social Statistics website . Examples are the biannual vital statistics data and the World\u2019s Women reports. Data on the international migrant stock is also available on the UN Population Division website. Other global population and urbanisation data series and metadata can also be found on this website. The \u2018Recommendations on Statistics of International Migration\u2019 note that African statistics on migration are often missing, unavailable or not comparable. The World Bank\u2019s \u2018Leveraging Migration for Africa\u2019 (2011) makes the same point 67 . Properly carried out, the initiatives discussed in section D.22.5 below should start to address the absence of data. A key objective of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) is to enhance the capacity of governments to collect reliable and comprehensive statistics and data on migration and to advance understanding of migration issues more generally. The IOM also compiles migration statistics on issues such as resettlement, emergency and post- emergency repatriation, assisted voluntary return, health of migrants, and trafficking. The Population statistics portal on Eurostat\u2019s website provides a standard for demographic and migration data dissemination. It also contains a database of annual population, migration and other demographic data for the EU and about 25 other countries and territories. D.22.4. Analysing data quality and identifying problems The key question for population and demographic data is whether the terms used correspond to the usual international classifications. One example is whether the standard five-year age groups are adhered to: 0-4; 5-9; 10-14 etc. As we have seen, demographic data is of much higher quality if it is based on a universal and up to date population register. The source(s) of demographic data should be ascertained. The number of entries in the population register might be compared with the estimated population. In looking at international migration statistics, data concepts should be compatible with those laid out in the relevant recommendations. However, one should not look for completeness, as it is understood that most countries will only produce a subset of the migration statistics framework that suits their own and their partners\u2019 needs. A potential tool for validating results is to use mirror techniques between the two sides of international migration flows. 67 see \u2018Leveraging Migration for Africa \u2019, box 1.1 \u2018Problems with Data on African Migration\u2019 ",
        "D 345 Population and Migration Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 D.22.5. Improving sector statistics Historically, EU support for population and migration statistics has focused on the central issue of census funding. A high profile example was the support for the 2005/06 Nigeria Census Support Initiative , which had a budget of EUR 116.5 millions . A common implementation mechanism has been a contribution agreement with UNDP/UNFPA. The recent debate has focused on reducing census costs and on improving the dissemination and use of census data. Current aims are also to obtain better population statistics between censuses and to increase the availability of data on international migration. These objectives can be seen as complementary to support for population censuses. An important theme of census improvement has for some time been cost limitation 68 . This is because the cost of carrying out population censuses in developing and middle-income countries is high relative to other statistics activities. Low- and middle-income countries sometimes have difficulty in financing their census. The 2001 UNFPA/PARIS21 International Expert Group Meeting on Censuses included a critical appraisal of census costs, backed by examples in many developing countries. The objective of increasing both efficiency and census quality is carried through the MAPS objectives and activities referred to in section D.22.2. A second area of action has been on census dissemination and increased exploitation of census data. This was brought into focus by a 2003 UNFPA/PARIS21 International Expert Group Seminar , whose objectives were: review census data dissemination and use in the 2000 \u03bf round of censuses; establish partnerships between users and producers to \u03bf maximize use of census data; ensure quality population-based data are disseminated \u03bf and used for national planning, poverty reduction strategies, monitoring of national and international development goals PARIS21 has also prepared an advocacy video on population statistics: Population Census Dissemination: the African \u03bf Perspective part 1 Population Census Dissemination: the African \u03bf Perspective part 2 68 See in particular the UNFPA papers \u2018 Population and Housing Censuses - strategies for reducing costs\u2019 and \u2018 Counting the people: Constraining Census Costs and assessing alternative approaches\u2019 and the Census Knowledge Base papers Improving civil registration and vital statistics systems in low income countries, in particular in Africa, is becoming a major issue. There is little prior experience in supporting this type of action. The objective is to provide improved statistics between censuses and to reduce or eliminate the need for large-scale inter-censal surveys. Analysis should look at whether the information recording system proposed is realistic. Will the system be accessible to the citizens who need to record vital events? Will the resulting statistics be consistent with international recommendations? Utilising regional experience could help ensure that planned actions can be sustained. The current focus on civil registration and vital statistics in Africa is discussed further in Box 22.1. New technologies including mobile telephone based technologies - are starting to be applied in censuses and vital statistics. A seminar on \u2018New Technologies in Population and Housing Censuses: Country experiences\u2019 linked to the 42 nd session of the UN Statistical Commission was held in February 2011. The paper by the Brazilian Institute of Statistics and Geography (IBGE) on \u2018IT in the Brazilian 2010 Census\u2019 is of particular interest. In supporting demographic analysis, the outputs and the main data sources available need to be defined in the terms of reference. The analyst will need to justify not only the selection of an appropriate demographic tool but must also make clear how the model parameters are arrived at. EU support for developing migration statistics in other countries presupposes that there is a mutual interest in monitoring migration flows between the two parties. Both sides need to be clear what statistics can be produced to meet the data needs. In any case, the resulting statistics should be designed to follow international definitions. ",

Education statistics The chapter in brief This chapter covers education statistics as defined by section 1.3 of the UNECE Databases for International Statistical Activities (DISA 2010) (see also section B.4.3. of this Guide ). The data are educational participation, illiteracy, educational institutions and systems, human and financial resources invested in education, lifelong learning, vocational training and adult learning, impact of education, assessments of student performance. Due to the complex role of education statistics for social and economic development planning, national and international agencies are actively seeking to improve them in order to obtain a robust means for decision-making, monitoring and evaluation. The main issues of the education statistics centres on the quality of national statistics received as well as the quality of the internal systems for collection, processing, analysis and dissemination of the data and metadata. The chapter covers a wide range of education statistics. The chapter starts by identifying the main policy areas for which these statistics are used and continues by providing a user\u2019s view of the statistics involved. The chapter then identifies the main sources of data and information about methods, continues by discussing how to analyse the quality of the statistics in these fields and concludes with information on complementary sources. D.23.1. Policy applications: what education data is used for The education sector plays a complex role in a country\u2019s social and economic development, presenting both a challenge and an opportunity for sustainable development. A country\u2019s successful social and economic development depends notably on a robust and sustainable education system as skilled human capital is seen as a key factor to reduce unemployment and improve people\u2019s welfare. In addition, there is empirical evidence that shows that the education level of a country is positively linked with economic growth. Therefore, the design and implementation of an effective education system and reforms in the education sector are a priority of governments. Hence, national education statistics, as well as international ones, are instrumental to inform adequately these policy reforms. Education statistics are collected mainly by Governments and international institutions to design, implement, monitor and evaluate education policies. These statistics are used to assess the alignment of the capacity and performance of the education system to the national education program and also to assist in planning for further development of the education sector. The education statistics are used mainly to: (i) distinguish between the actors in the education systems (individual learners, instructional settings and learning environments, education service providers, the education system); (ii) measure learning outcomes for individuals and countries; and (iii) identify the policy issues (quality of educational outcomes, equity and opportunities, adequacy and effectiveness of resources management). Specifically, education statistics allow for an assessment of the: access to and participation in education; \u2022 demand for and supply of educational opportunities \u2022 (students, teachers,\u2026); individual learning outcomes; \u2022 impact of education on personal growth; \u2022 well-being of all education beneficiary (individual, \u2022 community, country) study of the causes in disparities, and their effect on social \u2022 and economic development. quality of the teaching and learning process; \u2022 internal efficiency of the education system; \u2022 concern for equity in education, \u2022 Box 23.1: Links between Education and Millennium Development Goals In 2000, a consensus was reached by experts from the United Nations Secretariat and IMF, OECD, the World Bank and 189 nations on a framework of 8 goals, 18 targets and 48 indicators to measure progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) (see section B.1.1.). In education, the following goals, targets and indicators are being monitored by the UNESCO Institute of Statistics (UIS): Goal 2. Achieve universal primary education Target 3: Ensure that, by 2015, children everywhere, boys and girls alike, will be able to complete a full course of primary schooling.

Concepts and definitions The education statistics discussed here include data on educational participation, illiteracy, educational institutions and systems, human and financial resources invested in education, lifelong learning, vocational training and adult learning, impact of education, assessments of student performance, etc. In order to promote common definitions and concepts of education statistics and enable international comparisons, UNESCO designed the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) and the current classification is the ISCED 97 adopted late 1997. In addition, a comprehensive list of education indicators , their definitions, purposes, calculation methods, and formulae have been developed and maintained by the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) . This guide is available in four languages (Arabic, English, French, and Spanish). In addition, the UIS also maintains a multilingual glossary of education statistics that provides just the translation of the main education concepts in the same four languages. Education, according to the ISCED 97, is defined as \u201corganised and sustained communication designed to bring about learning\u201d. The OECD Handbook of Internationally Comparative Education Statistics presented the ISCED 97 education classification under the following categories: Pre-primary education (ISCED 0). \u2022 Early Childhood Development Programmes (ECD) cover pre-primary education corresponding to ISCED level 0, and also all other school- or centre-based programmes involving organized activities aimed at encouraging children (before age of 5) to learn and for their emotional and social development. The aim of education at this level is fourfold: (i) to provide to children a first contact with the education system; (ii) to better prepare entry into primary school; (iii) to provide opportunities to introduce other programmes such as health, hygiene and nutrition; and (iii) to allow women to return sooner to the labour market or go back to their studies. Primary education (ISCED 1): \u2022 Primary education usually begins at age 5 and generally lasts for 4 to 6 years. Generally no previous formal education is required before entering primary education. This is generally one component of \u201cbasic school education\u201d, which in many countries corresponds to compulsory education. These programmes are normally designed to give students a sound basic education in reading, writing and mathematics along with an elementary understanding of other subjects such as history, geography, natural science, social science, arts and music. Secondary education (ISCED 2 and 3): \u2022 Secondary education is divided into two main programmes: lower secondary (ISCED 2) and upper secondary (ISCED 3). The lower secondary generally pursues the basic programmes of the primary level, although teaching is typically more subject-focused. Lower secondary education may be either \u201cterminal\u201d (i.e. preparing students for direct entry into working life) and / or \u201cpreparatory\u201d (i.e. preparing students for upper secondary education).This level can range from 2 to 6 years of schooling. The upper secondary education typically begins at the end of full- time compulsory education for those countries that have a system of compulsory education. More specialization may be observed at this level than at ISCED 2 and often teachers need to be more qualified or specialized. The entrance age to this level is typically 15 or 16 years. The educational programmes included at this level typically require the completion of about 9 years of full-time education (since the beginning of level 1) for admission or a combination of education and vocational or technical experience, with minimum entrance requirements the completion of level 2 or demonstrable ability to handle programmes at this level. Post-secondary non-tertiary education (ISCED 4): \u2022 Post- secondary education is generally designed to provide short (6 months to 2 years) technical or vocational training courses. Sometimes these programmes can also be intended as a preparation for tertiary education for students leaving secondary school without getting the normal certificate. Tertiary education (ISCED 5 and 6): \u2022 Tertiary education at level 5 programmes have an educational content more advanced than those offered at levels 3 and 4. Entry to these programmes normally requires the successful completion of secondary education level. Programmes at level 5 must have a cumulative theoretical duration of at least 2 years from the beginning of level 5 and does not lead directly to the award of an advanced research qualification. The level 6 is reserved for tertiary programmes that lead directly to the award of an advanced research qualification. The theoretical duration of these programmes is 3 years full- time in most countries (for a cumulative total of at least 7 years FTE at the tertiary level), although the actual enrolment time is typically longer. Numerous statistical indicators are collected in order to give a complete overview of education system. The main indicators are: Adult Literacy Rate (ALR): \u2022 The ALR is the percentage of total population aged 15 years and over who can both read and write with an understanding of a short simple statement on his/her everyday life. Generally, \u2018literacy\u2019 also encompasses \u2018numeracy\u2019, which is the ability to make simple arithmetic calculations. The ALR shows the accumulated achievement of primary education and literacy programmes in imparting basic literacy skills to the ",
        "D 351 Education Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 population, thereby enabling them to apply such skills in daily life and to continue learning and communicating using written words. Literacy represents a potential for further intellectual growth and contribution to the economic-socio-cultural development of a society. Youth Literacy Rate (YLR) \u2022 or - Literacy rate of 15-24 year-olds: The YLR is defined as the percentage of the population aged 15 to 24 years old who can both read and write, with understanding of a short, simple statement about their everyday life. YLRs are increasingly used to assess the impact of primary education as well as the speed with which illiteracy can be eradicated. In general, literacy data can measure the achievement of literacy programs and primary education. School \u2022 - Life Expectancy (SLE): The SLE is a measure of how many years of education the average population of a country receives in their lifetime. It is used to compare and assess the development of a country. Transition Rate (TR): \u2022 The TR conveys information on the rate of access (or transition) from one cycle of education to a higher one. This is expressed as the percentage of pupils who graduate from one level of education and move on to the next higher level (from primary to intermediate; or from intermediate to secondary). Net Enrolment Rate \u2022 ( NER ): The NER is defined as the enrolment of the official age-group for a given level of education expressed as a percentage of the total population from the same age group. A high NER implies a high degree of participation of the official school-age population. Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER): \u2022 The GER is defined as the total enrolment, regardless of age, expressed as a percentage of the official school-age population for a given level. The GER shows general levels of participation in education. When net (aged-based) enrolment data are not available, gross enrolment can be used as a substitute indicator. This data can also be compared to net enrolment figures to indicate the extent of over- and under- aged enrolment. A GER of 100% or more indicate that a country is, in principle, able to accommodate all of its school-age population. Repetition Rate (RR): \u2022 The RR is the proportion of pupils who enrol in the same grade/year more than once to the total number of pupils/students enrolled in that grade/ year during the previous year. The RR helps to measure the effect on the internal efficiency of educational systems. Dropout Rate by Grade (DR): \u2022 It is the proportion of pupils from a cohort enrolled in a given grade at a given school year, but who are no longer enrolled in the following school year. The DR measures the trend of pupils leaving school without completion, and its effect on the internal efficiency of educational systems. In addition, it is one of the key indicators for analysing and projecting pupil flows from grade to grade within the educational cycle. Survival Rate (SR) \u2022 - It is the percentage of pupils enrolled in the first grade of a given level or cycle of education in a given school year who reach the final grade at the end of the required number of years of study. The SR measures the retention capacity and internal efficiency of an education system. It illustrates the situation regarding retention of pupils (or students) from grade to grade in schools, and conversely the magnitude of dropouts by grade. Public expenditure on education as % of total government \u2022 expenditure : It is the total public expenditure on education (current and capital) expressed as a percentage of total government expenditure (current and capital) in a given financial year. This indicator assesses a government\u2019s policy emphasis on education relative to the perceived value of other public investments. It reflects also the commitment of a government to invest in human capital development. Public current expenditure per pupil as % of GNP per \u2022 capita . It represents public current expenditure per pupil (or student) at each level of education, expressed as a percentage of GNP per capita in a given fiscal year. This indicator contributes to assess a country\u2019s investment in its human capital development and to measure the relative emphasis placed by the country on a particular level of education Pupil \u2022 - Teacher Ratio (PTR): The PTR is the average number of pupils (students) per teacher at a specific level of education in a given school year. It measures the level of human resources input in terms of the number of teachers in relation to the size of the pupil population. Percentage of female teachers \u2022 : it is the number of female teachers at a given level of education expressed as a percentage of the total number of teachers (male and female) at the same level in a given school year. This indicator shows the gender composition of the teaching force. It helps also in assessing the need for opportunities and/or incentives to encourage women to participate in teaching activities at a given level of education. Gender Parity Index (GPI) \u2022 - Ratio of girls to boys: The GPI is the ratio of female to male values of a given indicator. It measures progress towards gender parity in education participation and/or learning opportunities available for women in relation to those available to men. It also reflects the level of women\u2019s empowerment in society. ",
        "D 352 Education Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Box 23.2: The Education for All Development Index (EDI) While each of the six Education For All (EFA) goals adopted in 2000 matters in its own right, the commitment undertaken by governments at the World Education Forum in Dakar (Senegal) was to sustain advances on all fronts. The Education for All Development Index (EDI) provides a composite measure of progress, encompassing access, equity and quality. Because of data availability constraints, it includes only the four most easily quantifiable goals, attaching an equal weight to each: universal primary education (goal 2), measured by the primary \u2022 adjusted net enrolment ratio (ANER); adult literacy (first part of goal 4), measured by the literacy rate for \u2022 those aged 15 and above; gender parity and equality (goal 5), measured by the gender- \u2022 specific EFA index (GEI), an average of the gender parity indexes of the primary and secondary gross enrolment ratios and of the adult literacy rate; quality of education (goal 6), measured by the survival rate to \u2022 grade 5. The EDI value for a given country is the arithmetic mean of the four proxy indicators. It falls between 0 and 1, with 1 representing full EFA achievement. EDI = 1/4 primary adjusted net enrolment ratio (ANER) + 1/4 adult literacy rate + 1/4 gender-specific EFA index (GEI) + 1/4 survival rate to grade 5 For example, results for goals on which a country has made less progress can offset its advances on others. Since all the goals are equally important for Education for All to be achieved as a whole, a synthetic indicator such as the EDI is thus very useful to inform the policy debate on the prominence of all the Education for All goals and to highlight the synergy among them. Calculating the EDI: Let\u2019s assume a country with a primary adjusted net enrolment rate, adult literacy rate, GEI and a survival rate to grade 5 of values 0.998, 0.979, 0.971 and 0.998, respectively. The resulting EDI would then be 0.987: EDI = 1/4 (0.998) + 1/4 (0.979) + 1/4 (0.971) + 1/4 (0.998)= 0.987 D.23.3. Sources of data Education statistics are collected from two main sources: (i) Administrative data and periodic school surveys; and (ii) Population censuses and household surveys. Administrative data are the primary country\u2019s source of education statistics and cover the whole country on an annual basis. These data are based on school reporting, generally at the beginning of the school year. School- based surveys focus on pupils only with no information on household characteristics and children who do not attend school. The shortcomings of these data are their quality in terms of coverage, which is often incomplete, thus impairing the accuracy of the statistics, and their comparability between countries, which is limited when the statistical definitions used are not in line with the agreed international standards. Population censuses and household surveys provide a good complement to administrative data. Indeed, individual and household information collected through these surveys are instrumental to better analyze education data. Also, information on children\u2019s background and schooling decision can also be assessed. However, these data refer to the resident population and not to the education system; it may be difficult to relate these data to other education statistics for two reasons. The first is that the situation of the resident population concerning education may reflect the education system of another country, in case of immigrants, while missing some of the persons who were educated in the country, emigrants. This is as relevant as the migration flows are significant. The second reason is that the results of general population surveys refer to an age cohort of the population which may have been subject to the educational systems in very different moments in time, while statistics on the educational systems refer to their situation in one specific school or academic year. Internationally comparable education statistics are mainly administrative data, collected through data collections run by international institutions. The UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) uses a questionnaire to collect, annually, these data with the relevant national authorities of 200 countries (for example, Ministries of Education, Ministries of Finance or the National Library). The UIS education database , with more than 200 countries and territories, is the most comprehensive education data set in the world. It covers all education levels and a range of issues such as gender parity, teachers and financing. Worldwide statistics on education are collected through three major data collections: UIS \u2022 survey: The UIS education survey questionnaires are sent to UNESCO Member States/Countries annually. The questionnaires are based on international standards, classifications and measures that are regularly reviewed and modified by the UIS in order to address emerging statistical issues and improve the quality of data. UOE survey: \u2022 UNESCO-UIS, the OECD and Eurostat (UOE) have jointly administered this annual data collection since 1993. The UOE questionnaire compiles data from high- and middle-income countries that are generally members or partner countries of the OECD or the European Union. The UOE survey gathers more detailed education statistics and allows for production of a wider set of indicators. WEI programme \u2022 : The World Education Indicators (WEI) programme provides a platform for middle income countries to develop a critical mass of policy- relevant education indicators beyond the global core set of education statistics. This also allows for direct comparisons to countries participating in the UOE survey as the collection of data from the countries included in the WEI programme is based on the same common set of definitions, instructions and methods agreed by UIS, OECD and Eurostat for the UOE.

        "D 353 Education Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Literacy statistics for adults aged 15 years and older and for youth aged 15 to 24 years are available from national population censuses, household surveys and estimates using the UIS Global Age-Specific Literacy Projections Model (GALP). The methodology to implement this survey is discussed in the report \u201c Global Age-Specific Literacy Projections Model (GALP): Rationale, Methodology and Software \u201d. Statistics on educational attainment for the population aged 25 years and older are based on national population censuses or surveys. Population data are based on the World Population Prospects by the United Nations Population Division (UNPD). Data on economic indicators such as gross domestic product (GDP) can be obtained from the World Bank and education public expenditure from the UIS. Data on teachers and the curriculum have been collected since the early 1990s by the OECD through its \u201cTeachers and the Curriculum\u201d survey. Data cover: (i) Compulsory and non-compulsory intended instruction time for students; (ii) Teachers working time and teaching time; and (iii) Annual statutory teacher compensation. Box 23.3: Overview of ISCED-97 Each country\u2019s education system is dynamic and changes frequently in structure and curricular content. International comparison is thus difficult for policy makers. The international initiatives to facilitate comparisons of education statistics and indicators of different countries, on the basis of uniform and internationally agreed definitions, are coordinated by the UNESCO since it first designed the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED 76) in the early 1970. The current version, ISCED 97 is an improved, integrated and consistent statistical framework for the collection and reporting of internationally comparable education statistics. The coverage of ISCED- 97 extends to all organised and sustained learning opportunities for children, youth and adults, including those with special educational needs, irrespective of the institutions or organisations providing them or the form in which they are delivered. The mapping of country (national) data to those of the ISCED 97 is critical to ensure the meaningfulness of the education data. Hence to provide a clear guidance to OECD countries on how to implement the ISCED 97 framework in international data collection, OECD published a complementary guide, \u201c Classifying educational programmes: Manual for the implementation of ISCED-97 in OECD countries \u201d (OECD, 1999) to accompany the UNESCO ISCED 97 Manual . However, the dynamics of this sector raises some classifications issues in terms of system expansion and diversity. The ISCED 97 is currently being revised and the final recommendations will be presented to the UNESCO General Conference in 2011. Data on educational attainment of the adult population are collected as part of the Annual Labour Statistics data request, which is conducted by the OECD in February/ March each year. The National Statistical Offices provide data on employment, unemployment and population by National Educational Attainment Categories (NEAC), by gender and age groups. Data are derived from National Labour Force Surveys. They are mapped to ISCED-97 levels of attainment using the agreed mapping from NEAC to ISCED-97 standardized levels of attainment established by the Network B of the OECD education indicator project after consultation with country representatives. Work status is reported according to the International Labour Organization (ILO) guidelines and definitions of employment and unemployment. In addition to public examinations at the end of educational cycles, some countries implement national assessments to have a comprehensive view of the learning standard and the system performance. These national assessments are sometimes linked with regional or international evaluations which allow comparisons of education systems. Beside these sources of general statistical data, several initiatives assess general or specific learning outcomes, including: The Monitoring Learning Achievement \u2022 (MLA) is a project developed by UNICEF and UNESCO in nearly 50 countries in areas of Literacy, Numeracy and Life Skills. The MLA is part of the Education For All (EFA) assessment. The \u2022 Southern Africa Consortium for Monitoring Education Quality (SACMEQ) . Fifteen ministries of education in Southern and Eastern Africa share experiences, monitor and evaluate the conditions of schooling and the quality of education with technical assistance from UNESCO International Institute for Educational Planning (IIEP). The \u2022 Programme d\u2019Analyse des Syst\u00e8mes Educatifs (PASEC) . Created in 1991, this programme aims to assess learning skills in Francophone Africa and Indian Ocean. The \u2022 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) . Since 1995, TIMSS reports every four years on the achievement of fourth and eighth grade students. It is an international assessment of student achievement in mathematics and science involving more than 60 countries all around the world. The evaluations are organized around two dimensions, a content dimension specifying the domains or subject matter to be assessed (number, algebra, geometry, data, biology, chemistry, physics, and earth science) a cognitive dimension specifying the domains or thinking processes to be assessed (knowing, applying, and reasoning)... The \u2022 Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) assesses the reading comprehension for students in their fourth year of formal schooling for 40 countries. The \u2022 Laboratorio Latino-Americano de la Evaluaci\u00f3n de Calidad de la Educaci\u00f3n (LLECE) . Since 1994 with the support of UNESC, the LLECE organises regional evaluations on teacher policies and pedagogical practices in the Latin America and Caribbean Region. ",
        "D 354 Education Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 The \u2022 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) , collected for the first time in 2000, is a three-yearly survey of the knowledge and skills of 15-year-olds in the main industrialised countries. It assesses young people\u2019s capacity to use their knowledge and skills in order to meet real-life challenges and, specifically, assesses literacy in reading, mathematics and science. The assessments are conducted through students sitting pencil and paper tests in their schools. The students and principals of the schools also answer questions about themselves and their schools allowing analysis of the factors that influence good and bad performance. Other sources of education data include: World Bank: \u2022 EdStats - Education Statistics Database OECD: \u2022 Centre for Educational Research and Innovation (CERI) European Commission: \u2022 Eurydice - European Network for Information in Education UNESCO: \u2022 International Bureau of Education (IBE) International Labour Organization (ILO \u2022 ) Regarding the dissemination of education statistics, various international organisations publish education statistics for their member countries. The UNESCO Institute of Statistics (UIS) has the mandate to monitor progress towards Education For All (EFA) and education-related MDGs. The statistics, which are updated twice a year, are used by diverse partners, including governments, donor agencies and other UN organizations. In particular, the UIS is the primary education data source for the Education for All Global Monitoring Report , the World Development Indicators and the Human Development Report . The UNESCO Institute for Statistics\u2019 Global Education Digest (GED) presents a rich set of cross-nationally comparable data compiled by the UIS as well as information from household surveys and assessments of learning achievement that capture different dimensions of gender disparities. The GED also introduces several new indicators, such as the adjusted net intake rate and the adjusted net enrolment rate that have refined or replaced existing indicators as part of an ongoing effort by the UIS to ensure more reliable and accurate measures. The OECD publishes on an annual basis Education at a Glance: OECD Indicators that enables countries to compare themselves in terms of other countries\u2019 performances. It provides a rich, comparable and an up-to-date array of indicators on systems and represents the consensus of professional thinking on how to measure the current state of education internationally.

        "D 355 Education Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Box 23.4: Case study: Southern and Eastern Africa Consortium for Monitoring Educational Quality (SACMEQ) The SACMEQ is an international non-profit developmental organisation of 15 Ministries (Botswana, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Seychelles, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania (Mainland), Tanzania (Zanzibar), Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe) of Education in Southern and Eastern Africa. The SACMEQ\u2019s mission is \u201cTo undertake integrated research and training activities that will expand opportunities for educational planners and researchers to: (a) receive training in the technical skills required to monitor, evaluate, and compare the general conditions of schooling and the quality of basic education; and (b) generate information that can be used by decision-makers to plan the quality of education.\u201d Two key targets are drawn from this mission statement. Firstly, the main target audiences for SACMEQ\u2019s activities were \u201ceducational planners and researchers\u201d. Second, the substantive content of SACMEQ\u2019s activities was divided into two main areas: \u201ctraining\u201d (in technical skills) and \u201cinformation generation\u201d (for use by decision-makers). The Evolution of SACMEQ and Its Research and Training Programmes have evolved over the past 20 years in harmony with the increased scope and complexity of the four research and training projects in which it has been involved. This evolution has four phases: (i) an \u201cInnovate\u201d phase (1989- 1994) in which the IIEP worked with a single country on an innovative experimental educational research and training project designed to address a major educational challenge related to planning the quality of education; (ii) the \u201ccollaborate\u201d phase (1995-2004) where the IIEP encouraged several countries in the same region to work together on a mutually beneficial multi-country replication of the earlier experiment that drew upon lessons learned; (iii) the \u201cconsolidate phase\u201d (1995-2004) where the control of participating countries over the whole of the research and training process is strengthened; and (iv) Finally there was the \u201cLaunch\u201d (began in 2005) phase in which the participating countries assumed overall control of research and training directions, and began to make their own professional decisions about who assisted them and how they were to be assisted. The use of SACMEQ research and training resources by ministries, international organizations, bilateral organizations, universities, and individual researchers and planners is increasing. A couple of examples are presented below: Use of SACMEQ By Ministries of Education . The research reports from SACMEQ\u2019s first two educational policy research projects (see References) have been used extensively within the participating countries as a resource for education sector studies and as baseline information that can be employed in policy discussions and debates about the conditions of schooling and the quality of education. Murimba (2005), Nzomo and Makuwa (2006), and Oduol (2006) have provided reviews of the use of these reports by the SACMEQ Ministries of Education. Use of SACMEQ by International/Bilateral Organizations. SACMEQ\u2019s Data Archives and reports have been used by organizations such as UNESCO (2004; 2005; 2006; 2007; and 2008), the World Bank (2006), the Asian Development Bank (Hirosato, 2001), and the DFID Edqual Project (Yu and Thomas, 2007) in order to discuss and evaluate policy options related to the quality of education. Use of SACMEQ by Universities. In 2005 the IIEP arranged seminar presentations for professors and graduate students in African universities in order to demonstrate how to use the SACMEQ Data Archive for the preparation of master theses and doctoral dissertations. Since that time there has been a steady flow of postgraduate work based on SACMEQ data at institutions such as the University of Bourgogne, Bristol University, the University of Cape Town, the University of Gothenburg, the University of Melbourne, the University of Pretoria, the University of Stellenbosch, the University of Western Australia, and the University of the Western Cape. Use by Individual Educational Planners and Researchers . The SACMEQ Data Archive and SACMEQ Website are very popular with educational planners and researchers from many countries. Both of these resources contain valuable research data, research tools, publications, software, and training materials. It is estimated that hundreds of downloads of the modules have occurred \u2013 by users in universities, teachers colleges, and research units located in both developed and developing countries.

        "D 356 Education Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 D.23.4. Analysing data quality and identifying problems The main education data used at the international level are national administrative data. These data are frequently combined with data from national surveys on educational institutions, compiled and further processed by international institutions. The quality of these data depend on several factors: the quality of national statistics received, as well as the quality of the internal systems for collection, processing, analysis and dissemination of the data and metadata. In addition, the comparability of education data may be impacted by differences between countries\u2019 educational systems. Each of these factors needs to be adequately addressed in order to obtain quality education statistics. While the first factor depends principally on the country, the second one relies on the relevant international institutions (OECD, UNESCO, World Bank,\u2026). At the national level, the quality of education statistics is linked to the adequacy of national data sources and the extent to which international data definitions and guidelines are correctly applied. Hence, the challenges of education statistics at the national level are three-fold: A mismatch between the coverage of the national sources \u2022 and the ISCED definition; A difference between the school/academic year to which \u2022 the statistics refer, the point in time that the data were collected and the date on which the count of students is taken, may all differ from the international requirements. National data item definitions ( \u2022 e.g. a teacher, a graduate, a programme) and their classifications ( e.g. programme level, type of educational personnel) may be different to those required internationally. Another challenge at the national level may come from the difficulty of comparability of the statistics over time for the following reasons: (i) changes in the educational system (such as the implementation of reforms that lead to an increase in the stock of students); (ii) changes in the coverage of the data collection (inclusion/exclusion of programs,\u2026); and (iii) changes in the methodology used. Addressing the above-mentioned challenges is not an easy task and requires the implementation of several actions as follows: Ensuring that countries are provided with detailed data \u2022 definitions and data reporting advice and guidance; Allowing for data collection tools to include sufficient \u2022 disaggregated levels of sub-classifications in areas where it is known to be difficult for countries to provide the required data; Providing clear guidance on the reporting of missing data; \u2022 Requesting the data providers, whenever possible, to \u2022 provide metadata; Mapping countries\u2019 national educational programs to the \u2022 ISCED levels; Including automated verification checks if the \u2022 questionnaires are electronic; D.23.5. Improving sector statistics There is no rule-of-thumb for building a statistical action in the education sector of any developing country; in other words each country will have its own challenges, which will need to be addressed accordingly. Nonetheless, the overarching goal of any statistical task in the education sector should be to improve the quality, accuracy and timeliness of the statistics. In most developing countries, Educational Management Information Systems (EMIS) are established to collect, process and analyse statistical data on the educational system to improve planning within the sector and guide the formulation of educational policy reforms. Thus statistical actions in the sector should focus on strengthening the EMIS in order for the education statistics to meet the requirements of the end-users. The design and implementation of an effective EMIS are expensive and complex. Thus, it is instrumental to take into consideration the needs of all the groups that will provide and/or use these statistics (Ministry of planning, Finance, regional and district education offices, donors and NGOs). To be effective, an EMIS should be driven by national needs and not donor requirements. Education statistics provided by any EMIS should be timely and complete in order to ensure a good quality and for the data to be useful. Hence, there is a need to strengthen these EMIS. Several roadmaps can be implemented to improve education data collection. One of these roadmaps consists of the following steps: Ensure the collection and analysis of educational data, as 1. possible. If not in place, establish a data collection unit within the 2. education authority to co-ordinate data collection at all levels. Assess the status of EMIS nationally. Consider any 3. needed improvements and seek assistance as appropriate to strengthen national capacity in this area. Conduct data analysis to produce indicators to guide policy 4. makers and provide recommendations for practitioners to improve the quality of educational provision. Educational authorities should seek, obtain and share 5. statistical data concerning nationals ",
        "D 357 Education Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Box 23.5: Suggestions for the estimation of missing data There are broadly five situations in which missing values might arise: Data not collected for a variable: \u2022 It may be possible to generate an estimate by formulating assumptions with data available. For example, if the students\u2019 age distribution is not available but the grade distribution is, it is a logical to assume that all students in the same grade are of the same age. Data not available for the desired level of aggregation: \u2022 A feasible approach may be to scale up the sub-national figures to national level using a scaling factor derived from a different, but related dataset. For example partial student enrolment numbers could be scaled up on the basis of student data from labour force surveys or from the results of an ad-hoc survey. Data may be available only for certain sub-populations \u2022 : Similar to the previous situation where the same potential solution could be applied. For example, certain data may be available for public schools and government-dependent private schools but not for independent private schools and they could be scaled up as described above. Data not available for the desired level of disaggregation \u2022 : For example, expenditures data may not be available for each level of education separately but can be apportioned to the corresponding levels based on student enrolments in the respective levels. Data may not be available for the year of the data collection \u2022 : In this case, it may be possible to estimate the data on the basis of data from previous years. In all cases, when choosing a technique to estimate missing data, thought needs to be given to the use to which the data will be put, particularly in indicator calculations. For example, using student numbers as a basis for estimating missing expenditure data would be inappropriate if the estimated expenditure data were then to be used calculate expenditure per student. Specific data items which most commonly require estimation are: (i) Retirement expenditure (particularly in unfunded or partially funded schemes); (ii) Household expenditures on education (these are most commonly derived from national household expenditure surveys); (iii) Private employer expenditure on training of apprentices and other combined school and work-based training programmes.

Health statistics The chapter in brief This chapter covers the full range of health statistics and their direct uses in indicators such as those of the MDGs. A wide range of health statistics inform policy areas covered by the European Consensus on Development (see section B.1.5.1). The relationship between data collection and policy formation is covered. The chapter proceeds by using the MDG indicators and health accounts as the frameworks for health statistics publications and use. The chapter continues by covering administrative and survey- based statistics in some depth. The difficulties of coordinating health statistics collection and publication are also covered. An example of improvement in the coverage of administrative health statistics is provided. A check-list to analyse statistical quality is shown. Indicators for improving health statistics are given. An example of the application of mobile telephone technology to data collection is provided. D.24.1. Policy applications: what this data is used for The health statistics presented in this chapter have a variety of uses, notably: Analysing the health situation of the people and identifying \u2022 and quantifying health care activities and resources and the causes of death as a basis for policy preparation; Assessing the outcome of health policies; \u2022 Enabling health expenditure to be distributed between \u2022 regions so that people can have similar expectations for health and longevity; Ensuring output of health expenditure; \u2022 Assessing links between health care and social structures \u2022 to inform social policies; Assessing links between health and individual behaviour \u2022 to inform public health education; Quantify, locate and monitor epidemics to provide early \u2022 warning systems (locally, nationally and globally) and support emergency response; Providing information to vital statistics (birth and death \u2022 recording) systems for population statistics (see chapter D.19 on population statistics); Providing international comparisons through the \u2022 Millennium Development Goals indicators (see section B.1.1); Preparing and monitoring sector health programmes. \u2022 This list shows that health statistics have a wide range of demands within health and social policy areas. Timely and relevant statistics are essential to formulate, implement and monitor health policy actions. In the absence of this data, it is easy to misdirect limited health funds. In many developing countries, the challenge to meet these policy needs is overwhelming. Other statistics collectors have intervened, such as donor-supported international agencies and charitable organisations. Therefore, an important policy objective regarding health statistics is to ensure effective coordination of the various interventions. D.24.2. Concepts and definitions D.24.2.1 Overview Health statistics cover a wide range of health-related topics. These include life expectancy, health status, health and safety, health determinants (including lifestyle, nutrition, smoking, alcohol abuse), health resources and expenditure, health care systems, morbidity and mortality (including infant and child mortality), hospital admission, causes of illness and death, specific diseases (e.g. AIDS), disabilities, pharmaceutical consumption and sales, health personnel, remuneration of health professions, environmental health status, health inequality, health accounts. The first basic type of health statistics consists of administrative statistics . These consist of the records produced in the course of admitting, treating and discharging patients from hospitals, doctors\u2019 surgeries and other health centres; and the records produced in the course of the management of health institutions. Other health statistics are based on health surveys , directly collecting information about health status and determinants from a random sample of the target population. As record keeping and data provision to statistics agencies improves, survey-based data tends to be replaced by statistics from administrative sources. However, even in developed countries, health surveys are rarely completely replaced. The two types of data sources are in principle complementary and can be used to validate other results. Health indicators , such as life expectancy and child mortality, are usually based on a number of data sources. However, in low income countries, the data are often based on the results of single surveys, making these critically important to decision making. The best known of these in a global setting are the MDG indicators . The System of Health Accounts (SHA) has been developed to analyse the adequacy of resource levels for health care and the way that those resources are used. ",
        "D 362 Health Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Box 24.1: Classifications and nomenclatures relevant to health statistics The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is the standard to categorize diseases. The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed a Handbook on monitoring and evaluation of human resources for health and several other tools for monitoring and developing human resources for health (HRH) . WHO uses 9 occupational categories for the health workforce (18 occupational categories are available for some countries, differentiating some categories according to skill level and specialization): physicians; \u2022 nursing and midwifery personnel; \u2022 dentistry personnel; \u2022 pharmaceutical personnel; \u2022 laboratory health workers; \u2022 environmental and public health workers; \u2022 community and traditional health workers; \u2022 other health service providers; and \u2022 health management and support workers, that is, those who do \u2022 not provide services directly but are critical to the performance of health systems. The International Classification for Health Accounts (ICHA), developed by the OECD, covers three dimensions of health care: Health care function \u2022 s (ICHA-HC); Health care service provider industrie \u2022 s (ICHA-HP); Sources of financing of health car \u2022 e (ICHA-HF) D.24.2.1 Administrative data on health Administrative data on health consists of all the data that is regularly collected by hospitals and other health facilities. It covers data on the available beds and other medical facilities, the numbers of doctors and paramedical staff, the numbers of patients admitted, treated and discharged and records of births and deaths within health facilities. Records of cases of notifiable diseases and health situations are also included. These data are usually reported to the Ministry of Health or a similar agency, to provide information on health issues and for management purposes. Health facility assessments cover the number of hospital beds and other health facilities in use. These data are often collected infrequently, such as annually, since changes are comparatively rare. Health staff numbers are also collected and classified: the numbers of doctors, dentists, nurses, paramedical staff, community health workers, pharmaceutical personnel and so on. Hospitals and other health facilities maintain records of consultations / inpatient admissions, medical condition according to classification, length of stay and discharge. Surveillance (sentinel) systems monitor the occurrence of specific medical conditions to assess the stability or change in health levels of a population. The resulting statistics permit the study of disease rates in a specific cohort, geographic area, population subgroup, etc. to estimate trends in the larger population. The WHO International Health Regulations (IHR) require notification of health events defined by specific diseases and according to a set of criteria. Biometric information and patient history information collected systematically from patients can be considered as part of the heath administrative dataset. The vital statistics system, based on the register of births and deaths, is a key potential source of administrative information on cause of death. However, this data source is rarely reliable in low income countries (see section D.19.2.). Records of attended births and deaths in health facilities, especially hospitals, may be more reliable but cannot be used as unbiased indicators for the population as a whole. Administrative health data are often combined with data from other sources, notably population data, to obtain indicators based on ratios. These ratios include number of doctors, community health workers or hospital beds available per 10 000 population, nationally or within a province / region. Health indicators may also be derived from combining two administrative data series, such as percentage hospital bed occupancy. Health facility expenditure data, the source of financing of treatment and of facilities are key components of the national health accounts. This information may be drawn from administrative data sources, such as hospital financial records. National Health Accounts are discussed below in section D.24.2.5. The WHO World Health Statistics Indicator Compendium provides detailed definitions of the health related data series collected from national agencies, usually Ministries of Health, and used in its own publications. The preferred data sources and alternatives to them are identified. In recent years, private health facilities in many low and middle income countries have greatly increased in number and in the range of treatments offered, from pharmacies through to hospitals. Facilities supported and organised by external non-governmental organisations may also consider themselves as operating outside the national health system. Data collection from these facilities may be difficult. Such difficulties were observed during data collection for Malawi\u2019s national health accounts, discussed in Box 24.3. below. Administrative data on health are primary collected for current treatment and management of the health facility, not statistical analysis. This may lead to a number of problems for using these data for health statistics. Data definitions may not follow current classifications. Public health reporting systems may under-report infectious diseases and private institutions may not report at all. Transmission of data may not be consistent and timely. Health district boundaries may differ from provincial/regional boundaries and any location ",
        "D 363 Health Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 data may be insufficient to compensate for this. Ministry of Health officials may not have the skills to compile and validate the basic statistics nor to calculate indicators. In addition, the NSI may produce \u2018competing\u2019 publications to those of the Health Ministry. Statistical analysis, particularly epidemiology, is a major use of administrative data. If these data are insufficient, incorrectly collated or not present, such analysis is not possible. Demands for increased statistical collection are both continual and costly, in developing countries as in developed countries. Nevertheless, examples of the successful analytic exploitation of administrative health data can easily be found. 69 D.24.2.2 Sample surveys on health A number of international methodologies exist for sample surveys that include a major health component. In principle, the methodology of these surveys should be incorporated into the national practice, so that a nationally organised survey may follow the methodology. A major survey is ideally conducted once every five years. An interim survey is sometimes conducted, considering a specific issue and providing updated data. The WHO \u2022 World Health Survey provides a global system of health surveys. Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS \u2022 ) aim to collect and disseminate accurate, nationally representative data on fertility, family planning, maternal and child health, gender, HIV/AIDS, malaria, and nutrition. Other surveys carried out by the Measure DHS programme include the AIDS Indicator Survey and subject specific surveys. Primary funding is from USAID; other donors include the UK DfID. Multi-indicator cluster surveys (MICS \u2022 ) are supported by UNICEF which assists countries in collecting and analyzing data on the situation of children and women. The MICS aim at enabling countries to produce statistically sound and internationally comparable estimates of a range of indicators in the areas of health, education, child protection and HIV/AIDS. The current survey round, MICS4, is carried out during 2009-2011. It aims at monitoring progress toward national goals and global commitments, including more than twenty of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). MICS4 survey questions and modules are harmonized with DHS to ensure a coordinated approach to survey implementation, in order to provide comparability across surveys and to avoid duplication of efforts. 69 For example,\u2019 Cancer control in developing countries: using health data and health services research to measure and improve access, quality and efficiency\u2019 by Timothy P Hanna and Alfred CT Kangolle, BMC International Health and Human Rights 2010, 10:24 The World Bank \u2022 Core Welfare Indicators Questionnaire (CWIQ) survey contains only a limited number of health questions. The primary interest in this survey is in its frequency: it is intended for annual operation with a large sample size. The World Bank \u2022 Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS) aims to improve the type and quality of household data collected by statistical offices in developing countries. Specifically, the LSMS develops new methods. These monitor progress in raising levels of living, identify the consequences for households of past and proposed government policies, and improve communications between survey statisticians, analysts, and policy makers. The LSMS website provides: tools to managers who would like to design new \u03bf surveys tools to users to help in the analyses of the household \u03bf survey data users with actual household survey data for analyses \u03bf links to reports and research done using LSMS data \u03bf A health module exists within LSMS. Relatively few recent LSMS-based surveys use this module but the ones that do can be identified from the website and the questionnaires, methodologies, results and analytic papers found. The population census ( \u2022 see chapter D.19.) is sometimes used to analyse health questions, notably death rates and causes of death. Although a useful source of data, the population census has a low frequency (usually once every ten years). Limitations on the census arise from a limited number of health questions (due to cost) and inherent difficulties in accurately recalling the dates of births and deaths. The mission of the International Household Survey Network (IHSN) is to foster the improvement of the availability, accessibility and quality of survey data in developing countries. Furthermore, IHSN encourage the analysis and use of survey data by national and international development decision makers, the research community, and other stakeholders. Intermediate objectives to achieve these goals are: Improved coordination of internationally-sponsored \u03bf survey programs, with emphasis on timing, sequencing, frequency and cost-effectiveness; Provision of harmonized technical and methodological \u03bf guidelines by the international community, in particular related to data collection instruments; Availability of a central survey data catalogue to better \u03bf inform users of the availability of survey and census data from all sources; ",
        "D 364 Health Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Provision of tools and guidelines to data producers, to \u03bf foster documentation, dissemination and preservation of microdata according to international standards and best practices. The Accelerated Data Program (ADP) (see Box 5.3) provides technical and financial support to the documentation and dissemination of survey data and to the improvement of survey methods. The Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria has commissioned a number of studies to evaluate the impact of its actions and those of its partners. This includes a study on country progress in the fight against AIDS, TB, and malaria, with special attention to health systems. This evaluation examined trends in health outcomes, coverage, and risk behaviour; access and quality of services; and funding. Data collection in eight countries included national health accounts, district facility censuses, household surveys, civil society organization surveys, record reviews, and follow- up studies of patients. Special efforts were made to evaluate data quality, analyze subnational data, and assess the state of health services. The evaluation report, methodology and data are presented in the Global Fund Data Archive . D.24.2.3 Coordination: health information systems Some health policy objectives that require a coordinated system of health information can be stated as follows: Manage available health resources efficiently and \u03bf effectively to obtain measurable and comparable health outcomes throughout the country Respond rapidly and appropriately to serious events \u03bf Communicate the national health status to international \u03bf organisations and partners in a timely manner, especially about serious health situations Prepare and monitor a sector health programme. \u03bf When health funds are limited, the case for a health information system is that scarce resources need to be directed to where they are needed in appropriate amounts. A health information system aims to produce and disseminate a comprehensive national and local picture of the current health situation and its development. Coverage should include the immediate health priorities. The system should transmit health statistics that follow international standards to the relevant regional and global organisations ina timely manner, in particular on reportable diseases. The health information system should be sustainable, both technically and in terms of resources. In operation, a health information system needs to present information from different sources consistently. Information needs to be available at national or at area level \u2013 the locality or area needs to be clearly defined. Data should be as up to date as users reasonably require. The need for consistency and to communicate with international organisations and partners means that statistics must be compatible with international standards. \u2018Country health information systems include a range of population-based and health facility-based data sources. The main population-based sources of health information are census, household surveys and (sample) vital registration systems. The main health facility-related data sources are public health surveillance, health services data (also sometimes referred to as health management information system or routine health information system) and health system monitoring data (e.g. human resources, health infrastructure, financing). Lastly, national health accounts can provide a comprehensive picture of health financing. 70 \u2019 Health statistics are produced by both administrative sources and from surveys. The classifications used, for example classifications of diseases, need to be compatible between these two types of data sources., Geographical definitions also need to be aligned. For example, health districts often do not coincide with the regional or provincial boundaries that are used to report survey results. This is because health districts are often designed to reflect the catchment area (current or historic) of a health facility. Statistics need to be disseminated on a compatible geographical basis, preferably following legal boundaries, such as provinces or regions. Data from externally financed surveys that are not integrated into the national survey programme also need to be incorporated into a health information system. In administrative terms, the Ministry of Health or a related agency usually collects administrative data, while survey statistics are usually the responsibility of the NSI. Effective communication and a clear and agreed division of responsibilities between the two organisations may require formal coordination. The minimum aim is to publish a single set of data on each topic. The next step is to coordinate so that data from different sources are published using the same classifications, so that comparable at the national level. The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported on the work of a Health Metrics Network that has produced case studies and standards for health systems performance monitoring 71 . Further, the WHO has approached the issue of developing a common monitoring and evaluation framework for strategies to strengthen national health systems, working through a country health systems surveillance (CHeSS) platform. This aims to improve availability, quality and use of data needed to monitor health progress and performance and inform country health sector reviews and planning processes. There are five components to this strategy, two of which concern health statistics: 70 World Health Organization http://www.who.int/healthinfo/systems/en/u 71 http://www.who.int/healthinfo/systems/healthsystemmetrics/en/index.html ",

As shown in the case study in Box 24.3, implementing a national health account in a low income country requires the analysis of health statistics from all sources and clearly illustrates the difficulties in obtaining and comparing data. In this respect, the SHA can be regarded as an important element of the framework for health care statistics. What should be clear from this discussion is that a health information system is not necessarily a computer-based system that collects and disseminates data from and to local health offices, although this is the ideal. At its most basic, it is an approach that aims at delivering a consistent indicator set that can be used to monitor a health system or plan and implement a sector health plan, at national or local level. Coordination between statistics producers and users is the key element. D.24.2.4 Health statistics and the MDG indicators Data, definitions, methodologies and sources on the MDG indicators can be found at the Millennium Development Goals Indicators website. This was developed by the Inter- Agency and Expert Group (IAEG) on MDG Indicators and coordinated by the United Nations Statistics Division. (See chapter B.1.1.) A good presentation of child health statistics in the context of the MDG indicators can be found in the presentation of Hans Rosling to the 2010 TEDxChange conference . As with other MDG indicators, data on the global website may not match national data on the same indicators. This situation can arise for a variety of reasons. These include delays in transmitting data and metadata; non-acceptance of the survey methodology by the global agency; differences in indicator definition and methodology; and adjustments made by global agencies in the interest of comparability. In this kind of situation, conflicting viewpoints often arise. It is usually necessary to analyse the difference in each indicator on a case by case basis. In some situations there is no resolution, since the country can make a good case that its own indicator definition better represents the evolution in the MDG target. At the same time, the global agency is required to ensure comparability between countries. Box 24.2 presents the MDG health-related goals, targets and indicators, together with some surveys that potentially can be used as data sources. This table is based on an initial analysis performed in 2006, updated to reflect recent developments in the methodology and scope of these surveys. The paper from which this overview is drawn aimed to illustrate the importance of sample surveys data. The lack of coverage of indicator 6.1 on HIV/AIDS should be understood as underlining the importance of the targeted surveys such as the Measure DHS AIDS Indicator Survey and the surveys carried out by the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria .

        "D 367 Health Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 D.24.2.5 Spending on health: system of health accounts The System of Health Accounts (SHA) has been developed by the OECD. Its purpose is to analyse the adequacy of resource levels for health care and the way that those resources are used in order to answer questions such as: What are the main drivers accounting for health \u03bf expenditure growth? What factors explain the observed differences between \u03bf countries? What are the main structural differences in health \u03bf spending between countries? How are changes in the structure of health spending \u03bf and performance of health systems related? Other issues include the need to monitor the impact of rapid technological change, the influence of the private sector and the provision of care to an ageing population. To respond to the needs of policy-makers and researchers for more detailed and comparative information on health care expenditure, the OECD \u2018A System of Health Accounts (SHA)\u2019 manual provides a standard framework for producing a set of comprehensive, consistent and internationally comparable accounts. It is aimed at the needs of public and private-sector health analysts and policy-makers. Since 2005 Eurostat, the OECD and the WHO are collecting annual health care expenditure data following a Joint Questionnaire that is based on the SHA 1.0 manual. In order to improve and adapt that manual to user needs the three international organisations formed an International Health Accounts Team (IHAT) and revised that SHA manual by March 2011. The pre-edited version of that revision is available as Version 2.0 of the System of Health Accounts on the IHAT-OECD website. The SHA manual establishes a conceptual basis of statistical reporting rules that are compatible with other economic and social statistics. It proposes an International Classification for Health Accounts (ICHA), which covers the three core classifications used in the SHA: who pays (financing agents), for which goods and services (functions of health) and who produces these services (providers): Health care function \u03bf s (ICHA-HC); Health care service provider industrie \u03bf s (ICHA-HP); Sources of financing of health car \u03bf e (ICHA-HF) The World Health Organisation produces its own methodological guidelines and comparable estimated National Health Accounts (NHAs) for most countries in the world, using the most recently available data. The website contains a \u2018 Guide to producing national health accounts: with special applications for low-income and middle- income Countries \u2019. Methodology and data are presented for specific Reproductive Health Accounts as sub-accounts of national health accounts. Further technical support for developing NHAs is available from the WHO Africa regional office website . A case study of the application of the NHA framework in Malawi is presented in Box 24.3. The NHA framework allows for further analysis of funding flows by disease and by intervention clusters. These analyses are of particular interest in developing countries where they permit the analysis of malaria and HIV/AIDS and reproductive health, child health care, etc., respectively. ",
        "D 368 Health Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Box 24.3: Health financing in Malawi: Evidence from National Health Accounts This case study summarises three national health accounts exercises covering financial years 1998/99 to 2005/06. It describes the flow of funds and their uses in the health system and derives recommendations relevant to a comprehensive health financing policy and strategic plan. The methodology was based on SHA as presented in the WHO \u2018 Guide to producing national health accounts: with special applications for low- income and middle-income Countries \u2019. The study describes the data sources used in the National Health Accounts exercises: All the public sector institutions providing and receiving health funds, and providing health care goods and services. The interviews were 1. complemented with secondary data collection from government budget books, consolidated annual appropriation accounts, audited accounts, expenditure print-outs and ledgers. Since no database exists for donor expenditures on health, a special donor survey was undertaken to capture donor contributions for 2. health. A list of all NGOs, community based organisations (CBOs) and implementing agencies working in the health sector and HIV/AIDS sub-sector 3. was obtained and reviewed. Key informant interviews were used to select a total of 120 NGOs/CBOs. Data on employer and employees premium contributions to the only non-profit health insurance organisation was obtained using a 4. specially designed questionnaire. Employers and employees in Malawi contribute to health expenditures through provision of on-site health facilities; reimbursements to 5. employees; employer/employee contribution to an outside health insurance scheme; and in-house health insurance scheme. A list of companies was obtained from the Malawi Chamber of Commerce. Key informant interviews were held and a comprehensive list of all firms involved in health and HIV and AIDS financing and delivery was prepared. Surveys of purposely selected providers by different levels of care, ownership and region were carried out to collect information on utilization 6. of services. Surveys covered HIV/AIDS, reproductive health and child health (children age 0-5 years) and expenditure figures by source of finance/financing agent and function. In order to estimate household out-of pocket spending, national Integrated Household Survey results for 2004/05 were used. The figures 7. were distributed to providers and functions using the household health expenditure and utilization survey of 2000. A \u2018People Living with HIV/AIDS\u2019 (PLWHA) survey was conducted, targeting confirmed HIV positive persons in Malawi age 15 years and 8. older at the time of the survey. The major types of information obtained included utilization of health care services, household assets and expenditures for inpatient and outpatient care. Location sampling was used to identify the target population. The locations identified for the survey were: (a) PLWHA receiving anti-retroviral drugs in health centres and hospitals; and PLWHA receiving prevention of mother-to-child transmission treatment. A sample of 900 individuals throughout the country was selected. Data sources often provided conflicting data, requiring value judgments to be made. The response rate from donors and NGOs was poor and other sources were used to estimate their spending. Essential data on outpatient visits and inpatient admissions data by disease and facility type were unavailable in the national Health Management Information System (HMIS). Indicators such as bed occupancy rates, average length of stay, bed turnover rates, utilization by age, gender, type of facility-central hospital, district hospital, health centres are not reported to HMIS. It did not contain data by private-for-profit health sector. Funding and health services delivery are integrated at health facility level, making it difficult for providers to disaggregate expenditures by source, function (curative, rehabilitative, ancillary services etc.) and disease type, e.g. HIV/AIDS. Most for-profit facilities were unwilling to provide expenditure and revenue data. Data on reported cause of morbidity or care seeking, number of bed days, discharge etc. were available in patient registers but were in a poor state.

Sources of data and metadata The World Health Organisation is the primary global source for comparable country health data. The WHO Statistical Information System (WHOSIS) has been integrated into the Global Health Observatory (GHO) . In addition to the WHOSIS database and the World Health Statistics Report, the WHO also produces its own methodological guidelines and comparable estimated national health accounts for most countries in the world. WHO data may not replicate data from national sources, as common methodologies are applied to ensure data comparability. There may also be delays in transmitting and analysing new data. Measure DHS provides a website that details current and past Demographic and Health Surveys and related surveys that have covered most developing and transition countries. This is a primary resource for country level health data. The UNICEF ChildInfo website provides statistics from the Multi-Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) and other data related to child and maternal health. Comparable indicators, definitions, methodologies and sources on the MDGs can be found at the Millennium Development Goals Indicators website. Eurostat\u2019s health statistics provide a guide to the types of data and indicators that can be made available. In particular, Eurostat, the OECD and the World Health Organisation (WHO) are collecting data on health care expenditure statistics based on SHA 1.0 as well as on health care non- monetary data on health care employment and physical and technical resources via Joint Questionnaires. Box 24.4 summarises Eurostat\u2019s main health statistics datasets and publications as a guide as to what can be made available. Box 24.4: Eurostat health statistics The objective of the Eurostat health statistics is to ensure high quality and comparability of health data for evidence-based policy decisions at EU level. Eurostat\u2019s health statistics are divided in the two main domains Public health and Health and safety at work . Both domains contain free datasets and pre-defined data tables. The brief Health expenditure 2003-2005 \u2018Data in Focus\u2019 publication presents data according to the three core classifications used in the System of Health Accounts, i.e. who pays (financing agents), for which goods and services (functions of health) and who produces these services (providers). It is based on a joint EUROSTAT/OECD/WHO questionnaire on current health expenditure for the years 2003-2005. The Atlas on mortality in the European Union describes mortality by age and gender, by main causes of death and by 272 regions of the EU Member States, Candidate countries (except Turkey) as well as EEA/ EFTA countries. The methodology chapter of the \u2018Atlas on mortality in the European Union\u2019 bears reading; it underlines the difficulties in achieving complete, timely, comparable health data even in developed countries. Eurostat\u2019s Public Health Statistics web forum (CIRCA) contains a library on health statistics, including methodologies and methodological developments, reports and other publications. D.24.4. Analysing data quality and identifying problems Amongst others, the quality of data depends on the coverage, the timeliness of the published figures and their compliance with the agreed methodology (see section C.5.3. on statistical quality). For comparisons and analyses, international standards and classifications should be respected. The potential problems with health surveys are the same as social surveys generally. The most common problem is a lack of timeliness; the data takes too long to collect, process and publish, so that the data is no longer current when it finally appears. This is often the result of a poorly planned survey. Common problems include: Logistics problems slow the sending out and return of \u03bf questionnaires; Questionnaire design gives rise to coding problems; \u03bf Data entry and validation is not matched to questionnaire \u03bf arrival; Insufficient budget exists to disseminate the results. \u03bf A badly drawn sample often is coupled with an excessive sample size at province/regional level and for target groups, resulting in too high survey costs. The number of people who are able to design an efficient and effective sample is often limited in developing countries. One good indicator of a well designed sample is a clear methodological text. In administrative health statistics in developing countries, problems may include some or all of the following: ",
        "D 370 Health Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Non-adoption of current international definitions and \u03bf classifications; Incomplete returns from health facilities, especially \u03bf private companies and in particular concerning notifiable illnesses; Insufficient process management to ensure full data \u03bf coverage; Key indicators not calculated; \u03bf Limited and late publication of basic tables without \u03bf analysis; \u2018Competitive\u2019 publications of different data for the same \u03bf series The fundamental problems are usually: Lack of capacity to manage data collection and \u03bf processing effectively; Lack of capacity to identify, prepare, present and analyse \u03bf key indicators; Lack of formal coordination between the health and \u03bf statistics institutes. Coverage of the private health sector, such as clinics and pharmacies, is also of considerable importance for the completeness and information value of the statistics. This will require an effort to explain the use of the statistics and the safeguards put in place to protect respondents. Achieving a good quality response from the sector will also usually require the existence of effective sanctions for non-response. A key quality issue is that the NSI at least implements basic credibility and consistency checks on the data between different sources. In particular, classifications, methods and coverage should be compatible between the organisations that collect these different data. Externally financed surveys that are not integrated into the national programme complicate the situation further (although in some cases they may use NSI resources to carry out the survey). The epidemiological and/or social justification for such surveys may mean that they cover only a part of the country. The geographical units used may not match regional / provincial boundaries and there may be little or no attempt to improve statistical capacity. On the other hand, the resulting data may be more accurate and timely than official figures. From the perspective of the organisation carrying out the survey \u2013 especially if the funds are charitable donations \u2013 the survey can only be carried out cost-effectively if it focuses on the target region. Their responsibility is to produce an analysis to address their mandated priority issues and not address general health statistics issues for the nation. Such organisations may make efforts to coordinate with Ministry of Health and NSI officials but may not be prepared to make a costly effort to do so. At worst, this lack of coordination can result in non-comparable data being published outside of the country concerned and not being readily accessible for purposes other than the direct objectives of the survey. D.24.5. Improving sector statistics The key system objective is to produce a consistent set of health indicators that can be used to monitor a health system or plan and implement a sector health plan, at national or local level. The means by which this data can be delivered are through the development of a health information system and its major component, a national health account. The usual major difficulty is in coordinating the various health statistics producers and users around a common system that uses international statistical standards and classifications and common geographical boundaries. This approach can provide the framework for coordinating and improving surveys, making administrative data more useful and integrating data from censuses and improved vital statistics systems. The basic quality criteria is whether the statistics are \u2018fit for use\u2019, in other words whether they meet the information needs of the users. Interventions should address any critical points in the data chain, from data collection and processing to the publication of statistics. (See also section C.5.3. on the concepts of statistical quality). An efficient use of resources requires that data collections are not duplicated. It is therefore vital to establish a close cooperation between the institutions concerned. Whether the NSI should publish statistics based on the administrative data or the health administration should publish the data themselves depends on the structure of the national statistical system (see chapter C.5.). A formal service-level agreement or memorandum of understanding, especially for statistical activities not covered by legislation, is often necessary to align the interests of the two services. Given the needs for effective inter-ministerial coordination, there must be a clear demand and support for improved health statistics. It may be that the increased demand for health statistics is brought about by decentralisation of decision making, meaning that the data will need to reflect provincial / regional boundaries. Normally, such undertakings will be identified in the National Strategy for Development of Statistics (NSDS), as described in section C.6.1.2, and resources planned accordingly. Sufficient capacity to produce and disseminate the improved statistics will be needed. This entails, in addition to the means of communication between the health and statistics authorities, a structure within the Ministry of Health that is responsible for statistics and planning, including an appropriate number of trainable staff and their training. Improving localised data according to political boundaries will require knowledge of the location of health facilities as well as good information about the location of the population, ",
        "D 371 Health Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 usually drawn from the population census. Information will also be needed about the residence of patients using the health facility, normally drawn from their administrative records. A GIS system can be used to manage, map and provide excellent dissemination products for all of this information, and is being considered in several developing countries (see for example the NSDS of Ethiopia). However, in many countries consistent management of GIS data will be a further challenge to a limited numbers of skilled personnel; other solutions are possible and should be considered. The key issue in developing a programme of improvement will be to involve the users in determining the key indicators and thus the key data to be collected and developed. At the same time, international demands for core data and indicators according to standard classification must be met, in particular the demands for data for the MDG indicators. This prioritisation exercise should produce a medium term plan for developing sector statistics, e.g. as part of the NSDS. One way to execute this plan in the area of administrative statistics is to focus on achieving progressive improvements in a core statistics publication, such as a yearbook. This approach would focus on improving data collection and thus the number of facilities reported on, as well as improving data compilation and tabulation. This procedure should be planned to improve the identification of location, so that provincial / regional statistics can be published. Basic indicators and graphs are presented in a summary document. Such an approach leaves the preparation of further indicators and graphs and the consequent analysis to a later stage. The improvements would be accompanied by widespread dissemination of the results by internet and on CD-ROM. An example of implementation of such a strategy was the development of health statistics in Burkina Faso through the EDF programme ARC-SSN. As with any social survey, some basic requirements need to be respected in improving health survey statistics: The survey outputs \u2013 the tables and graphs of results \u2013 need \u2022 to be discussed and defined with stakeholders at the start of the process; The sample needs to be defined correctly to enable the results \u2022 to be statistically valid, especially at sub-national level or for specific target groups. A risk exists in many countries of defining an excessively large and costly sample size that nevertheless may not deliver statistically valid results at sub-national level or for target groups. Nevertheless, social distinctions and target groups often need to be taken into account in designing the sample; The international classifications described in \u2022 Box 24.1 should be respected; Localised results should be planned to the extent that \u2022 these can be realised by an affordable and feasible survey plan. Preferably, results should be presented according to regional / provincial government boundaries; The survey plan, processing and associated logistics need \u2022 to be designed, costed and presented as part of the survey preparation; A training plan should accompany the survey plan; \u2022 Budget for dissemination of results needs to be included in \u2022 the survey preparation; Responsibility for release of the results should be clearly \u2022 defined to lie with the agency responsible for the survey, rather than at a political level. Box 24.4: Using new technology The KoBo project , based at University of California Berkeley Human Rights Centre, has developed Mobile Technology for Secure Data Collection. Originally developed for interviewing the population in post-conflict zones, the technology has been applied to health related surveys such as the impact of impact of water access on waterborne disease prevalence in Ghana. The Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) has long used GPS to identify the location of health facilities, for example. Local interviewers are being trained to use hand-held GPS units to collect geographic coordinates in the field, indicating the location of surveyed communities and/or health facilities. Using GIS, DHS data can be linked with routine health data, health facility locations, local infrastructure such as roads and rivers, and environmental conditions. Linked DHS and geographic data are e.g. being used to improve planning for family planning interventions, to assess the correlation of malaria prevalence and anaemia in children in West Africa, and to analyze the effects of environment on early childhood mortality. Localising information is a very desirable element of a health information system. Geographical Information Systems can make health information more useful at the local level if they are applied correctly and continuously. An interesting survey of health oriented GISs can be found in the paper \u2018 Software Programs for Mapping and Spatial Analysis in Epidemiology and Public Health .\u2019 The paper originally appeared in Epidemiological Bulletin , Vol. 25 No. 4, December 2004.

        "D 375 Income and Consumption Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 D.25. Income and consumption statistics The chapter in brief Income and consumption statistics tell how people earn and use their money. Though the concept could be put that simple it should not disguise the complexity of the process necessary to collect information on or monitor household income and consumption. From the income side, these statistics include simple concept like salary or regular pays to individuals. It is intuitive that payroll and light household surveys could be used to collect this information. But they also cover statistics on transfers received and paid from/to other households, government at central and sub-national levels, or nongovernmental organisation such as Non Profit Institutions Serving Household. Accuracy of these data requires specific instruments for their collection and validation. Within the borderlines between income and consumption analysis these statistics are more elaborate indicators on income/expenditure- based measures of poverty, consumer protection, and household consumption patterns. They inform policy makers on social distribution of economic wealth of a country. For their comparability over time and space, main issues in these areas are definition, methodology and consistency. From the consumption side emphasis is put in this chapter on how households acquire and consume goods and durables. The chapter finally presents statistical measures of the gap between income and consumption. That is household wealth when there are leftover resources after consumption and debts otherwise. Beyond the conceptual framework for collecting statistics on household income and consumption, this guide presents available data sources, addresses data quality issues and provides ways and means to improve income and consumption statistics. Chapter D.21 of this Guide covers the related topic of living conditions and poverty. D.25.1. Policy applications: what this data is used for Decision makers at all levels, whether national, regional or international, need information on their people well- being. They use it to address issues related to economic and social conditions, and shape the future of communities. More specifically, for policy formulation and evaluation purposes, statistics on income and consumption inform on the magnitude and structure of household resources and expenditures. Consumption expenditure statistics are necessary for monitoring and evaluation of national policies related to poverty alleviation and effectiveness of household related information system, business orientation and wealth distribution. They are the base for measuring inflation in economies and estimating purchasing power of national currencies. Household consumption expenditures give important signals on future trends in economic opportunities in a country. From purely conceptual point of views, statistics on household income can be approached from the standpoint of its use for policy analysis as the best proxy for economic well-being of individuals and households. That is in terms of those receipts that contribute to economic well-being of individuals by increasing their potential to consume or to save. Emphasis is then on those receipts that individuals consider as being of direct benefit to themselves as well as on the distribution of income across households. A different perspective is from the aggregated macroeconomic level, e.g. within the system of national accounts where the total income accruing to households is described in relation to other aggregate components of this system. 72 While undoubtedly there are several overlaps between these two perspectives, there are nevertheless important differences arising from their different objectives and methodologies. Users of statistics, especially decision makers are invited to bear these differences in mind while acting in light of income and consumption statistics. Whatever the perspective, trends in economic analysis show that developing countries are often characterized by uneven distribution of income within the country and generally fairly low average income levels compare to others. For example, empirical data from a case of Philippines indicated that distribution of income and consumption by families in the country appeared to be stably unequal over a generation. 73 D.25.2. Concepts and definitions This guide retains the definition of the Canberra Group for which income includes all payments received by individuals as a result of their current or former involvement in paid economic activity or self-employment. Conceptually three principles usually discussed in connection with the definition of income for a specified reference period are: Receipts should be expected to recur regularly to be 1. considered as \u201cincome\u201d; To be considered as \u201cincome\u201d, receipts should contribute 2. to current economic well-being \u2013 Receipts deferred for future uses are savings or investment; Receipts arising from a reduction in net worth should be 3. excluded from the concept of income. 74 In another concept from an economic theory referred to as the Haig-Simons\u2019, income is defined as the sum of consumption expenditure and change in net worth in a period. 72 Reference: 1993 System of National Accounts (1993 SNA) 73 As reported in a study by Albert Berry from University of Toronto, Canada entitled Income and Consumption distribution trends in the Philippines, 1950 \u2013 1970 . 74 Cf. ILO Report II of the Seventeenth International Conference of Labour Statisticians held in Geneva, 24 November-3 December 2003 on Household income and expenditure statistics . ",
        "D 376 Income and Consumption Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 The System of National Accounts (SNA) has recommendations on the definition of income for use in preparing national accounts (see chapter D.11. for more information on national accounts). In the 1993 SNA version, the proposed definition of disposable income is \u201c the maximum amount that a household or other unit can afford to spend on consumption goods or services during the accounting period without having to finance its expenditures by reducing its cash, by disposing of other financial or non-financial assets or by increasing its liabilities \u201d. The Eurostat draft manual on income measurement adopts the definition of income proposed in the Canberra Report: \u201c In broad terms, income refers to regular receipts. \u2026 Large and irregular receipts from inheritances and the like are considered to be capital transfers because it is unlikely that they will be spent immediately on receipt and are \u2018one-off\u2019 on nature .\u201d The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) considers household consumption as the use of personal or family income and revenue from investment and pecuniary activities. In a more practical way, from household perspective, the income concept refers to the one of equivalent disposable household income per individual. The income unit is the household, defined as a group of persons sharing a set of common resources. Incomes are recorded on an annual basis and all possible types of cash income have been grouped into four categories: Gross earnings: the salary income of the household i. from dependent employment (excluding employers\u2019 contributions to social security, but including sick pay paid by social security). Gross capital and self-employment incomes: financial ii. gains, real estate rents, occupational pensions and all kinds of private transfers as well as self-employment incomes (but not including imputed income from owner occupation). Social security transfers: all kinds of cash transfers from iii. public sources. Taxes: direct income taxes and employee social security iv. contributions paid by households. Household disposable income is defined as total market income (i + ii) plus transfers from general government (iii), less income taxes and social security contributions (iv). In the next paragraphs of this chapter we will provide detailed definition on these concepts at macro and household economics levels. D.25.2.1 Gross Domestic Product, Income and Expenditure approach In macroeconomics perspectives the size of the economy can be estimated in many different ways. The two most popular methods for the computation of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) are the Aggregate Expenditures Approach and the National Income Approach. The Expenditures approach measures national output (GDP) indirectly by estimating how the GDP is purchased. As such the major purchasers of goods and services are: households, businesses who buy capital goods and equipment, government, and the world economy. Households buy final goods and services, and these purchases are categorized as consumer purchases. Businesses buy many intermediate goods and services to make the final goods and services that households, government, other businesses, and the world economy buy. This is intermediate consumption (C). Many of those intermediate goods and services become part of the final product or services and are not included as separate purchases. The only exceptions are those purchases related to capital goods and equipment which do not become part of the final product. For this reason, a separate category measured in the expenditures is capital and equipment purchases, otherwise known as business investment (I). The public sector purchases final goods and services as part of Government consumption (G). Finally, goods and services sold to foreigners, or exports (X), as well as goods and services bought from foreigners (Import or M), are included in the expenditures measure of GDP as net exports, i.e., exports minus imports, X-M. Adding up these spending components yields aggregate expenditure or GDP. Therefore, the following equation gives an estimate of GDP using the expenditures approach: GDP= C + I + G +(X \u2013 M) An alternative approach, the income approach, measures GDP by adding up the different types of income that are generated in the GDP production process. To measure GDP in this manner the following categories are added up: Wages and Salaries, Net interest (interest received minus interest paid), Rental income, Proprietor\u2019s Income, and Corporate Profits. The sum of these five categories, known as Net Domestic Product at Factor Cost, does not yet give GDP. To arrive at GDP from this sum requires the addition of two other elements that, while included in the expenditures approach, are not included in any of the five income categories. Those two elements are: indirect business taxes (which can be thought of as sales taxes) and depreciation. In developing economies and in most industrialized countries, households are the core part of the economy as they contribute to the most extent to the formation of the above equation either by their revenues or their purchases known as individual consumption. Though it is important to know about the magnitude of income in a country \u2013 usually through GDP, the structure of income (income distribution) says who earns what. Description of the Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES) conducted in Philippines in 2006 and the 1-2-3 survey system in selected African countries is presented in this chapter. The reference for income and consumption statistics in the European Union is the Statistics on Income and Living Conditions known as EU-SILC (see Box 25.1 below). ",
        "D 377 Income and Consumption Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Box 25.1: Selection of household income and expenditure surveys 1. The 1-2-3 Survey System The 1-2-3-type mixed surveys system is used in order to achieve two objectives, one with macroeconomic and the other with microeconomic perspective: 1. It provides interesting information to both economic modellers and national accountants concerned with defining a good method for including the informal sector in national accounts. This objective is achieved by measuring employment and informal production together with consumption of goods and services provided by the informal sector; 2. It describes the conditions under which informal activities are carried out, thus making it easier to devise policies in support of small or micro-enterprises as part of national or international projects. This analysis also makes it possible to relate this informal activity with poverty analysis. Three types of modules are used to achieve these two objectives. They are distributed one after the other to households living in the area being studied: the first module measures employment, stating whether it is formal or informal; \u2022 the second module measures production generated by the informal activities which were detected during the first stage; \u2022 the third module analyses household consumption in relation to its origin and once again makes a distinction between demand on the informal \u2022 sector and demand on the modern (or formal) sector . Results of 1-2-3 Surveys (LFS, informal sector, consumption and poverty) are available for selected African countries. In the case of Madagascar 1-2-3 surveys were conducted between 1995-2004, covering capital, urban (2000, 2001), and rural areas. In West Africa 2001/2003, these surveys were conducted in 7 West African Economic and Monetary Union capital cities ( Herrera, Razafindrakoto and Roubaud (2008) and the African Statistical Journal vol. 9 (2009)). 2. The European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) The European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) is an instrument aiming at collecting timely and comparable cross- sectional and longitudinal multidimensional microdata on income, poverty, social exclusion and living conditions. This instrument is anchored in the European Statistical System (ESS). The EU-SILC project was launched in 2003 on the basis of a \u2018gentleman\u2019s agreement\u2019; it covers the EU Member States, the EFTA countries (except Lichtenstein), and is being expanded to also cover EU candidate countries. The instrument aims to provide two types of data: Cross-sectional data pertaining to a given time or a certain time period with variables on income, poverty, social exclusion and other living \u2022 conditions, and Longitudinal data pertaining to individual-level changes over time, observed periodically over, typically, a four year period. \u2022 3. The Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES) - Philippines The Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES) is a nationwide survey of households undertaken every three years by the National Statistics Office (NSO) of Philippines. It is the main source of data on family income and expenditure in the country, which include among others, levels of consumption by item of expenditure as well as sources of income in cash and in kind. The results of FIES provide information on the levels of living and disparities in income of Filipino families, as well as their spending patterns. It covers the whole country and follows a national multi-stage stratified random sampling methodology. The FIES is a sample survey designed to provide income and expenditure data that are representative of the country and its 17 regions. The last FIES was conducted in 2009. ",
        "D 378 Income and Consumption Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 D.25.2.2. Income distribution Income distribution measures the gap between the various strata of the population. On the extremes let us suppose that in a country everyone has the same (or approximately) income. This would be a situation where any proportion of the population (say x%) would have (approximately) the same x% of the wealth. The country would have an even income distribution. On the contrary in case one person (or very few people) has the whole (or almost) wealth of the country. We consider this as an uneven income distribution. In a very uneven income distribution, the rich are very rich and the poor are very poor, comparatively. The most used statistical tool for assessing the shape of income distribution in a country is the Gini Coefficient. What is Gini coefficient? Gini index or Gini coefficient is an economic measure of inequality in income distribution. On a scale of 0 to 1, the lower the Gini coefficient, the more evenly distributed the wealth. The coefficient is named after its inventor, the Italian statistician Corrado Gini. How is the Gini coefficient calculated? Gini coefficient is calculated from the Lorenz curve, in which cumulative family income is plotted against the number of families arranged from the poorest to the richest. The index is the ratio of the area between a country\u2019s Lorenz curve (A) and the 45 degree helping line to the entire triangular area (A + B) under the 45 degree line. Using the graph below G = A/ (A+B) \u2013 See graph below. The more unequal a country\u2019s income distribution, the farther its Lorenz curve from the 45 degree line and the higher its Gini index. For example, Sub-Saharan countries typically have an index of around 40 to 60. The more nearly equal a country\u2019s income distribution, the closer its Lorenz curve to the 45 degree line and the lower its Gini index. As an example, the EU countries with the lowest values of the Gini index \u2013 below or about 25 \u2013 are Slovenia, Hungary, Slovakia, Sweden and the Czech Republic. If income were distributed with perfect equality, the Lorenz curve would coincide with the 45 degree line and the index would be zero; if income were distributed with perfect inequality, the Lorenz curve would coincide with the horizontal axis and the right vertical axis and the index would be 100. In practice people mostly receive their income in cash but often this happens in kind. D.25.2.3 In-kind income In-kind income is income that is not in the form of cash or negotiable instruments. Examples of in-kind income include real property, food, and occasionally, wages (e.g., room and board or clothing as compensation for employment) 75 . The United Nations Statistics Division defines in-kind income as individual goods and services provided as transfers (see next section) in kind to individual households by government units (including social security funds) and Non Profit Institutions Serving Households (NPISHs), whether purchased on the market or produced as non-market output by government units or NPISHs. They may be financed out of taxation, other government income or social security contributions, or out of donations and property income in the case of NPISHs. D.25.2.4 Income transfers Income transfers are cash disbursements made by government or non-governmental organizations to individuals or households identified as highly vulnerable, with the objective of alleviating poverty or reducing vulnerability. Income transfers are payments to individuals for which no current goods or services are exchanged. This is the case of social security and unemployment benefits (see chapter D.28. on social protection statistics). Depending on the country the details of income transfer may vary. Social security covers pension payments but also early retirement benefits. Public transfer administrations pay supplements to individuals temporary inactive due to unexpected leaves or study, inability to pay specific services such as rent, survival utility bills and care for children and young persons. Education aids from public funds are exceptional forms of income transfers from public administrations to households. They take the form of cash pays or indirect transfers such as reduction on tuition and/ or school supplies. Moreover private transfer income includes received presents and winnings, payments from insurances, as well as payments from private pension schemes and received child maintenance and alimony. Besides these types of more current income transfers, households may receive capital transfers, such as inheritance. In low-income economies remittance are increasingly participating in the formation of income transfer between households either from urban to rural areas or from the citizens aboard to domestic families. 75 United States of America Social Security Handbook 2009 Section 2140 L i n e o f E q u a l i t y ( 45 D e g ee ) Cumulative share of people from lowest to highest incomes 100% 1 0 0 % C u m u l a t i v e s h a r e o f i n c o m e e a r n e d L o r e n z C u r v e A B ",
        "D 379 Income and Consumption Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 D.25.2.5 Measures of poverty Measuring poverty is one of the most challenging areas of income and consumption statistics due to the existence of mainly two different concepts of poverty (see chapter D.21. for more details). Two important notions are taken into consideration for the determination of the poverty status of a household: absolute and relative poverty. Absolute poverty is a level of poverty at which certain minimum standards of living - for example nutrition, health and shelter - cannot be met. It is internationally admitted that people leaving in this condition earn less than $1 per person per day. This threshold was recently re-evaluated to $1.25 a day per person as the initial value tends to underestimate the number of poor people actually living below the poverty line in some countries. Depending on the expected impact some countries and organization push the threshold to 2 dollars a day. The term \u201cAbsolute poverty\u201d may be slightly misleading, since there is no \u201cabsolute\u201d standard that defines absolute poverty: the level of income necessary for these minimum standards is often referred to as poverty line, which various institutions and individuals define differently. Absolute poverty can be contrasted with relative poverty which is a low income or standard of living relative to the rest of society. Relative poverty is a poverty measure based on a low disposable income relative to the rest of society. Unlike absolute poverty, it does not necessarily imply that physical human necessities of nutrition, health and shelter cannot be met; instead it suggests that the lack of access to many of the goods and services expected by the rest of the contemporary society leads to social exclusion and damaging results for the individuals and families in relative poverty. One of the consequences of using relative poverty to judge societies over time is that the poverty line tends to rise as incomes rise. This is desirable if it reflects a changing social consensus about minimum acceptable standards of living. However, it is less desirable if it leads to social and economic policies which give such an emphasis to reducing inequality that the cost includes keeping the incomes of the poorest at a lower level than they might have been, had an absolute poverty measure been used to guide policy. It is a common take that rich and poor people do not spend their income the same way. What are the differences in consumption patterns between two counties? D.25.2.6 Consumption patterns The consumption patterns of households determine the relative importance (weight) of household monetary expenditure attached to each category of goods and services covered by the Consumer Prices Index, a key measure of inflation. Mainly, consumption pattern is the key for distribution of the effects of economic chocks such as price change or increase in wealth (income). However, there is no uniform basket which applies to all countries/economies. The structure of the weights may vary considerably from country to country, as well as between the Consumer Price Index for an individual country over time. This makes the study of consumption pattern a rather sophisticated exercise. For more accurate analysis of consumption pattern, especially in developing countries, it is suggested to reduce the number of categories at the first stage. For instance, simple structures like food vs. non-food analysis are more accurate than the usual international analysis of decomposition of household expenditures according to six or more categories (e.g. United Nations\u2019 Classification Of Individual Consumption by Purpose (COICOP) ). In the European Union, benchmarking studies have been conducted with three categories: 1. Food; 2. All items except Food and Transport; and 3. Transport. The HICP - Household consumption patterns is a reference show case. For this guide individual buy goods for immediate but also for long term use. The last are durables. D.25.2.7 Consumer goods and durables Household durables goods are products that are not purchased frequently. Under normal circumstances consumer durables can be used for more than a year. Furthermore the purchase price for the consumer good accounts for a significant amount of money. Examples of durables are appliances, home furnishings, lawn and garden equipment, consumer electronics, toys, small tool, sporting goods, photographic equipment, and jewellery. When the national statistical infrastructure allows, it is recommended to fine-tune the definition to at least two or three sub categories. In this context household durables are goods that last longer in consumer use. Durables include, inter alia, motor vehicles, furniture, cookers, fridges, washing machines, television sets, musical equipment, computer equipment, watches and jewellery. Semi-durables \u2019 life time is rather short and this category includes clothing, footwear, household utensils, equipment for sport and books. Other non- durables consumer goods include food, beverages, tobacco, pharmaceutical products, petrol, cosmetics, newspapers etc. The stock of consumer durables does not contribute to the national wealth, since the value of consumer durables is a satellite account. This is a consequence of the structure of the national accounts system, where households\u2019 acquisitions of consumer durables are considered as private consumption and not as an investment. Therefore durables purchased by household as capital goods do not count in this category. It is a National Accounts requirement to differentiate private consumption of goods and durables from investment which goes to family owned business account. As seen above households and individuals earn income from various sources and consume different goods and services. The difference between income and consumption expenditure is known as wealth is positive and debt otherwise. ",
        "D 380 Income and Consumption Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 D.25.2.8 Household wealth and debts Household wealth is defined as the total market value of dwellings, consumer durable goods and financial asset net of debt. In practice, total household wealth is the sum of savings and checking accounts, bonds, stocks, individual retirement accounts, vehicles, market value of housing equity and other real estate, minus all current debt individually and/or collectively contracted by members of the household. In the notion of household wealth, the distinction between financial and non financial asset is essential. The fact that non financial assets are valued at their market price valuation impacts on the determination of the total wealth. Ideally the main source of information on household wealth should be private banks. But due to confidentiality binding banks on consumer information, National Statistical Institutes generally use surveys to collect information about household wealth and the debts. In poor statistical systems lack of information makes it difficult to get accurate data on wealth as respondents may think information collected from them will be used for tax purposes. The general tendency therefore is for households to underestimate the amount of their asset. The next section of this chapter deals with important factors in the valuation of household income and consumption components. D.25.2.9 Inflation and price level indices Focusing on household consumption expenditures, two types of statistical indicators are used to assess how the wealth of consumers varies over time and space. Inflation formulates how much money is needed to purchase the same amount of goods or services from one year to the other while purchasing power tells the price of the same good in one country relatively to another one. Consumer Prices Indices (CPI) general measures of inflation while price levels differences between two or more countries are measured by a Price Level Index (see also chapter D.12. on price statistics). All countries in the Euro zone and their partners in OECD and outside have a well established Consumer Price Index. Some regions are participating in Harmonized Consumer Price Indexes making CPI numbers comparable across countries. As regards the measure of price level indices several methods are available including the use of official national currency exchange rate to Euro or United States Dollar. But the most robust measure of price level indexes between countries is provided by the International Comparison Programme with the notion of Purchasing Power Parities . Box 25.2: Do we underestimate household income in poverty context? In order to have a better estimate of what households make a year it is better to measure its consumption rather than capturing its income. Consumption captures permanent income, reflects the insurance value of government programs and credit markets, better accommodates illegal activity and price changes. Consumption is more likely to reflect private and government transfers. However, it is fairly compelling that most households can more easily report income. Research in the area of income and consumption statistics shows that income is systematically under-reported and measured with substantial error 76 . These problems are especially severe for those households with few resources. It is therefore recommended to use consumption to supplement income in analyses of poverty whenever possible. Monitoring household consumption is a challenging endeavour. Existing international initiatives such as the household budget surveys any various standards of living surveys open the ground for more accurate estimates of consumption estimates. 76 76 \u2018 Measuring the Well-Being of the Poor Using Income and Consumption \u2019 by Bruce D.

        "D 381 Income and Consumption Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 D.25.3. Sources of data and metadata The primary sources of data on household income and consumption are national surveys of living standards. EUROSTAT collects across EU Member States harmonised data on living conditions (EU-SILC, See chapter 28) and of household budget surveys. Part of structural income and consumption expenditure statistics are available in population and housing census. Statistics about the level of income or consumption come from National Accounts. It is commonly admitted that data from sample surveys cannot be used at a broad level of disaggregation. At the same time census data are generally not a good source of data on household income. A trade-off is necessary to determine which available indicators should be used when assessing household income and consumption. Metadata are available from international organizations such as the United Nations International Labour Organization, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the European Union, etc. The Eurostat Household consumption expenditure web site gives an interesting oversight of individual components of household consumption expenditure, their variation among European Union Member States, reasons for statistical discrepancies, and factors affecting spending and saving habits in the Union. The OECD Statistics portal provides definition of key concepts on household income, consumption and savings for member economies. International Financial Statistics (IFS) of the International Monetary Fund defines economic concept of Household Consumption Expenditure including Non Profit Institutions Serving Households (NPISHs) while the United Nations Statistics Division centralizes metadata on the general framework for assessing household income and consumption statistics as part of Millennium Development Goals indicators (see section B.1.1. and section B.4.1.). The international reference organization on household statistics including income, consumption and price levels is the United Nations International Labour Organization with its Laborsta statistical initiative . Box 25.3: Selected international datasets related to Household Income and Consumption Laborsta Laborsta is a database of labour statistics. It covers official core labour statistics and estimates for over 200 countries since 1969. Also provides methodological descriptions of main national statistical sources. Laborsta is an initiative of the International Labour Organization Office (ILO). OECD Statistics (StatExtracts) OECD.StatExtracts is an integrated database system. It was developed for the use of member countries but also includes major aggregates from selected non-member countries. It has interesting features such as creating and customizing tables, reshaping table using \u201cpivot dimensions\u201d to move rows and columns. It also has export functions to download data in Excel or CSV formats. User can print query or save them for later use. World Bank. Data and Statistics The World Bank Open Data initiative forms a platform for sound policy making around the world. The mission of the World Bank\u2019s Data Group is to provide high quality national and international statistics to clients within and outside the Bank and to improve the capacity of member countries to produce and use statistical information. As part of the international statistical system, the Data Group works with other organizations on new statistical methods, data collection activities, and statistical capacity-building programs. This group also coordinates the analytical and statistical work related to monitoring progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (see section B.1.1. and section B.4.1.). The World Development Indicators (WDI) provides a comprehensive selection of economic, social and environmental indicators, drawing on data from the World Bank and more than 30 partner agencies. The database covers more than 900 indicators for 210 economies with data back to 1960. Eurostat statistical publications Eurostat is the statistical office of the European Union. Its task is to provide the European Union with statistics at European level that enable comparisons between countries and regions. Featured publications include The EU economic data pocketbook and the Eurostat labour market statistics pocket book. The EU economic data pocketbook is a handy collection of economic data from different domains, covering the European Aggregates, EU Member States and its main economic partners. The publication focuses on the structural aspects of the EU economy; consequently, most of the data are annual, complemented by selected monthly and quarterly indicators. The Eurostat labour market statistics pocket book aims to highlight various aspects of the labour markets in Europe. The statistics shown refer to the labour market situation of individuals and households, their gross and net earnings as well as the labour cost incurred by enterprises, to labour demand, and labour market policy interventions. IMF Data and Statistics The IMF publishes a range of time series data on IMF lending, exchange rates and other economic and financial indicators including GDP expenditures. Manuals, guides, and other material on statistical practices at the IMF, in member countries, and of the statistical community at large are also available. These are also important sources of metadata on household income and consumption ",
        "D 382 Income and Consumption Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 D.25.4. Analysing data quality and identifying problems Data quality issues should be looked at from different perspectives which may vary from one country to the other. (See chapter C.5.3. for general aspects of statistical quality.) For example a United States experience highlights non response in national census as an issue whether on statistical units or on items surveyed. International researches also show that in many countries, underreporting is disproportionately high for three types of income: government transfers, property income, and self-employment income. Since transfers are more likely to be received by people in the lower tail of the income distribution, this underreporting would increase measured poverty. On the other hand, underreporting of property income tends to lower the income of households at the top of the distribution, leaving poverty unaffected. Underreporting of self-employment income can result in too many individuals with low incomes, or even negative incomes, also affecting the measure of poverty rate. As regards household surveys in general, fundamentally, there are two types of errors inherent in sample survey data, mainly, non-sampling errors and sampling errors. The reliability of survey estimates depends on the combined impact of non-sampling and sampling errors. A practical example of data quality indicators in relation with household income and consumption is available in Data quality in the 2004 Survey of Labour and Income Dynamics (SLID) 75F0002M disseminated by Statistics Canada. D.25.5. Improving household statistics Population and household statistics are of interest to international organizations but also to central and local government, especially in the context of governance and decentralization in developing countries. Improving relevance, accuracy and timeliness of household statistics will bring them to the standard needed to meet the needs of users. Many means can be used to improve household income survey estimates. Developing international standards for household surveys is a major task to enhance comparability of data collected on income and consumption. An important international achievement is the establishment of the International Household Survey Network as a follow-up of recom- mendations on the implementation of the Marrakech Action Plan for Statistics. In addition, it is necessary to create experts discussion groups to share experience and best practices on issues of improving household statistics at both national and international levels. Examples of such initiatives are the UN backed Rio Experts Group on poverty statistics and the Canberra Group on household income statistics . National or regional workshops should be encouraged to discuss survey methodologies, questionnaire design, data processing and analysis. But moreover elaboration of household survey guides and standards are critical to ensuring robustness of income and consumption statistics. Implementation agencies should encourage pilot surveys in order to reduce data issues at the end of household income surveys while international organizations must provide necessary technical assistance where needed to enhance the quality of data collected on household income and consumption.

Policy applications: what these indicators are used for The most well-known definition of sustainable development comes from the United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED) (also known as the \u2018Brundtland commission\u2019) in its report \u2018 Our common future \u2019 (1987): \u201c... development which meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs\u201d. In other words, progress aiming at a better quality of life for everyone, both now and in the future. Sustainable development integrates immediate and longer- term objectives and actions, both at local and global level and seeks a balance between social, economic and environmental issues. The United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) is the high-level forum for sustainable development within the United Nations system. It was established in 1992 to ensure effective follow-up of United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) (\u2018the Earth Summit\u2019 in Rio de Janeiro). The CSD is responsible for reviewing progress in the implementation of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development (1992) and Agenda 21 (1992), the action plan for global, national and local actions by the United Nations system, governments, local administrations and major groups in every area where humans impact on the environment. The CSD also provides policy guidance to follow up the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation (JPOI) (2002) at the local, national, regional and international levels. At the European level, the 2006 EU Sustainable Development Strategy (EU SDS) sets out a single, coherent strategy on how the EU will more effectively meet the challenges of sustainable development. It reaffirms the overall aim of achieving a continuous improvement in the quality of life of citizens through sustainable communities that manage and use resources efficiently and tap the ecological and social innovation potential of the economy, ensuring prosperity, environmental protection and social cohesion. Measuring progress towards sustainable development is a key aspect of international, European and national sustainable development strategies. Agenda 21 calls on countries and the international community to develop indicators of sustainable development . Such indicators are needed to increase focus on sustainable development and assist decision-makers at all levels to adopt sound national sustainable development policies. The Johannesburg Plan of Implementation and the CSD encouraged further work on indicators for sustainable development by countries, in line with their specific conditions and priorities. CSD invited the international community to support efforts of developing countries in this regard. Eurostat plays a leading role in providing indicators and monitoring to what extent the EU is on track to achieving the concrete goals set out in the EU SDS. To this end, Eurostat has developed an EU set of sustainable development indicators (EU SDIs) , on the basis of which Eurostat every two years publishes a Monitoring Report which underpins the Commission communication to the Council and the European Parliament. D.26.1.1 What is sustainable development? \u2018Sustainable development is a normative concept, rather like \u2018justice\u2019 or \u2018democracy\u2019. The general meaning of the concept is clear, but there is no simple definition of it. In its report \u2018 Our common future \u2019 (1987) (also known as the \u2018Brundtland report\u2019), the World Commission on Environment and Development outlined seven critical objectives for environment and development policies that follow from the concept of sustainable development: Reviving growth to eliminate poverty. Growth must be \u2022 revived especially in developing countries as that is where the links between economic growth, the alleviation of poverty, and environmental conditions operate most directly. Yet developing countries are part of an interdependent world economy and their prospects also depend on the levels and patterns of growth in industrialized nations; Changing the quality of growth to make it less material- \u2022 and energy-intensive, to maintain the stock of ecological capital, to improve the distribution of income, and to reduce the degree of vulnerability to economic crises; The chapter in brief This chapter describes the meaning of sustainable development and the statistical steps necessary to define a set of Sustainable Development Indicators (SDIs). It draws from the work of both the UN and the EU and gives examples of the SDIs developed in individual countries. The developing country dimension is considered throughout, particularly in section D.26.5 on building a statistical action. As SDIs are a cross-cutting theme, a detailed description of data sources is largely unnecessary because they would overlap with other modules; see e.g. chapter D.14 on environmental statistics, chapter D.15 on transport statistics and chapter D.28 on social protection statistics. SDIs is an area in constant evolution, despite the substantial methodological work already undertaken all over the world. It is therefore recommended to look up the most recent developments in this statistics area. Hyperlinks to key SDI resources and reference documents are given throughout this chapter. In addition, the list of references in the \u2018To find out more\u2019 box at the end of this chapter will allow follow-up of any aspect of SDIs. ",
        "D 388 Sustainable Development Indicators Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Meeting essential human needs. The most basic of all needs \u2022 is for a livelihood, i.e. employment. More food is required to feed more people and to attack undernourishment. Energy is another essential need, especially urgent for poor households in developing country which depend mainly on wood as fuel; Ensuring a sustainable level of population as sustainable \u2022 development can be pursued more easily when population size is stabilized at a level consistent with the productive capacity of the ecosystem; Conserving and enhancing the resource base. Development \u2022 policies must widen people\u2019s options for earning a sustainable livelihood, particularly for resource-poor households and in areas under ecological stress. Agricultural, fishery and forestry resources have been overexploited and must be conserved and enhanced to meet the needs of growing populations; Reorienting technology and managing risk. The capacity \u2022 for technological innovation needs to be greatly enhanced in developing countries so that they can respond more effectively to the challenges of sustainable development. The orientation of technology development must be changed to pay greater attention to environmental factors; Merging environment and economics in decision making. \u2022 This will require a change in attitudes and objectives and in institutional arrangements at every level. Economic and ecological concerns are not necessarily in opposition. For example, policies that conserve the quality of agricultural land and protect forests improve the long-term prospects for agricultural development. The integration of economic and ecological factors into the law and into decision making systems within countries has to be matched at the international level. These 7 strategic imperatives were followed up by political commitment in the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development and the Agenda 21 action plan for global, national and local actions. A key conclusion is that the world must design and pursue strategies that will allow nations to move onto sustainable development paths. This requires policy changes in all countries, with respect both to their own development and to their impacts on other nations\u2019 development possibilities. Poor people depend on the environment for their livelihoods and well-being. Improved management of the environment and natural resources contributes directly to poverty reduction, more sustainable livelihoods and pro-poor growth. The strong link between poverty and the environment is actively pursued in the Poverty-Environment Initiative (PEI) of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). PEI is a global UN-led programme that supports country-led efforts to mainstream poverty-environment linkages into national development planning. It provides financial and technical assistance to government partners to set up institutional and capacity strengthening programmes and carry out activities to address the particular poverty- environment context. The UN Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) was established to review progress in the implementation of Agenda 21 and the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development. The role of the CSD as a high level forum on sustainable development also includes providing policy guidance to follow up the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation at the local, national, regional and international levels. The CSD has opened its annual sessions to broad participation from both governmental and non- governmental actors. CSD promotes dialogue and build partnerships for sustainable development with governments, the international community and the major groups identified in Agenda 21 as key actors outside the central government who have a major role to play in the transition towards sustainable development. These major groups include women, youth, indigenous peoples, non-governmental organizations, local authorities, workers and trade unions, business and industry, the scientific community, and farmers. Following the UN Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro (1992), the EU ratified both the Rio Declaration and Agenda 21. In 1997, sustainable development became a fundamental objective of the EU when it was included in the Treaty of Amsterdam as an overarching objective of EU policies. At the Gothenburg Summit in 2001, EU leaders launched the first EU sustainable development strategy. The EU SDS added a third, environmental dimension to the Lisbon Strategy of economic and social renewal. The two strategies are complementary. The Gothenburg declaration formed the core of the EU\u2019s policies towards sustainable development. But these also encompassed other programmes and commitments, such as the commitments made at the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg and the Millennium Development Goals agreed in 2000, as well as global pledges to increase official development aid and to take account of the needs of developing countries in international trade. In June 2006, a renewed EU Sustainable Development Strategy was adopted by the European Council in response to developments such as climate change, a widening gap between the rich and the poor in the world, increased instability due to terrorist threats and violence, further globalization and changes in the world economy. This required a sustainable development strategy with a stronger focus, a clearer division of responsibilities, wider ownership and broader support, a stronger integration of the international dimension and more effective implementation and monitoring. The renewed EU SDS sets out a single, coherent strategy on how the EU will more effectively live up to its long-standing commitment to meet the challenges of sustainable development. It reaffirms the need for global solidarity and recognises the importance of strengthening the work with partners outside the EU, ",
        "D 389 Sustainable Development Indicators Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 including those rapidly developing countries which will have a significant impact on global sustainable development. D.26.1.2 The role of indicators The evaluation of indicators is a particular case in statistics. Indicators are built on statistics and statistical methodology is used to assess their quality. However, sustainable development indicators (SDIs) are conceived to enable assessment of whether targets and objectives of sustainable development are being met. In other words, they are policy performance indicators, designed to enable evaluation of the policy performance of the different facets of sustainable development. By establishing quantitative measures for sustainability it becomes possible to set goals, apply management strategies, and measure progress. Agenda 21 calls on countries and the international community to develop indicators of sustainable development. Such indicators are needed to increase focus on sustainable development and assist decision-makers to adopt sound national sustainable development policies. Furthermore, the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation and the Commission on Sustainable Development encourages further work on indicators for sustainable development by countries, in line with their specific conditions and priorities. CSD specifically invites the international community to support efforts of developing countries in this regard. The focus of countries in establishing sustainable development indicator sets has generally been on meeting the information needs of a national sustainable development strategy. The establishment of SDIs has for many countries and institutions been a key opportunity to move environmental issues higher up the policy agenda alongside economic and social issues. The SDIs have also been instrumental in promoting the concept in a much clearer way than can be achieved through national sustainable development strategies alone. As regards developing countries, generally the policy priorities relevant to sustainable development tend to emphasis basic aspects of economic development, social development and ecological aspects: Reducing poverty; \u2022 Providing energy services to those without them; \u2022 Managing external debt; and \u2022 Energy security issues. \u2022 At the same time, many developing countries have an important and growing impact on world emissions of greenhouse gases. The solutions they find to their development challenges will affect the course of climate change globally. Generally, the UN recommends a policy-driven approach, adapted to each region of the world. Thus, the regional Commissions of the UN are also prioritising the work on regionally adapted frameworks for SDIs. A good example is the framework developed by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), which is presented in more detail in section D.26.3.3. below, together with the practical application of this in Argentina (see Box 26.3). Further regional work can be found e.g. on the websites of the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) and the UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) . Eurostat and the European Statistical System have a leading role in providing data and monitoring to what extent the EU is on track to achieving the concrete goals for sustainable development set out in the EU Sustainable Development Strategy. Measuring progress towards sustainable development is an integral part of the EU SDS, and Eurostat is charged with producing a monitoring report every two years, based on the EU set of sustainable development indicators (EU SDIs). Eurostat\u2019s Sustainable development in the European Union - 2011 monitoring report of the EU sustainable development strategy complements the policy analysis provided in the Commission\u2019s progress report Mainstreaming Sustainable Development into EU Policies: 2009 Review of the European Union Strategy for Sustainable Development . D.26.2 Concepts and definitions D.26.2.1 Policy driven approach In many cases, the relationship between indicators and policy is very strong. This is the case for sustainable development indicators, which are designed specifically to monitor progress in the different aspects of the sustainable development strategies. This policy driven approach assures the relevance of the SDIs. Policy makers see them as being directly relevant to the sustainable development strategies and effective means for communication. While there may be concerns about having indicators closely aligned with policy objectives and targets at the expense of other aspects of sustainable development, this is also one of their strengths. On the other hand, indicators which are closely connected with the measurement of specific policies must be redefined whenever there are changes in these policies. The United Nations Guidelines and Methodologies for Indicators of Sustainable Development and their detailed methodology sheets are available as a basis for all countries to develop national indicators of sustainable development. In the context of sustainable development, one often refers to three interdependent and mutually reinforcing pillars, meaning development that balances economic growth, the need to maintain stocks of natural resources, and social justice, in other words bringing people out of poverty. Sometimes, a fourth pillar is included, namely the institutional framework supporting sustainable development. ",
        "D 390 Sustainable Development Indicators Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Most sets of indicators presently used by nations and international bodies are based on the DPSIR framework or a subset of it (see Box 14.1 in chapter D.14 on environmental statistics). According to this analysis, social and economic developments or (i) Driving forces exert (ii) Pressure on the environment and, as a consequence, the (iii) State of the environment changes, such as the conditions for health, resources availability and biodiversity. Finally, this leads to (iv) Impacts on human health, ecosystems and materials that may draw a (v) Response that feeds back on the (i) Driving forces. From the policy point of view, there is a need for clear and specific information on these five elements. This is achieved by using indicators reflecting the links between human activities and their environmental impacts as well as the response of society to these impacts. D.26.2.2 Conceptual frameworks The focus of countries in establishing sustainable development indicator sets has generally been on meeting the information needs of a national sustainable development strategy. It is relatively rare that such policies have been based on an explicitly defined conceptual framework. They have often been, however, the result of rigorous consultation inside and outside of government to ensure that different perspectives on how sustainable development should be defined are taken into account. The Joint UNECE/OECD/Eurostat Working Group on Statistics for Sustainable Development (WGSSD) was established in 2005 to identify good concepts and practices to assist national governments and international organizations in the design of sustainable development indicator sets. The aim of the Working Group was to develop a broad conceptual framework for measuring sustainable development with the concept of capital at its centre, and to identify a small set of indicators that might become the core set for international comparisons. Sustainable development covers two different scales: the temporal and the spatial. The temporal scale considers sustainability within a generation and between generations; the spatial scale considers sustainability with respect to local, national, regional and global sustainability. This is also at the core of the Agenda 21. With respect to the intra-generation scale and the spatial scale, there is a divide in economic, social and ecological standards and growth between the developing countries and developed countries, often labelled a \u2018North- South divide\u2019. Another dimension of sustainable development is the discussion of \u2018weak\u2019 versus \u2018strong\u2019 sustainability as regards \u2018natural\u2019 and \u2018artificial\u2019 capital, understood as the volume and quality of the stock of natural, physical, human, financial, produced and social capital. In essence, these two views disagree as to what should be handed over to future generations. \u2018Weak sustainability\u2019 argues that \u2018natural\u2019 and \u2018artificial\u2019 capital can be substituted for another, i.e. that depreciation of natural capital such as the use of non-renewable resources such as oil and uranium can be compensated for by a corresponding investment in \u2018artificial capital\u2019 such as knowledge of production of renewable energy and of energy efficiency. Strong sustainability, in contrast, argues that humans are embedded in a natural system and that limits to natural resources (\u2018capital\u2019) constrain the scope for human actions. In other words, that the two kinds of capital are complementary. The indicators that are used to measure sustainability are dependent on the choice of basic sustainability concept. An extensive discussion of the capital approach is contained in the \u2018 Measuring Sustainable Development \u2019 study prepared by the Joint UNECE/ Eurostat/OECD Task Force on Measuring Sustainable Development (WGSSD) in 2009. D.26.3 .Sources of data and metadata D.26.3.1. United Nations (CSD) sustainable develop- ment indicators Agenda 21 specifically calls on countries and the international community to develop indicators of sustainable development. Compiling indicators and communicating efficiently about an issue as complex as sustainable development remains a challenge at all levels (international, national, local). This is due not only to the wide range of issues which need to be addressed (economic, environmental, social and institutional), but also to the demand for new data, which may stem from diverse data sources. The third, revised set of CSD indicators was finalized in 2006 by a group of experts from developing and developed countries and international organisations. The revised edition contains 96 indicators, including a subset of 50 core indicators (presented in Box 26.1 below.) The larger indicator set allows for a more comprehensive and differentiated assessment of sustainable development by countries. The CSD indicators are placed in a framework of themes and sub-themes. The CSD core indicators fulfil three criteria: They cover issues that are relevant for sustainable \u2022 development in most countries; They provide critical information not available from other \u2022 core indicators; They can be calculated by most countries with data that \u2022 is readily available or could be made available within reasonable time and costs.

EU Sustainable Development Indicators The EU Sustainable Development Indicators (EU SDIs) are used to monitor the EU Sustainable Development Strategy in a report published by Eurostat every two years. The most recent example is the Sustainable development in the European Union - 2011 monitoring report . Out of more than 100 indicators, eleven have been identified as headline indicators . They are intended to give an overall picture of whether the EU has achieved progress towards sustainable development in terms of the objectives and targets defined in the strategy. Like the UN set, the EU SDIs have been organised within a thematic framework in order to provide a clear and easily communicable structure, relevant to political decision- making. The framework is based on priority policy issues, but is flexible enough to adjust to possible changes in these priorities and objectives, bearing in mind that new issues and priorities emerge from time to time. The EU SDI framework follows a general gradient from the economic, to the social, and then to the environmental and institutional dimensions. The themes are derived from the EU SDS as well as Agenda 21. Each theme is further divided into subthemes to organise the set in a way that reflects the operational objectives and actions of the EU SDS (see Box 26.2 below). ",
        "D 393 Sustainable Development Indicators Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 The EU SDI set is structured as a three-storey pyramid, distinguishing between three levels of indicators. This approach not only reflects the structure of the EU SDS (overall objectives, operational objectives, actions), but also responds to different kinds of user needs. The three-level pyramid is complemented with contextual indicators: Headline (or level-1) indicators \u2022 are at the top of the pyramid, monitoring the \u2018overall objectives\u2019 related to the seven key challenges of the EU SDS. On the whole they are widely used indicators with a high communicative and educational value. They are robust and available for most EU Member States. The \u2022 second level of the pyramid consists in most cases of indicators related to the \u2018operational objectives\u2019 of the strategy. They are the lead indicators in their respective subthemes. They are robust and available for most EU Member States. The \u2022 third level consists of indicators related to actions described in the Strategy or to other issues which are useful for analysing progress towards the strategy\u2019s objectives. Contextual indicators \u2022 are part of the SDI set, but either do not monitor directly a particular SDS objective, or they are not policy responsive. Generally, they are difficult to interpret in a normative way. However, they provide valuable background information on issues having direct relevance for sustainable development policies and are useful for the analysis. The SDI set also describes indicators which are not yet fully developed but which would be necessary to give a more detailed and complete picture of progress: The \u2022 indicators under development either already exist, but are of insufficient quality or coverage, or are known to be currently under development by a group of experts in Europe. The \u2022 indicators to be developed are either: (i) known to be under development currently by a group of experts in Europe, but no final satisfactory result is expected within two years; or (ii) not being developed currently as far as is known. D.26.3.3. Examples of regional and national SDI frameworks Latin America and the Caribbean - Argentina A good example of a policy-driven, regionally adapted framework for SDIs is the framework developed by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) . The conceptual framework developed through the Evaluation of sustainable development in Latin America and the Caribbean project (ESALC - Evaluaci\u00f3n de la Sostenibilidad en Am\u00e9rica Latina y el Caribe) . The ESALC SDI framework is based on the four pillars Economic, Social, Environmental and Institutional. For each pillar (or \u2018subsystem\u2019), the indicators are divided into sustainability and development indicators. An interesting approach is the definition of themes and indicators on the interrelations between the different subsystems (e.g. between economic and environmental, and institutional and social) and between the national level and the rest of the world. The ESALC SDI framework also defines the energy and demography \u2018Efficiencies and intensities\u2019 as specific themes. The Argentinian System of Sustainable Development Indicators (SIDSA) presented in Box 26.3 is a good example of a national adaptation Vietnam In Vietnam, the \u2018Strategic Orientation for Sustainable Development\u2019 included promoting environmental information systems and a sustainable development evaluation and monitoring indicator system. The Local Agenda 21 focuses on concrete local conditions, defines sustainable development goals and indicator systems on local level and establishes a reporting and supervising system. Before the establishment of the Sustainable Development Implementation Plan for Vietnam (2008), there was no official indicator system to measure and assess sustainable development. According to the local conditions and the targets and characteristics of the national Agenda 21, the SDI set has been developed for each area. Amongst other, this work has been based on the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) indicators and the CSD sustainable development indicators. Following a four-pillar framework, an SDI set of 44 indicators has been established, presented in Box 26.4: Operational objectives and targets Background Actions/Explanatory variables Overall objectives Contextual indicators Level 1 Level 3 Level 2 ",

Box 26.3: System of Sustainable Development Indicators, Argentina The \u2018Sistema de Indicadores de Desarrollo Sostenible Argentina\u2019 (SIDSA) is built on the basis of the ESALC conceptual framework. The SIDSA contains 68 indicators, measuring the relationship between economic and population growth and their effects on the environment. The system builds on the four subsystems economic, social, environmental and institutional, each subdivided into development indicators and sustainability indicators. The development indicators portray change directly, enabling improved definition of development objectives. The sustainability indicators aim to portray the change process and therefore the capacity to maintain the development over time. The use of the conceptual framework: permits a holistic view of the sustainability of development; \u2022 permits an integrated view of the indicators, visualising the \u2022 interactions between the different subsystems; constitutes a tool for defining integrated public policies. \u2022 The national system is not a closed system, but linked with the rest of the world. Therefore, the national indicator system includes indicators on the interrelations between the national and international development and sustainability. Furthermore, the system includes indicators on the interrelations between the different subsystems (or \u2018pillars\u2019). In addition, indicators are presented on intensities, analysing the relations between the productive sector and the environment. These indicators permit analysis of to what extent economic growth depends on the use of natural resources. The SISDA system is structured as follows: Social subsystem of Development: 11 indicators \u2022 Social subsystem of Sustainability: 3 indicators \u2022 Environment subsystem of Development: 3 indicators \u2022 Environment subsystem of Sustainability: 5 indicators \u2022 Economic subsystem of Development: 3 indicators \u2022 Economic subsystem of Sustainability: 4 indicators \u2022 Institutional subsystem of Development: 3 indicators \u2022 Institutional subsystem of Sustainability: 3 indicators \u2022 National and international interrelations: 4 indicators \u2022 Interrelation between the Economic and Environment subsystems: \u2022 9 indicators Interrelation between the Environment and Social subsystems: 4 \u2022 indicators Interrelation between the Economic and Social subsystems: 3 \u2022 indicators Interrelation between the Institutional and Economic subsystems: \u2022 3 indicators Interrelation between the Institutional and Social subsystems: 3 \u2022 indicators Interrelation between the Institutional and Environment \u2022 subsystems: 3 indicators Efficiency or intensity: 4 indicators \u2022 ",

Analysing data quality and identifying problems The quality of Sustainable Development Indicators (SDIs) includes the relevance to policy makers in their decision- making and policy monitoring is central to SDI quality, as well as more traditional aspects such as accuracy, comparability and timeliness. (Statistical quality is described in more detail in section C.5.3.) The Quality profile system developed by Eurostat for the EU SDIs provides a template for the systematic assessment of the quality of indicators. The main feature of policy driven indicators is their relevance to the formulation and 77 77 See the Description of Eurostat quality grades: overall technical assessment of the indicator based on accuracy and comparability monitoring of policy. This is a cornerstone of the assessment of the quality profiles, together with the indicator\u2019s contribution to an integrated policy analysis. The quality profile also documents the quality of the indicator with respect to the statistical quality dimensions most relevant to the indicator and its institutional framework (sources, legislation, etc). As the Eurostat Quality profiles framework is generic and focused on common key quality criteria for indicators, it is straight-forward to adapt and implement in any statistical system, both in developing and developed countries. Box 26.5. Eurostat\u2019s Quality profiles for EU SDIs The quality profiles provide the definition of the indicator and a list of key stakeholders in Eurostat and elsewhere in the European Commission, as well as any Working Groups involved.

        "D 396 Sustainable Development Indicators Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 D.26.5. Improving sector statistics D.26.5.1. EU SDI Following the 1992 Rio Earth Summit Eurostat worked closely with the UN work programme on global indicators of sustainable development, and published indicator compilations in 1997 and again in 2001. A first EU-oriented set of SDIs was proposed following the adoption of the initial EU SDS of 2001. The European Commission foresaw the need for a regular review and adaptation of the set in order to reflect emerging policy priorities, as well as improvements in statistical data collection. Eurostat, with the assistance of the working group on SDIs, constantly reviews the situation regarding the development of appropriate indicators, so as to further improve the relevance of the set of indicators. This working group on SDIs comprises both statistical and policy representatives at both national and EU level. The issues addressed in these reviews are: Policy relevance: is the current SDI set providing the \u2022 information needed to monitor progress under the latest version of the EU SDS and other relevant policy initiatives? Efficient communication: Is the current SDI set streamlined \u2022 to communicate progress and priorities efficiently and does it take in the latest developments in indicator methodology with respect to communication Statistical quality: Are the SDIs meeting current quality \u2022 criteria, are they designed using the best available methods, are they taking into account the latest datasets available and are they stable over time?. The EU SDIs include a group of indicators currently under development, as they are based on the development of specific surveys (e.g. SILC, CIS, health surveys) and sectoral methodological development (e.g. energy statistics, environmental accounts). Eurostat is cooperating closely with relevant agencies, researchers, etc. to develop further sustainable development indicators, especially to fill information needs in areas currently not adequately covered. D.26.5.2. Recommendations on how to construct a set of SDI The United Nations Guidelines and Methodologies for Indicators of Sustainable Development provides both a global list of sustainable development indicators and methodology for developing such indicators within each area. This is a good basis for developing a national set of SDIs. However, but each country must define which SDIs are most relevant for its own policy purposes, e.g. as defined by the national Agenda 21. A basic approach is to start by analysing national policy information needs and which statistics and indicators are already available or easy to construct based on existing sources. Policy makers and other stakeholders should be closely involved in this process, as the main goal of the SDIs is to inform policy makers and to monitor progress within the national sustainable development policies. Political support is vital; policy makers must need the SDIs for their planning, monitoring, evaluation and political dialogue. Existing surveys and management information systems (MIS) are key data sources. On this basis, a first set of national SDIs may be established. Further development should be focused on improving the quality of these first SDIs and of constructing indicators in priority areas poorly or not at all informed by the initial set of SDIs. In this context, coordination and networking is vital, bringing surveys and data together. The initial set of SDIs needs to be operationalised, the theoretical framework established and the necessary policy documents developed. Some countries and international organisation use so- called composite indicators, such as the ecological footprint, genuine savings, and the human development index. This type of indicator attempts to combine different indicators into a single index. The lack of an empirical basis for weighting the different components means that these indicators remain controversial. The structure of the SDI set is important, and requires a balance between indicators for the different themes and between different types of indicators (stock, flow, distribution, efficiency, context). The Eurostat pyramid of indicator levels (see section D.26.3.2.) is a good way to structure the indicator set, both as regards policy relevance and quality. The quality of Sustainable Development Indicators (SDIs) is closely related to their purpose of monitoring progress in priority policy areas. Thus, the relevance to policy makers in their decision-making and policy monitoring is central to SDI quality, together with aspects such as accuracy, comparability and timeliness. (Statistical quality is described in more detail in section C.5.3.) The Quality profile system developed by Eurostat for the EU SDIs provides a template for the systematic assessment of the quality of indicators. It is straightforward to adapt and implement in statistical system also in developing countries. In summary, the indicators should be: policy responsive; \u2022 informative to policy makers and other stakeholders; \u2022 methodologically sound; \u2022 easy to interpret; \u2022 form a balanced set over the sustainable development \u2022 themes; ",

It is not always possible to satisfy all these criteria simultaneously; compromises are often unavoidable. However, the main goal of these indicators is that they should monitor progress towards sustainable development strategies. Thus, they must be relevant to these policies and be comparable over time (and preferable also across countries and regions).

Labour market statistics The chapter in brief The challenge for labour market statistics is to provide users with a comprehensive description of the various aspects of the labour market and its dynamics. This statistical domain is of strategic importance, as labour market policies are at the heart of efforts to reduce poverty and provide the poor with the means to support themselves. Like national accounts, the population census or business statistics, labour market statistics belong to the core business of national statistical offices. Labour market statistics are mainly based on administrative records and on large surveys, such as labour force surveys. This chapter covers a wide area of labour market statistics such as employment and unemployment, labour conditions, job vacancies, health and safety at work, strikes and lockouts, etc. It starts by identifying the main areas for which these statistics are used. The chapter then provides an overview over the different labour market statistics collected and of some of the main concepts, definitions and classifications agreed at international level. The main sources of labour market data are presented, followed by advice on how to analyse the quality of labour market statistics. The chapter concludes with recommendations on how to improve labour market statistics and how to strengthen the capacity to produce these statistics in developing countries. This chapter is based on internationally agreed definitions and methodological recommendations from the International Labour Organization (ILO) , the UN Statistical Division and Eurostat and the European Statistical System (ESS). Examples and recommendations are drawn both from ILO/PARIS21 meetings on labour market statistics in developing countries as well as from experiences of European integration in this domain. D.27.1. What this data is used for Labour market statistics are key information for understanding, enhancing and promoting fundamental issues such as employment, principles and rights at work and social protection and dialogue. These statistics are essential to analyse, evaluate and monitor the functioning of the economy, to design and set up effective labour market strategies and evaluate their effectiveness over the short and the long term. From a social viewpoint, this information is necessary to design policies and programs regarding job creation, training schemes, and help vulnerable groups (e.g. poor people, young people, older people, women, disabled people) to find secure employment. From an economic viewpoint, these statistics are used to analyse, evaluate and monitor the way the economy is performing and the effectiveness of current and longer term economic policies. Statistics on employment, unemployment, the share and structure of the labour market, broken down by age and sex, are essential to design social protection policies. In developing countries, labour market statistics are needed in particular to design and monitor the policies and programs aiming at reducing poverty and vulnerability by promoting efficient labour markets, alleviating people\u2019s exposure to risks and enhancing their capacity to manage economic and social risks such as unemployment, sickness or disability. In developing countries, employment in the informal sector and informal employment is often of great importance. Thus, statistics need to capture employment in both the formal and the informal sector, including informal employment (see Box 27.2 below). 78 Labour market statistics are also used to complement information from other social statistics and enhance the analysis of key social challenges and development. High unemployment is often correlated with social issues such as poverty, crime, social unrest, religious and ethnic tensions, health risks, etc. (see Box 27.1 on Employment and the MDGs). Labour market statistics are also used to develop and improve education policies and identify training needs. Main labour market indicators, in particular unemployment and employment rates, are published frequently (monthly and/or quarterly), provided that the NSI has the required capacity. The labour market indicators are timely indicators providing key information for short term and business cycle analysts to monitor the current economic situation in conjunction with other short term economic indicators (e.g. GDP, trade, current account, financial indicators, and business climate indicators). Labour market data are also directly relevant to citizens, as employment and unemployment are of central concern to individuals and to society. It may also be used by international private companies to decide if they should make long term investments in a particular developing country. Many types of labour market statistics, such as hours worked, absences or injuries at work are also useful for labour-management negotiations and discussions led by unions. Enterprises, governments and other stakeholders use information on health and safety at work to design, monitor and evaluate policies and programmes for the prevention of occupational injuries, disease and deaths and to foster a safe work environment. Finally, labour market statistics are also used as input to other statistical domains, such as education statistics (see chapter D.23) and national accounts (see chapter D.11). 78 For further discussion of informal employment in specific sectors (see chapter D.11 National accounts, economic accounts and the non-observed economy; chapter D.13 Business statistics; chapter D.17 Agriculture, forestry and fishing statistics).

This area covers statistics on the labour force, the labour market, employment and unemployment. The more detailed topics include the economically active population, labour conditions, health and safety at work, working time and other working conditions, strikes and lockouts, job vacancies and job creation. At the international level, the International Labour Organization (ILO) promotes standards on various topics of labour market statistics. Standards are defined according to Conventions and recommendations adopted by the ILO\u2019s annual International Labour Conference, and to Resolutions and Guidelines adopted by the International Conference of Labour Statisticians . ILO Convention n\u00b0 160 provides general guidelines encompassing all areas of basic labour market statistics. It is complemented by several resolutions regarding specific topics like the statistics of child labour , the measurement of working time , the economically active population, employment, underemployment, employment in the informal sector and classifications. The Resolutions provide information on conceptual frameworks, definitions and methodologies to be used when producing labour market statistics. They are complemented by Guidelines which refer to specific areas. Numerous statistical variables and indicators are collected in order to give a comprehensive overview of the labour market. The definitions of the main variables, as agreed at the international level, are presented in section D.27.2.2. Generally, the terminology used is that of the ILO 79 . The ILO plays a key role given its position as a specialised agency of the UN, which includes a specific responsibility for labour market statistics. In addition, a number of other actors are involved in labour market statistics, including Eurostat, OECD, IMF, UNSD and the World Bank. The ILO and other international actors are working since a long time to improve the quality of labour market statistics, through the promotion of international harmonization of concepts and definitions and through technical assistance to improve statistical capacity at national level. Many more indicators than the ones defined in section D.27.2.2 are available at European level. To improve harmonisation of labour market statistics, definitions and concepts throughout the European Statistical System, a number of regulations have been adopted and form the legal basis for the labour market statistics in the EU. Generally, the definitions and recommendations of the International Labour Organisation are followed. Eurostat\u2019s Labour market statistics website provides methodological information and definitions for EU labour market statistics, as well as references to international methodological recommendations, guidelines, etc. The European Union Labour Force Survey (EU-LFS) web forum contains detailed information regarding the concepts and definitions, survey methods, organization and comparability of the EU-LFS. Eurostat also maintains a Concepts and Definitions Database (CODED) where, amongst others, concepts and definitions for labour market statistics can be consulted. 79 \u2018Job vacancies\u2019 and \u2018job creations\u2019 refer to Eurostat terminology, as does \u2018labour market statistics\u2019.

Definitions Labour force, employment and unemployment: The economically active population \u2022 (or labour force ) encompasses persons employed and unemployed. People are classified as employed, unemployed or economically inactive according to the definitions of the ILO (see the following definitions). When measured for a short period of time, e.g. a day or a week, it refers to the labour force or the current economically active population. When measured for a long period of time, such as a year, it relates to the usually active population . The activity rate is the share of the total population that is economically active, i.e. the labour force as a percentage of the population of working age (in the EU, this is defined as the population aged 15-64 years). Employed \u2022 persons are those who, during the reference week, did any work for pay or profit, or were not working but had jobs from which they were temporarily absent. \u201dWork\u201d means any work for pay or profit dur ing the reference week, even for as little as one hour. Pay includes cash payments or payment in kind (i.e. payment in goods or services rather than money), whether payment was received in the week the work was done or not. Anyone who receives a wage for on-the-job training which involves the production of goods or services is also considered as being in employment. Self-em ployed and family workers are also included. The Employment rate \u2022 is calculated as the share of persons in employment in the total population; the employment rate is frequently broken down by sex and age groups. Unemployment \u2022 : The reference statistical definition of unemployment is based on the \u2018Recommendation of the 13 th International Conference of Labour Statisticians\u2019. According to ILO terminology, the \u201cunemployed\u201d comprise all persons above a specified age 80 who during the reference period were: (a) \u201cwithout work\u201d, i.e. were not in paid employment or \u03bf self-employment; (b) \u201ccurrently available for work\u201d, i.e. were available \u03bf for paid employment or self-employment during the reference period; and (c) \u201cseeking work\u201d, i.e. had taken specific steps in a \u03bf specified recent period to seek paid employment or self- employment. The specific steps may include registration at a public or private employment exchange; application to employers; checking at worksites, farms, factory gates, market or other assembly places; placing or answering newspaper advertisements; seeking assistance of friends or relatives; looking for land, building, machinery or equipment to establish own enterprise; arranging for financial resources; applying for permits and licences, etc. 80 The Eurostat definition is people aged 15 to 74 years old. The \u2022 unemployment rate is the number of people unemployed as a percentage of the labour force. The youth unemployment rate is the unemployment rate of people aged 15-24. The long-term unemployment rate is the number of persons un employed for 12 months or longer as a percentage of the labour force 81 . Labour conditions Labour conditions cover issues such as wages, working time, work organization, maternity protection and arrangements to adapt working life to the demands of life outside work. It can be defined as the legislated conditions that shape workers\u2019 experience at work. Numerous conventions regarding working time and work organization have been adopted, and a number of associated international standards exist. A key international policy initiative aimed at improving labour conditions is the ILO\u2019s Decent Work Agenda . According to the ILO methodology, definitions of main indicators are: Usual hours worked are the modal value of the actual hours worked per week over a long reference period, excluding weeks when an absence from work occurs (e.g. holidays, leaves, strikes ...). Actual hours worked in the reference week are the hours the person spent in work activities during the reference week. Work activities should include production activities, ancillary activities, short pauses and education and training which are necessary for successfully carrying out of either the production or ancillary activities. Actual hours worked should exclude travel time between home and the place of work, the main meal breaks, absences from work within the working period for personal reasons and education and training hours which are not necessary for carrying out the production or ancillary activities. Health and safety at work Health and safety at work is a cross-disciplinary area. Since 1950, the ILO and the World Health Organization (WHO) have shared a common definition of occupational health. It was adopted by the Joint ILO/WHO Committee on Occupational Health at its first session in 1950. The definition reads: \u201c Occupational health should aim at: the promotion and maintenance of the highest degree of physical, mental and social well-being of workers in all occupations; the prevention amongst workers of departures from health caused by their working conditions; the protection of workers in their employment from risks resulting from factors adverse to health; the placing and maintenance of the worker in an occupational environment adapted to his physiological and 81 Eurostat uses a more precise definition in order to further improve comparability within the EU (see Commission Regulation (EC) No 1897/2000) . This definition is fully compatible with the ILO standards. ",

Current international statistical guidelines on occupational injuries are found in the Resolution concerning \u201cStatistics on occupational injuries resulting from accidents at work\u201d (adopted by the 16 th International Conference of Labour Statisticians, 1998), which adopted much of the European Commission\u2019s European Statistics on Accidents at Work (ESAW) methodology . The Resolution and the ESAW provides terms and definitions for statistics on occupational injuries. According to the ILO methodology, definitions of main indicators are: Occupational accident : an unexpected and unplanned occurrence, including acts of violence, arising out of or in connection with work which results in one or more workers incurring a personal injury, disease or death; as occupational accidents are to be considered travel, transport or road traffic accidents in which workers are injured and which arise out of or in the course of work, i.e. while engaged in an economic activity, or at work, or carrying on the business of the employer; Occupational injury : any personal injury, disease or death resulting from an occupational accident; an occupational injury is therefore distinct from an occupational disease, which is a disease contracted as a result of an exposure over a period of time to risk factors arising from work activity. Strikes and lockouts Official statistics related to strikes and lockouts data are provided following the guidelines included in the Resolution concerning statistics of strikes, lockouts and other actions due to labour disputes, adopted by the ILO Fifteenth International Conference of Labour Statisticians in 1993 which gives the following definitions: \uf0fc A s trike is a temporary work stoppage effected by one or more groups of workers with a view to enforcing or resisting demands or expressing grievances, or supporting other workers in their demands or grievances. \uf0fc A lockout is a total or partial temporary closure of one or more places of employment, or the hindering of the normal work activities of employees, by one or more employers with a view to enforcing or resisting demands or expressing grievances, or supporting other employers in their demands or grievances. \uf0fc Workers involved in a strike : Workers directly involved in a strike are those who participated directly by stopping work. Workers indirectly involved in a strike are those employees of the establishments involved, or self-employed workers in the group involved, who did not participate directly by stopping work but who were prevented from working because of the strike. \uf0fc Workers involved in a lockout : Workers directly involved in a lockout are those employees of the establishments involved who were directly concerned by the labour dispute and who were prevented from working by the lockout. Workers indirectly involved in a lockout are those employees of the establishments involved who were not directly concerned by the labour dispute but who were prevented from working by the lockout. \uf0fc A labour dispute is a state of disagreement over a particular issue or group of issues over which there is conflict between workers and employers, or about which grievance is expressed by workers or employers, or about which workers or employers support other workers or employers in their demands or grievances. Job vacancies, job creations Job vacancy statistics provide information on the demand side of the labour market (whereas employment and related statistics illustrate the offer side). These indicators are used to analyse the business cycle and as early indicators of downturns in the business cycle. Recently, an emphasis has been made on job vacancies and job creation. These indicators belong to the indicators used to closely monitor short-term changes in the labour market. The Eurostat definition is as follows: \uf0fc job vacancy is defined as a paid post newly created, unoccupied, or about to become vacant: for which the employer is taking active steps to find a \u2022 suitable candidate and is prepared to take further steps to find a suitable candidate from outside the enterprise concerned; and which the employer intends to fill either immediately \u2022 or within a specific period of time. The concepts \u201cactive steps to find a suitable candidate\u201d and \u201cspecific period of time\u201d are country specific, and defined in relation to national legislation. A vacant post that is only open to internal candidates is not treated as a \u2018job vacancy\u2019. Job vacancy statistics are predominantly presented in terms of the Job Vacancy Rate (JVR). This indicator measures the percentage of total posts that are vacant, in line with the definition of job vacancy above, expressed as follows: JVR = number of job vacancies / (number of occupied posts + number of job vacancies) * 100 An occupied post is a post within an organisation to which an employee has been assigned. ",
        "D 405 Labour Market Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Classifications Several classifications are relevant for labour market statistics. The ILO is responsible for the maintenance, the update and the revision of two main specific classifications used for labour market statistics; the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) and the International Classification of Status in Employment (ICSE) . The \u2022 International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) which brings together individuals working in similar types of work, namely tasks and duties undertaken in the job, irrespective of where the work is performed. The \u2022 International Classification of Status in Employment (ICSE) which is a set of discrete values which can be assigned to the variable \u201ctype of contract which a person has with other persons or organizations when performing a particular job\u201d when that is measured in a statistical survey or registered in other administrative files. Other classifications are also of relevance to labour market statistics, in particular: United Nations\u2019 \u2022 International Standard Industrial Classification of all Economic Activities (ISIC) . In the European Statistical System, the NACE classification is used. 82 UNESCO\u2019s \u2022 International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) 82 NACE is based on ISIC and adapted to reflect economic activities of particular relevance to the European economy through sub-division of ISIC sub-groups. Statistics produced on the basis of NACE are comparable at European and, in general, at world level. Box 27.2: Informal employment, the informal sector and the informal economy The term \u201cinformal economy\u201d is used by the ILO as including the informal sector as well as informal employment. As a supplement to the 1993 System of National Accounts, an international conceptual framework for measurement of the non-observed economy already exists (see chapter D.13), which distinguishes the informal sector from underground production, illegal production and household production for own final use, The concept of informal sector refers to production units as observation units, while the concept of informal employment refers to jobs as observation units. Informal sector enterprises and employment in the informal sector are defined according to the resolution concerning statistics of employment in the informal sector adopted by the 15th ICLS. Informal employment comprises the total number of informal jobs, whether carried out in formal sector enterprises, informal sector enterprises, or households, during a given reference period: own-account workers employed in their own informal sector i. enterprises; employers employed in their own informal sector enterprises; ii. contributing family workers, irrespective of whether they work in iii. formal or informal sector enterprises; members of informal producers\u2019 cooperatives; iv. employees holding informal jobs in formal sector enterprises, v. informal sector enterprises, or as paid domestic workers employed by households; own-account workers engaged in the production of goods vi. exclusively for own final use by their household 83 . Employees are considered to have informal jobs if their employment relationship is, in law or in practice, not subject to national labour legislation, income taxation, social protection or entitlement to certain employment benefits. The reasons may be that the jobs or the employees have not been declared; the jobs are casual or of a limited short duration; the hours of work or wages fall below a specified threshold; employment by unincorporated enterprises or by persons in households; the employee\u2019s place of work is outside the premises of the employer\u2019s enterprise (e.g. outworkers without employment contract); or labour regulations are not applied, not enforced, or not complied with for any other reason for the jobs in question. The structure and size of the informal economy varies greatly between countries; the operational criteria for defining informal jobs of employees must be determined in accordance with national circumstances and data availability. Informal employment outside the informal sector comprises: employees holding informal jobs in formal sector enterprises (or as paid domestic workers employed by households); contributing family workers working in formal sector enterprises; own-account workers engaged in the production of goods exclusively for own final use by their household. Countries which exclude agricultural activities from the scope of their informal sector statistics should develop suitable definitions of informal jobs in agriculture, especially with respect to jobs held by own-account workers, employers and members of producers\u2019 cooperatives.

Europe 2020 aims at creating more jobs and better lives through Europe\u2019s capability to deliver smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. It also involves greater coordination of policy at Member States and EU level . The Europe 2020 strategy has 5 headline targets, the first of which is directly addressing the labour market in the Member States and in the EU: 75 % of the population aged 20-64 should be employed: The employment rate of the population aged 20-64 should increase to at least 75%, \u2022 also through the greater involvement of women, older workers and the better integration of migrants in the work force. These headline targets are currently measured by eight headline indicators . The first of these is taken directly from Eurostat\u2019s labour market statistics : Employment rate by gender, age group 20-64 \u2022 The Employment Committee, the Social Protection Committee and the European Commission have developed a Joint Assessment Framework (JAF) to track progress and monitor the Employment Guidelines under Europe 2020. JAF includes quantitative monitoring of progress towards the EU headline and related national targets in the light of the implementation of the Europe 2020 Integrated Guidelines . It also monitors progress in the labour market participation and social inclusion of specific groups. The initial list of JAF indicators (see Annex 2 of the JAF) is mainly based on the indicators developed for the monitoring of the Employment Guidelines under the Lisbon Strategy . Labour market statistics also provide key indicators in other key policy areas: Good quality Euro Area statistics are essential for co-ordination of economic policies, assessment of convergence and the conduct of monetary policy. This concerns macroeconomic statistics with quarterly and monthly frequency, a key instrument for business cycle analysis, for short- term economic policies and for monitoring of government deficit and debt in the context of the Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP). The Principal European Economic Indicators (PEEIs) include 4 short-term indicators drawn from the labour market statistics: 4.1 Unemployment rate (monthly) \u2022 4.2 Job vacancy rate (quarterly) \u2022 4.3 Employment (quarterly) \u2022 4.4 Labour cost index (quarterly) \u2022 Eurostat\u2019s Sustainable Development Indicators (SDIs) are used to monitor the EU Sustainable Development Strategy (EU SDS) (see chapter D.26.). The EU SDIs are organised in ten themes in order to provide a clear structure, relevant to political decision-making. The EU SDIs is structured in three levels of indicators, complemented by contextual indicators. Several of these indicators are taken from the labour market statistics: Headline indicators monitor the \u2018overall objectives\u2019 of the key challenges of the EU SDS: \u2022 Employment rate of older workers \u03bf Indicators related to the \u2018operational objectives\u2019 of the EU SDS strategy are the lead indicators in their respective subthemes: \u2022 Total employment rate \u03bf Indicators related to actions described in the EU SDS strategy: \u2022 Employment rate, by gender \u03bf Employment rate, by highest level of education attained \u03bf Dispersion of regional employment rates, by gender \u03bf Unemployment rate, by gender \u03bf Unemployment rate, by age group \u03bf ",
        "D 407 Labour Market Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 D.27.3. Data sources In general, labour market statistics are obtained from the following sources: \uf0fc Population censuses and household-based sample surveys (in particular labour force surveys (LFS)). \uf0fc Enterprise censuses or surveys. \uf0fc Administrative records. Household surveys usually have comprehensive coverage of the population and allow detailed questioning for precise measurement of labour force concepts. It is the main source of information for labour market statistics. The definitions used are agreed at the international level by the ILO. At EU level, the LFS is a large sample survey among private households that provides detailed annual and quarterly data on employment, unemployment and inactivity. The EU LFS is carried out on a quarterly basis by the Member States. The data can be broken down along many dimensions including age, sex, educational attainment, and distinctions between permanent/temporary and full-time/part-time employment. Ad-hoc modules (set of questions on specific topics) have been added to the EU LFS on a yearly rotating basis, e.g. on employment of disabled people, entry of young people into the labour market, labour market situation of migrants, accidents at work and work-related health problems, etc. Although the LFS is a priority source of information, it cannot provide data on job vacancies and job creation. This type of data, together with collection of data related to production, labour input, number of employees 84 , salaries of the employees, etc., is obtained from enterprise surveys or censuses. Responding companies usually provide reliable information. However, business surveys (enterprise surveys) are based on business registers, which may not be well maintained or even available in developing countries (small businesses are for instance usually poorly covered, and enterprises in the informal sector are not covered at all). Thus, mixed surveys such as 1-2-3 surveys (see e.g. chapter D.13) may also be valuable tools to estimate informal employment. Dependent on their design, household and business surveys often do not provide reliable estimates for very small sub-groups of the population, such as unemployment by individual occupational groups or detailed data by industry type. The size of the samples for normal household surveys are usually not large enough to provide reliable (in the sense of low variance) estimates for such small sub-groups. Business surveys in developing countries normally contain a limited number of questions in order to avoid excessive administrative burden and ensure adequate response by the business community. Detailed data covering specific groups or industries may instead be obtained from targeted sector 84 The number of employees is also available from the LFS . surveys (e.g. on companies in particular industries, such as mining or manufacturing) when they exist. Data compiled from administrative records include for instance registered job-seekers (from the national employment service, and occasionally even private agencies) or injuries at work (from national compensation schemes, etc). Administrative records are good sources in countries where the administrative system is reasonably developed and well organised. However, in developing countries this is often not the case. A comprehensive system for labour market statistics needs to tap into several data sources. The same type of information may be available through more than one data source. The labour market statistics system must be developed based on an assessment of quality, coverage and reliability of the available sources, in order to select the most appropriate sources within the national context. On this basis, a sound and comprehensive labour statistics system should be developed. Data availability Regarding the dissemination of labour market statistics, various international organisations regularly publish data for their member countries. The International Labour Office disseminates official core labour market statistics and estimates for over 200 countries. It also provides methodological descriptions of main national statistical sources. Those data are accessible online from the LABORSTA - database of labour market statistics . Every two years, the ILO also publishes the Key Indicators of the Labour Market (KILM) . This publication presents a collection of 20 key indicators of the labour market, ranging from employment and variables relating to employment (status, sector, hours, etc.) to the lack of work and the characteristics of jobseekers, education, wages and compensation costs, labour productivity and working poverty. The World Bank database covers most countries around the world; labour market statistics can be found under the topic \u2018 Labor & Social Protection \u2019. The OECD also maintains a database on labour market covering mainly its Member countries. WHO is active within the field of \u2018 Occupational health and safety \u2019 (health and safety at work), and is also central in the Global Occupational Health Network (GOHNET) . Many National Statistical Offices publish national labour market statistics on their website, in particular results of national Labour Force Surveys . Eurostat publishes EU statistics on employment and unemployment (from the Labour Force Survey (LFS)); Job vacancies; Earnings (gross and net earnings, the Structure of Earnings Survey (SES), gender pay gap, minimum wages); Labour costs incurred by businesses (the quarterly Labour ",

Analysing data quality and identifying problems The Data Quality Assessment Framework (DQAF) for Principal Labour Statistics published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 2005 is a recommended tool for establishing a quality statistics diagnostic. The quality criteria identified in this framework are: prerequisites of quality (covering legal and institutional environment, resources available for statistical work, relevance, and other quality management), assurances of integrity (adherence to the principle of objectivity in all steps of statistical production), methodological soundness (concepts, definitions, scope, classifications used), accuracy and reliability (data source, statistical techniques, validation, revision), service ability (periodicity and timeliness, consistency, revision policy and practice), data accessibility, metadata accessibility, and assistance to users. The European Statistical System has agreed standards for the quality of statistics in general and of labour market statistics in particular (as for other statistical domains). Quality criteria are: relevance, accuracy, timeliness and punctuality, coherence, accessibility and clarity, comparability and completeness. Based on those criteria (and sub criteria), Eurostat compiles a Quality Report on the European Union Labour Force Survey (EU LFS). A report based on 2008 data and on individual Member States quality data was published in 2010. For comparison and analysis of situations in different countries or sub-regions of the world, international standards and classifications should be respected. At the EU and OECD level, labour market statistics are harmonised and thus very comparable. But in developing countries, in practice, comparability of the data over time and across countries is often hampered by the use of different definitions, classifications or by differences in the methods of collection. If we take as an example the economically active population, the extent to which family workers, particularly women, are included among the economically active population varies considerably from one country to another. National practices between countries also vary significantly as regards the treatment of groups such as armed forces, members of religious orders, persons entering the labour market, seasonal workers or persons engaged in part-time economic activities. Depending on the countries, all or some of these groups are included, or not, among the economically active population while in other countries they are treated as inactive. The quality of data produced by countries also depends on issues specific to the source used. Survey data may suffer from sampling and non-sampling errors, and may also suffer from a poor quality of the sample frames used (e.g. population registers, business registers) 85 . 85 See chapters D.13 Business statistics and D.22 Population statistics. ",
        "D 409 Labour Market Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 As already mentioned, the management and maintenance (updating, checking) of business registers should assure a comprehensive coverage of all type of businesses; in developing countries, this is often not the case. In particular, poor coverage of small business is often observed. Furthermore, employment in the informal sector and other informal employment (see Box 27.2) often play a key role in developing countries. For instance, the Expert Group Meeting on Setting the Scope of Social Statistics of the United Nations Statistics Division noted that in several African countries the sample frame starts to be obsolete already four years after a population census, due to very rapid population growth (in particular in urban areas). If, as it may be the case, a systematic update of these frames is not undertaken, the sampling errors may increase significantly. The use of administrative data to compile statistics has the advantage of often being less costly than the implementation of surveys and treatment of data from these. However, the reliability and especially the adequacy of administrative data depend on the organisation and ability of the administration in a given country to manage and maintain them efficiently. For instance, if unemployed people do not systematically register to job agencies (e.g. because the agency is not efficient or because there is no incentive to do it), information from those agencies will have a poor coverage of the actually unemployed population. Finally, at national level, the multiple sources for producing labour market data (population censuses, labour force surveys, establishment surveys and administrative records) may create confusion. These data sources have the advantage of providing users with a wide spectrum of statistics. However, different data sources with different methodologies measure the same phenomena in different ways, with more or less accuracy and coverage. As a result, the final figure for the same type of variable may not be comparable. In addition, not all countries are able to produce data on a regular basis. In terms of quality, it is thus very important to provide metadata and guidelines to users to explain differences, key methodological and quality issues to keep in mind when using the data. It is also important to advise users on which source is the best to use for which particular purpose. Metadata are of particular importance for assessing the level of comparability and compliance with international standards. For bodies responsible for the production of labour market statistics, the comparison of data from different sources is also a way to identify and understand problems and gaps. Some countries go one step further and try to reconcile/ adjust data collected from different sources in order to bridge distinctive gaps in coverage of individual sources, smooth over measurement errors and harmonised definitions and classifications used. Other countries go further by integrating data or constructing labour accounting systems where various types of inconsistent data are reconciled to yield hybrid \u201cbest\u201d estimates. The main aim of such systems is to combine statistical data sources to enhance their strengths and overcome their weaknesses, in order to produce new series of data of superior quality. One of the advantages is the elimination of contradictory results. Box 27.5: Example of two data sources in Europe: EU LFS and National accounts The EU Labour Force Survey (EU LFS) and National Accounts of EU Member States are the two main sources of employment data. These two sources are not independent; indeed LFS is frequently an input to National Accounts employment estimates. Although using common definitions, LFS and National Accounts have their own aims and measurement approaches, which may lead to different results. In addition, other statistics based on business surveys or administrative sources also provide estimates of employment which may differ. These may also be used as input to the National Accounts. The main differences between LFS and National Accounts concern elements of geographical coverage (resident per sons employed in the LFS vs. employment in resident production units in National Accounts), other coverage issues such as age boundaries and treatment of institutional households and some borderline differences regarding for example the recording of conscripts, unpaid apprentices and trainees or work in agricul ture solely for own-consumption. To ensure consistency between the numerator (output in terms of value added) and the denominator (labour input) in the productivity indicators, the primary source for employment growth and branches of activity is National Accounts data; EU LFS data are used for employment rates and for gender and social breakdowns.

First and foremost, it is necessary to have a comprehensive diagnosis of the situation, including ongoing activities managed by other international donors, and potential difficulties. This could be done via targeted missions to the country. The objective of such a mission will be to produce a detailed report assessing: \uf0fc The level of comprehensiveness and quality of available data (e.g.: domain covered, existing sources, results from user surveys ...), problems of coherence and definition; data flows and existing information systems. \uf0fc The qualifications of the staff involved in terms of their ability to produce data that meet the standards required, as well as the level of national expertise in the different sub-sectors. \uf0fc The institutional framework and organisation of the collection and dissemination of labour market statistics and the role played by the NSI. Based on the results of this initial study, key actions should be identified together with the recipient country. To do so, a strategic meeting with the main stakeholders regarding the labour market statistics should be organised, with the objective of defining key priorities, objectives and targets. The result of the meeting will be translated into a document describing the components of the cooperation project, together with a tentative calendar. Key activities of the project may comprise: \uf0fc Technical meetings: training courses and workshops to help domain specialists in the country to deal with practical questions related to the collection, processing and analysis of labour market data. To encourage institutional co-ordination, experts from both the NSI and other administrations involved in the production process should be invited to participate. \uf0fc Technical assistance to national experts in the implementation of new concepts or methodological tools, methods for designing Labour Force and Living Conditions Surveys (standardized questionnaires, sampling methods), methods for analysing social statistics (data processing and analysis software such as STATA or SPSS), the concepts behind data harmonisation, etc... \uf0fc Specific co-ordination mechanisms between the NSI, involved ministries and other specialised agencies should be identified and proposed, in order to: Best address the use \u2022 rs\u2019 needs of labour market statistics. Define the most suitable set of indicators, given the national \u2022 methodologies used for the production of labour market statistics and social indicators. Promote synergies between the labour market statistics sector \u2022 and related statistical sectors (e.g. national accounts, migration statistics and social statistics). Even if national settings are very different, many of the problems in the development of sustainable systems for labour market statistics are common. Some common challenges for developing and improving the capacity for producing labour market statistics in a developing country are: \uf0fc Labour statistical systems are often not sufficiently co- ordinated. Concepts, definitions and classifications are not harmonised within countries and the labour market statistical system is not well co-ordinated with the statistical system for related domains (e.g. education, health, agriculture). Data might be available, but with problems concerning coherence and definitions and concerning the quality control of the data. \uf0fc Given the numerous stakeholders involved in producing labour market data, inter-institutional co-ordination is a major issue in many countries. Often, the Ministry of Labour and the National Statistical Institute do not collaborate closely to discuss statistical needs and priorities, to co-ordinate statistical standards and output or to avoid overlaps in data collection. \uf0fc A lack of capacities within government ministries (e.g. ministries responsible for labour, social security, education, vocational training and occupational health) to generate quality data from administrative records is often observed in developing countries. 86 In addition, statistics on the supply and demand in the labour market, based on registers kept by employment agencies, may be very unreliable due to the low coverage of the labour market (informal sector not covered; vacancies are not reported; unemployed persons are not registering). \uf0fc A lack of communication between users and producers of statistics is often observed. Access to data might be difficult (even if data exist) and dissemination not appropriate. A lack of co-ordination of concepts and definitions generates difficulties for users in reconciling statistics produced from different sources and for different regions or periods. Users may also lack the specialised skills and knowledge to analyse and interpret the labour market statistics. Each of these challenges needs to be addressed in order to develop and improve the capacity to produce even a basic set of labour market statistics. Factors that should be put in place to make data available include: organisation of the statistical system; \u2022 primary data collection mechanisms; \u2022 data processing methods; \u2022 dissemination mechanisms; \u2022 data analysis capacity; \u2022 staff qualifications; \u2022 funding mechanisms; \u2022 hardware and software equipment; \u2022 premises; \u2022 partnerships with non statistical units and with employers\u2019 \u2022 and union bodies. Furthermore, factors concerning possible synergies with other data production mechanisms must be addressed: 86 In such situations, the administrative systems are normally not well developed or maintained ",
        "D 411 Labour Market Statistics Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 sampling frames and registers; \u2022 survey systems; \u2022 dissemination of statistics; \u2022 compatibility of concepts adopted; \u2022 synchronisation of activities; \u2022 training; \u2022 multi-sectoral analyses within the framework of \u2022 development and poverty reduction policies; user satisfaction surveys. \u2022 ILO generally recommends prioritising the following actions: \uf0fc If it does not already exist in a given country, the highest priority should be given to the introduction of at least one national household survey with detailed labour force questions (preferably a labour force survey (LFS)) and subsequently to introduce a regular programme of LFS. At early stages of development in a country with limited resources and capacities, the labour force survey programme might comprise annual surveys of urban areas and 5-yearly (intercensal) surveys with national coverage. Informal employment should be measured in these labour force surveys. 87 \uf0fc Second priority should be given to build the capacity of the NSI and government ministries to generate quality statistics from administrative records. In order to build this capacity, it might be useful to initially develop statistics from one simple system only (such as reports of labour disputes or registered job-seekers), in order to build the confidence and skills of the statistical staff; In countries where the labour market statistics is more advanced (a good LFS already exists, ad-hoc surveys are conducted (e.g. child labour, informal sector), statistics from administrative records are available (but with uneven quality)), priorities can be given to the improvement or widening of the existing process, such as: increasing the frequency of the LFS (e.g. monthly or \u2022 quarterly); widening the thematic coverage of the LFS (e.g. modules \u2022 related to accidents at work, details of training, work history, travel to/from work, labour migration, etc...); introducing a regular programme of specialised household \u2022 surveys (informal sector, household budget, child labour); improving business surveys (e.g. separate surveys for \u2022 employment, extending existing surveys to include labour turnover and unfilled job vacancies, enlarge coverage to all business sectors); 87 Specific guidelines are provided by ILO to cover the informal labour market (see also Box 27.2). improving existing statistics based on administrative \u2022 records (content, definitions, classifications, coverage, frequency, reporting accuracy, quality checks) or compiling statistics from untapped administrative records (e.g. social security records, industrial relations reports and registrations, public sector records, etc ...). In addition, collaboration between ministries, other statistical producers/users and the national statistical office should always be encouraged. Moreover, overall management of the data flows and the implementation of a sustainable and modern information system is an issue in many developing countries. In some countries, administrative records are not available in an electronic format. The choice of which improvements or developments to focus upon should be based on the particular country priorities and directly linked with the user needs. Indeed, all potential actions should be complemented by an improvement of statistical analyses and of the relevance to user needs and priorities. It should also be kept in mind that, the more labour market statistics are used for current political issues, the more political awareness is raised and more use is made of labour market statistics when discussing, formulating and implementing policies. This should in turn raise the political awareness of the need to improve statistical capacity, both generally and specifically for labour market statistics. In this framework, organisation of user/producer workshops to encourage communication between these parties and of training workshops to guide users in how to make better use of labour market statistics might be considered.

Social Protection The chapter in brief This chapter is about social protection mainly in developing countries, with the emphasis on statistics. It gives the policy context of social protection, describes the metadata and data sources including their quality and proposes how a statistical action could be built in the sector. Its illustrations are drawn mainly from Eurostat\u2019s ESSPROS (European Social PROtection Statistics), which is used as a starting point for demonstrating how a framework could be developed and used. Further information could be obtained from the various websites given in the references at the end of the chapter. D.28.1. Policy applications The distribution of factor incomes in market economy is highly inegalitarian, with a very large number of zero incomes. This degree of poverty and inequality is a threat to social cohesion. Governments intervene to alleviate the condition of poverty and redistribute incomes. Redistributive policies are both vertical and horizontal. Vertical redistribution transfers income from better-off households to those in the lowest deciles, using mainly progressive taxation and benefits to the poor. Horizontal redistribution transfers incomes between different stages of the life cycle, such as from the working population to pensioners, from the healthy to the sick, from the employed to the unemployed. Thus, redistribution reduces poverty and vulnerability and minimises social exclusion, enhances social solidarity and, through particularly health and education expenditures, promotes investments in human capital. In developed countries, social insurance essentially covers the middle-income formal sector and either excludes informal workers altogether (among those most in need of social protection) or offers them ineffective voluntary affiliation. The ongoing global financial and economic crisis is aggravating these problems, reducing social insurance coverage (as the formal sector contracts and the informal sector and unemployment expand), increasing poverty and worsening living conditions. In this context, social assistance (including non-contributory social transfers in both cash and in-kind) is emerging in many developing countries as a key social protection instrument for tackling poverty and vulnerability. This kind of socially acceptable economic growth or \u201cgrowth with a human face\u201d is enshrined in a number of international policy initiatives, such as, for example, the White Paper on \u201cEuropean Social Policy: A Way Forward for the Union\u201d (COM(94) 333) and in the European Social Charter , which is the only treaty in European law to apply to all the aspects of social protection and hence lie at the core of the European social model. The European Social Model and the Lisbon Strategy have an external dimension which shapes EU external and development policy. In its relations with partner countries, the Commission advocates and supports the efforts to create more, better and more productive employment and to develop systems of social protection with broader and effective coverage, in order not to risk increasingly divided societies where economic growth does not benefit the poor. The European Consensus on Development stresses the crucial role of employment and Decent Work for achieving the MDGs. The EU endorses fully the Decent Work Agenda, which includes social protection as one of its four interdependent objectives 88 . Against the background of the current financial and economic crisis, social protection and employment are gaining momentum in European Commission development cooperation as effective responses to poverty and vulnerability in developing countries and as essential components of economic and social development strategies. The European Commission Communication (COM(2009) 160 of 8 April 2009) and the Council Conclusions of 18 May 2009, both on \u201c Supporting developing countries in coping with the crisis \u201d, stressed the importance of tackling the direct social impact of the crisis by creating and strengthening social protection systems and supporting formal job creation. The key policy applications of social protection arise from a number of issues. These arise in both developed and developing countries, though to varying degrees: The proportion of GDP that is spent on social protection. \u2022 \u201cToo small\u201d a proportion can be regarded as too little investment in human capital and \u201ctoo high\u201d a proportion can be seen in some quarters as directly and indirectly damaging economic growth potential; The share of the total benefit expenditure that is devoted to \u2022 current consumption, and the share to capital investments, such as the construction of hospitals, clinics and schools; The size of the benefit awarded to each individual/ \u2022 household. The larger the benefit, the greater the protection against social risks and needs, such as unemployment, but a large benefit can damage incentive to work, save and invest; and it also means fewer beneficiaries from a fixed budget; The coverage of the population under each scheme. The \u2022 coverage of the whole population is the aim of universal state schemes, such as those providing sickness benefits, but there may be supplementary employers\u2019 schemes that cover only a part of the population, such as farmers or other occupational groups. Developing countries have special problems. For example, important equity concerns remain because coverage is not usually extended to include private sector workers, people in the informal economy and immigrant workers. Also, the constitutional requirement 88 Together with fundamental principles and rights at work, decent and productive employment, and social dialogue. ",
        "D 416 Social Protection Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 in many cases to introduce a retirement pension scheme for all the workers, including the private sector ones, is not met in practice. Whether or not the benefit is means-tested, in other \u2022 words the eligibility for receiving the benefit depends on whether income or wealth is below a certain level. Means-testing channels limited resources to the poorest and most vulnerable but it can be seen as bureaucratic and stigmatising, meaning that take-up can be low, that is not all those who are entitled to the benefit applies for it and receive it. More generally, targeting is the means of identifying which members of society should receive a particular benefit. Benefits can be targeted on the basis of geography, age, disability, household size or other indicators of poverty. Targeted programmes have the effect of limiting the number of clients and reducing costs, but can also receive less political support, be too administratively cumbersome and costly. The appropriate approach to targeting will depend on a country\u2019s social and policy context. Whether financing of the benefit is through contributory \u2022 or non-contributory social insurance. The tendency is for benefits, such as unemployment or sickness, intended to compensate for temporary loss of earnings to be based on contributions, but other benefits, such as those that protect against social exclusion, to be non-contributory, that is eligibility is not conditional on prior contributions; The financing of social protection has been a huge challenge \u2022 to policy makers in both developed and developing countries. For the developed countries, the big problem has been the financing of pensions because of the ageing population and rising elderly dependency ratios, that is the retired population as a percentage of the working population has been increasing. Raising taxes and social insurance to pay for non-contributory old age pensions, in direct competition with spending on human and economic development, would have disincentive effects and are generally considered politically inexpedient. Although financing is one of the major challenges for delivering social protection in developing countries (and particularly in low income countries), recent evidence shows that even low-income countries can afford at least basic packages of social protection. Affordability of social transfers is largely a matter of political prioritisation, which depends on the political will to make the necessary trade-offs 89 . The more fundamental policy challenge concerns the \u2022 efficiency and effectiveness of social protection expenditures. Efficiency would be optimised when maximum return is achieved from a given expenditure or a given outcome is achieved at minimum cost. For example, it is generally considered that targeted means-tested benefits are more 89 The ILO has conducted a costing exercise that quantifies the costs of a basic package of social protection under a number of alternative scenarios. Still, analysis of broader affordability dimensions and fiscal space for social protection in low income countries needs to be strengthened. efficient than generalised benefits, though universal benefits would be preferable where administrative capacity is weak and political support from the middle classes for a social protection programme is needed. Effectiveness would be optimised when the stated objectives of the expenditure are achieved. For example, increased expenditure on maternal health care should result in much lower maternal deaths and infant mortality; Effective social protection systems require long-term \u2022 planning, strategy and political commitment. The social protection statistics can also be used to assess \u2022 the nature and trends in social exclusion, though for an in-depth study of this topic, or any other such as pensions, the core system of social protection would need to be supplemented by special modules that bring together data from a variety of sources for analysis. In developing countries, effective and credible monitoring and evaluation systems (measuring the performance of social protection programmes) are essential for demonstrating programme impact, developing an evidence base for decision-making, communicating operational lessons, and building the foundation of support that fosters long-term sustainability. The ILO uses the Social Protection Expenditure and Performance Reviews (SPERs) , which aim at providing detailed information on the performance of national social protection schemes as well as on the extent of coverage and exclusion from social protection. The SPERs provide information about the structure and level of total social expenditure, and establish indicators of system performance with respect to its effectiveness, efficiency, population coverage and the adequacy of benefit levels. The SPERs provide internationally comparable statistics on social protection D.28.2. Sources of data and metadata: scope, limits, concepts, definitions and nomenclatures Numbers are wrapped in a set of metadata concerning the scope, concepts, definitions and nomenclatures and, indeed, legislation on social protection. These are briefly considered in this section. D.28.2.1. Scope of social protection There is no universally unique definition of the scope of social protection that satisfies all purposes. Normally a pragmatic definition is adopted. The usual definition is that social protection encompasses all interventions from public or private bodies intended to relieve households, families or individuals of the burden of a defined set of risks or needs. The scope is defined in terms of the social risks or needs that one decides to include in social protection. As an example, Box 28.1 lists the social risks or needs defined in the ",
        "D 417 Social Protection Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 European ESSPROS survey, based on administrative data. In addition, the example in Box 28.1 includes education, which is excluded from ESSPROS but included in the reckoning of most developing countries. Thus, the table on social protection expenditure for a particular year would simply show (a) functions in columns, (b) either schemes or type of benefit in rows and (c) the expenditure figures in the cells. For the least developed countries, the tables in full would contain many empty cells, therefore showing where the gaps in the social protection system are located. At a second stage, cells could be combined into smaller tables. Social protection expenditures include not only social benefits but also the cost of administration . Social expenditures are classified by function. However, it is more difficult to classify social protection revenue by function. But revenue is classified by its institutional source, viz corporation, general government (central government, local authorities and social security funds), households, non-profit-making organisations and rest of the world. For example, the institutional distribution of total revenue would show how the social protection financing burden is shared between employers, government, households and other sources. D. 18.2.2. Content of the functions Box 28.1 takes a restricted view of social protection in terms of social risks in order that it should not include general anti-poverty measures or broader social policies or the entire spectrum of social expenditures as defined in the national accounts. However, operationally, it is difficult to set limits because social protection in individual developing countries can vary widely depending on culture, conventions, political consensus, policies and practices. The EU statistics on social protection, ESSPROS, provides a restrictive definition of content, i.e. of the risks and needs for which support schemes are defined under \u2018social protection\u2019. ESSPROS is useful as a starting point for developing social protection statistics, and can be adapted to fit with national circumstances and needs. ESSPROS has two conditions for a benefit to be counted as a social protection benefit. The first condition is that the recipient is not obliged to provide something of equivalent value in exchange. For example, expenditures by employers that can be regarded as compensation for work, such as free housing, child care for the children of employees, etc., should be excluded from social protection. If there is not a direct counterpart, for example in the case of occupational pensions, these are included in social protection. Similarly, the continued payment of normal or reduced wages and salaries while an employee is unable to work during sickness, maternity, disability and redundancy is regarded as social benefits. This criterion is restrictive. However, ESSPROS, which has been under development for over 40 years, show the basic principles for classifying support schemes as social protection. These principles can be applied as they are or adapted dependent on the national situation and systems. For example, the ESSPROS criterion would not include the Maharashtra Employment Guarantee Scheme in India under \u2018social protection\u2019. The Maharashtra Scheme guarantees one hundred days employment a year for the poor; not considering this as \u2018social protection\u2019 would be unacceptable in the context of India, and an adaption of the basic principle required. The second ESSPROS condition for a benefit to qualify as \u2018social protection\u2019 is that individual arrangements are excluded. A third party should be involved, with the aim of promoting social solidarity, for the benefit to be classified as social protection. This excludes insurance policies taken out as a private initiative of households or individuals solely for their own interest. For instance, the payment of a capital sum or an annuity to the holder of a private life insurance policy is not considered social protection as no third party is involved. The question of the scope, content and statistical dimensions of social protection is more easily resolved by listing the specific risks and needs (also called functions) in the international systems ESSPROS (EU), the Cost of Social Security Enquiry (ILO) and the SOCX system (OECD). The differences between these systems show some differences in the classification of benefits by risks and needs. The systems, with corresponding data bases are: Organization for Economic Cooperation and a. Development (OECD) : SOCX is the Social Expenditure database developed in order to serve a growing need for indicators of social policy. It includes reliable and internationally comparable s tatistics on public and private social expenditure at programme level across OECD member states . It should be noted that social expenditure is closer to this concept as defined in the national accounts rather than to social protection expenditure. International Labour Organization (ILO) b. : The ILO regards social protection as a fundamental human right under Article 22 of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights . The ILO has developed the Social Security Inquiry and additional associated databases to collect, store and disseminate, on a regular and sustainable basis, comparable statistics on social security systems/programme financing, expenditure, benefit levels and coverage for both formal and community based schemes across the world (including both developed and developing countries). These include employment- related social security schemes, public health, welfare and anti-poverty programmes as well as non-public schemes of different types transferring goods, services or cash to poor and vulnerable individuals and households. ",
        "D 418 Social Protection Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Eurostat c. : ESSPROS (the European System of Integrated Social PROtection Statistics) is the harmonised instrument of statistical observation of social protection in EU member states. Complementary to ESSPROS is MISSOC (The Mutual Information System on Social Protection) , which was established in 1990 and gives fuller description of the underlying legislation in EU Member States and analyses developments on, for example, the financing of social protection systems. The d. World Bank views seem to have shifted the conceptual framework of social protection from a definition by instruments (such as social insurance) to a definition by objectives (that is assisting in risk management); from a traditional focus on ex-post poverty to ex-ante vulnerability reduction; from seeing social protection less as safety nets and more as trampolines from which the poor can help themselves to jump out of poverty. The new conceptual framework is called Social Risk Management (SRM) . This framework is used by the World Bank for risk and vulnerability analysis, often done in conjunction with a poverty analysis, prior to the development of a country Poverty Reduction Strategy. D.28.2.3. Schemes and types of social protection interventions An important aspect of the system is the scheme or organisation. Schemes can be government or not government-controlled, contributory or non-contributory, universal that covers the whole population or occupational schemes, compulsory or not, and so on. A useful analysis is the functional classification of expenditures by schemes or a classification of revenue by schemes, showing for example the extent to which private schemes contribute to social protection receipts. The ESSPROS Manual contains a detailed classification of different types of social protection schemes. In the context of development cooperation, arrangements such as micro-insurance or community based schemes should be included. These arrangements have specific advantages, such as the flexibility in administrative processes and the targeted definition of benefits and contribution rates according to the capacities and needs of specific population groups such as rural workers or certain occupational groups. They allow the coverage of groups which may be difficult to cover otherwise and often excluded from statutory schemes. The encouragement of these arrangements and progressively establishing linkages with statutory social security schemes can be a strategy for extending social protection. Social assistance Social protection programmes are described as \u2018social assistance\u2019 when resources, either cash or in-kind (such as food), are transferred to vulnerable individuals or households. Social assistance programmes take many forms, including cash transfers or public works programmes. They will be allocated to functions depending on the risk being addressed, for example social assistance to the elderly would be allocated to the old-age function. Cash transfers Cash transfers can be unconditional, for example, social pensions or disability allowances. Alternatively, they can be conditional, for example where receipt of the payment is dependent on public works being performed or children attending school or a health clinic. The allocation could be to the Family, Education and Health functions respectively. Social pensions are non-contributory pensions and are therefore a form of cash transfers targeted by age. Research shows that they have a strong poverty reducing potential as the cash benefits tend to be shared within households. Public works programmes Public works programmes are a form of conditional transfer in that cash or food is given in return for work on public infrastructure projects, such as road building. In-kind transfers In-kind transfers are when non-cash resources (such as food) are passed to vulnerable individuals and households. The free distribution of anti-retroviral drugs to those living with HIV and AIDS can save lives. Fee waivers for basic services such as health and education are a form of social assistance in-kind transfers. School feeding is also common in many countries. Housing subsidies for the poor (concessional interest rates for mortgages) fall in this category. Social insurance Social insurance schemes are contributory programmes, where the beneficiaries make regular financial contributions in order to join a scheme that will reduce risk in the event of a shock. Thus, contributory insurance schemes protect against the social risks of, for example, old age (pensions) and unemployment (unemployment benefit), Health insurance is increasingly popular in developing countries, particularly where fees are charged for health services. Schemes can be run by the government, health providers and by non-governmental organizations. However, poor people find it hard to afford the health insurance premiums, particularly in the informal economy where incomes are small and uncertain. Micro-insurance can cover the risks of unorganized workers and their families in the informal sector of developing countries For example, in Bangladesh, many microfinance institutions provide life insurance and disaster insurance when giving loans to poor people (by allocating a small proportion of the loan to pay the insurance premiums). Funeral associations that support families when a member dies is another type of social insurance scheme. Labour market interventions Labour market interventions focus on providing protection for the category of the poor who are able to work. They vary between active and passive programmes. Active programmes ",
        "D 419 Social Protection Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 include training and skills development and employment counselling. Passive interventions include unemployment insurance, income support and changes to labour legislation, for example in establishing a minimum wage or paid maternity leave or safety at work. D.28.2.4. Risks/needs/functions The specification of the social risks of social protection helps in the definition of the scope, content and statistical support needed for monitoring and evaluation of social protection expenditures and receipts. Box 28.1 below gives one list of functions with examples of the benefits that may be classified in each. It provides an illustrative example of the possible contents of each function and is not entirely linked to any known system: Box 28.1: Social protection risks RISKS/NEEDS OR FUNCTIONS EXAMPLES OF BENEFITS Sickness/Health care Included are cash benefits that replace income lost due to illness, including medical care provided to expectant mothers and disabled persons. Conditional and unconditional non-contributory social transfers to the sick are included. That part of medical care paid for in part by the sick is excluded. Also, health care provided by employers to maintain production is excluded because there is a simultaneous reciprocal counterpart in the production of goods and services. Disability This social risk is the full or partial inability to engage in economic activity or to lead a normal life due to physical or mental impairment. It covers disability allowances, rehabilitation services, and goods and services other than medical care. Medical care for disabled or sickness-related benefits are classified under the Sickness function; and family allowances paid to the disabled in respect of spouse and children are classified under the Family function. Old age The benefits under this function are directly linked to the condition of old-age. They include contributory and non-contributory old age pensions and any replacement income when a person leaves his/her job early to make way, for example, for an unemployed person to take it. But excluded are health care expenditures for elderly, which are allocated to the Sickness function. Survivors Survivors eligible for benefit may be the spouse or ex-spouse or children of the deceased beneficiary. Benefits include survivors\u2019 pensions, death grants and funeral expenses. Family allowances for dependent children of a beneficiary of survivors\u2019 benefits are allocated to the Family function. Family/children This includes financial support for bringing up children and social services designed to assist the family. Benefits cover income maintenance at childbirth, birth grant, paid maternity leave, all family allowances, child day care and nursing homes. Conditional cash transfers or fee-waivers to encourage children to attend school may be classified under the Education function. Unemployment Typical benefits are unemployment benefit, redundancy compensation, training allowances for people looking for work and relocation costs for the unemployed who have found work away from their local area. Payments to promote active labour market policies that do not raise the disposable income of the unemployed may be excluded. Housing This covers means-tested interventions by the authorities directly to assist households with meeting their housing costs. It includes social housing, rent allowances, and means-tested transfers to owner-occupiers to help pay mortgages, capital and/or interest. Wider housing policies, including housing subsidies, aimed at assisting the building industry or promoting ownership may or may not be excluded depending on the strength of country reactions. Education For developing countries, the achievement of universal primary education is a key MDG and is normally measured through indicators on the reduction in illiteracy, increase in net enrolment ratios in primary education and the promotion of gender equality in primary and secondary education. Thus, this function may include the total expenditure by Local and Central Government on nursery, primary and secondary education; and on the reduction of illiteracy. It may include assistance with school uniform, text books and other educational material as well as free or subsidised school meals and school medical services. Conditional cash transfers or fee-waivers to encourage children to attend school may be classified under the Education function. Social exclusion not elsewhere specified This includes income support paid to people with insufficient resources or other safety-net payments to alleviate destitution. They include shelter for the homeless, means-tested legal aid, and counselling for alcohol and drug abuse. These benefits could be paid by Government or private non-profit making organisations such as charities. Care should be taken not to make this residual category too large; otherwise it would need further disaggregation. ",
        "D 420 Social Protection Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 D.28.3. Possible output of statistics and indicators Before describing the data sources, we should state some of the statistical indicators which those sources are expected to produce. That would impart focus to the description of sources, their limits and quality. The following suggestions are intended to serve only as a flexible guide which can be expanded in specific cases: Total social protection expenditure as a % of GDP at factor \u2022 cost, both current and constant prices; Total social protection expenditure as a % of all public \u2022 expenditure, current and capital combined; The total expenditure under each function as a % of \u2022 total social protection expenditure, for example the total expenditure under the old-age function as a % of all social protection expenditure; The full table showing functions in columns, schemes in \u2022 rows and expenditure in each cell; The full table showing functions in columns, benefit types \u2022 in rows and expenditure in each cell; The % distribution of total social protection revenue by \u2022 institutional source, for example how much employers contribute to the financing of social protection compared with households; The % distribution of revenue by function, though this can \u2022 be very difficult to produce; The total number of beneficiaries in receipt of benefits under \u2022 each function, without aggregating across functions; An estimate of the take-up of means-tested benefits, see \u2022 D.28.4.3 \u2018Household surveys\u2019 below; An estimate of the post-transfer poor, see \u2022 D.28.4.3 \u2018Household surveys\u2019 below; An estimate the reduction in inequality that is attributable \u2022 to the redistributive effect of the social protection system, see D.28.4.3 \u2018Household surveys\u2019 below. D.28.4. Data sources: content, limits and quality The data sources are: Accounting records of expenditure and revenue; \u2022 The administrative forms which are completed either by the \u2022 authorities concerning the condition and characteristics of the beneficiary or by the beneficiary himself. Included in this category are hospital and clinical records or registers on school enrolment, attendance, dropouts etc; Household sample surveys. \u2022 General statistical quality is discussed in chapter C.5.: The 7 quality criteria of Eurostat, based on the UN\u2019s Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics and part of the European Statistics Code of Practice (see section B.2.1.2.), are: relevance, accuracy, timeliness and punctuality, coherence, accessibility and clarity, comparability and completeness. Because social protection expenditure and receipts are part of public finance, the quality criteria stated by IPSAS (International Public Sector Accounting Standards) 1 , appendix 2, are also highly relevant: understandability, relevance, reliability (faithful presentation, substance over form, neutrality, prudence and completeness), constraints (timeliness, balance between benefit and cost). References will be made to quality in the description of content below. D.28.4.1. Accounting records Most of the expenditure data for social protection would come from government departments/ministries responsible for health, education, housing, social security and other functions. Often, the National Statistical Institute (NSI) would coordinate the information flow from different sources into a pre-determined social protection format, ensuring in the process that departmental concepts, definitions and classifications are adjusted to those used in the standard framework (which is necessary for international and temporal comparability). For example, errors and inconsistencies could arise from different valuations, (cash or accrual), different years, (fiscal or calendar), and different basis for recording benefits, (net or gross of tax). Within a decentralised statistical system, the line departments have their own statistical divisions, which, together with the NSI, form the National Statistical System (NSS). The NSI may be independent or may be located in the Treasury or in the Finance Ministry or the Planning Department. In any event, the NSS tends to coordinate closely to ensure, inter alia, that international standards are adopted throughout. This makes the flow of social protection statistics according to international norms more manageable, reliable and timely. Social protection statistical standards seek to be as consistent as possible with the UN System of National Accounts (SNA) 2008 and the European System of National Accounts (ESA95) (which applies to EU Member States) as well as with the latest IMF Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM 01) . These systems have differences amongst themselves, though in 2003 a Task Force on the harmonisation of public sector accounting led by the IMF but including OECD, EU and IPSAS have sought to minimise the differences in producing GFSM 08. Alignment with particularly General Government transactions in the national accounts is important and, indeed, in countries such as France, social protection statistics are developed as a satellite of the national accounts. However, the national accounts and the social protection systems are ",
        "D 421 Social Protection Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 not identical in all respects. For example, the classification of government expenditure by COFOG (Classification of the Functions of Government) is a classification by purpose whereas the classification by social protection functions is according to the viewpoint of the beneficiary. Thus, a payment to someone near retirement age to induce him to vacate his job so that an unemployed person could be placed in it is allocated to unemployment in COFOG, because the purpose is to reduce unemployment, but in social protection the payment is classified as old age because that is the perspective of the recipient of the payment. Thus, great care is required in importing ready-made national accounts statistics into social protection. It should also be noted that COFOG can be used in relation to government revenues such as fees. Care is also required to ensure that all social insurance schemes are included because in some countries such schemes are run by private companies such as insurance companies. They count as social security because they are compulsory and are subject to strict government regulations. But the money flows through private sector entities and might or might not count as government spending. The need is to make sure that they are included in the social protection statistics. Nearly all developing countries are committed to implement the latest SNA. However, even though the 2008 edition is now available, a large majority of them are still dealing with the 1993 version. Social protection accounts are, strictly speaking, satellite accounts of the national accounts. It is not uncommon for the national accounts to be developed ahead of social statistics generally and certainly social protection statistics in particular. Ideally, there should be maximum articulation between social protection statistics and national accounts but this tends to be the exception in low-income developing countries. Therefore, as a first interim step, using the national accounts figures of social expenditures for the identified social risks might be unavoidable while launching a statistical programme to achieve improvements. In developed countries generally, the state of public finance, including auditing and control, is sufficiently advanced not to cause undue concern about the quality of the derived statistics. In low-income countries, the situation can be very different. This is so despite the commendable efforts of, amongst others, the International Social Security Association (ISSA) to develop the statistical capacity of its members in developing countries and contributing to the development of international standards in this field. Often, the recording and reporting of disbursements (budget execution) can be seriously delayed, with serious consequences for programme monitoring and evaluation. This delay tends to be worse for health expenditure than for education expenditure, and also worse for capital than for current expenditure. The root cause is the shortage of trained accountants and auditors, even shortage of skilled clerks. In a number of low-income countries, such as Gambia and Guyana, the Ministries of Finance have been supported through cooperation programmes in order to install a network of computers linking the fiscal departments for rapid transmission of expenditure and revenue data. This network forms part of IFMIS (Integrated Financial Management Information System). IFMIS is to be welcomed but it can be demanding in skills and resources to maintain, which raises questions about sustainability once donor finance ceases. Financial data on social protection have to be supplemented with physical data on the number and characteristics of the beneficiaries under each function, for example how many pensioners or how many widowed pensioners. The aggregation of this information is not always easy to disentangle on an unambiguous basis. Some beneficiaries receive more than one benefit, such as both pensions and housing benefits, and so simply adding the number of beneficiaries under the old-age function to those under the housing function would result in duplication. Moreover, estimates of numbers can relate to one point in time or for the whole year, not always easy to distinguish in the statistics. The difficulty in estimating numbers of beneficiaries and their socio-economic characteristics from financial records is one argument in favour of the administrative forms and also of household sample surveys, described in section D.28.4.2. and section D.28.4.3. respectively. D.28.4.2. Administrative forms concerning the condition and characteristics of the beneficiary The information contained in the administrative forms which are completed either by the authorities concerning the condition and characteristics of the beneficiary or by the beneficiary himself goes well beyond expenditure and receipts. For example, the forms on the granting of means-tested housing benefits would contain, inter alia , information on income and/or wealth, tenure status and household size. The forms would be completed either by the social security administration through direct questioning of the applicants for benefits, with requests in some cases for supporting documentary evidence, or it would be filled in by the applicant, with subsequent checks carried out by the authorities. Sometimes, the administration is persuaded to add questions for purely statistical purposes in these forms as the cheapest way of collecting additional information. The accuracy of the data collected in this way depends very much on the truthfulness of the answers given by applicants. This can be assessed by in-depth follow-up investigations of a very small sample of respondents. If the forms are pre-coded, data entry should be relatively fast with fewer transcription and other errors. In large countries, the resulting database can be huge, with quite protracted timescales for the completion of processing to obtain analyses. In order to improve timeliness, some countries, such as UK, take a small random sample of the records for early processing to obtain preliminary results, with of course the caveat that the sample results would be subject to sampling errors. ",
        "D 422 Social Protection Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Also, administrative records are normally the source of input/resource/access social protection indicators (at least the numerator) such as the number of trained doctors per head of rural population. In low-income countries, administrative reporting is well- established and can yield comparatively reliable data. However, some countries experience severe difficulties, particularly in the field of health. Health data tend to be collected at various levels, viz Village Health Centres, Primary Health Care Centres, and Minor and Major Health Centres. But this reporting is not always undertaken under professional supervision. In addition, there might be no means of centralizing the data from the health facilities because of lack of internet services, including lack of electricity, and insufficient vehicles, scarce fuel and limited personnel. The few officials from Head Office have to travel the length and breadth of the country to collect the information, which might remain stored in paper files for long periods without processing and analysis. The overriding danger of this ad hoc, manual process of data gathering is coverage errors, which are the inadvertent omission of facilities and even regions from the national statistical aggregates. D.28.4.3. Household surveys Administrative data give only users of services or actual reach. Those who need the service but do not, for one reason or another, make use of it themselves are excluded from the administrative statistics. This argument applies to people who are entitled to means-tested social protection benefits but do not, for one reason or another, actually claim, or take up, the benefit. The only way to measure take-up is either through appropriate questions included in household surveys or through service facility-based surveys. The typical survey for measuring take-up is the Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES), in which detailed questions are asked about sources of income, including the receipt of various benefits. From these data it is possible to construct the means-tested income/assets threshold and hence measure entitlements and take-up. More generally, the HIES is used to measure financial poverty and material deprivation and, in some countries, to collect information on coping strategies. Indeed, a household survey generally covers a wider range of household characteristics than the corresponding administrative source, and can therefore generate deeper cross-analyses to reflect the multi- dimensional nature of poverty and vulnerability. These issues are all highly relevant to questions about the need for, and delivery of, social protection and hence the implications for social cohesion. The HIES has two other relevant uses, though these are more difficult to execute and can even be somewhat controversial. First, it can yield an estimate of the post-transfer poor, that is the numbers that remain poor after the receipt of the \u201csafety- net\u201d income support. As a hypothetical example, let us put the official minimum income as 100 Euros per month for a female-headed indigent household. A poverty line can and is often independently derived from the HIES. If this statistical line for exactly the same household type works out as 120 Euros per month, it is clear that this particular household still lives in poverty even after help from the authorities. The total number of such households can be counted from the HIES. If this number is large, the conclusion could be that the social protection system in respect of poverty alleviation is ineffective. 90 Secondly, the HIES, in conjunction with independent data on unit costs of services, can be used to show how inequality (as measured by say the Gini coefficient) in the size-class distribution of factor incomes is progressively reduced at each stage of income redistribution. Starting with the large Gini for factor incomes, the Gini is derived for incomes after income taxes, and then for post-tax, post-transfer incomes, then for incomes (say final incomes) after taking account of imputed benefits of health expenditure to individual households. The greater the difference between the Gini for the distribution of factor incomes and the Gini for the distribution of final incomes, then the more effective is the redistributive function of social protection system 91 . All household sample surveys suffer from sampling and non-sampling errors. Income data are particularly prone to wide margins of reporting errors and non-response bias and, indeed, household surveys are particularly unreliable at the tails of the income distribution. Surveys are very costly. Because mainly of costs, the HIES is often carried out every five years in developing countries, which means that it is more useful for providing benchmarks than for annual monitoring. Nevertheless, household survey data can be used to check the reliability of administrative data or, coupled with administrative data, to derive estimates in certain circumstances. Surveys other than the HIES can shed light on the effectiveness of the social protection system in terms of outcome indicators. The main examples are the World Bank\u2019s Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS) , UNICEF\u2019S Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) , the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) , and the Core Welfare Indicator Questionnaire (CWIQ ), a light survey intended to yield data on the MDG indicators. 90 Governments often object to this interpretation on the grounds (a) that the official line IS THE poverty line and (b) that the line derived from the survey is too generous and therefore unaffordable. Normally, the survey-based line is defined as 50% or 60% of the mean equivalised household disposable income, where the equivalence scales are factors that adjust the household income for household size and sex-age composition. 91 The horizontal redistribution and the disincentive effects have also to be taken into account before passing a final judgment on the effectiveness of the social protection system.

How to build a statistical action in this sector The principles that should guide the statistical action are; To be clear about the objectives and statistical outputs of a. the statistical action in this sector; To consolidate and build on the 3 broad categories of b. data sources mentioned in the previous section in order to meet these objectives; To develop social protection statistics as part of the c. development of other systems, specifically the national accounts (of which it is a satellite), Public Finance Management (PFM) reform, which is normally central to EU General Budget Support, and social indicators, with which it overlaps; To see social protection statistics in the broader context d. of building institutional capacity and strengthening good governance. The main pillars of the statistical action should be: The suggestions in this chapter provide a flexible guide to a. the kinds of issues that a country would have to consider in developing a social protection statistical programme. The chapter does not seek to be prescriptive because of the wide variations in national policies, preferences and practices. However, it should serve as a very useful point of departure concerning the scope of social protection, concepts, definitions and classifications, functions, the possible content of functions, schemes, types of benefits, institutional breakdown and data sources. In general, to develop an action in this area, the following steps are proposed: Develop a national social protection \u03bf framework , linked, where appropriate, to the Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) and the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF); Establish a manageable definition of social protection \u03bf and its scope; Define which is the main set of needs or risks (i.e. \u03bf which are the functions) to be considered within the definition of social protection; Identify the main types of institutions providing social \u03bf protection that should be considered within the scope and formulate a definition for the statistical units (i.e. the social protection schemes) by specifying the elements necessary to delimit them; Identify, according to the functions selected, groups of \u03bf protected persons and define the benefits provided for specific groups; establish a classification of benefits by function and possible specific breakdowns needed by the national system of social protection (e. g. by cash/ kind, means-tested / non means-tested); As certain who \u03bf are the poorest and most vulnerable , and what is the best way of reaching them, given the budget and capacity constraints facing so many governments; Establish which are the main data sources that can \u03bf provide the necessary information by social protection scheme, which is the information that can be gained from different data sources and formulate a parallel programme for improvements; Describe qualitatively all schemes and the benefits \u03bf provided by each one of them; develop user manuals; Build broad political support and support amongst \u03bf donors. Aim at producing as far as possible the statistics and b. indicators listed in section D.28.3. above. For developing countries, many cells in the tables would be zero. However, that would still be useful information in indicating the absence of particular social protection arrangements in those cells; Consolidate. That means building on the 3 categories c. of data sources mentioned in the preceding section. These sources should not be seen as alternatives but complementary, and therefore their development should be planned in a coordinated way; Most of the action that should be taken is implied in d. the comments on data quality in those descriptions. Additional considerations are mentioned below; The role of training is crucial in all countries, particularly e. in developing (both low and middle income) countries. Training is further considered below. Ideally, the development of social protection statistics should proceed through the strengthening of Management Information Systems (MIS). The data in these are used to underpin policy decisions and to conduct monitoring and evaluation exercises. They cover both financial and non- monetary data and their relationship to each other, and they are constructed from both administrative and survey information, including the population census. IFMIS has already been mentioned. Others would be the Health MIS (HeMIS), Housing MIS (HMIS) and Education MIS (EMIS). Setting them up would involve substantial back-office costs in IT. ",
        "D 424 Social Protection Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 Box 28.2: European Commission support to social protection in developing countries Income, employment and social protection are essential for achieving social inclusion and cohesion. Developing countries are often characterized by unemployment, underemployment, lack of social protection and large informal economies. Social protection systems function as shock absorbers in crisis situations, reduce poverty and support pro-poor economic growth. However, there are challenges for social protection in developing countries. These include the necessity to raise awareness and provide evidence on the positive impacts of social protection, achieving long term financially sustainably within national budgets for social protection, and extending social protection for people in the informal economy and in rural areas. These challenges highlight the need for quality data to monitor and evaluate the impacts of social protection. The EU emphasizes reduction of poverty in its development and co-operation policies, by strengthening employment, employability, social protection and decent work , amongst others through the Migration, Mobility and Employment Partnership of the Joint Africa-EU Strategy (JAES) . The European Report on Development 2010 is entitled \u2018Social Protection for Inclusive Development - a New Perspective in EU Co-operation with Africa\u2019. It deals with the issues of poverty, inequality and social protection, with a focus on Sub-Saharan Africa. The report focuses on the role of formal and informal mechanisms of social protection as a means to enhance the resilience of countries when faced with shocks (short term) and structural vulnerabilities such as poverty traps (long term). The European Commission Communication \u2018 A twelve-point EU action plan in support of the Millennium Development Goals \u2019 (2010) underlined that targeted interventions should focus on the most vulnerable, including women, children and people with disabilities, through support to wide coverage social protection systems which are a key element of social cohesion and stability. Concrete measures to help developing countries cope with the global financial and economic crisis were set out in the European Commission Communication \u2018 Supporting developing countries in coping with the crisis \u2019 (2009). Amongst these measures is support to developing countries to cope with the direct social impact of the crisis through creation and strengthening of social safety nets, facilitation of direct cash transfers and enhancement of in-kind transfers. A further measure is to support mechanisms to safeguard social spending in developing countries in crisis situations. A European Commission Reference Document on \u2018Social Transfers in the fight against hunger\u2019 is being issued in 2011. The European Commission supports social protection in all regions, through a demand-driven and differentiated approach. In Latin America, 40% of European Commission co-operation is addressing the social sector and social protection; in Asia, there is increasing political dialogue and important bilateral co-operation support to social protection reforms. In Africa, European Commission support to social protection encompasses a range of country programmes, including the Productive Safety Net Programme in Ethiopia (with the World Bank), comprehensive social protection programme through sector budget support in Rwanda, and support and funding for UNICEF\u2019s Orphan and Vulnerable Children\u2019s (OVC) Programme in Lesotho and Zimbabwe. There are widespread actions, supporting countries own reforms of social protection systems and Food Security programmes. The Joint Africa-EU Strategy (2007) defines 8 strategic partnerships, one of which is the Migration, Mobility and Employment Partnership. This Partnerships aims to create more and better jobs for Africa and to better manage migration flows, essential elements of strategies against poverty and other national development and co-development strategies. The Action Plan 2011-2013 defines 12 initiatives; the ones directly concerning EU-AU co-operation on social protection: The Decent Work Initiative, which extends social protection coverage in particular in the informal economy, supporting the AU programme on \u2022 upgrading the informal economy and the Productivity Agenda for Africa; The Labour Market Governance and Capacity Building Initiative, which aims at strengthening the institutional capacity of the labour market \u2022 institutions in Africa, especially public employment services and labour administrations; The organisation of a number of regional and sub-regional fora on employment, labour, social protection and labour migration, including \u2022 supporting harmonisation processes of labour market and social protection frameworks at regional levels, in cooperation with Regional Economic Communities In March 2001, the European Commission and the African Union Commission organised a workshop in Nairobi on \u201c Social protection in Africa \u2013 sharing experience in the informal economy \u201d. It was attended by representatives of EU and AU Member States, Regional Economic Committees, international organizations, civil society organizations, social partners and experts on social protection. In line with the Action Plan initiative, the objective of workshop was to contribute on how to implement the AU Social Policy Framework and the AU Programme on Upgrading the Informal Economy and the Productivity Agenda for Africa, through an exchange on national, regional or local social protection initiatives/schemes in the formal and informal economy were discussed. The workshop focused on identifying and removing obstacles to effective social protection for informal economy workers, on resource mobilization strategies in support of social protection, and on follow-up on the Decent Work Initiative. The workshop concluded that there is a need to further develop and implement overall social protection policies that particularly address workers and their family members in the informal economy. Political commitment, mobilisation of national resources and the need to address affordability aspects were particularly highlighted for setting up social protection systems. It was highlighted that it is important to enhance data collection and setting up monitoring and evaluation mechanisms for analysing the impacts of social protection.

        "D 425 Social Protection Guide to Statistics in European Commission Development Co-operation \u2014 Version 2.0 D.28.5.1. Accounting records There is no substitute to ensuring timely, comprehensive and accurate recording and reporting of expenditure and revenue covering all service facilities. In low-income countries, appropriation, commitments and disbursements tend to be well below budgets, with substantial time lags. There are international standards and recommendations about these matters. There is the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) PFM Performance Measurement Framework ; Annex 1 gives The PFM High-Level Performance Indicator Set, which should be implemented. D.28.5.2. Administrative records The specific actions that should be taken to achieve improvements are: Observe the data capture forms used; see if they are \u2022 standardized between service facilities in the sector; find out how the data are stored and trace the information flows; See to what extent international classifications, such as \u2022 ICD and ISCED , are used; Observe the recording of information and, if any, \u2022 computerised data entry; Identify the quality control methods used in the statistical \u2022 process; Assess other aspects of data management, such as \u2022 supervision, hardware and software in use, spreadsheets, deployment of internet or other methods for data transmission; Evaluate the extent of tabulation and analysis, and their \u2022 purpose; Assess the strength and quality of the human resources \u2022 deployed on statistical reporting; Interact with the data clerks at grass-root level to learn of \u2022 their qualifications, motivation, dedication, and training needs; sector training initiatives should be coordinated with the statistical training programme of the NSI. D.28.5.3. Household sample surveys Remember that surveys are necessary for performing \u2022 welfare analysis and for impact analysis of social protection programmes; and they are also necessary for data capture in the informal sector which might be poorly covered in administrative records. At the same time, they can be very expensive, so first see if the required analyses could be met from existing sources or by hitch-hiking on existing collection instruments; The primary purpose of an HIES is to generate expenditure \u2022 weights for the compilation of the CPI and secondarily to contribute to the tracking of progress towards the MDGs. Attempts to overload the HIES thereby making it a multi- purpose omnibus survey, for example in Gambia in 2003, has actually resulted in large blocks of data never analyzed. Many countries, for example the Maldives, have found the Household Economic Survey useful, particularly in relation to the informal sector. D.28.5.4. Training In developing countries at least, training is needed at all levels: central government, sectoral and regional levels and also at the level of service facility. The evidence is that, generally speaking, the clerks who compile figures are not sufficiently motivated and consequently might be casual in carrying out their statistical tasks. The problem is attitude as well as lack of skills. Many of those charged with compiling data for poverty monitoring are themselves near the poverty line. Thus, simply demanding greater rigour and dedication to increasing data quality might seem coercive and unproductive. Local staff should be trained to see the ultimate value of their work, such as the impact of their data entries on policy and planning. This perspective would invert dissemination and reporting, that is, disseminate the results of monitoring first and as a means of improving bottom-up reporting. There should be training in analysis and training should be continuous . The first step in developing a training programme is to conduct a needs survey and a needs analysis covering all relevant stakeholders. The priority is to train trainers, with their multiplier effects, and if possible to mount training in situ because of the need to achieve relevance to local conditions and local laws. However, because of economies of scale, a regional approach and infrastructure might already be available through, for example, CARICOM in the Caribbean or through SADC for Southern Africa. The ILO\u2019s International Training Centre in Turin Italy has 5 regional centres, which deal with Africa, the Americas, Arab States, Asia and the Pacific and Europe; these regional divisions do run training courses in social protection.
