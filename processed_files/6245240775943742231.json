        "2 R. C.: Sir, as President of the Turkish Court of Accounts you are the Chairman of a Troika which includes the President of our Court of Auditors and the General Auditor of Macedonia. What is the aim of this Troika? President Akyel: first of all, I would like to thank you for giving this opportunity for sharing with you the information regarding the structure and the audit function of the turkish court of accounts (tca) as well as our efforts of cooperation with other saIs. as you may know the next Presidents\u2019 Meeting of the network of the supreme audit Institutions of the candidate and Potential candidate countries of the european union and the european court of auditors, in short the Presidents\u2019 network, is planned to be held in March 2011 in Istanbul. the last meeting hosted by the state audit office of Macedonia 1 was held in June 2007 in skopje which was also the first meeting after the latest enlargement rounds in 2004 and 2007. the activities of the network are also supported by oecD/sIGMa and the co- chairs of the Joint working Group on audit activities which was established in 2002 under a different name with the aim of promoting and facilitating small-scale, practical, hands-on co-operation between candidate country and eu Member state saIs. after previous network activities such as conducting a Parallel audit on eu funded projects which resulted in a consolidated report and a document entitled \u201cMaking saI twinning successful: a Good Practice Guide\u201d, since 2007, two successful workshops in the Public Internal financial control area have been held in July 2008 in ankara and in february 2010 in sarajevo. oecD/sIGMa hosted a brainstorming meeting on 15 January 2010 in Paris in order to identify common needs and interests to serve as a basis for future network activities which can potentially be supported by sIGMa. one of the major conclusions of the meeting was that organising a new meeting of the Presidents of the saIs of the network in 2010 would be very beneficial for giving direction and impetus to the network, as well as providing the Presidents of the saIs with potential follow-up activities such as mandating specific working groups under the network and opportunities for supporting other identified topics and events such as workshops and seminars. In the meeting of the liaison officers of the network held on 26 th april 2010 in Prague, the turkish court of accounts volunteered to host the next Presidents\u2019 meeting in spring 2011, instead of 2010 and a working group consisting of the liaison officers from the saIs of Macedonia as the former host of the meeting of the Presidents of saIs, turkey and eca (the troika) with the support of sIGMa and the co- chairs of the JwGaa was established in order to draft the preliminary agenda. It\u2019s concluded that the Presidents\u2019 meeting will take place in Istanbul. the tca distributed the first draft agenda of the Presidents\u2019 meeting on 3 september 2010 and it was discussed at a preparatory meeting with participation of the los of the troika member saIs as well as the representatives from sIGMa and the saI of the czech republic representing the co-chairs of JwGaa on 5 october 2010 in Paris which was hosted by sIGMa. as the heads of the troika member organizations, we had planned to gather just after the 2010 contact committee meeting on 18-19 october 2010 in IntervIew wIth Dr. recaI akyel, PresIDent of the turkIsh court of accounts (tca) for the euroPean court of auDItors (eca) Journal By Rosmarie Carotti 1. note by the editor : In official eu documents Macedonia is referred to as \u00ab former yougoslav republic of Macedonia\u00bb ",
        "3 luxembourg with an aim to review and contribute to the preparation of the Istanbul Meeting next year. Because of the deliberations on the draft new tca law in our Parliament, unfortunately I was not able to attend either the 2010 cc meeting or the troika meeting. however, I am pleased to learn that the delegation of the troika members with the participation of Mr. vitor caldeira, President of the european court of auditors and Mrs. tanja tanevska, General state auditor of Macedonia as well as Mr. Milan Martin cvikl, the Member of chamber Iv of the eca conducted a very fruitful meeting and made significant progress in terms of giving direction to the preparations of the Presidents\u2019 meeting. R. C.: Has the Turkish Court of Accounts experienced important changes after the foundation of the Turkish Republic in 1923 or in more recent times? President Akyel: the turkish court of accounts was established in 1862, and it became a constitutional institution when the first ottoman constitution was enacted. after foundation of the turkish republic in 1923 it was re-established and maintained its status as a constitutional institution in all three republican constitutions. During the republican era, our efforts on the modernisation of every segment of society were further accelerated with the beginning of cooperation between turkey and the european economic community (ecc) in 1959. as supreme audit Institutions are one of the main actors in supporting the improvement of accountability, transparency and financial management system, the turkish court of accounts tried to make every effort to fulfil this role. especially, after the announcement of turkey\u2019s eu candidacy in 1999, these efforts have gained further momentum. In parallel to this development, with a view to aligning its audit methods and institutional principles and practices with internationally accepted standards and european practices, a twinning Project was implemented in cooperation with the uk national audit office. the project was fully financed by european union, except for preparatory works and our own contributions throughout the project. within the scope of the project, draft financial audit and Performance audit Manuals as well as It and hr strategy Documents and the risk assessment and Management framework Document were developed. the most significant impact of eu harmonization efforts in the field of public financial control in turkey is the abrogation of the most fundamental and comprehensive law regulating this area and the enactment of a new law prepared in compliance with internationally accepted practices in 2006. In line with this significant change, a draft tca law was submitted to our Parliament and deliberations regarding the law in the Parliament are still in progress. R. C.: What does \u201caccountability\u201d mean for the Turkish Court of Accounts? President Akyel: as a requirement of the accountability principle regarding the acquisition and utilization of public resources of all kinds, as defined under the constitution and the law on the turkish court of accounts, the tca is responsible for auditing on behalf of the turkish Grand national assembly the revenues, expenditures and property of public administrations. In the main law regulating the public financial management and control in turkey which was implemented in 2006, accountability is described for those who are assigned duties and vested with authority for the acquisition and utilization of public resources of all kinds as being accountable vis-\u00e0-vis the authorized bodies and responsible for the effective, economic and efficient acquisition, utilization, accounting and reporting of the resources on the basis of law, as well as for taking necessary measures to prevent the abuse of such resources. IntervIew wIth Dr. recaI akyel, PresIDent of the turkIsh court of accounts (tca) ",
        "4 another reflection of eu harmonization process to our institution in recent years is the extension of our audit scope. as we all know, one of the most vital features of supreme audit Institutions is the authority to audit all entities using public resources without any limitations. In parallel to this, with the amendments made to our constitution and to relevant laws, tca\u2019s audit mandate was expanded to include social security institutions and certain special budget institutions, which had not been subject to the tca\u2019s audit before. Moreover, the mandate to conduct external audit of local administrations\u2019 budgets, was given constitutional guarantee, instead of the provisional articles it rested upon until that time. Public sector and municipal companies that are outside the scope of the tca audit shall be subject to our audit when our draft law is enacted. regarding our reports submitted to the Parliament, under the constitution we prepare the statement of General conformity and submit it to Parliament. with this statement we assure Parliament that the figures and disclosures shown in the draft final accounts law for previous year fairly present the actual results of budgetary implementation. we also perform performance audits and accordingly, we examine whether the public entities within our audit mandate are using their resources effectively, efficiently and economically and submit the results of our examinations as evaluation reports to the Parliament. according to Public financial Management and control law we have the responsibility to submit administration accountability reports, General accountability report on local administrations, General accountability report, financial statistics evaluation report and external audit General evaluation report to the Parliament. according to the tca law we are also entitled to prepare reports and submit them to the Parliament in subjects such as, legal and regulatory provisions which jeopardize the interests of the treasury, significant instances of failure to comply with legislation and financial issues including accounting methods, practices and systems. our performance audit reports receive wide media coverage and have an impact on public opinion. nevertheless, there are no guidelines for the procedure of the debate of our reports submitted to the Parliament and thus we encounter some problems and difficulties in following up. R. C.: Are EU funds treated the same way as national funds? What systems are in place to make sure that EU pre-accession funds are well spent and what improvements can be considered? President Akyel: as known, the audit of the funds provided to turkey by the eu has been carried out by the turkish court of accounts in accordance with the Memorandum of understanding (Mou) on the establishment of the national fund since 2003. In these audits eu funds are dealt with some different procedures compared to the national funds. the audit findings of eu funds are submitted to eu commission by the President without being subject to the internal process of national funds audit reports, such as judicial review of tca. In its audits, tca uses a mixed system containing financial, compliance and system based audits to ensure that eu funds are used efficiently and effectively. under the Decentralised Implementation system, tca functions as an external audit body for eu funds management. to fulfil our audit function well, we have set up a dedicated and qualified audit team responsible for the audit of eu funds. each year an audit plan and summary of the audit findings report are prepared by this team and these reports are sent to the eu commission directly by the Presidency of tca in compliance with the Mou.

        "5 R. C.: ECA has recently created Chambers, you work with Chambers. What precisely are their function and powers? President Akyel: chambers are at the heart of the tca\u2019s judicial system. each chamber consists of a chairman and six members, and operates as a court. however, the chambers gather with the presence of the chairman and four members and decide by simple majority. the principal work of a chamber is to try the acts and accounts of responsible officials. trial is based on auditor reports. thus the chamber decides whether these officials are to be acquitted or held liable. In addition to this, according to the tca law, in case the President deems necessary, chambers express their opinions on the statement of general conformity and other reports to be submitted to the turkish Grand national assembly, and decide on matters the deliberations of which were requested by the President. R. C.: Contrary to the ECA, the Turkish Court of Accounts has judicial powers and can pass judgement. What is the role of the Prosecutor of the Turkish Court of Accounts? President Akyel: the authority and responsibilities of the Prosecutor and ten Deputy Prosecutors of the turkish court of accounts are prescribed in the related articles of the tca law. to mention a few, he expresses his claims and opinion during the stages of examination and trial of the accounts; presents and expresses his opinion in the General assembly meetings at which the deliberations on the statement of general conformity and the reports to be submitted to the Parliament take place; monitors the execution of rulings entailing disciplinary or punitive actions regarding the responsible officials; informs the Ministry of finance and other authorities concerned, if during the trial of accounts or under other circumstances he becomes aware of the acts of responsible officials which require disciplinary or punitive actions, expresses his opinion about the actions to be taken against those accountants who have not submitted their accounts within the time limits prescribed by the law. the prosecutor may join the Board of chambers, which formulates the opinion of the tca on the financial regulations issued by the ministries and other administrations and institutions that fall under the court of accounts\u2019 jurisdiction, upon his own initiative or upon invitation of the chairman of the Board, but he has no vote. In addition to that he defends his case before the Board of appeals at trial sessions. In short, he acts as the representative of the treasury. I would like to thank you again for giving me this opportunity for providing information about the turkish court of accounts.

        "6 R. C.: Mr Muis, you were President of the Dutch Institute of Registered Accountants, Vice president of the World Bank and Director-General of the European Commission. In what are you involved now and why are you here today? Jules Muis: I am here in luxembourg to-day basically to tell Maarten engwirda, and anyone else who wants to know, that there is life after retirement! I am very interested in good governance in the public and private sector and in international financial architecture. I speak to conferences and mostly work for non profit organisations in oversight functions. I was the chairman of the audit committee for IB, the International Baccalaureate programme which is accepted by most international schools, and I have just joined its Board of Governors. I am the chairman of an oversight committee of a european project by various eu accountants organisations called \u201ccommon content\u201d which focuses on harmonizing and upgrading the quality educational requirements for accountants. I have also joined the audit committee of the International criminal court (Icc) to give an outside view on prudential good housekeeping practices of a very difficult, very important organisation. Because the Icc is sending such a unique signal to the world: that you can be a dictator in your country but your past may always catch up with you at some point in the future. IntervIew wIth Jules MuIs, forMer DIrector-General of the Internal auDIt servIce of the euroPean coMMIssIon By Rosmarie Carotti Jules Muis, former Director-General of the Internal audit service of the european commission Maarten B. Engwirda, Dutch Member of the Court, invited Members and staff to attend a lecture by Jules Muis, on \u2018THE AUDIT PROFESSION AND THE FINANCIAL CRISIS: AUDITING AS A MAJOR PART OF THE PROBLEM, AND A MAJOR PART OF THE SOLUTION\u2019 on Wednesday 20 October 2010 ",
        "7 R. C.: Today you give a lecture in the ECA on \u2018 THE AUDIT PROFESSION AND THE FINANCIAL CRISIS: AUDITING AS A MAJOR PART OF THE PROBLEM, AND A MAJOR PART OF THE SOLUTION\u2019 in which you refer to a number of key recommendations you have given to IFAC in an interview called \u201cThe Flying Dutchman\u201d and which can be found on their site http://www.ifac.org/frsc/ . You say in it that the signs of the financial crisis were clearly visible and you sounded a clear warning in 2004. What is your message today, as press and banks come up again with positive figures about the development of our economy? Mr Jules Muis: we still have major problems because we have not absorbed, digested and disclosed all the pain and the expense of the financial crisis. on an interview with Dutch television, I defined the nature of this crisis as a hairball. we have these very complex derivatives wrapped into each one another and you have to disentangle that. It will take a long time before this crisis, which unlike most other economic crises was triggered by a failure of the financial system, is solved. all the chronometers you have, all the monitoring systems, went haywire. we have to realize that there is still a tremendous mortgage of the past on our balance sheets. that we do not live now in a normal economy but what I call a \u201cmethadone economy\u201d; we are off heroine but are using the substitute methadone as a cure. R. C.: What concretely is this \u201cmethadone\u201d? Jules Muis: we are keeping interest rates artificially low. the central Banks are buying up a lot of debt, basically printing money. and unless we normalize that into a regular housekeeping practices ours is an economy on drugs and it is an economy still faced with paying off the debt of the past. we have deferred taking the pain out of the balance sheets of many banks by collective window dressing, by suspending mark-to-market accounting. R. C.: Do you therefore think that the recent decision of the Federal Reserve (FED) to print more money to boost the economy is right, or do you rather share the fears of the President of the German Bundesbank on that? Jules Muis: temperamentally I am a big admirer of Paul volker, the old feD chief of the eighties. he had the courage to take the pain up front, to use what the Dutch call: horse medicine, and increase interest rates through the roof. we now basically spread the pain to future generations by artificial means which have nothing to do with the market realities. the reason is that a lot of the old guard, which was in charge when the crisis happened, is still in charge. they have no interest in a diagnosis which is real. and therefore the remedies are suspect. as far as that goes, I am more of a weberian than Bernankian. But the americans are in a special position, the dollar being still the reserve currency of the world. this makes it very tempting for the americans, having only debt in dollars, to inflate themselves out of the problem. I know they are trying to fight inflation and deflation \u2013 deflation being considered the bigger risk. But by more quantitative easing, a euphemism for pumping more money than we have, they are taking a tremendous risk. It is like putting up even more sails when you know that you are not out of the storm yet, and in terra incognita . R. C.: You have been quite critical about the role of the accountants and you said that part of the blame lay with them. What has improved since your criticism in 2004? Jules Muis: In 2004, no one listened because everybody, accountants included, were enjoying the party. the accountancy profession traditionally has had an important role as a micro gatekeeper for the integrity of the numbers at micro-level, so at corporate level. If they do not do their work well, you have IntervIew wIth Jules MuIs, forMer DIrector-General of the Internal auDIt servIce of the euroPean coMMIssIon ",
        "8 IntervIew wIth Jules MuIs, forMer DIrector-General of the Internal auDIt servIce of the euroPean coMMIssIon to also start doubting also the macro numbers, that what we call \u2018the economy\u2019. an economic bubble is composed of a thousand small bubbles. the accountancy profession, in its defence, does not have a role in monitoring systemic risk. nobody has ever specifically given them that role. But the accountancy profession simply did not follow the courage of its convictions. It basically did not look at the very important question what it really understood of the financial markets. the financial markets had become very, very complex, and if you are a profession which audits major players - some of which are so big that if they keel over the whole economy is at risk - then you should look much further than your nose is long. If I can do it after six weeks retirement why can\u2019t they? that was my criticism. I do not know what the future will bring them, but having lost credibility, and not having produced a proper self-diagnosis on its own, the future of the accountancy profession is now at stake; the commission\u2019s Barnier report points the way. R. C.: This raises the issue of private and public sector. What could the European Court of Auditors contribute? Could ECA be part of what you also propose an early warning system? Jules Muis: I think, of all the auditors, the supreme audit Institutions have been much more courageous, much more effective in their role than the public auditors in the private sector. the difference between the saIs and the private sector audit firms/public accountant is that in the public sector the saIs and the audit court have been willing to qualify, if necessary, their opinions. that applies to the european court of auditors and to the american Gao, too. the latter has given, for 15 years, a disclaimer of opinion on the american federal government accounts and an adverse opinion on the control systems of the american federal government. at least they have played their signalling role! now, you look at the financial crisis and you will see that the implosion of the banks was preceded and accompanied by clean audit opinions by public accountants. the auditors did not feel it necessary in any way shape or form to send out any signal that something might be wrong. they should have resorted to a disclaimer of opinion. they should simply have said to the world that they no longer understood the language of finance because it had become so complex and that the financial industry was out of touch with its own language. that\u2019s what I told them publicly, and in hindsight for exactly the right reasons, in 2005! R. C.: In 2004 you were critical not with the auditors but also with the regulators. Jules Muis: In terms of sequencing culpability for this crisis, I would start with the management of the banks themselves and then their oversight bodies, their Board of Directors. the second ones who dropped the ball were the regulators. the third ones who for me are marginally guilty is the accountancy profession, from cfo\u2019s to public accountants - although they can hide behind an embarrassing and paper-thin \u2018compliance with the rules\u2019 defence. now, the regulators are also trying to draw some lessons on where they have gone wrong. In the international financial architecture there are different players at the regulatory level: at monetary policy level you have the ecB and the central Banks, setting the rules and looking at compliance. there is also the oversight function, but at a national level. additionally, in terms of financial market functioning you have other regulators like in america the sec and in europe we have a host of regulators which deal with the effective and efficient functioning of the market. the pre-conditions for those markets are further defined in Brussels by the commission\u2019s Internal Market DG. I think that in Brussels we got ourselves just as drunk on the euphoria of deregulation as anyone else. at this particular moment we are basically trying to tighten or reverse that \u2018laisser faire\u2019 trend, belatedly but very necessary. ",
        "9 IntervIew wIth Jules MuIs, forMer DIrector-General of the Internal auDIt servIce of the euroPean coMMIssIon In sum, the regulators (I have repeatedly defined them over the last decade as \u2018the most unaccountable institutions\u2019 in the financial architecture) forgotten their principle task as macro financial gatekeeper. In consequence, the wake up call had to be made by default, through this persistent crisis. R. C.: You are talking about the financial regulation and its reform. What is your opinion about the proposal made by the Commission? Jules Muis: the commission\u2019s reform proposals are going in the right direction and we are making the right noises but there are some major missing links. I am a firm believer in systemic assurance statements, both in the public and in the private sector, macro and micro. If we really want to hand over eu funds to other countries in the form of subsidies and grants, we miss in this whole chain the national governments taking responsibility by signing off that they do have in place proper controls that will ensure that the money will be used for the purposes intended. without that link you automatically have to develop spaghetti of rules that keep auditors and accountants very busy but miss assurance and ownership at a national government level. I have been advocating such national assurance statements in the public sector of the eu and as far as I know only 4 of the 27 Member states have made a real start. I think that we will snowball into full compliance ultimately but the resistance in the council is still very big because most of the national governments know that they do not control adequately the eu or even their own expenditure. yet they have the gall to ask the court and the eu to give assurance that the money has been used for purposes intended, while they themselves are much better placed than anyone else to give that assurance in the first place. which turns it all into a bit of a charade. absent this \u2018national declaration\u2019, also championed by the european Parliament, the eu\u2019s controls framework gives false comfort, because it misses an essential link to be even minimally convincing. R. C.: Do you consider these assurance statements part of internal or external audit? Jules Muis: It is an interesting question whether I see it as part of the internal or an external audit. Both I would say. But I would recommend looking at it as an internal document for the first three years. the Dutch have immediately published their exploratory findings, warts and all; but if there is too much cold water fear with national governments, then it would not be so bad \u201csmoothing it in\u201d by looking at it as an internal document the first three years. But ultimately the citizens of the country where the government signs off such a statement do have the right to know how the government deals with the public eu funds they receive. My preference is for a public document ultimately. R. C.: What are we still missing? Jules Muis: I had made the same crusade for systemic assurance statement by regulators of the private (financial markets) sector. Giving us periodic assurance \u2018that there are no systemic weaknesses that may materially effect the ordely functioning of the markets\u2019 - any regulator\u2019s most fundamental responsibility\u2013 an instrument that can also, and very importantly, smoke out the unknowns in the market equation R. C.: Can you name the regulators you are thinking of when you talk about systemic assurance? Jules Muis: you are now talking about financial market oversight I assume. In which case I mean the he monetary policy agencies and regulators, i.e. the central Banks and what- or whoever the market regulators are in the national countries: like the fsa in the uk, or its replacement, the afM in holland, the stock exchanges regulators and of course all global or regional systemic risk monitoring agencies, from the financial stability Board, all the way down via the regional to the national level. ",
        "10 R. C.: Who would be the one at EU level as the ECB does not have the mandate for it? Jules Muis: the ecB does not have the bank oversight mandate, the national central Banks have. thus, you have to start at a lower level. But even if the ecB does not have the mandate, I would recommend that at the least they tell the world whether they rely on these statements and believe in them. Beyond the ecB and the national central banks is also the financial stability Board at a worldwide level and I think it would be a little odd and fragmented if the ecB did not want to play any role in adding up these assurance statements and come out either with an analysis or opinion of its own. all of this should fit in with the new architecture now designed in and for europe to monitor systemic risk. such results based assurance statements would also ultimately lead to a convergence of the financial architecture in the different countries. once you have that you also can have consistent and effective regulatory accountability, which was so absent in the run up to this financial crisis. R. C.: Let\u2019s go back to the financial regulation. How do you see the development of the role of the ECA? Jules Muis: the eca, in a narrow sense, is basically put in charge of auditing the good housekeeping of the eu. In a broader sense it is not only allowed but I think also expected to carry out efficiency and effectiveness audits. under that umbrella, if I were the court and had the resources for it, I would go for the big picture first rather than for the smaller Das picture. I think the Das picture is interesting but I never fell in love with it. I would rather have the court just certify the eu accounts. the Das is the old fashioned remnant of times passed when the public policy role of the commission was less pronounced and the commission less organized, the Das is a kind of a distraction as far as I a concerned that keeps us from the big tickets: efficiency and effectiveness in the eu policy area. R. C.: Is there a task for ECA in relation to early warning? Jules Muis: the prime body that would have responsibility within the eu for an early warning system on financial markets, pre crisis, would be DG for Internal Market together with the commission\u2019s various economic monitoring functions, including eurostat. and now we have of course a major overhaul of the european financial architecture, identifying specific responsibilities at semi- supranational level for systemic risk. for the court, there would be, I think, a fantastic opportunity to look at the total financial architecture presently being proposed, public and private sector, and see whether the eu can play its role convincingly. It would already be a fantastic opportunity for the eca to look whether these rules make sense and whether they actually are a help or a mortgage in avoiding a next crisis. for little money it can do an enormous amount of good by looking at how far the present eu system can play the role the world expects it to have. which is to make sure that we have a reasonably secure, still vibrant market driven system and that the right balance between the right regulation and deregulation is achieved and systemic risk captured. In its extention and in the same process it could also follow through with questions why eurostat did not follow through on the integrity of the numbers it got from e.g. Greece. the council is part of the solution, but the council is also quite often part of the problem. all these are most interesting vital financial system architectural questions, where the eca could play a much more vital rule than following the money, without asking often enough : \u201c but to what effect?\u201d R. C.: In your IFAC interview you call it \u201cmight makes right\u201d. Is that what you mean, in this context? Jules Muis: \u201cMight makes right\u201d is shorthand for a governance construct which on paper looks very balanced, but when you really look at it, is skewed in favour of effective dictatorial powers at the expense of proper checks and balances. to put it subtly: the real executive power in the eu it is obviously with the council, not with the commission.

        "11 IntervIew wIth Jules MuIs, forMer DIrector-General of the Internal auDIt servIce of the euroPean coMMIssIon \u201cMight makes right\u201d, also features in the corporate sector. you look at an organisation chart and it looks perfect but it doesn\u2019t tell you whether you have a president who is a bully and just thinks of his bonus, or real checks and balances. or take the cfo - who is both a bean counter and a bean maker; and gets his bonus for being a good bean maker, not for being a good bean counter. these governance disconnects all indicate checks-and-balances problems, which on paper are not evident but in reality are. If you want to have a career, and manage it, you better look at the effective power structure and not only at the paper power structure. R. C.. When you talk about global accountable government is that realistic? Jules Muis: no, that\u2019s obviously not realistic. But I am basically saying that you cannot run a global economy without supra-national oversight and management structures. that applies to the eu, as a regional economic block, as well as the much looser world economy. In consequence, until this changes, we will progress by default rather than by design. that is the equivalent of trying to fry a chicken out of an omelette, not a very effective way of moving forward, and sometimes just damn dangerous; at one point of time one burns one\u2019s fingers. R. C.: Do you think that the gap between rich and poor gets deeper? Can that entail a threat for peace in Europe? Jules Muis: the good news is we have less and less people who live under the absolute poverty line. the poor countries are getting little by little better, most BrIc countries in rapid pace. But the bad news is that the difference between rich and poor within those countries and within the rich countries gets more extreme. the rich getting richer and poor getting poorer alarms me. In particular in the us, the chance of democracy being bought or taken over by big money, still looms large. the us, effectively, is a \u2018monetized democracy\u2019. and that is being said by someone who would like to see some sort of mid- atlantic socio-political model developed! I would like to put on the wall of every millionaire a little reminder that \u201cyou can only wear one pair of shoes at the same time\u201d. I do not want to overdramatize, but keeping an eye on the democratic process in the us, is well advised. R. C.: You have left Europe, you went to the US, and you say you stand half way, why not simply call you the Flying Dutchman? some do. and some of those get upset if I still show myself too much with both feet to the ground rather than with my head in the clouds. I have learned to learn from and benignly ignore their concerns all at the same time. It has served me well. ",
        "12 Mesdames, Messieurs, comme vous le savez probablement, c'est la derni\u00e8re fois que je vous pr\u00e9sente le rapport annuel de la cour des comptes europ\u00e9enne. apr\u00e8s avoir exerc\u00e9 les fonctions de Membre du coll\u00e8ge de la cour \u00e0 luxembourg durant 15 ans, je passerai le relais \u00e0 Gijs de vries fin de cette ann\u00e9e. Je suis tr\u00e8s reconnaissant \u00e0 l\u2019 Algemene Rekenkamer de m'avoir syst\u00e9matiquement offert la possibilit\u00e9 de venir pr\u00e9senter le rapport annuel ici \u00e0 la haye et je souhaite lui exprimer ma gratitude pour son hospitalit\u00e9. les changements ont \u00e9t\u00e9 nombreux ces 15 derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, que ce soit dans le domaine de la gestion et du contr\u00f4le des fonds budg\u00e9taires de l\u2019ue ou dans celui des audits effectu\u00e9s par la cour des comptes europ\u00e9enne. Je pr\u00e9senterai, \u00e0 la fin de mon expos\u00e9, ma vision r\u00e9trospective personnelle \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Mais commen\u00e7ons par le rapport annuel relatif \u00e0 l\u2019exercice 2009. et pour d\u00e9crire le contexte, je commencerai par un aper\u00e7u de l'ex\u00e9cution budg\u00e9taire et par la situation des Pays-Bas. en 2009, l\u2019ue a d\u00e9pens\u00e9 118,4 milliards d\u2019euros, contre 116,5 milliards en 2008. une augmentation de 1,6 %, qui ne serait probablement pas pour d\u00e9plaire au gouvernement actuel. 56,3 milliards d\u2019euros ont \u00e9t\u00e9 consacr\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019agriculture et aux ressources naturelles, 35,5 milliards aux fonds structurels pour la coh\u00e9sion. 9,1 milliards ont \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9s aux d\u00e9penses de personnel et aux immeubles, les 17,5 milliards d'euros restants ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 consacr\u00e9s \u00e0 d'autres programmes de d\u00e9pense, concernant notamment la recherche, la coop\u00e9ration au d\u00e9veloppement, ainsi que l\u2019\u00e9ducation et la citoyennet\u00e9. Parall\u00e8lement, les recettes ont repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 117,3 milliards d\u2019euros, dont 70 % proviennent des contributions fond\u00e9es sur le rnB. le budget est \u00e9quilibr\u00e9 par le report des cr\u00e9dits non utilis\u00e9s de l\u2019exercice pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent. sur les 118,4 milliards d\u2019euros d\u00e9pens\u00e9s par l\u2019ue, 2 milliards l\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 aux Pays-Bas: 1,3 milliard affect\u00e9 aux d\u00e9penses agricoles et pr\u00e8s de 0,7 milliard \u00e0 la coh\u00e9sion et au renforcement de la comp\u00e9titivit\u00e9 et quelques montants moins importants \u00e0 d\u2019autres postes mineurs concernant d\u2019autres programmes. les contributions vers\u00e9es s\u2019\u00e9tant, quant \u00e0 elles, \u00e9lev\u00e9es \u00e0 1,6 milliard d\u2019euros, les Pays-Bas font donc partie des b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires nets en 2009. Il s\u2019agit cependant l\u00e0 d\u2019une image embellie de la situation, car en 2009, la r\u00e9duction de la contribution n\u00e9erlandaise au budget de l\u2019ue \u00e0 hauteur d\u2019environ un milliard d\u2019euros par an, n\u00e9goci\u00e9e en son temps par le ministre Zalm pour la p\u00e9riode 2007-2013, a \u00e9t\u00e9 absorb\u00e9e en une seule fois et correspond aux ann\u00e9es 2007- 2009. nous sommes donc plut\u00f4t en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019une situation nette n\u00e9gative de 1 718 millions d\u2019euros. et si comme le fait, \u00e0 tort, le minist\u00e8re des finances, l\u2019on consid\u00e8re que les ressources propres traditionnelles, c\u2019est- \u00e0-dire les droits de douanes, constituent \u00e9galement une contribution, l'on peut encore y ajouter un montant de 1,7 milliard d\u2019euros.

        "13 si les changements ont \u00e9t\u00e9 nombreux en quinze ans, l\u2019opinion de la cdce sur la r\u00e9gularit\u00e9 de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du budget de l\u2019ue n\u2019a pas vari\u00e9: elle est d\u00e9favorable. en 2009, nous avons de nouveau constat\u00e9 un nombre trop \u00e9lev\u00e9 de paiements irr\u00e9guliers, tandis que les syst\u00e8mes de gestion et de contr\u00f4le ne se sont av\u00e9r\u00e9s, dans l\u2019ensemble, que partiellement efficaces. la cour a \u00e9mis une opinion d\u00e9favorable pour cinq des sept domaines de d\u00e9penses pour lesquels elle doit fournir une appr\u00e9ciation sp\u00e9cifique. Mais cette image d\u2019ensemble occulte des diff\u00e9rences et des tendances que je souhaite \u00e0 pr\u00e9sent examiner. Premi\u00e8rement, la situation semble plus mauvaise qu\u2019en 2008 si l\u2019on observe la part des domaines class\u00e9s dans les cat\u00e9gories \u00abverte\u00bb et \u00abjaune\u00bb, \u00e0 savoir la part des d\u00e9penses affect\u00e9es par un taux d\u2019erreur respectivement inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 2 % ou compris entre 2 % et 5 %. la cause en est que les d\u00e9penses agricoles, dont le taux d'erreur \u00e9tait pass\u00e9 sous les 2 % l'an dernier, sont \u00e0 nouveau affect\u00e9es par un taux situ\u00e9 entre 2 % et 5 %. Mais, comme le fait remarquer \u00e0 juste titre la commission dans sa r\u00e9ponse, le taux d'erreur affectant les d\u00e9penses agricoles se maintient autour des 2 %: il \u00e9tait l\u00e9g\u00e8rement inf\u00e9rieur en 2008, il est l\u00e9g\u00e8rement sup\u00e9rieur en 2009. les d\u00e9penses relatives aux fonds structurels ont en revanche connu une am\u00e9lioration sensible, qui n\u2019est cependant pas visible puisque le taux d\u2019erreur le plus probable pour ce domaine est sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 5 %. si les ann\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes nous devions indiquer qu\u2019au moins 11 % des subventions \u00e9taient vers\u00e9es ind\u00fbment, ce pourcentage, qui correspond au \u00abseuil d'erreur inf\u00e9rieur\u00bb, est aujourd\u2019hui de 3 %. si l'on consid\u00e8re uniquement le montant total des paiements irr\u00e9guliers, on constate que par rapport \u00e0 2008, celui-ci est pass\u00e9 de 6,1 milliards \u00e0 3,8 milliards. ce n\u2019est pas suffisant, m\u00eame s'il s'agit d'une \u00e9volution dans le bon sens. De plus, une tendance se d\u00e9gage clairement si l\u2019on reprend dans le m\u00eame tableau les taux d'erreur pour les ann\u00e9es 2006 \u00e0 2009. la diapositive montre que le taux global d'erreur a baiss\u00e9, passant d\u2019environ sept \u00e0 un peu plus de trois. l\u2019incidence, sur cette baisse, de l\u2019\u00e9volution qu\u2019ont connue les fonds structurels est \u00e9vidente, mais il est int\u00e9ressant d'observer que la plupart des autres programmes ont connu une tendance similaire. comme je l\u2019ai dit pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, la cour a \u00e9mis une opinion d\u00e9favorable pour cinq domaines de d\u00e9penses sur sept, sur la base d\u2019une \u00e9valuation tant des syst\u00e8mes de contr\u00f4le et de surveillance, que du taux d'erreur le plus probable constat\u00e9. les syst\u00e8mes sont jug\u00e9s \u00abefficaces\u00bb, \u00abpartiellement efficaces\u00bb ou \u00abinefficaces\u00bb; s\u2019agissant des taux d\u2019erreur, la cour les classe en trois cat\u00e9gories: inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 2 %, soit le seuil de signification fix\u00e9 par la cour, compris entre 2 % et 5 % et sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 5 %, taux qui correspondent aux couleurs verte, jaune et rouge, un peu \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re des feus de signalisation. les diapositives montrent clairement que le vert est une couleur assez rare. les directeurs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux de la commission doivent \u00e9tablir des rapports d\u2019activit\u00e9 et fournir une d\u00e9claration dans laquelle ils indiquent dans quelle mesure ils peuvent donner une assurance raisonnable que les moyens qui leur ont \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pens\u00e9s l\u00e9galement. ces d\u00e9clarations font l'objet d'un rapport de synth\u00e8se \u00e9labor\u00e9 par la commission, dans lequel celle-ci rend compte de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du budget. ce syst\u00e8me, mis en place en 2002 par Jules Muis, lorsqu\u2019il occupait la fonction d'auditeur interne de la commission, commence \u00e0 fonctionner de mieux en mieux. la cour des comptes a pu constater que les directeurs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux \u00e9valuent de mieux en mieux les risques et les erreurs, ce qui nous permet de conclure, dans l\u2019ensemble, que les d\u00e9clarations des directeurs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux donnent une image fid\u00e8le des forces et des faiblesses de l\u2019environnement de contr\u00f4le. l'avantage en est que les faiblesses sont aussi effectivement trait\u00e9es, mais cela suppose naturellement que l'on reconnaisse d\u2019abord qu\u2019il existe des faiblesses. avant d\u2019examiner en d\u00e9tail les diff\u00e9rents domaines, permettez-moi de m'attarder un instant sur l\u2019opinion de la cour sur la fiabilit\u00e9 des comptes. comme en 2007 et en 2008, la cour \u00e9met une opinion favorable sur la fiabilit\u00e9 des comptes: les comptes annuels pr\u00e9sentent fid\u00e8lement, dans tous leurs aspects significatifs, la situation financi\u00e8re de l\u2019ue au 31 d\u00e9cembre 2009, ainsi que les r\u00e9sultats des op\u00e9rations et les flux de tr\u00e9sorerie pour M.

        "14 M. Maarten B. enGwIrDa, MeMBre De la cour, Pr\u00e9sente le raPPort annuel 2009 \u00e0 la cour Des coMPtes n\u00e9erlanDaIse \u00e0 la haye l\u2019exercice clos \u00e0 cette date. la cour formule cependant un certain nombre de remarques sur les insuffisances de la comptabilit\u00e9, notamment en ce qui concerne les d\u00e9penses, ainsi que les recouvrements et les corrections financi\u00e8res. les informations qui s\u2019y rapportent ne sont ni compl\u00e8tes ni suffisamment fiables. Passons \u00e0 pr\u00e9sent \u00e0 l\u2019agriculture. comme je l\u2019ai dit pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, en 2009, le taux d\u2019erreur d\u00e9passe de nouveau 2 %, comme c'\u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 le cas toutes les ann\u00e9es avant 2008. cependant, la situation reste comparable \u00e0 celle de 2008, et on constate m\u00eame une am\u00e9lioration dans le domaine du d\u00e9veloppement rural, qui faisait office de parent pauvre depuis des ann\u00e9es. la plupart des erreurs r\u00e9sultaient de la surd\u00e9claration de terres \u00e9ligibles, mais d'autres erreurs ont \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 constat\u00e9es. Par exemple, en Gr\u00e8ce, des demandes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 introduites pour des prairies, alors qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 de parcelles bois\u00e9es impropres \u00e0 la mise en p\u00e2turage. la cour mentionne \u00e9galement dans son rapport annuel des cas de paiements \u00e0 la surface octroy\u00e9s m\u00eame si aucune activit\u00e9 agricole n\u2019\u00e9tait exerc\u00e9e sur les parcelles concern\u00e9es, ainsi qu'\u00e0 des b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires qui ne sont ni agriculteurs, ni \u00e9leveurs. la commission a d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9 l\u2019an dernier qu\u2019elle entendait renforcer les r\u00e8gles applicables en la mati\u00e8re, mais sa proposition n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9e par le conseil. les syst\u00e8mes de contr\u00f4le et de surveillance, en particulier le syst\u00e8me int\u00e9gr\u00e9 de gestion et de contr\u00f4le - le sIGc, sont bien con\u00e7us, mais l\u2019exactitude des donn\u00e9es qui y figurent pose probl\u00e8me. vingt organismes payeurs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9s par la cour ces derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es et, dans sept cas, les contr\u00f4les effectu\u00e9s dans le cadre du sIGc n\u2019\u00e9taient pas efficaces. les missions men\u00e9es en 2009 aupr\u00e8s de huit organismes payeurs ont confirm\u00e9 cet \u00e9tat des choses, trois d\u2019entre eux ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9s inefficaces (chypre, Gr\u00e8ce et Malte). la commission consid\u00e8re en outre que les probl\u00e8mes en Bulgarie et en roumanie, dont la cour a fait \u00e9tat l\u2019an dernier, sont encore plus importants et a m\u00eame, \u00e0 juste titre, \u00e9mis une r\u00e9serve \u00e0 ce sujet dans son rapport annuel d'activit\u00e9. la r\u00e9serve concernant la Gr\u00e8ce a \u00e9t\u00e9 lev\u00e9e par la commission, contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019avis de la cour. la cour estime qu'il est pr\u00e9matur\u00e9 de le faire tant qu'il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli que le sIGc fonctionne effectivement en Gr\u00e8ce. De son c\u00f4t\u00e9, la commission consid\u00e8re que le risque financier est suffisamment couvert par les contr\u00f4les ex post qu\u2019elle effectue dans le cadre de la proc\u00e9dure d\u2019apurement des comptes. Dans le domaine des fonds structurels, l\u2019am\u00e9lioration sensible par rapport \u00e0 2008 s\u2019explique par le renforcement des exigences en mati\u00e8re de gestion et de contr\u00f4le pour la p\u00e9riode de programmation 2007-2013, ainsi que par la mise en \u0153uvre du plan d\u2019action 2008 de la commission. si, en 2008, les paiements effectu\u00e9s dans le cadre de la nouvelle p\u00e9riode de programmation avaient exclusivement consist\u00e9 en des pr\u00e9financements, les paiements interm\u00e9diaires se sont mont\u00e9s \u00e0 14 milliards d'euros en 2009, et ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis au nouveau r\u00e9gime, plus strict, tandis qu\u2019en parall\u00e8le, des simplifications ont \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9es pour r\u00e9duire le risque d\u2019infraction. la plupart des erreurs relev\u00e9es par la cour dans ce domaine concernaient les op\u00e9rations de passation de march\u00e9s publics. les efforts d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s par la commission pour renforcer la capacit\u00e9 des \u00e9tats membres \u00e0 faire appliquer les r\u00e8gles applicables en la mati\u00e8re au moyen d\u2019activit\u00e9s cibl\u00e9es de formation n\u2019ont pas encore eu une incidence suffisante. la commission a annonc\u00e9 qu\u2019elle s'efforcerait aussi d\u2019apporter des simplifications suppl\u00e9mentaires \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. la cour constate \u00e9galement que, pour 30 % des erreurs qu\u2019elle a constat\u00e9es, les autorit\u00e9s nationales disposaient de toutes les informations permettant de les mettre au jour, mais qu'elles n'en avaient simplement rien fait. cette situation donne \u00e0 r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir, dans un syst\u00e8me o\u00f9 les \u00e9tats membres sont responsables au premier chef de l\u2019exactitude des d\u00e9clarations de d\u00e9penses. Mis \u00e0 part ce type de doutes l\u00e9gitimes, le principal message pour cette ann\u00e9e est cependant que le renforcement des exigences pour la p\u00e9riode de programmation 2007- 2013 commence \u00e0 porter ses fruits, ce qui constitue un renversement de tendance par rapport aux ann\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes. \u00e9voquons \u00e0 pr\u00e9sent bri\u00e8vement quelques autres cat\u00e9gories de d\u00e9penses. sur les sept domaines de d\u00e9penses faisant l\u2019objet d\u2019une appr\u00e9ciation sp\u00e9cifique de la cour, seuls deux pr\u00e9sentent un taux d\u2019erreur qui reste inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 2 %, \u00e0 savoir les d\u00e9penses administratives et les activit\u00e9s bancaires et financi\u00e8res. le groupe de politiques ",

Pour ce groupe de politiques, la cour a \u00e9galement constat\u00e9 que le taux d\u2019erreur \u00e9tait sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 2 % et que les syst\u00e8mes de contr\u00f4le et de surveillance ne sont, d'une mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, que partiellement efficaces, malgr\u00e9 certaines am\u00e9liorations. les probl\u00e8mes concernent entre autres les contr\u00f4les effectu\u00e9s par les d\u00e9l\u00e9gations de l\u2019ue dans les pays candidats \u00e0 l'adh\u00e9sion, les contr\u00f4les ex post r\u00e9alis\u00e9s par la DG releX et les contr\u00f4les op\u00e9r\u00e9s par les d\u00e9l\u00e9gations quant \u00e0 la r\u00e9gularit\u00e9 des d\u00e9penses au titre de la coop\u00e9ration au d\u00e9veloppement. les syst\u00e8mes de contr\u00f4le relatifs \u00e0 l'aide d'urgence ont \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9s efficaces par la cour. avant de revenir sur ces 15 derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, j\u2019aimerais attirer l\u2019attention sur un point pr\u00e9cis concernant les recettes de l\u2019ue. Dans le cadre limit\u00e9 de nos contr\u00f4les, nous n\u2019avons d\u00e9tect\u00e9 aucune erreur significative en la mati\u00e8re. toutefois, pour les ressources tva, la cour a soulev\u00e9 une question au sujet de l\u2019\u00e9cart tva. Il s\u2019agit de la diff\u00e9rence entre la tva effectivement per\u00e7ue par les \u00e9tats membres, sur laquelle sont fond\u00e9es leurs contributions, et les recettes th\u00e9oriques de tva calcul\u00e9es sur la base des statistiques \u00e9conomiques nationales. selon une \u00e9tude r\u00e9cemment publi\u00e9e par la commission, l\u2019\u00e9cart moyen entre les recettes effectivement per\u00e7ues et celles th\u00e9oriquement exigibles est d'environ 13 %. s'il n'a globalement aucune incidence sur le budget de l\u2019ue, cet \u00e9cart est quand m\u00eame compens\u00e9 par une augmentation des ressources rnB. Pour certains \u00e9tats membres, cette diff\u00e9rence est cependant consid\u00e9rable: les 13 % ne sont en effet qu\u2019une moyenne, l'\u00e9cart \u00e9tant de 30 % pour la Gr\u00e8ce et de 3 % pour les Pays-Bas. Je ne suis pas en mesure de d\u00e9tailler les cons\u00e9quences, mais il me semble important que ce point soit abord\u00e9 lors des discussions sur le financement futur de l'ue. Quinze ans en tant que membre de la cour des comptes europ\u00e9enne, cela m\u00e9rite bien un petit retour en arri\u00e8re. Bien que la situation en mati\u00e8re de gestion financi\u00e8re et de contr\u00f4le au sein de l'ue ne soit pas encore satisfaisante, je peux dire sans crainte qu'elle est r\u00e9v\u00e9latrice d'une \u00e9volution manifestement positive. lorsque ce processus d\u2019am\u00e9lioration est en marche, on ne se rend pas forc\u00e9ment compte des progr\u00e8s r\u00e9alis\u00e9s, vu la lenteur avec laquelle les choses changent. Mais un regard en arri\u00e8re me permet de dire que des am\u00e9liorations substantielles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9es au cours des quinze derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es. cela vaut aussi pour la cour des comptes elle-m\u00eame. les rapports annuels autrefois difficiles \u00e0 lire ont \u00e9t\u00e9 remplac\u00e9s par toute une s\u00e9rie de rapports sp\u00e9ciaux fond\u00e9s sur des audits de la performance de plus en plus solides. au cours de la p\u00e9riode 2002- 2006, la cour s\u2019est livr\u00e9e \u00e0 une auto\u00e9valuation approfondie et s\u2019est soumise \u00e0 un examen par des pairs.

        "17 PresentatIon By Dr IGors luDBor\u017es, MeMBer of the euroPean court of auDItors, of the annual rePort 2009 to the stanDInG coMMIttees of the latvIan ParlIaMent (saeIM a) on 10 noveMBer 2010 In rIGa concerning the special reports and the specific annual reports on eu agencies and other bodies, there are no specific findings reported for latvia, except that latvia sometimes figures in general tables providing eu data. the situation is different for the 2009 Annual Report . similarly to last year, latvia can be found in chapter 2 \u201crevenue\u201d where it now has five Value Added Tax reservations open, compared with two for last year. the system of reservations is used by the commission to keep doubtful elements in the vat statements submitted by Members states open for correction after the statutory time limit of four years. some of these reservations date back to 2004 and latvia should undertake steps to clarify the outstanding cases with the commission. also in chapter 2 are observations concerning latvia following the court\u2019s audit on traditional own resources , where the court carried out an assessment of supervisory and control systems and related accounting systems in three Member states, namely Germany, Ireland and latvia. for Ireland and latvia the national authorities were not able to justify fully the amounts recorded in certain statements of established duties because they did not match the underlying documents. for all three Member states the court found deficiencies in national customs\u2019 supervisions, particularly regarding the performance of risk analysis. this increases the risk of irregularities remaining undetected, possibly leading to a loss of traditional own resources. however, to put things into perspective, in its audit work for a recent special report, eca found significant control weaknesses in several other Member states. they will have to be addressed in order to minimise the risk of financial losses. regarding the follow-up of previous observations of the court in the same chapter, latvia had undertaken the actions needed to address the issues raised, although not within the deadline set. rather interesting is the finding in chapter 3 of the annual report concerning Agriculture and natural resources . latvia belongs to the eight Member states selected by the court to assess the supervisory and control systems in the application of either the single area Payment scheme (saPs) or the single Payment scheme (sPs). the audit findings concerning latvia are clearly reflected in a table in annex 3.2. while some Member states score a \u2018not-effective\u2019 or \u2018partially effective\u2019, out of the eight Member states audited only latvia scores \u2018effective\u2019 for each of the three systems and gets an overall green assessment. Dr Igors Ludbor\u017es gave a press conference and also presented the Annual Report to the State Audit Office of the Republic of Latvia and to representatives of the ministries of the Latvian government on 9 and 10 November 2010.

The Committee was meeting under the Presidency of the French Cour des comptes , using the new organisational model for Contact Committee meetings that was based on a troika of SAI Heads. In this connection, Mr Caldeira paid tribute to the late Philippe S\u00e9guin, the former Head of the French Cour des comptes , who had been instrumental in involving his institution in this pioneering exercise. The Contact Committee provided a forum for considering not only the impact of the Treaty of Lisbon but also new areas for cooperation, as significant changes, especially relating to economic convergence in Europe, posed new challenges for the SAIs and for the European Court of Auditors. Jean Laporte examined the reasons why the authors of the Treaty had progressively taken account of the role of national parliaments in the EU\u2019s operations by devising arrangements to ensure that the principle of subsidiarity was observed. Until almost three decades after the Treaty of Rome, the Council was virtually alone in occupying the role of European legislator. The European Parliament held merely advisory powers, an anomaly which had given rise to the concept of the democratic deficit. The answer was therefore to increase the powers of the European Parliament, to which the Treaty of Lisbon attributed the role of co-legislator. However, individual national parliaments also had to be encouraged to scrutinise their own governments\u2019 European activities: there was a need for parliaments to play a greater role in EU Heads of the SAIs of Turkey, Croatia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, as well as representatives of IDI, EUROSAI and SIGMA, had been invited to attend the meeting as active observers. Particular attention was given to the \u201cRole of national parliaments after the adoption of the Lisbon Treaty\u201d which is the subject of the following article. Guest speakers were Algirdas \u0160emeta, the European Commissioner for Taxation, Customs Union, Audit and Anti-Fraud, Colette Flesch, Luxembourg\u2019s former Minister for Foreign Affairs and a Member of European Parliament, Edward Leigh, a Member of the UK House of Commons and former Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, and Jean Laporte, the Director of the French Senate\u2019s European Affairs Department. the contact committee of the heads of the supr\u00eame audit Institutions (saIs) of the european union ",
        "21 MeetInG of the contact coMMIttee of the heaDs of the suPreMe auDIt InstItutIons (saIs) of the euroPean unIon operations in order to bring Europe closer to its citizens and so increase understanding of European activities. Who, if not national parliaments, could provide oversight in the form of an early warning mechanism, and refer disputes to the European Court of Justice? Colette Flesch, Luxembourg\u2019s former Minister for Foreign Affairs, thought that there were good reasons why national parliaments should take an interest in the use of EU funds, as up to 80% of the EU budget was funded from national contributions. The national declarations issued by some Member States were to be regarded as a positive initiative but had also highlighted the difficulty of cooperation between national audit bodies and the ECA. The new Treaty, in particular Article 3.17, showed significant progress in clarifying the respective roles of the Commission and the Member States. The Member States had always occupied a central role in implementing the EU budget, yet responsibility had formerly lain solely with the Commission. However, the new text took account of shared management. Although the provisions of the new Treaty allowed national parliaments to play a more significant role in developing EU legislation, it was still difficult to distinguish a general trend regarding the way national parliaments would exercise their new powers. Interestingly enough, though, the majority of national parliaments insisted that they had to improve their relationship with the EU institutions. Colette Flesch welcomed the process of greater involvement by national parliaments and the partnership with a strengthened European Parliament. Discussion of the principle of subsidiarity held out the prospect of improvements in the control and management of EU expenditure in the Member States. However, there was also a need for caution where the Lisbon Treaty appeared to place the principle of subsidiarity within the realm of EU budget management since it was imperative that an EU-wide perspective on EU budgetary control should not be compromised. The principle of subsidiarity could also work in the other direction, with a strong central oversight role for the European Parliament. In terms of the management and accountability of EU funding, the most important current document was the Commission\u2019s proposal for a new Financial Regulation. The draft Regulation proposed introducing an obligation on Member States to issue an annual management declaration of assurance and to deliver an independent audit. In the light of the draft, the Lisbon Treaty raised a series of questions for the Contact Committee. What exactly would the national declarations cover? Which independent audit body would deliver the opinion on the national declaration? What would be the relationship between the national audit bodies and the ECA in the years to come? Colette Flesch was in favour of the national audit authority delivering the opinion on the declaration, and strongly believed in developing a consistent audit model for national declarations. Even if methodologies varied, there was a need to adhere to the same principles. The ECA would retain responsibility for the overall external audit of the EU, but might consider making greater use of the work of the auditors who issue opinions on the national declaration. It would not, therefore, be surprising if some of the issues which the ECA had addressed in its 2004 opinion on the so-called Single Audit Model were re-examined soon. Ms. Flesch proposed that small countries be given the opportunity to submit declarations of more limited scope as they spend less in absolute terms. Edward Leigh, a Member of the UK House of Commons, felt that there was a leadership role for all Member States to play in ensuring transparency, efficiency and accountability in the use of European funds, although he admitted that the UK parliament had often lost sight of this aspect. He believed that the UK had some way to go as regards the scrutiny of EU funds, but said that a new EU scrutiny committee had been set up in the House of Commons and that the government intended to introduce a European Bill later that year. The NAO\u2019s audit of the third annual consolidated statements on the UK\u2019s use of EU funds would be published in a few weeks. ",
        "22 The financial crisis would focus greater attention on the way EU funds were spent, and it would be the ECA\u2019s task to make the whole process easier to understand and less technical for MPs and for the public. The new financial framework would provide a greater opportunity to press the case for simplification and to create programmes with measurable and clear objectives. Didier Migaud felt that the Contact Committee was surely an ideal forum for the Supreme Audit Institutions to work together towards a common purpose. However, Mr Caldeira was careful to note that the Committee should not adopt an authoritarian and restrictive approach but should have a strictly financial mission, the aim being to work together towards the goal of analysing performance and effectiveness. Action was also needed to dispel the frequent confusion between internal control and external audit. The SAIs had to continue to act as independent external control bodies; although not an integral part of the Member States\u2019 internal control systems, they could certainly play a useful role in shared management if requested to do so by national parliaments. Mr Caldeira said that the ECA was currently working on an opinion concerning the Commission proposal. This was part of a wider reform that included a review of sector-specific regulations and a new multi-annual financial framework after 2013. In its contribution to budgetary reform and its opinion on the risks and challenges which the new Commission faced in the task of improving European financial management, the Court recommended that due consideration be given to key principles such as clear policy objectives, simplification, realistic policies, and transparency and accountability when reforming existing expenditure schemes or considering new ones. As regards the new Financial Regulation, there were three trends: greater accountability, simplification and flexibility, and systems based on output rather input. Mr Caldeira believed that the proposal to increase accountability should be examined as part of the process whereby the Commission intended to create a common internal framework for the European budget as the ECA had suggested in its Single Audit opinion. The proposed independent external auditors were part of the internal control framework, the primary aim being to provide the Commission with reasonable assurance that the management declarations issued by the national authorities in specific policy areas provided a true and fair picture. In addition, the revised Financial Regulation introduced the concept of tolerable risk of error into the principle of sound financial management, and was a key component of the internal control framework. The concept of tolerable risk included the idea that an appropriate balance needed to be struck between the cost of auditing a particular budget area and the benefits the checks would bring. Achieving this balance was essentially a political choice. The draft revised Financial Regulation also made provision for tolerable risk to be used as a benchmark for assessing the Commission\u2019s risk management. Control systems ought to be focused on output rather than input. This was is something the Court had recommended on a number of occasions as a promising way to achieve simpler and more cost-effective management for audit bodies. What were the implications of these proposals for the Court and national institutions? The changes in management methods and in measures to increase accountability represented a move towards an internal control framework based on policy areas rather than towards a system of national declarations. The assurance provided by the management authorities could not only make it easier for the national authorities to produce a set of declarations for their own purposes but could also facilitate the national audit institutions\u2019 contribution to such an endeavour. Many of the concerns which the Court had raised in its previous reports and opinions remained. How its audit work would be affected depended to a large extent on how the revised sector-specific regulations would apply after 2013. Although the draft revision of the Financial Regulation provided some answers to questions raised in connection with the Lisbon Treaty, many still remained and full answers would not be obtained until specific regulations dealt with these matters and the new financial framework had been agreed.

        "23 Algirdas \u0160emeta, the European Commissioner for Taxation, Customs Union, Audit and Anti-Fraud, focused on the latest developments regarding the revised EU Financial Regulation. The annual management declaration of assurance strengthened control by the Member States and their responsibility for implementing EU funds. Through the declaration of assurance, the managing bodies formally expressed their accountability. The declaration covered the completeness, accuracy and truthfulness of the accounts, the effectiveness of internal control systems, and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions. The declaration of assurance was subject to approval by an independent audit body, which could be a private company or a national SAI. In the Commissioner\u2019s view, the involvement of the national audit institutions would offer a guarantee of professionalism, expertise and independence; it was not his intention to diminish SAI independence. If an SAI were in charge, it would report to the national authorities first, but the audit report would also be forwarded to the Commission. The Commission felt that the management declaration of assurance would be a major step forward in terms of the assurance it obtained from the Member States, and urged them to implement the measures as early as possible rather than wait until the Financial Regulation had come into force. The Commission was trying to attain challenging audit objectives in many areas. The Commission and the Member States intended the tolerable risk of error to be used to devise risk-based and cost-effective control mechanisms to ensure that the number of controls was proportionate to their potential benefit. The tolerable level of error in the various policy areas would depend on the intrinsic risks which could be reviewed when the rules were simplified. The tolerable risk of error was not an alternative to materiality thresholds, which were an instrument to be decided upon and used by auditors alone; nor was it a tolerable level of error. Commissioner \u0160emeta\u2019s agenda for 2010 to 2014 included three strategic objectives towards an unqualified declaration of assurance. The first objective was simplification and, in its proposal for a revised Financial Regulation, the Commission had already proposed simplification programmes. Moreover, the Commission had decided that programme proposals should be accompanied by an assessment of the cost of control and the intrinsic risks. In an announcement later that year, the Commission would define the key principles underlying the preparation of the next generation of EU programmes. Spending programmes and measures had to be measured in terms of output rather than input. Therefore, as part of the budget review process, the Commission had already identified the need for specific measurable, achievable, relevant and timely objectives, as well as appropriate performance indicators and systemic enhanced evaluation. To enhance an already genuine partnership, it would be productive to envisage further involvement by national SAIs in the control of EU funds in the Member States. In this context, Commissioner \u0160emeta was pleased to announce that, at the Parliament\u2019s request, the Commission would be organising an interinstitutional conference on the EU budget, the discharge procedure and sound financial management in April 2011.

Jaki MEEKINGS DAVIS: Many of the people who are currently in post within the court of auditors are already our members. last year at the meeting of the european branch of cIPfa, which has got people here and in Brussels, our members asked us to focus our efforts much more clearly on continuing professional development for existing members to work in the court or in other eu institutions, but also to think about the next generation of accountants that is coming through and make sure that we were producing a product that reflected your needs. today\u2019s two-part session in advance of the meeting of november is very much about understanding the longer term needs of your organisation, about the development of accountants and post-qualification training. cIPfa, though being an accountancy institute, also does training at different levels for non-financial managers. People may come with other accountancy qualifications but they still need the public sector context within which the eu institutions are working. that is what cIPfa would be able to bring: that sense of how the whole public finance works, because obviously public finance starts with a vote in Parliament right through to the audit and the performance management. the cIPfa qualification and syllabus covers the whole of that including governance as such of the public sector and the whole ethical code about procurement. If you went to other accountancy qualifications they would concentrate more deeply on a smaller section. R. C.: How do you interact with other institutes which have similar aims in other countries? Jaki MEEKINGS DAVIS: there are no other institutes for public finance accountancy. we are the only one in the world. there is no other member of the International federation of accountants (Ifac). Because of our international strategy and globalisation gathering pace, now we are entering into agreements with other chartered accountancy bodies in other parts of the world. examples are canada, although the agreement has not yet been signed, and the australian and new Zealand chartered accountants. we also have an agreement with the cPa australia which is a certified public accountancy body and, interestingly, with the Institute of chartered accountants of nigeria. they realized that to be an accountant it is not sufficient to meet the needs of public sector financial management and governance. the nigerians are particularly interested because many donors and the eu increasingly want to see better levels of governance and custody of public money. we also have training centres in kosovo. R. C.: You are the new President of CIPFA. When were you elected and for how long? Jaki MEEKINGS DAVIS: I took this position in June this year and it is a one-year mandate, actually 13 months this year for unusual reasons. Before that I was on the cIPfa council for 10 years and prior to that I was the chairman of the health care financial Management association in the uk, which brings together all the english accountancy institutes in health service and represents health service managers. I have worked for local Government, trained in audit, internal audit, and I worked in the health service and in the water Industry as well. one of my messages is that to find the answer to our current financial crisis, which by the way is not uk specific, we need to work across the public sector and not be focused on just one sector, because the big savings will be made at the interfaces where different services come together and we have duplication. for more information about cIPfa: www.cipfa.org.uk Mrs Jaki Meekings Davis, cIPfa President IntervIew wIth Mrs JakI MeekInGs D avIs, cIPfa PresIDent erratum By Rosmarie Carotti ",

        "Q J - A D - 10 - 011 - 2 A - N F O C U S E A special Report No 5/2010 Implementation of the Leader approach for rural development Leader is an approach for implementing the EU\u2019s rural development policy through local action groups (LAGs). This involves specific costs and risks but promises an added value from following a bottom-up and partnership approach. in this report the Court finds that LAGs implemented the Leader approach in ways that limited the potential for added value and gave grants to projects without due regard to efficiency. Procedures were not always transparent and did not sufficiently demonstrate that the LAGs took decisions on an objective basis, free from conflicts of interest. The Commission has not yet demonstrated the effectiveness or efficiency of the expenditure, the added value achieved through following the Leader approach, the extent to which the known risks have materialised or the real costs of implementation. special Report No 6/2010 has the reform of the sugar market achieved its main objectives? The EU launched a major reform of its sugar sector in 2006, to ensure its competitiveness and to stabilise the market while complying with international commitments. This involved a price decrease as well as a 30 % reduction in production quotas, resulting in the closure of 80 factories. A restructuring fund and aid for diversification were to mitigate the social and economic impact of these measures, the Court conducted an audit of the reform and concluded that some of the most efficient producers were forced to renounce quotas and rigidities linked to the quota system are still present. there is an increased dependence on imports while there are doubts as to the decrease in prices being passed on to the final consumers and delays persist in implementing diversification and environmental measures.
