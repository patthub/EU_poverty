        "I (Resolutions, recommendations and opinions) RECOMMENDATIONS COUNCIL COUNCIL RECOMMENDATION of 28 June 2011 on policies to reduce early school leaving (Text with EEA relevance) (2011/C 191/01) THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 165 and 166 thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission, Whereas: (1) The term \u2018early school leaving\u2019 is used in connection with those who leave education and training with only lower secondary education or less, and who are no longer in education and training. (2) Reducing early school leaving is essential for achieving a number of key objectives in the Europe 2020 strategy. The reduction of early school leaving addresses both the aims for \u2018smart growth\u2019 by improving education and training levels and the aims for \u2018inclusive growth\u2019 by addressing one of the major risk factors for unem\u00ad ployment, poverty and social exclusion. The Europe 2020 strategy therefore includes the headline target to reduce early school leaving to less than 10 % by 2020, from 14,4 % in 2009. Member States have undertaken to establish national targets, taking account of their relative starting positions and national circumstances. (3) The guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States, contained in Council Deci- sion 2010/707/EU ( 1 ), for the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy call on Member States to take all necessary efforts to prevent early school leaving. (4) The flagship initiative \u2018A European platform against poverty and social exclusion\u2019 sets a framework for action to ensure social and territorial cohesion, with a specific focus on breaking the cycle of disadvantage and stepping up preventive action. It addresses the Europe 2020 headline target to lift at least 20 million people out of poverty and social exclusion in the next decade. (5) \u2018Youth on the move\u2019, a flagship initiative within the Europe 2020 strategy, aims to \u2018enhance the performance and international attractiveness of Europe\u2019s higher education institutions and raise the overall quality of all levels of education and training in the EU, combining both excellence and equity, by promoting student mobility and trainees\u2019 mobility, and improve the employment situation of young people\u2019. (6) The Council conclusions of 5-6 May 2003 on reference levels of European average performance in education and training (benchmarks) stated that the share of early school leavers should be below 10 % by 2010, defining early school leavers as persons between 18 and 24 years old with only lower secondary education or less and no longer in education or training. The benchmark was not attained. One in seven young people currently leave education and training before they have completed upper secondary education. EN 1.7.2011 Official Journal of the European Union C 191/1 ( 1 ) OJ L 308, 24.11.2010, p. 46. ",
        "(7) The Council Resolution of 15 November 2007 on the new skills for new jobs ( 1 ) stressed the need to raise overall skill levels and to give priority to the education and training of those at risk of economic and social exclusion, particularly early school leavers. They underlined the need to provide vocational guidance and personal training plans to job seekers and to develop the validation of learning outcomes acquired through formal, informal and non-formal learning. (8) The Council conclusions of 22 May 2008 on adult learning recognise the role of adult learning in addressing early school leaving by offering a second chance to those who reach adulthood without a qualification, focusing especially on basic skills, IT skills and language learning. (9) In its conclusions of 12 May 2009 on a strategic framework for European cooperation in education and training (\u2018ET 2020\u2019) the Council agreed that, by 2020, the share of early leavers from education and training should be less than 10 %. (10) The Council conclusions of 26 November 2009 on the education of children with a migrant background noted that while large numbers of children with a migrant background succeed in education, students with a migrant background are generally more likely to leave school early. For migrants the average early school leaving rate across the Union is double that of native students. Available evidence indicates that early school leaving is even higher among the Roma population. (11) The Council agreed in May 2010 in its conclusions on the social dimension of education and training that the successful prevention of early school leaving requires the development of knowledge about groups at risk of dropping out at local, regional and national level, and systems for identifying early individuals who are at such risk, and concluded that comprehensive and cross- sectoral strategies should be implemented, which provide a range of school-wide and systemic policies targeting the different factors leading to early school leaving. (12) The reasons for early school leaving differ widely from country to country and also within regions. Policies to reduce early school leaving need to be adjusted to the specific situation within a local area, region or country; there is no single solution for all Member States. (13) Despite the differences between countries and regions, there is strong evidence in all Member States that disad\u00ad vantaged and vulnerable groups are more affected. In addition, young people with special educational needs are overrepresented among early leavers from education and training. Early school leaving both results from social disadvantage and perpetuates the risk of social exclusion. (14) Whilst fully respecting the principle of subsidiarity, a European framework for comprehensive policies on early school leaving can help Member States to review existing policies, to develop their national reform programmes under the Europe 2020 strategy, and to implement strategies with a high impact and a good cost-benefit ratio. It can also provide a basis for collab\u00ad oration through the open method of coordination and a focus for the use of Union funding instruments. (15) Education reforms take time to have effect. In order to achieve a reduction of early school leaving rates within the next decade and reach the Europe 2020 target, comprehensive and cross-sectoral strategies on early school leaving need to be implemented as soon as possible, HEREBY RECOMMENDS THAT MEMBER STATES: Make use of the framework set out in the Annex to this Recom\u00ad mendation, according to national circumstances, in order to: 1. Identify the main factors leading to early school leaving and monitor the characteristics of the phenomenon at national, regional and local level as the foundation for targeted and effective evidence-based policies. 2. Ensure that comprehensive strategies on early school leaving are in place by the end of 2012, and that they are imple\u00ad mented in line with national priorities and the Europe 2020 objectives. Comprehensive strategies are taken to include prevention measures, intervention measures and compen\u00ad sation measures, the latter being aimed at re-engaging people who have dropped out of education. 3. Ensure that those strategies include appropriate measures for groups at increased risk of early school leaving in the Member State, such as children with a socio-economically disadvantaged, migrant or Roma background, or with special educational needs. 4. Ensure that those strategies address in a coherent manner both general education and vocational education and training, and the challenges specific to each. 5. Integrate measures which support the reduction of early school leaving rates in relevant policies targeted at children and young people, and coordinate activities among different policy sectors. EN C 191/2 Official Journal of the European Union 1.7.2011 ( 1 ) OJ C 290, 4.12.2007, p. 1. ",
        "6. Whilst acknowledging the key role played by teachers, school leaders and other educational staff, ensure the involvement in those measures and activities of all relevant stakeholders to help people who are at risk of early school leaving, including those who have dropped out already. INVITES THE COMMISSION: 1. Within the ET 2020, to contribute to the efforts made by Member States by monitoring developments at different education levels across Member States in order to identify trends. 2. To support Member States\u2019 strategies through the exchange of experience and good practice, and to facilitate effective peer learning, networking and experimentation with inno\u00ad vative approaches among the Member States on measures aimed at reducing early school leaving and improving the educational outcomes of children from groups at risk of early school leaving. 3. To integrate measures which support the reduction of early school leaving rates in all relevant Union actions targeted at children and young adults. 4. To support the development of effective policies against early school leaving by launching comparative studies and research, and to encourage cooperation between the Member States in this area. 5. To ensure, in cooperation with the Member States, and without prejudice to the negotiations on the future financial framework, that the Union programmes in the fields of lifelong learning, youth and research, as well as the European Structural Funds, support and contribute to the implementation of Member States\u2019 strategies on early school leaving. 6. To report periodically on the progress towards the Europe 2020 target and on the implementation of Member States\u2019 strategies on early school leaving through the Annual Growth Survey and within the reporting arrangements under the ET 2020.

        "ANNEX A FRAMEWORK FOR COMPREHENSIVE POLICIES TO REDUCE EARLY SCHOOL LEAVING Strategies on early school leaving should be based on an analysis at national, regional and local level of the conditions leading to the phenomenon, as average rates often mask large differences between different regions or countries. Early school leavers are a heterogeneous group and individual motivations to leave education prematurely differ widely. Family background and wider socio-economic conditions such as pull from the labour market are important factors. Their impact is conditioned by the structure of the education and training system, by available learning opportunities, and by the learning environment. The coordination of policies addressing the well-being of children and young people, social security, youth employment and future career perspectives has an important role to play in reducing early school leaving. 1. Identification of main factors and monitoring Early school leaving processes have complex and varied causes, but are often linked to socio-economic disadvantage, to low education backgrounds, to alienation from or poor achievement in education and training, to pull factors from the labour market, and/or to a combination of social, emotional and educational problems putting individuals at risk of dropping out. Account needs to be taken of the type of education in which students are enrolled. In some Member States, students who have encountered difficulties in general education often go into vocational education and training (\u2018VET\u2019). In such cases, vocational schools face a particular responsibility and challenge with respect to the reduction of early school leaving. Evidence-based policies require that particular attention be given to performance by sector of education or training. The development of evidence-based and cost-effective policies to combat early school leaving requires gathering and maintaining data on the phenomenon. This should allow analysis at local, regional and national levels. It may contain information on early school leaving rates, on transitions between educational levels, enrolment rates and completion rates of upper secondary education, as well as on school absenteeism and school-avoiding behaviour. \u2014 Collection of information should allow for the analysis of the main reasons underlying early school leaving for different groups of pupils, schools, types of education and training institution, municipalities or regions. \u2014 The combination of data on early school leaving and contextual data such as socio-economic information can help in the targeting of measures and policies. Gathering and analysing information on the motivation of early school leavers, their employment and career perspectives can also help in the targeting of measures and policies. \u2014 Evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of existing policy measures aimed at reducing early school leaving is an important basis for improving strategies and programmes for increasing pupils\u2019 chances of school success. 2. Policy framework Comprehensive strategies on early school leaving comprise a mix of policies, coordination across different policy sectors and the integration of measures supporting the reduction of early school leaving into all relevant policies aimed at children and young people. In addition to education policies that promote high-quality school systems, these are principally social policy and support services, employment, youth, family, and integration policies. Hori\u00ad zontal coordination between different actors and vertical coordination through different levels of government are equally important. Strategies on early school leaving should comprise prevention, intervention and compensation elements. Member States should select the detailed components of their strategies according to their own circum\u00ad stances and contexts. 2.1. PREVENTION POLICIES aim to reduce the risk of early school leaving before problems start. Such measures optimise the provision of education and training in order to support better learning outcomes and to remove obstacles to educational success. They aim to lay a solid early foundation for children to develop their potential and to integrate well into schools. Prevention policies could include: 1. Providing high-quality early childhood education and care is beneficial for all children and especially relevant for those from disadvantaged backgrounds, including migrants and Roma. It enhances physical well-being, social and emotional development, language and basic cognitive skills. Provision should be high-quality, affordable, adequately staffed and accessible to families with a disadvantaged background. EN C 191/4 Official Journal of the European Union 1.7.2011 ",
        "They address the organisation of education and training systems, the resources available to schools, the availability, permeability and flexibility of educational pathways. They also address the gender gap, the support of children from disadvantaged backgrounds or with a different mother tongue. Prevention policies could further include: 2. Increasing the educational offer by providing education and training opportunities beyond the age of compulsory education can influence the behaviour of young people and their families and lead to higher rates of completion of upper secondary qualifications. 3. Promoting active anti-segregation policies and providing additional support for schools in disadvantaged areas or with high numbers of pupils from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds help them to diversify their social composition and enhance their educational offer. This improves the educational achievements of pupils from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds and reduces their risk of early school leaving. 4. Emphasising the value of linguistic diversity and supporting children with a different mother tongue to improve their proficiency in the language of instruction and, where appropriate, in the mother tongue, as well as supporting teachers to teach children with different levels of linguistic competence, can improve the educational achievements of children with migrant background and reduce their risk of early school leaving. 5. Enhancing the involvement of parents, reinforcing their cooperation with the school and creating partnerships between schools and parents can increase learning motivation among pupils. 6. Increasing the flexibility and permeability of educational pathways, for example by modularising courses or alternating school and work, supports in particular pupils with lower academic performance, and can motivate them to continue education and training which is better adapted to their needs and abilities. It also helps to address gender-specific reasons for early school leaving, such as joining the labour market early or teenage pregnancy. In addition, limiting the repetition of school years and replacing this with flexible individual support has been associated with lower early school leaving. 7. Strengthening high-quality vocational pathways and increasing their attractiveness and flexibility provide pupils at risk with credible alternatives to early school leaving. VET provision, which is well integrated into the overall education and training systems, allows for alternative pathways into upper secondary and tertiary education. 8. Strengthening the link between education and training systems and the employment sector, in order to emphasise the benefits of completing education for future employability. This could be in the form of work experience placements or greater employer engagement in schools and colleges. 2.2. INTERVENTION POLICIES aim to avoid early school leaving by improving the quality of education and training at the level of the educational institutions, by reacting to early warning signs and by providing targeted support to pupils or groups of pupils at risk of early school leaving. They address all educational levels, starting from early childhood education and care to upper secondary education. At the level of the school or training institution strategies against early school leaving are embedded in an overall school development policy. They aim at creating a positive learning environment, reinforcing pedagogical quality and innovation, enhancing teaching staff competences to deal with social and cultural diversity, and developing anti- violence and anti-bullying approaches. Intervention policies at the level of the school or training institution could include: 1. Developing schools into learning communities based on a common vision for school development shared by all stakeholders, using the experience and knowledge of all, and providing an open-minded, inspiring and comfortable environment to encourage young people to continue in education and training. 2. Developing early-warning systems for pupils at risk, which can help to take effective measures before problems become manifest, pupils start to alienate from school, play truant or drop out. 3. Networking with parents and other actors outside school, such as local community services, organisations representing migrants or minorities, sports and culture associations, or employers and civil society organisations, which allows for holistic solutions to help pupils at risk and eases the access to external support such as psychologists, social and youth workers, cultural and community services. This can be facilitated by mediators from the local community who are able to support communication and to reduce distrust. 4. Supporting and empowering teachers in their work with pupils at risk, which is a pre-requisite for successful measures at school level. Initial teacher education and continuous professional development for teachers and school leaders help them to deal with diversity in the classroom, to support pupils from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds and to solve difficult teaching situations. EN 1.7.2011 Official Journal of the European Union C 191/5 ",
        "5. Extra-curricular activities after and outside school and artistic, cultural and sport activities, which can raise the self-esteem of pupils at risk and increase their resilience against difficulties in their learning. Intervention policies at individual level aim to provide a set of support mechanisms for individual students at risk of dropping out which can be tailored to their needs. They focus both on personal development in order to build resilience for students at risk, and on redressing concrete difficulties which can be of a social, cognitive or emotional nature. Intervention policies at individual level could include: 1. Mentoring supports individual pupils to overcome specific academic, social or personal difficulties. Either in one- to-one approaches (mentoring) or in small groups (tutoring), pupils receive targeted assistance, often provided by education staff by community members or by their peers. 2. Tailoring teaching to pupils\u2019 needs, strengthening individualised learning approaches and providing support for pupils at risk helps them to adapt to the demands of formal education and to overcome barriers created by the education and training system, and can thus contribute to limiting the repetition of school years. 3. Strengthening guidance and counselling supports students\u2019 career choices, transitions within education or from education to employment. It reduces poor decision making based on false expectations or insufficient information. It helps young people to make choices which meet their ambitions, personal interests and talents. 4. Ensuring that young people whose economic circumstances may result in their dropping out of education are given access to appropriate financial support. Where considered appropriate, such support might be subject to conditions or might be linked to social benefits. 2.3. COMPENSATION POLICIES aim to help those who left school prematurely to re-engage in education, offering routes to re-enter education and training and gain the qualifications they missed. Compensation policies could include: 1. Successful second chance education programmes, which provide learning environments which respond to the specific needs of early school leavers, recognise their prior learning and support their well-being. These programmes are different from schools in both organisational and pedagogical approaches and are often char\u00ad acterised by small learning groups, by personalised, age-appropriate and innovative teaching and by flexible educational pathways. As far as possible, they should be easily accessible and free of charge. 2. Various routes back into mainstream education and training, the provision of which is important. Transition classes with a strong emphasis on guidance can help to bridge the gap between previous school failure and re- entering mainstream education. 3. Recognising and validating prior learning, including competences achieved in non-formal and informal learning, which improves the confidence and self-esteem of young people and facilitates their re-entry into education. It can motivate them to continue education and training, helps them to identify their talents and to make better career choices. 4. Targeted individual support, which integrates social, financial, educational and psychological support for young people in difficulties. It is especially important for young people in situations of serious social or emotional distress which hinders them from continuing education or training.

In everyday language usage, the two names refer to the same product made from the same dough and are interchangeable. The egg-based pasta product may be thick or thin and long or short. There is no clear distinction between the way the two names are used and usage varies from one region to another. C h a r a c t e r i s t i c f e a t u r e s Colour/appearance: natural, golden yellow to light yellow. Shape: pasta product with an irregular shape; rough and porous surface; home-made style; the shape varies from thick to thin and from long to short.

Raw materials (for processed products only): The ingredients used to make (dry) \u2018Schw\u00e4bische Sp\u00e4tzle\u2019/\u2018Schw\u00e4bische Kn\u00f6pfle\u2019 are meal, fresh eggs and potable water. Salt (max. 1 %), spices, herbs and spinach may be added. For fresh \u2018Schw\u00e4bische Sp\u00e4tzle\u2019/\u2018Schw\u00e4bische Kn\u00f6pfle\u2019, citric acid may be added and flour can be used fully or partly instead of meal. 3.4. Feed (for products of animal origin only): \u2014 3.5. Specific steps in production that must take place in the defined geographical area: To guarantee the authenticity of this traditional product, which is typical of its region, and to ensure a consistently high quality, \u2018Schw\u00e4bische Sp\u00e4tzle\u2019/\u2018Schw\u00e4bische Kn\u00f6pfle\u2019 must be produced in the defined geographical area. The production stages for the fresh and dry pasta products are the same up to the points of cooling and drying. \u2018Schw\u00e4bische Sp\u00e4tzle\u2019/\u2018Schw\u00e4bische Kn\u00f6pfle\u2019 are traditionally made by hand; machine production of \u2018Schw\u00e4bische Sp\u00e4tzle\u2019/\u2018Schw\u00e4bische Kn\u00f6pfle\u2019 did not start until the beginning of the 20th century. The ingredients are mixed and the dough is kneaded until it achieves consistency. Since the introduction of kneading machines, this process has largely been mechanised. The dough is shaped and put into boiling water or steam. The consistency of the dough and the right cooking time and temperature require an instinctive feel and experience which are difficult to standardise. The producers\u2019 craft skills and regional expertise with regard to processing play a special part in this process. In the case of the dry pasta product, the \u2018Schw\u00e4bische Sp\u00e4tzle\u2019/\u2018Schw\u00e4bische Kn\u00f6pfle\u2019 produced are pre-dried and then dried; in the case of the fresh pasta product, the product is cooled, if necessary, pasteurised and then cooled to 2-7 \u00b0C. 3.6.

        "4. Concise definition of the geographical area: The geographical area of Swabia comprises the whole of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and the whole of the region of Swabia in Bavaria. 5. Link with the geographical area: 5.1. Specificity of the geographical area: \u2018Schw\u00e4bische Sp\u00e4tzle\u2019/\u2018Schw\u00e4bische Kn\u00f6pfle\u2019 have been produced in the geographical area for centuries and play a very important part in Swabian cooking. The producers\u2019 craft skills and regional expertise with regard to processing play a special part in this process. Traditionally, the \u2018Sp\u00e4tzle\u2019 dough is hand- cut and, even today, hand-cutting of the dough from a board is regarded as a special symbol of its quality. The production of \u2018Schw\u00e4bische Sp\u00e4tzle\u2019/\u2018Schw\u00e4bische Kn\u00f6pfle\u2019 by machine in a home-made style, i.e. as if the dough were hand-cut, started at the beginning of the 20th century for economic reasons. The first patents based on practical experience were registered (see, for example, Deutsches Reichpatent 471046) to maintain the authenticity and home-made character of \u2018Schw\u00e4bische Sp\u00e4tzle\u2019/\u2018Schw\u00e4bische Kn\u00f6pfle\u2019. Several exhibitions contain records tracing the traditional skills used in Swabia to make the product dating from earliest times to the present day (see \u2018Sp\u00e4tzle und Kn\u00f6pfle \u2014 Geschichte(n) rund um das Leibgericht der Schwaben\u2019, especially: Alte Zeiten, Ofterdingen; \u2018Sp\u00e4tzle \u2014 Schaben, pressen, hobeln\u2019, Freilichtmuseum Beuren). Numerous cookery competitions and several world records in cutting the \u2018Sp\u00e4tzle\u2019 dough underline the specificity of the geographical area in connection with the human factors. The local expertise in making the dough has been handed down from generation to generation and plays a significant part in the product's subsequent char\u00ad acteristics. The tradition of making \u2018Sp\u00e4tzle\u2019 can be traced back to the 18th century. In 1725, Rosino Lentilio, a councillor and personal physician from W\u00fcrttemberg, concluded that \u2018Kn\u00f6pflein\u2019 and \u2018Spazen\u2019 were \u2018all the things that are made from flour\u2019. Spelt was grown widely in the Swabian- Alemannic area at the time. The cereal grows on poor soils and was very popular in the region, which was home to small farmers and characterised by poverty. As spelt flour contains high levels of gluten protein and the dough could therefore be made in times of hardship without the need for eggs, \u2018Schw\u00e4bische Sp\u00e4tzle\u2019/\u2018Schw\u00e4bische Kn\u00f6pfle\u2019 were mainly made from spelt. The product achieved fame in the M\u00fcnsinger Alb upland area. As industrialisation began and prosperity increased, \u2018Schw\u00e4bische Sp\u00e4tzle\u2019/\u2018Schw\u00e4bische Kn\u00f6pfle\u2019 went from being an ordinary, everyday food item to a culinary speciality eaten on feast days. In a description of a Swabian farmers\u2019 village written in 1937, \u2018Sp\u00e4tzle\u2019 are described as a festive food. The year before, the local poet Sebastian Blau called \u2018Sp\u00e4tzle\u2019 the symbol of Swabian regional identity: \u2018 \u201cSp\u00e4tzle\u201d are the foundation of our cuisine, our country\u2019s fame, etc., the Alpha and the Omega of a Swabian menu, etc.\u2019. In places less favoured by nature within the geographical area, the traditional, regional methods of making \u2018Sp\u00e4tzle\u2019 together with the highly developed craft skills enabled a high-value product to be made. Today in Swabia, \u2018Schw\u00e4bische Sp\u00e4tzle\u2019/\u2018Schw\u00e4bische Kn\u00f6pfle\u2019 are produced by nearly all makers of pasta products and used by nearly all restaurateurs. Since the 1980s, exports of the product have also been a success. For the people living in the geographical area, the product has become a symbol of identity. The great importance of \u2018Schw\u00e4bische Sp\u00e4tzle\u2019/\u2018Schw\u00e4bische Kn\u00f6pfle\u2019 in Swabian cooking can be seen, inter alia, from the novel, first published in 1827, entitled \u2018Die Geschichte von den Sieben Schwaben\u2019, according to which the custom in Swabia is \u2018to eat five times a day, five times soup, twice with \u201cKn\u00f6pfle\u201d or \u201cSp\u00e4tzle\u201d \u2019. In 1892, Elise Henle wrote that it was the proper thing for a woman in Swabia to know how to cook \u2018Sp\u00e4tzle\u2019: \u2018She\u2019s not a proper Swabian girl if she can\u2019t cook \u201cSp\u00e4tzle\u201d \u2019. More recently, the Swabian author Siegfried Ruoss lists more than 50 different recipes from Swabia using \u2018Sp\u00e4tzle\u2019 in his cookbook \u2018Schw\u00e4bische Sp\u00e4tzlek\u00fcche\u2019. 5.2. Specificity of the product: Unlike other pasta products, \u2018Schw\u00e4bische Sp\u00e4tzle\u2019/\u2018Schw\u00e4bische Kn\u00f6pfle\u2019 is an egg-based pasta product made from fresh eggs in a home-made style. The product is irregular in shape and has a rough, porous surface. The dough is placed straight into boiling water/steam. It can be thin or thick, long or short. It is the only pasta product boiled for the first time during the course of its production. The moist dough is either pressed through perforated sheets or it drops through these sheets and into a hot water container. If appropriate, the dough is cut during this process. 5.3. Causal link between the geographical area and the quality or characteristics of the product (for PDO) or a specific quality, the reputation or other characteristic of the product (for PGI): The causal link between the special features of \u2018Schw\u00e4bische Sp\u00e4tzle\u2019/\u2018Schw\u00e4bische Kn\u00f6pfle\u2019 and the geographical origin is attributable to the special regard in which the products are is held in view of their origin. The products are pasta specialities which look back over a long tradition, are emblematic EN C 191/22 Official Journal of the European Union 1.7.2011 ",
        "of Swabia and in particular are well known and held in high regard both within the region and beyond. This is confirmed by most of the comments received by the national authority and from a consumer survey carried out in 2002. Secondly, numerous references in literature, press articles and regional cookery books confirm the fundamental importance of \u2018Sp\u00e4tzle\u2019 and \u2018Kn\u00f6pfle\u2019 to Swabian cooking and the high regard in which the products are held as the \u2018Swabian national dish\u2019. In Swabia today, \u2018Schw\u00e4bische Sp\u00e4tzle\u2019 and \u2018Schw\u00e4bische Kn\u00f6pfle\u2019 appear in the product lists of nearly all makers of pasta products and are used by nearly all restaurateurs. Since the 1980s, exports of the product have also been successful. The high regard in which \u2018Schw\u00e4bische Sp\u00e4tzle\u2019/\u2018Schw\u00e4bische Kn\u00f6pfle\u2019 are held is mainly the result of the traditional, regional production methods and the highly-developed craft skills which exist in Swabia for making \u2018Sp\u00e4tzle\u2019, with the hand-cut variety finding particular favour. Machine production also demands an instinctive feel and experience, so the producers\u2019 craft skills and regional expertise with regard to processing are of special significance. Therefore, the assumption which can be made is that the renown of \u2018Schw\u00e4bische Sp\u00e4tzle\u2019/\u2018Schw\u00e4bische Kn\u00f6pfle\u2019 is closely associated with the region of production. The product \u2018Schw\u00e4bische Sp\u00e4tzle\u2019/\u2018Schw\u00e4bische Kn\u00f6pfle\u2019 is well known to consumers and, given its regional origin, it is held in high esteem based on its long tradition as a Swabian speciality and the local craft skills developed in making the product, which is regarded as being of special quality if it is hand-cut. A nationwide survey carried out in 1965 by Konsumgenossenschaft Stuttgart e.G. for the Stuttgart and Reutlingen regions showed that \u2018Sp\u00e4tzle\u2019 are held in the highest regard. Swabian literature is also full of poems about the Swabians\u2019 favourite food, such as the poem published in 1838 in the Schwarzw\u00e4lder Boten entitled \u2018Das Lob der Schwabenkn\u00f6pfle\u2019, the poem \u2018Schw\u00e4bische Leibspeisa\u2019 and \u2018Sp\u00e4tzles-Lied\u2019. There are numerous festive activities and customs in which reference is made to \u2018Schw\u00e4biche Sp\u00e4tzle\u2019/\u2018Schw\u00e4bische Kn\u00f6pfle\u2019 and the products are marketed to the tourist industry in the form of speciality food weeks, courses, seminars and competitions on how to cut \u2018Sp\u00e4tzle\u2019. More recently, \u2018Schw\u00e4biche Sp\u00e4tzle\u2019/\u2018Schw\u00e4bische Kn\u00f6pfle\u2019 have come to be seen as Swabia\u2019s \u2018culinary ambassador\u2019.

Bread, pastry, cakes, confectionery, biscuits and other baker\u2019s wares 3.2. Description of product to which the name in (1) applies: \u2018Koufeta Amygdalou Geroskipou\u2019 are roasted sugared almonds. The final product has the following main characteristics: P h y s i c a l c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s Shape: oval/almond-shaped Colour: white C h e m i c a l c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s Moisture content: 2-4 % O r g a n o l e p t i c c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s Surface/texture: the outer layer of sugar syrup has a characteristically rough surface which, when it is chewed, is comparatively softer than similar products and leaves behind a pleasant sensation (it melts easily in the mouth). The thickness of the sugar coating varies between two and four millimetres. Taste: sweetness conveyed by the sugar and a characteristic taste of roasted almonds. 3.3. Raw materials (for processed products only): The following are used to produce \u2018Koufeta Amygdalou Geroskipou\u2019; (a) almonds; and (b) granulated cane sugar. 3.4. Feed (for products of animal origin only): Not applicable EN C 191/24 Official Journal of the European Union 1.7.2011 ( 1 ) OJ L 93, 31.3.2006, p. 12. ",
        "3.5. Specific steps in production that must take place in the defined geographical area: The production and packaging of \u2018Koufeta Amygdalou Geroskipou\u2019 must take place in the defined geographical area (municipality of Geroskipou) (both the sugar and the almonds can originate from outside the defined geographical area). 3.6. Specific rules concerning slicing, grating, packaging, etc.: \u2018Koufeta Amygdalou Geroskipou\u2019 must not be packaged at temperatures exceeding 45 \u00b0C because of the condensation that creates humidity in the sachets. As soon as the temperature falls below 45 \u00b0C, the packaging process, which takes place at room temperature, can start. If the Koufeta are not packaged at this time, too much humidity is lost and the Koufeta will not be so soft when chewed (i.e. their specific organoleptic characteristics will be altered). In other words, the time when \u2018Koufeta Amygdalou Geroskipou\u2019 are packaged is crucial, since the preservation of their final organoleptic characteristics depends on this. It is therefore imperative for \u2018Koufeta Amygdalou Geroskipou\u2019 to be packaged within the defined geographical area. This also guarantees the authenticity and traceability of the product. 3.7. Specific rules concerning labelling: The labelling of \u2018Koufeta Amygdalou Geroskipou\u2019 includes a conservation date of one month from the date of production. 4. Concise definition of the geographical area: The administrative boundaries of the municipality of Geroskipou 5. Link with the geographical area: 5.1. Specificity of the geographical area: \u2018Koufeta Amygdalou Geroskipou\u2019 are made using a traditional family recipe and to date all persons involved in their production in the municipality of Geroskipou have been descendants of Sophocles Athanasios, who started making them in Geroskipou in 1895. The product has been made in the same way for over a century in the same geographical area (municipality of Geroskipou) by descendants of Sophocles Athanasios. As a result, the expertise and know-how needed to produce \u2018Koufeta Amygdalou Geroskipou\u2019 have existed in the defined geographical area since 1895 and have been handed down to this day. Training in how to produce \u2018Koufeta Amygdalou Geroskipou\u2019 was, and is still, given by experienced producers to the younger generation, in other words the know-how is transmitted from one generation to the next. The book entitled \u2018Geroskipou \u2014 Old and New\u2019 (Aristidou and Vakis, 1992) contains a reference to the preparation of sugared almonds in Geroskipou after 1930, which are sold mainly during festivals. There is also a reference to the product in the book entitled \u2018Geroskipou \u2014 A Historical and Folkloric Study\u2019 (Hatzikyriakos, 2000), mentioning that sugared almonds are made using syrup, sugar and almonds that are cooked in a small pot. A defining moment for \u2018Koufeta Amygdalou Geroskipou\u2019 was the award of a prize in a special fair organised in Stroumbi in 1937. \u2018Koufeta Amygdalou Geroskipou\u2019 are also mentioned in the municipality of Geroskipou's book entitled \u2018Geroskipou from Antiquity to the present day\u2019 (2008). The monthly newsletter \u2018O Tahidromos tis Paphou\u2019 (August 2010) featured an interview with a veteran producer who is still making Koufeta today, and mentions that the product is one of Geroskipou's long-established traditional products. 5.2. Specificity of the product: The specificity of \u2018Koufeta Amygdalou Geroskipou\u2019 is twofold: (a) the product's reputation due to the traditional production method that has been used in the municipality of Geroskipou from the late 19th century to this day; and EN 1.7.2011 Official Journal of the European Union C 191/25 ",
        "(b) certain specific organoleptic characteristics which distinguish it from similar products, mainly its characteristically rough surface and texture created by the outer layer of sugar syrup which, when it is chewed, is softer than similar products and melts easily in the mouth, leaving behind a pleasant sensation. \u2018Koufeta Amygdalou Geroskipou\u2019 also have a characteristic sweetness conveyed by the sugar. The rough surface, the texture and the sweetness are unique to the product and are not found in other sugared almonds. In particular, \u2018Koufeta Amygdalou Geroskipou\u2019 are made without using any wax to protect or isolate the almond (a practice followed in the production of other sugared almonds so that the almond retains its oil content). Nor does the process involve any raw materials other than the almonds and the sugar, or any additional process for polishing the sugared almonds (coating them with wax or polishing them mechanically as a continuation of the processing in the sugared almond maker), as is the case for other sugared almonds. The pores on the surface of the product therefore remain open, rendering the surface rough by comparison with other sugared almonds. Also, during their shelf life, \u2018Koufeta Amygdalou Geroskipou\u2019 are softer and sweeter than other sugared almonds since no other raw materials are used, whereas for other sugared almonds other raw materials are added to counteract the sweetness of the product. 5.3. Causal link between the geographical area and the quality or characteristics of the product (for PDO) or a specific quality, the reputation or other characteristic of the product (for PGI): \u2018Koufeta Amygdalou Geroskipou\u2019 are well-known throughout Cyprus. As stated above, \u2018Koufeta Amygdalou Geroskipou\u2019 have been made in Geroskipou for a great many years and the know-how involved in preparing them has been handed down from one generation to the next until this day. The uniqueness of \u2018Koufeta Amygdalou Geroskipou\u2019 and their specific characteristics are due to the knowledge and expertise of their manufacturers in Geroskipou, especially as regards the method of production. The particular texture which is characteristic of \u2018Koufeta Amygdalou Geroskipou\u2019 is due mainly to the way the product is prepared, and in particular to the length of the process of coating the roasted almonds with sugar syrup, the rhythmic movement of the sugared almond maker during this process and the recipe used to prepare the product. The crucial element in the production process, which constitutes the fundamental know-how, is that the producer has to stand by the machine (the sugared almond maker) all the time to supervise the entire coating process so that he can intervene immediately to adjust the thickness and quantity of the syrup and the temperature if required. The combination of the time taken to coat the roasted almonds with sugar syrup and the rhythmic movement of the sugared almond maker during the coating process is also very important. If the almonds are coated earlier than intended and/or if the rhythmic movement of the sugared almond maker is not exactly right, then the sugared almonds will stick to each other. Likewise, if the almonds are coated later than intended and/or if the rhythmic movement of the sugared almond maker is not exactly right, then the sugared almonds will dry out and the correct amount of sugar will not be absorbed. All the above form part of the tradition, the authentic local methods of production and the local knowledge and expertise of the Geroskipou producers. The success of the recipe described in the specification is also due to the fact that only two raw materials are used, namely sugar and almonds, and nothing else (contrary to the production of other sugared almonds, where other raw materials are used).
