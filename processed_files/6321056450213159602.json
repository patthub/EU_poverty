        "Middle East 43. Iran 44. Iraq 45. Yemen South Africa 46. South Africa\u2019 Financing instrument for development cooperation ***I P7_TA(2010)0382 European Parliament legislative resolution of 21 October 2010 on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006 establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation (COM(2010)0102 \u2013 C7-0079/2010 \u2013 2010/0059(COD)) (2012/C 70 E/32) (Ordinary legislative procedure: first reading) The European Parliament , \u2014 having regard to the Commission proposal to Parliament and the Council (COM(2010)0102), \u2014 having regard to Article 294(2) and Article 209(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, pursuant to which the Commission submitted the proposal to Parliament (C7-0079/2010), \u2014 having regard to Article 294(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, \u2014 having regard to the reasoned opinions sent to its President by national parliaments on the compliance of the draft act with the principle of subsidiarity, \u2014 having regard to Rule 55 of its Rules of Procedure, \u2014 having regard to the report of the Committee on Development and the opinion of the Committee on Budgets (A7-0285/2010), 1. Adopts its position at first reading hereinafter set out; 2. Considers that the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council, by drastically reducing the margin under the ceiling of heading 4 of the multiannual financial framework (MFF) for 2007-2013, does not leave sufficient room for manoeuvre to face and to react adequately to a potential upcoming crisis; 3. Considers that, due to the long-standing issue concerning trade in bananas, the proposed measures could have been integrated at an earlier stage into the MFF; EN 8.3.2012 Official Journal of the European Union C 70 E/203 Thursday 21 October 2010 ",
        "4. Reiterates its conviction that any new instrument should not be financed through redeployment as this would jeopardise the existing priorities; 5. Recalls that the Flexibility Instrument referred to in point 27 of the Interinstitutional Agreement (IIA) of 17 May 2006 on budgetary discipline and sound financial management ( 1 ) aims at financing \u2018clearly identified expenditure which could not be financed within the limits of the ceilings\u2019, and considers measures relating to trade in bananas to be accompanying measures falling into that category; 6. Considers therefore that the proposal is not compatible with the ceiling for heading 4 of the MFF, and calls for the revision of the latter by all means provided for in points 21 to 23 of the IIA, or by other means such as those included in points 25 and 27 thereof; 7. Calls on the Commission to refer the matter to Parliament again if it intends to amend its proposal substantially or replace it with another text; 8. Instructs its President to forward its position to the Council, the Commission and the national parliaments. ( 1 ) OJ C 139, 14.6.2006, p. 1. P7_TC1-COD(2010)0059 Position of the European Parliament adopted at first reading on 21 October 2010 with a view to the adoption of Regulation (EU) No \u2026/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006 establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 209(1) thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission, After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national Parliaments, Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure ( 1 ), Whereas: (1) The Union\u2019s development policy aims to reduce and ultimately eradicate poverty. (2) The Union, as a contracting party of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), is committed to main\u00ad streaming trade in development strategies and to promoting international trade in order to advance development and reduce \u2013 and, in the long term, eradicate \u2013 poverty worldwide. (3) The Union supports the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group of States on their path to poverty reduction and to sustainable economic and social development, and recognises the importance of their commodity sectors. EN C 70 E/204 Official Journal of the European Union 8.3.2012 ( 1 ) Position of the European Parliament of 21 October 2010. Thursday 21 October 2010 ",
        "(4) The Union is committed to supporting the smooth and gradual integration of developing countries into the world economy with a view to sustainable development. The main ACP banana-exporting countries may face challenges in the context of changing trade arrangements, notably liberalisation of the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) tariff in the framework of the WTO and the bilateral and regional agreements concluded, or in the process of being concluded, between the Union and Latin American countries . Hence an ACP Banana Accompanying Measures programme should be added to Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 estab\u00ad lishing a financing instrument for development cooperation ( 1 ). (5) The financial assistance measures to be adopted under this programme should aim at improving the living standards and living conditions of people in banana-growing areas and banana value chains, specifically small farmers and small entities, as well as complying with labour and occupational health and safety standards, and environmental standards, notably those regarding the use of and exposure to pesticides, by supporting the adaptation and including, when relevant, the reorgani\u00ad sation, of areas dependent upon banana exports through sector-specific budget support or project- specific interventions. The measures should aim to provide for social resilience policies, economic diversification or investment to improve competitiveness, where this is \u2590 viable \u2590 , taking into account the results of and experiences gained through the Special System of Assistance to traditional ACP suppliers of bananas established in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 2686/94 ( 2 ) and the Special Framework of Assistance (SFA) for traditional ACP suppliers of bananas established in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 856/1999 ( 3 ) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1609/1999 ( 4 ). The Union acknowledges the importance of promoting a more equitable distribution of the banana revenues. (6) The programme should accompany the adaptation process in ACP countries which have exported significant volumes of bananas to the Union in recent years and which will be affected by liberali\u00ad sation in the framework of the WTO ( 5 ) and by the bilateral and regional agreements concluded, or in the process of being concluded, between the Union and Latin American countries . The programme builds on the SFA for traditional ACP suppliers of bananas. It is in conformity with the Union\u2019s international obligations in the framework of the WTO , focuses on restructuring and boosting competitiveness, and is consequently temporary in nature, with a \u2590 duration of four years (2010-2013). (7) The conclusions of the Commission Communication of 17 March 2010 entitled \u2018Biennial Report on the Special Framework of Assistance for Traditional ACP Suppliers of Bananas\u2019 indicate that past assistance programmes made substantial contributions to achieving improved capacity for successful economic diversification, although the full impact cannot be quantified, and that the sustainability of ACP banana exports remains fragile. (8) The Commission has carried out an evaluation of the SFA programme and has not carried out an impact assessment of the banana accompanying measures (BAMs). (9) The Commission should ensure proper coordination of this programme with the regional and national indicative programmes operating in the beneficiary countries, in particular as regards the achievement of economic, agricultural, social and environmental objectives. (10) Almost 2 % of the world\u2019s trade in bananas is endorsed by fair trade producers\u2019 organisations. The minimum fair trade prices are set on the basis of a calculation of the \u2018sustainable production costs\u2019, established following consultations with stakeholders, with a view to internalising the costs of meeting decent social and environmental standards and generating a reasonable profit, enabling producers to safeguard their livelihoods in the long term. (11) To prevent the exploitation of local workers, actors in the production chain in the banana industry should agree to ensure that the revenue generated by the industry is allocated fairly.

        "(12) The Commission should be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union in respect of Geographic Strategy Papers, Multi-annual Indicative Programmes and Strategy Papers for thematic programmes and the accom\u00ad panying measures, as they supplement Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006 and are of general appli\u00ad cation. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. (13) Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly, HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1 Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006 is hereby amended as follows: (1) Article 4 is replaced by the following: \u2018 Article 4 Implementation of Union assistance Consistent with the overall purpose and scope, objectives and general principles of this Regulation, Union assistance shall be implemented through the geographic and thematic programmes set out in Articles 5 to 16 and the programmes set out in Articles 17 and 17a.\u2019; (2) The following Article is inserted: \u2018 Article 17a Main ACP banana supplying countries 1.
