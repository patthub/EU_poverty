The spring European Council meeting, held in Brussels, was chaired by Mr Janez Jan s a, the Slovenian Prime Minister, who opened the first meeting of the Heads of State or Government chaired by a Member State having acceded to the EU in 2004. The meeting was preceded by the traditional tripartite social summit and by an expos\u00e9 by the President of the European Parlia- ment, Mr Hans-Gert P\u00f6ttering. Leaders of the EU Member States launched the next cycle of the Lisbon strategy 2008\u201310. The European Council confirmed the validity of the integrated guidelines for growth and jobs and approved specific recommendations for Member States. It invited the Commission, Parliament and the Council to take forward work on the 10 objec- tives identified in the new Community Lisbon programme as soon as possible. It also confirmed the adoption timeline and key principles of the climate and energy package. Moreover, the Heads of State or Government devoted part of their dis- cussion to the recent turmoil in international financial markets, as well as to responding to it and to preventing such crises in the future. They also addressed the future of sovereign wealth funds. Finally, the European Council approved the principle of a Union for the Mediterranean and invited the Commission to bring forward pro- posals to that effect, in order to upgrade the Barcelona process and enhance the EU\u2019s relations with its Mediterranean neighbours. The full text of the Presidency conclusions and annexes are reproduced below ( \u2192 points I.2 to I.21). Presidency conclusions I.2. The meeting of the European Council was pre- ceded by an expos\u00e9 by the President of the European Parliament, Mr Hans-Gert P\u00f6ttering, followed by an exchange of views. I.3. 1. The fundamentals of the European Union econ- omy remain sound: public deficits have been more than halved since 2005 and public debt has also declined to just under 60%. Economic growth has reached 2.9% in 2007, but is likely to be lower this year. 6.5 million jobs were created in the last two years. Although cycli- cal factors have played a role, these developments have been aided by the structural reforms undertaken over the last years within the framework of the Lisbon strategy and the beneficial effects of the euro and the single market. 2. However, the global economic outlook has dete- riorated recently as a result of a slowdown of economic activity in the United States, higher oil and commodity prices, and ongoing turbulence on the financial markets. Excessive volatility and dis- orderly movements in exchange rates are undesir- able for economic growth. In the present circum- stances we are concerned about excessive exchange rate moves. This is why it is all the more essential for the Union to avoid complacency and sustain reform efforts through the full implementation of the national reform programmes and the integrated guidelines for growth and jobs. Efforts to complete and deepen the internal market must continue. Closely coordinated economic and financial policies must be geared towards ensuring macroeconomic stability, taking up the opportunities of globalisation and addressing the challenges ahead including ageing populations, climate change and energy. In order to ensure greater stability of financial markets, action is also required to strengthen their transparency and functioning and to further improve the supervisory and regulatory environment at national, EU and global levels. 3. The European Council notes that recent signifi- cant increases in food and energy prices have con- tributed to inflationary pressures. In this regard, the European Council recalls the need to avoid dis- tortionary policies that prevent the necessary adjust- ments by economic agents. It invites the Council to identify the driving forces behind developments in commodity and food prices and pursue EU and national policies which remove possible supply limi- tations. ",

Further to the Commission\u2019s strategic report and in the light of work in the relevant Council formations the European Council launches the second three-year cycle of the strategy by: \u00a1 confirming that the current integrated guidelines (BEPGs and employment guidelines) remain valid and should serve for the period 2008\u201310. The Council (Ecofin and EPSCO) is invited to formally adopt the integrated guidelines in accordance with the Treaty; \u00a1 endorsing the country-specific recommendations for the economic and employment policies of the Member States and the euro area as drawn up by the Council on the basis of the Commission\u2019s proposals. The Council is invited to formally adopt them. Mem- ber States should set out detailed and concrete actions addressing their specific policy response to the inte- grated guidelines, country-specific recommendations and \u2018points to watch\u2019 in their national reform pro- grammes and the subsequent annual implementa- tion reports. The Commission is invited to continue working with Member States to further develop a clear and transparent methodology for the monitoring and evaluation of Lisbon reforms; \u00a1 taking into account the priorities identified by the Council and the concrete actions set out below, invit- ing the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council, within their spheres of competence, to take forward work on the 10 objectives identified in the Community Lisbon programme, which provides a strategic reform agenda for the Community part of the renewed Lisbon strategy; progress should be assessed annually. 5. The focus of the new cycle will be on implementa- tion. The European Council therefore: \u00a1 reconfirms the four priority areas agreed at its spring 2006 meeting as the cornerstones of the renewed Lisbon strategy and at the same time calls for synergies among them to be exploited to a greater degree; \u00a1 invites the Commission and Member States in the context of multilateral surveillance to step up the exchange of best practices, in particular by making full use of existing methods of open coordination, efficient coordination within the euro area being of particular importance; \u00a1 invites the Commission and Member States to strengthen the involvement of relevant stakeholders in the Lisbon process; \u00a1 recognises the role of the local and regional levels in delivering growth and jobs; increased ownership of the growth and jobs agenda at all levels of government will lead to more coherent and effective policymaking; \u00a1 emphasises that economic, social and territorial cohesion also contributes to fulfilling the objectives of the renewed Lisbon strategy and welcomes the progress made in targeting cohesion funds in support of national reform programmes and implementation of the integrated guidelines. Now that the programming phase has been completed, the European Council calls on Member States to ensure that expenditure reflects the earmarking commitments made; \u00a1 underlines the importance of macroeconomic stability in addressing longer-term challenges ahead.

        "Presidency conclusions 10 Bull. EU 3-2008 The EU budgetary framework, as defined by the revised Stability and Growth Pact, provides the appro- priate tools in this regard. The improvement in the overall budgetary situation in the EU provides the nec- essary room for manoeuvre for automatic stabilisers to play if downside risks were to materialise. Countries that have reached their medium-term objective should maintain their structural position and all countries not yet at their medium-term objectives should speed up the pace of deficit and debt reduction, in line with the Council opinions on the stability and convergence pro- grammes, and allocate possible higher-than-expected revenues to this objective. The quality of public finances needs to be improved by raising the efficiency and effectiveness of public expenditures and revenues, including continued efforts to combat cross-border tax evasion, modernising public administration and favouring measures in public budgets that promote pro- ductivity, employment and innovation; \u00a1 reconfirms the importance of the social dimension of the EU as an integral part of the Lisbon strategy and in particular stresses the need to further integrate eco- nomic, employment and social policies; \u00a1 agrees the concrete actions set out below. In this connection, the European Council endorses the key messages from the Council in its Ecofin, competitive- ness, employment and social policy, environment and education and youth formations, as well as the Council conclusions on the single market review. 6. The European Council furthermore stresses that a continued EU-level commitment to structural reforms and sustainable development and social cohesion will be necessary after 2010 in order to lock in the progress achieved by the renewed Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs. The European Council therefore invites the Commission, the Council and the national Lisbon coor- dinators to start reflecting on the future of the Lisbon strategy in the post-2010 period.

A key factor for future growth is the full devel- opment of the potential for innovation and creativity of European citizens built on European culture and excellence in science. Since the relaunch of the Lisbon strategy in 2005, joint efforts have led to significant achievements in the areas of research, knowledge and innovation. The implementation of the broad-based innovation strategy is key to realising EU ambitions in the area. All the priorities of the strategy need to be taken forward rapidly. At the same time further efforts must be made, including in the private sector, with a view to investing more, and more effectively, in research, creativity, innovation and higher education and achieving the 3% R & D investment target. The European Council highlights the following actions on which the Member States and the Community are urged to make swift progress. \u00a1 Member States are invited to set out in their national reform programmes how progress towards national R & D investment targets will be achieved and how their R & D strategies will contribute to the realising and better governance of the European research area. \u00a1 Key projects, such as Galileo, EIT, the European Research Council, the risk-sharing finance facility, the joint technology initiatives must be swiftly imple- mented or further promoted; decisions on Article 169 initiatives and additional research initiatives should be taken as soon as possible. \u00a1 Scientific e-infrastructure and high-speed Internet usage must be significantly increased. Member States should aim to make high-speed Internet available to all schools by 2010 and to set ambitious national targets ",
        "Presidency conclusions Bull. EU 3-2008 11 for household access as part of their national reform programmes. \u00a1 An EU-wide market for venture capital for the most innovative companies must be promoted; in that respect the European Investment Fund must play a key role in the financing of innovative SMEs. \u00a1 Efforts towards improving the framework condi- tions for innovation should be better coordinated, including through improved science\u2013industry linkages and world-class innovation clusters and development of regional clusters and networks. \u00a1 Particular attention should be given to further ini- tiatives for joint programming of research, mutually complementary international S & T cooperation strate- gies and the strengthening of research infrastructure of pan-European interest. \u00a1 Universities should be allowed to develop partner- ships with the business community so as to benefit from complementary private sector funding. 8. In order to become a truly modern and competitive economy, and building on the work carried out on the future of science and technology and on the moderni- sation of universities, Member States and the EU must remove barriers to the free movement of knowledge by creating a \u2018fifth freedom\u2019 based on: \u00a1 enhancing the cross-border mobility of researchers, as well as students, scientists, and university teaching staff, \u00a1 making the labour market for European researchers more open and competitive, providing better career structures, transparency and family-friendliness, \u00a1 further implementing higher education reforms, \u00a1 facilitating and promoting the optimal use of intel- lectual property created in public research organisa- tions so as to increase knowledge transfer to industry, in particular through an \u2018IP Charter\u2019 to be adopted before the end of the year, \u00a1 encouraging open access to knowledge and open innovation, \u00a1 fostering scientific excellence, \u00a1 launching a new generation of world-class research facilities, \u00a1 promoting the mutual recognition of qualifications.

Decisions taken since the renewal of the Lisbon strategy have started to improve conditions for market players. It has become easier to set up a business as all Member States have established one-stop shops or similar arrangements to facilitate registration and reduce paperwork. The European Council welcomes the progress made during 2007 on better regulation and considers that further efforts are needed in order to deliver crucial improvements to the competitiveness of EU business, in particular SMEs. Better regulation should be considered a high priority by each Council formation in its regulatory work. To ensure that the bet- ter regulation initiative delivers real and substantial economic benefits: \u00a1 efforts on reducing administrative burdens arising from EU legislation by 25% by 2012 should be stepped up, in line with the European Council Conclusions of March 2007; the appointment of an advisory group of independent stakeholders in the context of the action programme is welcomed; progress made will be evaluated at the 2009 spring meeting on the basis of the Commission\u2019s \u2018Strategic evaluation of better regu- lation\u2019; \u00a1 pending \u2018fast track\u2019 legislative proposals should be swiftly adopted and new ones identified, and the Commission should also continue to bring forward administrative burden reduction proposals on an ongo- ing basis; the simplification rolling programme should continue to be implemented; \u00a1 more should be done to develop the capacity of EU institutions on impact assessment, in line with the rel- evant key message from the Council (competitiveness). ",
        "Presidency conclusions 12 Bull. EU 3-2008 I.7. 10. The single market remains a crucial driver for enhancing living standards of European citizens and Europe\u2019s competitiveness in the globalised economy. In order to further improve the functioning of the sin- gle market so as to allow business, in particular SMEs, and consumers to make full use of its potential the fol- lowing measures and actions need to be taken forward as immediate priorities: \u00a1 ensure an effective follow-up to the Commission\u2019s single market review on a yearly basis with a focus on actions needed to boost growth and jobs by removing remaining barriers to the four freedoms of the treaty, including, where appropriate, through harmonisation as well as mutual recognition. In this context market developments should be monitored in order to prioritise action in markets where there are genuine and signifi- cant barriers to market functioning and competition. Due attention must also be paid to the social dimension and services of general interest; \u00a1 reinforce efforts to strengthen competition in net- work industries (energy, electronic communications) and to adopt the adequate regulatory frameworks; in this context work on interconnections must be pursued and accelerated; \u00a1 ensure a complete, coherent, and timely transposi- tion and implementation of the services directive which is an important step towards the creation of a genuine single market for services. In this context it is crucial to improve the functioning of \u2018e-single market\u2019 by put- ting in place cross-border interoperable solutions for electronic signature and e-authentication. I.8. 11. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) form the backbone of the European econ- omy and have the potential to contribute signifi- cantly to creating more growth and jobs in the European Union. In order to reinforce the Union\u2019s SMEs policy and to allow them to operate more effectively in the single market, the following actions are of immediate importance: \u00a1 swift examination by the Council of the upcoming small business act initiative setting out an integrated approach across the SMEs\u2019 life cycle in line with better regulation and think small first principles and intended to further strengthen SMEs\u2019 growth and competitiveness; \u00a1 the introduction, where justified and following screening of the acquis commun a utaire , of exemptions for SMEs from the administrative requirements of EU legislation; \u00a1 strengthened support of research-performing and innovative SMEs with high growth potential, for exam- ple through a new European private company statute; \u00a1 further facilitation of access to finance, including through existing EU financial instruments; \u00a1 facilitation of increased participation of innovative SMEs in clusters and in public procurement. I.9. 12. Open markets and a sound international envi- ronment contribute to growth and jobs and should lead to reciprocal benefits. The EU should therefore continue its endeavours to shape globalisation by reinforcing the external dimension of the renewed Lis- bon strategy. The European Council welcomes the Commission\u2019s intention to report annually on market access, identifying countries and sectors where signif- icant barriers remain and believes that the EU should continue its endeavours to: \u00a1 promote free trade and openness as a means to fos- ter growth, employment and development for itself and its trading partners and continue to take the lead in this domain; \u00a1 improve the multilateral trading system, in particu- lar by continuing to strive for an ambitious, balanced and comprehensive agreement in the Doha Develop- ment Round; \u00a1 conclude ambitious bilateral agreements with impor- tant trading partners and further step up the efforts for integration with neighbouring countries and candidate countries through developing a common economic space; \u00a1 secure reliable access to energy and to strategic raw materials; \u00a1 strengthen existing economic relations and develop mutually beneficial strategic partnerships with emerg- ing economic powers in a context of fair competition; \u00a1 foster regulatory cooperation, convergence of stan- dards and equivalence of rules in the mutual interest of the EU and its partners, and improve the effectiveness of the intellectual property rights enforcement system against counterfeiting.

        "Presidency conclusions Bull. EU 3-2008 13 I.10. 13. The education element of the knowledge triangle \u2018research\u2013innovation\u2013education\u2019 should be strengthened. Providing high-quality education and investing more and more effectively in human capital and creativity throughout people\u2019s lives are crucial con- ditions for Europe\u2019s success in a globalised world. This can bridge and facilitate the movement towards a \u2018knowledge-based economy\u2019, create more and better jobs and contribute to sound fiscal positions. They are also effective ways of fighting inequality and poverty and can contribute to reducing youth unemployment. I.11. 14. The European Council looks forward to the Commission\u2019s proposal for a renewed social agenda which should play a key role in strengthening the social dimension of the Lisbon strategy by taking account of Europe\u2019s new social and labour realities and also covering issues such as youth, education, migra- tion and demography as well as intercultural dialogue. In this context combating poverty and social exclusion, promoting active inclusion and increasing employment opportunities for those furthest from the labour market are all of major importance. To this end all the appro- priate instruments and tools available at Community level should be used. In view of increasing skills shortages in a number of sectors, it invites the Com- mission to present a comprehensive assessment of the future skills requirements in Europe up to 2020, taking account of the impacts of technological change and ageing populations and to propose steps to anticipate future needs. Economic migration can play a role in meeting the needs of the labour market and can con- tribute to help reduce skills shortages. The European Council therefore considers that the employment and social impact of migration of third-country nationals needs to be addressed in the context of the Commis- sion proposals for a common policy on migration. I.12. 15. The European Council urges Member States to take concrete action to: \u00a1 substantially reduce the number of young people who cannot read properly and the number of early school leavers, and improve the achievement levels of learners with a migrant background or from disadvan- taged groups; \u00a1 attract more adults, particularly low-skilled and older workers into education and training and further facilitate geographic and occupational mobility; \u00a1 promote higher overall labour force participation and tackle segmentation in order to ensure active social inclusion; \u00a1 improve policy consistency and coordination of economic, employment and social policies in order to enhance social cohesion. I.13. 16. Flexicurity strikes a balance between flexi- bility and security on the labour market and helps both employees and employers to seize the opportunities globalisation offers. In line with the recommendations of European social partners of October 2007 and recognising that there is no single flexicurity model, the European Council calls on the Member States to implement the agreed common principles on flexicu- rity by outlining in their 2008 national reform pro- grammes the national arrangements giving effect to those principles. Flexibility and security are mutually reinforcing throughout the life cycle. In this context, intergenerational solidarity should be considered within all four components of flexicurity. Continued attention needs to be given to youth employment, and in partic- ular to the transition from education to employment in the context of the implementation of the European youth pact. Attention should also be given to the employment of disabled persons. The availability and affordability of quality childcare should be increased in line with national and Community targets. Efforts should be pursued to reconcile work with private and family life for both women and men, substantially reduce gender pay gaps and implement the European pact for gender equality. The European Alliance for Families can also contribute to achieving these aims.

Last year the EU made firm and ambitious commitments on climate and energy policy; now, in 2008, the challenge is to deliver. In December of last year the Bali climate conference made an important breakthrough and launched an inclusive international negotiating process set out in full in the Bali roadmap. The EU is committed to maintaining international leadership on climate change and energy and to keep- ing up the momentum of negotiations on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol in particular at the next confer- ence of parties in Pozna n . The objective is to secure an ambitious, global and comprehensive post-2012 agreement on climate change at Copenhagen in 2009 consistent with the EU\u2019s 2\u00b0 C objective. By delivering on all the targets set by the 2007 spring European Council, the EU will make a major contribution to this objective. A key challenge will be to ensure that this transition to a safe and sustainable low-carbon economy is handled in a way that is consistent with EU sustainable development, competitiveness, security of supply, food security, sound and sustainable public finance and economic and social cohesion. The EU proposes to contribute to an accelerated and concerted high level effort in support of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Bali action plan, to develop a coherent and consistent architecture for a post-2012 agreement that ensures scaled up finance and investment flows for both miti- gation and adaptation. Taking into account that energy and climate is an integral part of the Lisbon strategy it will also contribute positively to broader growth and jobs objectives. 18. The ambitious package of proposals proposed by the Commission to implement the conclusions of the spring European Council 2007 provides a good starting point and basis for agreement. The European Council invites the Commission to continue to sup- port Member States\u2019 efforts to reduce their emis- sions of greenhouse gases through comprehensive and ambitious Community policies and measures. Comprehensive deliberations by the Council, working closely with the European Parliament, should result in an agreement on these proposals as a coherent package before the end of 2008 and consequently allow for their adoption within the current legislative term, at the latest early in 2009. In so doing, the Council should bear in mind the importance of main- taining the overall balance across the package as a whole and should base its work on the principles of transparency, economic efficiency and cost-effective- ness, and fairness and solidarity in the distribution of effort between Member States. It should also take into account Member States\u2019 different starting points, cir- cumstances and potentials as well as achievements accomplished, and respect the need for sustainable economic growth across the Community with all sectors contributing. A cost-effective and flexible way should be followed as well when developing market- based instruments to reach energy and climate policy objectives, so as to avoid excessive costs for Mem- ber States. Stepping up to the more ambitious 30% reduction target as part of a global and comprehensive agreement needs to be built in explicitly and in a balanced, transparent and equitable way, taking into account work under the Kyoto Protocol first commit- ment period. 19. The European Council recognises that in a global context of competitive markets, the risk of carbon leak- age is a concern in certain sectors such as energy-inten- sive industries particularly exposed to international competition that needs to be analysed and addressed urgently in the new ETS directive so that if interna- tional negotiations fail, appropriate measures can be taken. An international agreement remains the best way of addressing this issue. 20. The European Council underlines that the EU ETS forms an essential part of an integrated climate and energy policy and recognises the importance of a single EU-wide ETS cap and an emissions reduction trajectory. The revised directive should enhance the cost-effectiveness of the necessary emission reduc- tions, enable the EU ETS to link to other mandatory emissions trading systems capping absolute emissions and strengthen the use of flexibility mechanisms resulting from projects implemented in third coun- tries. The European Council also underlines the need for flexibility in achieving national non-ETS and renewable targets in line with the action plan adopted by the European Council in March 2007 and stresses the importance of effective national support schemes for renewable energies and an effective flexibility mechanism based on guarantees of origin as sug- gested by the Commission and stresses the need for Community and Member States\u2019 energy policy to increase energy efficiency and security of supply as key elements for achieving the EU\u2019s integrated climate and energy policy and sustainable economic develop- ment. 21. The European Council recalls that the objective of proposing a regulatory framework on carbon capture ",
        "Presidency conclusions Bull. EU 3-2008 15 and storage (CCS) is to ensure that this novel technol- ogy is deployed in an environmentally safe way, which will be demonstrated through projects, as agreed in spring 2007. I.15. 22. In meeting the ambitious target for the use of biofuels it is essential to develop and fulfil effective sustainability criteria to ensure the commercial avail- ability of second generation biofuels, which could in the future also be considered for the use of other forms of biomass for energy in line with the conclusions of the 2007 spring European Council. 23. It is necessary to achieve greater synergies between climate change and biodiversity policies as a way of securing co-benefits, in particular by strengthening mutually supportive activities and measures with regard to climate-change mitigation and adaptation and to the production, consumption of and trade in bio- fuels. The European Council encourages Member States and the Commission to strengthen efforts aimed at halting biodiversity loss by 2010 and beyond. The 9th conference of the parties to the CBD in May 2008 in Bonn and the full implementation of the Natura 2000 network are essential steps towards achieving this objective. I.16. 24. An effective, fully-functioning and intercon- nected internal energy market is an essential condition for secure, sustainable and competitive supply of energy in Europe. The European Council therefore urges the Council to build on recent progress on the third internal market package for gas and electricity in order to reach political agreement by June 2008, taking full account of the spring 2007 European Council conclusions. It invites the Commission to take account of the situation and needs of small or isolated energy markets in further developing these policies. 25. The European Council recalls the importance it attaches to enhancing the energy security of the EU and its Member States. Whereas action on climate change and energy, the internal energy market and new technologies all contribute to this objective, work must also be vigorously pursued on further developing the external dimension of the 2007\u201309 energy policy for Europe. The European Council welcomes the progress achieved in this regard, as set out in the state of play report submitted to the Council (doc. 6778/08) and will undertake a more comprehensive assessment of progress on implementation and further actions needed in the light of the next strategic energy review to be presented in November 2008 and endorsed by the spring European Council 2009 and which will serve as the basis for the new energy action plan from 2010 onwards to be adopted by the spring 2010 European Council. This strategic energy review will focus in par- ticular on security of supply, including regarding inter- connectors, and external energy policy. The European Council attaches particular importance to the EU and its Member States speaking with a common voice on energy issues with third parties. I.17. 26. The European Council welcomes the joint report from the High Representative and the Commis- sion on the impact of climate change on international security. It underlines the importance of this issue, and invites the Council to examine the paper and to submit recommendations on appropriate follow-up action, in particular, on how to intensify cooperation with third countries and regions regarding the impact of climate change on international security by December 2008 at the latest. I.18. 27. The transition to a safe and sustainable low carbon economy will have an impact on numerous policies and on the economic and daily life of citizens. Coherent policies exploiting the synergies relating to energy and climate change are also needed in the other three priority areas of the Lisbon strategy as well as in other EU policy areas, including: \u00a1 developing coherent R & D and innovation policies at the European and national levels; \u00a1 unlocking the business potential of eco-industries and developing a sustainable industrial policy and sus- tainable and globally competitive lead markets, while taking into account the impact of energy and climate change measures on competitiveness; \u00a1 promoting a sustainable transport system which allows Member States, in the framework of EU policies, to take the necessary measures to combat climate change effectively; \u00a1 considering a review of the energy taxation direc- tive to bring it more closely into line with the EU\u2019s energy and climate change objectives; \u00a1 improving energy and resource efficiency in all sectors; \u00a1 informing the consumer about the efficient use of energy in order to tackle social impacts and opportu- nities of energy and climate change. The European Council also invites the Commission, in bringing forward its legislative proposals on VAT rates, due in the summer of 2008, and working with the Member States, to examine areas where economic instruments, including VAT rates, can have a role to play to increase the use of energy-efficient goods and energy-saving materials. 28. The European Council emphasises the need for sus- tained investment in research and development and an active take-up of new technologies in energy, as out- lined recently in the European strategic energy tech- nology plan put forward by the Commission. 29. The European Council recognises that addressing energy and climate change is also a matter of shaping values and changing citizens\u2019 behaviour. It therefore ",

The European Council endorses the interim report by the Council (Ecofin) on financial market sta- bility. While conditions in the international financial system remain fragile, some adjustments in follow-up to the turmoil have already taken place in financial markets since last autumn as the European Central Bank, national and EU authorities and financial institutions have acted to stabilise the situation. 31. Prompt and full disclosure of exposures to dis- tressed assets and off-balance-sheet vehicles and/or of losses by banks and other financial institutions is essential. Improvements are needed to the prudential framework and the risk management of individual institutions, in an environment of constant financial innovation which has underscored new challenges for crisis prevention and financial supervision at national, EU and global levels. 32. In responding to the turmoil, the European Coun- cil agrees that while primary responsibility is with the private sector, authorities in the EU stand ready to take regulatory and supervisory actions where necessary. Policy action should focus on the four following areas. \u00a1 Enhancing transparency for investors, markets and regulators, in particular on exposure to structured products and off-balance-sheet vehicles. \u00a1 Improving valuation standards, in particular for illiquid assets. \u00a1 Reinforcing the prudential framework and risk man- agement in the financial sector, through reviewing a number of areas of the capital requirements directive (CRD), and the enhancement of the management of liquidity risk. The Council encourages the Commis- sion to proceed with consultations and to put forward its proposal by September 2008 and underlines the importance of striving for an agreement between the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission by April 2009 on the necessary regulatory changes. \u00a1 Improving market functioning and incentive struc- ture, including the role of credit-rating agencies on which the EU stands ready to consider regulatory alter- natives if market participants do not rapidly address these issues. 33. The current turmoil has highlighted the need for further strengthening of the financial stability frame- work, through enhanced prudential supervision and improved tools for financial crisis management. The European Council invites the Council (Ecofin) to swiftly and completely implement the programme of work agreed in autumn 2007; this encompasses further progress in spring 2008 on: \u00a1 financial supervision, where main issues include improvements to and convergence of key supervisory rules and standards; convergence of regulatory/finan- cial reporting, with a view to supervision of cross- border groups; clarification of the relationship between home and host authorities appropriately reflecting their competences and responsibilities, including balanced exchange of information; the role of colleges of super- visors and improvement of the functioning of supervi- sory committees; and consideration of inclusion of an EU dimension in the mandates of national supervisors to facilitate convergence and cooperation; \u00a1 the management of cross-border financial crisis sit- uations, tools and procedures should be enhanced and, as a first step, a new memorandum of understanding on cross-border cooperation between the relevant author- ities is expected to be signed in spring 2008; on the basis of further work by mid-2008, the Council should also scrutinise the functioning of deposit guarantee schemes. 34. In addition, early warning systems at the EU and international levels should be enhanced, including by strengthening the role of the IMF in oversight of macro-financial stability. On financial markets\u2019 stabil- ity issues, the EU should work in close cooperation with its international partners in the relevant fora. 35. The European Council invites the Council to con- tinue to give high priority to these issues in the com- ing months, with a major review of progress in April 2008, and to monitor closely the situation so as to react swiftly to possible adverse developments. The European Council will come back to these issues as appropriate and at the latest in autumn 2008. ",
        "Annexes to the Presidency conclusions Bull. EU 3-2008 17 I.20. 36. The European Council welcomes the Com- mission communication on sovereign wealth funds (SWFs). The European Union is committed to an open global investment environment based on the free move- ment of capital and the effective functioning of global capital markets. SWFs have so far played a very use- ful role as capital and liquidity providers with long- term investment perspective. However, the emergence of new players with a limited transparency regarding their investment strategy and objectives has raised some concerns relating to potential non-commercial practices. The demarcation between SWF and other entities is not always clear cut. The European Council agrees on the need for a common European approach taking into account national prerogatives, in line with the five principles proposed by the Commission, namely: commitment to an open investment environment; sup- port for ongoing work in the IMF and the OECD; use of national and EU instruments if necessary; respect for EC Treaty obligations and international commit- ments; proportionality and transparency. The European Council supports the objective of agreeing at interna- tional level on a voluntary code of conduct for SWFs and defining principles for recipient countries at inter- national level. The EU should aim to give coordinated input to this ongoing debate, and invites the Commis- sion and the Council to continue work along these lines.

Better regulation should be considered a priority by each Council formation in its regula- tory work. To ensure that results are delivered, efforts on the implementation of the simplifica- tion rolling programme and reducing administra- tive burdens should be stepped up and pending \u2018fast track\u2019 legislative proposals should be swiftly adopted ( \u2192 point I.6).

The Council welcomed the second strategic review of the better regula- tion initiatives presented by the Commission. It reiterated that further efforts are necessary to simplify and improve legislation and to reduce unnecessary administrative burden at the EU and national levels. These efforts should deliver legislation that not only cuts unnecessary costs for business and others, but also achieves envi- ronmental objectives more effectively through streamlining procedures for implementation and enforcement bodies. The Council therefore called on the Commission and Member States to increase efforts to consider implementation measures in their impact assessments and to share best prac- tices on implementation and enforcement. It looks forward to upcoming further improvements to the Commission\u2019s impact assessments, in particular in relation to the analysis and quantification of the long-term environmental impact.

In order to produce concrete results in the short term the action programme on reducing administrative burdens in the EU foresees the adoption of immediate measures called \u2018fast track actions\u2019. The policy areas concerned by the fast-track actions are: agriculture, internal market, industrial policy, environment and statistics. Before finalising the list of 2008 fast-track actions, the Commission sought the opinion of the high-level group of independent stakeholders on administra- tive burdens, which was adopted on 26 February. By means of this communication, the Commission asked the Council and the Parliament to urgently develop working methods to speed up the process- ing of fast-track actions. This is necessary to ensure that a significant number of reduction proposals can be taken forward in 2008 and 2009 and is a crucial condition for ensuring that the EU will succeed in reaching its 25% reduction objective by 2012.

Parliament considers that the particular needs and circumstances of women in prison should be taken into account and that measures adapted to their specific needs should be put in place. Particularly, an equal and non-discriminatory access to healthcare, psycho- logical support and social assistance as well as satisfying sanitary conditions must be guaranteed. Pregnant women in prison should be able to receive the required support, information and essentials for a healthy pregnancy and mother- hood. Furthermore, the best interests of children should always be a consideration in decisions on whether to separate them or keep them with an imprisoned parent. The maintenance of family ties is an essential means of preventing repeat offences and facilitating social reintegration and is the right of all prisoners and their children. In consequence, Parliament requested the Com- mission and the Member States to adopt all the necessary measures to remedy the particular situation of women in prison. In particular, it encouraged Member States to invest sufficient resources in modernising and adapting their prison infrastructures. It recommended that alter- native penalties to imprisonment, such as com- munity-based sentences, should be favoured to a greater extent, particularly for mothers, and rec- ommended that the imprisonment of pregnant women and mothers with young children should only be considered as a last resort. In view of the fact that the role of penal institutions should be to aid social and professional reintegration, Parliament considers that mentoring programmes should be drawn up to facilitate the prisoners\u2019 journey towards reintegration. Finally, Parliament repeated its call for the Commission and the Council to adopt a framework decision, on min- imum standards to protect the rights of prisoners, on the basis of Article 6 of the Treaty on Euro- pean Union.

According to the Council, the programme aims to maintain a sound budgetary position throughout the period, planning the continuation of high general government surpluses. The budgetary targets seem plausible. Safeguarding macroeconomic stability and sustaining catching-up in a context of rising external imbalances and high inflation requires the continuation of tight fiscal policies, further improvements in the quality of public spending, including in healthcare, and fiscal institutions and a public sector wage policy that contributes to overall wage moderation in line with productivity gains. The Council invited Bul- garia to: \u00a1 continue avoiding a pro-cyclical fiscal stance with a view to help containing existing external imbalances, notably by fully saving any revenue over-performance and respecting expenditure ceilings; \u00a1 adopt policies to contain inflationary pres- sures, including through prudent public sector wage policy contributing to wage moderation and preserving competitiveness; \u00a1 further strengthen the efficiency of public spending, in particular through full implementa- tion of programme budgeting, reinforced admin- istrative capacity and a reform of the healthcare system.

According to the Council, the programme is consistent with a correction of the excessive deficit in 2008, conditional on continuing expenditure restraint and close monitoring of the fiscal impact of the tax measures in the stabilisation package. Owing to the positive macroeconomic outlook and a probably better-than-expected 2007 budgetary outturn in the programme, there could be ample opportunity to bring the 2008 deficit below the 3% of GDP reference value by a larger margin and to achieve stronger-than-targeted fiscal con- solidation afterwards. The Council considers that the main risks are in the reliance on reductions to public sector employment and relate to the fact that appropriate consolidation measures remain to be spelled out after 2008. The Czech Republic remains at high risk with respect to the sustain- ability of public finances, while first steps have been made on healthcare reform. Therefore, the Council invited the Czech Republic to: \u00a1 exploit the probably better-than-expected 2007 budgetary outcome to bring the 2008 deficit below the 3% of GDP reference value by a larger margin by continuing to exercise expenditure restraint; \u00a1 exploit the high rate of growth in the econ- omy by strengthening the pace of adjustment so as to build a safety margin against breaching the reference value as soon as possible and to achieve the medium-term objective by 2012 at the latest; \u00a1 in view of the projected increase in age-related expenditures, improve the long-term sustainabil- ity of public finances through the necessary pen- sion and healthcare reforms.

The Coun- cil considers that the programme aims at main- taining a sound budgetary position fully respect- ing the medium-term objective throughout the period, while adhering to the long-term objective of fiscal sustainability. Foreseeing high, albeit rapidly declining, surpluses over the programme period, the budgetary targets appear to be on the cautious side, in view of the better-than-expected 2007 outcome and the most recent projections. The Council notes that the risk to long-term sustainability is assessed to be low. For the pres- ent, the most important policy challenge is to address labour shortages and looming cost pres- sures through a mix of structural and macroeco- nomic policies. According to the Council, further measures need to be identified and implemented to stimulate labour supply. Meanwhile, the fiscal stance should be considered carefully so as to avoid pro-cyclicality. Therefore, the Council con- siders that containing public consumption expen- diture growth, as foreseen in the programme, remains of high priority. OJ C 74, 20.3.2008 Estonia 1.7.6.

According to the Council, the programme aims at maintaining a ",
        "Economic and monetary policy 28 Bull. EU 3-2008 sound budgetary position throughout the period. The budgetary targets seem plausible. Macro- economic imbalances that have accumulated in the economy during the years of high growth, notably wage growth exceeding that of produc- tivity, price pressures and high net borrowing vis- \u00e0-vis the rest of the world, are expected to mod- erate only gradually and the deceleration path of the economy is accompanied by downwards risks. Setting a budgetary strategy that aims at over-achieving the medium-term objective is a step forward in addressing these macroeconomic challenges. The Council noted that it would be desirable to maintain a broadly neutral fiscal stance in 2008, as it would support adjustment in the current phase of the cycle when imbalances accumulated during the period of very high growth still persist. The long-term sustainability of pub- lic finances is assessed to be at low risk. The Council invited Estonia to contribute to reducing risks to macroeconomic stability by: \u00a1 aiming for a broadly neutral fiscal stance in 2008 and beyond so as to contribute to an orderly adjustment towards a balanced convergence path; \u00a1 complementing the recommended fiscal stance with appropriate public wage policy and further labour market reforms so as to contain inflationary pressures and sustain rapid produc- tivity growth.

Reference: Council opinion in accordance with Article 5(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/ 97 on the updated stability programme of Ireland, 2006\u201309: OJ C 70, 27.3.2007; Bull. 1/2-2007, point 1.6.8 Commission recommendation: SEC(2008) 221 Adopted by the Council on 4 March. According to the Council, Ireland is facing several macro- economic challenges in its transition to a period of lower economic growth, mainly linked to a return to more sustainable activity in the hous- ing sector. Slowing domestic demand has been accompanied by losses in recent years in export market shares, pointing to price competitiveness challenges. The risks attached to the budgetary projections are broadly neutral in 2008, but from 2009, in the absence of adequate expenditure containment, outcomes could be worse than pro- jected. While the medium-term objective (MTO) would be broadly reached in 2008, keeping to it thereafter might be possible if the margins fore- seen in the programme as contingency provi- sions remain unused. Furthermore, regarding the long-term sustainability of the public finances, while the public debt is low, Ireland is at medium risk because of the projected impact of population ageing on pension expenditure. The Council considers that the challenge for the authorities will be to deal with macroeconomic risks, while at the same time avoiding a deterioration of the fiscal situation. Therefore, it invited Ireland to: \u00a1 keep to the MTO in 2008 and thereafter, by maintaining firm control over expenditures; \u00a1 improve the long-term sustainability of pub- lic finances by implementing further pension reforms, in view of the significant projected increase in age-related expenditure.

Reference: Council opinion in accordance with Article 5(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/ 97 on the updated stability programme of Greece, 2006-09: OJ C 70, 27.3.2007; Bull. 1/2-2007, point 1.6.9 Commission recommendation: SEC(2008) 220 Adopted by the Council on 4 March. According to the Council, the programme envisages speed- ing up the reduction of the still large budget deficit, in a context of strong growth, to achieve a nominal budget balance in 2010, although the medium-term objective (MTO) is not planned to be achieved in structural terms within the programme period. This consolidation, which relies on prompt implementation of the 2008 bud- get and a significant increase in tax revenues throughout the programme horizon, is subject to risks as the underlying macroeconomic scenario ",
        "Economic and monetary policy Bull. EU 3-2008 29 is favourable and the revenue-enhancing meas- ures are not fully spelled out after 2008. Also, the reliance on results from the fight against tax evasion is significant and only partly backed up with reforms in tax collection. It noted that the level of debt which remains among the highest in the euro area, coupled with the projected increase in age-related spending, will negatively affect the long-term sustainability of public finances, which remains at high risk. The Coun- cil invited Greece to: \u00a1 carry out the envisaged adjustment towards the MTO, reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio accord- ingly, and use any budgetary over-performance to speed up the consolidation process to reach the MTO within the programme period; \u00a1 pursue the ongoing reforms of tax adminis- tration and continue improving the budgetary process by increasing its transparency, spelling out the budgetary strategy within a longer time perspective and effectively implementing mech- anisms to monitor, control and improve the effi- ciency of primary expenditure; \u00a1 in view of the level of debt and the projected increase in age-related expenditure, improve the long-term sustainability of public finances by achieving the MTO, continuing the ongoing reforms in the healthcare system and reforming the pension system; updated long-term projections for age-related expenditure should be produced as soon as possible.

The Coun- cil considers that the medium-term budgetary position is sound with high general government surpluses above the medium-term objective and a relatively low-debt ratio. However, given favourable economic growth assumptions and the end of the housing boom, the projected govern- ment revenue might turn out to be on the high side. In this context, a careful assessment of the impact on the general government balance of per- manent tax cuts and/or expenditure increases will be crucial to maintain a strong budgetary posi- tion and to ensure the long-term sustainability of public finances, which is at medium risk. The Council noted that fostering productivity enhancing expenditure items, such as R & D, infrastructure and education, is important to underpin a smooth adjustment of the economy in the light of large external imbalances, the contraction of the hous- ing sector and the existing inflation differential with the euro area. While maintaining a strong budgetary position, the Council invited Spain to further improve the long-term sustainability of public finances with additional measures to contain the future impact of ageing on spending programmes. It also invited it to improve com- pliance with the submission deadline for stability and convergence programmes specified in the code of conduct. OJ C 75, 26.3.2008 Cyprus 1.7.10.

According to the Council, the budgetary strategy in the pro- gramme should be sufficient to maintain a sound budgetary position and macroeconomic stability throughout the period. The budgetary targets, which are significantly better than in the previous programme, could be surpassed in 2008 and 2009 given the better-than-expected 2007 results. Thereafter, they could be worse, given the opti- mistic growth assumptions. Although the planned reduction in the budgetary surplus compared with ",
        "Economic and monetary policy 30 Bull. EU 3-2008 2007 reflects to a large extent an expected nor- malisation of tax revenues, there is a risk that the stance in 2008 may turn out to be pro-cyclical. The level of debt is projected to decline signifi- cantly, especially in 2008. Given the projected increase in age-related spending, the reform of the pension system and a timely implementation of adopted reforms in healthcare, would have a positive effect on the long-term sustainability of public finances, which appears to be at high risk. The Council invited Cyprus to: \u00a1 avoid pro-cyclical fiscal policies by better controlling current expenditures, while using revenue windfalls to further reduce debt; \u00a1 contain public expenditure, notably by reform- ing the pension system and timely implementing the adopted reforms in healthcare in order to improve the long-term sustainability of the pub- lic finances.

According to the Council, the programme aims to reduce economic imbalances and excessive demand pressure by setting a slightly increasing but over- all modest surplus target for 2008\u201310, in excess of the medium-term objective. However, the risks to the achievement of the budgetary targets are high primarily due to large macroeconomic uncer- tainty and a track record of slippages from expen- diture plans. Moreover, a considerably tighter stance of fiscal policy is urgently needed to meet the programme\u2019s aims in a context of an economy subject to risks to stability stemming from infla- tionary pressures, deteriorating cost competitive- ness and sharply increasing net foreign liabili- ties. As regards the long-term sustainability of public finances Latvia is assessed to be at low risk. The Council invited Latvia to contribute to reducing overheating pressures and risks to macroeconomic instability by: \u00a1 aiming for significantly more ambitious bud- getary targets in 2008 and beyond than foreseen in the programme, notably by fully saving any revenue due to over-performance and respecting the expenditure ceilings; \u00a1 carefully prioritising public expenditure within the overall public sector expenditure lim- its set within the medium-term budget planning framework, and re-examining taxation instruments to avoid demand stimulus in sectors which do not significantly strengthen the economy\u2019s medium- and long-term supply potential; \u00a1 adopting further policies to contain inflation- ary pressures, including through a responsible pub- lic sector wage-setting, thus contributing to the sharp reduction in whole-economy wage growth necessary to break the current cost-price dynamics and arrest rapidly deteriorating competitiveness.

The Coun- cil considers that the programme aims at tackling Lithuania\u2019s macroeconomic imbalances by tight- ening fiscal policy. However, the budgetary tar- gets seem modest in the light of the current high economic growth. The programme only envisages a back-loaded adjustment effort so that the medium- term objective is reached only in 2009. There are risks to the achievement of the budgetary targets as the consolidation is insufficiently backed by announced measures or a binding medium-term framework. The revenue projections are optimistic given the further planned direct tax cuts and a reliance on improved tax collection. A signifi- cantly tighter fiscal policy than foreseen in the ",

As regards the long-term sustainability of public finances Lithuania remains at low risk. The Council invited Lithuania to contribute to reducing overheating pressures by: \u00a1 aiming for significantly better budgetary out- comes in 2008 and thereafter than foreseen in the programme, notably by restraining expenditure growth, saving windfall revenues and reinforcing the binding character of the medium-term expen- diture ceilings; \u00a1 tackling inflationary pressures by promoting wage setting in line with overall productivity gains and adopting structural measures to remove labour market bottlenecks.

Council opinion in accordance with the second paragraph of Article 5 of Council Regula- tion (EC) No 1466/97 on the stability programme of Malta, 2007\u201310. Reference: Council opinion in accordance with Article 9(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/ 97 on the updated convergence programme of Malta, 2006\u201309: OJ C 72, 29.3.2007; Bull. 1/2- 2007, point 1.6.16 Commission recommendation: SEC(2008) 182 Adopted by the Council on 4 March. According to the Council, the stability programme envisages continued progress towards reaching the medium- term objective (MTO), which is planned to be achieved by 2010, brought about by expenditure restraint in a context of sustained economic growth. The reduction of the general government gross debt is planned to proceed at a satisfactory pace and is expected to fall below 60% of the GDP reference value by 2009. However, there are risks that the achievement of the budgetary tar- gets linked to a reliance on volatile tax revenue items in 2008, the envisaged degree of spending restraint, the favourable macroeconomic outlook after 2008 and the lack of information of the underlying measures, in particular as regards the envisaged continued restraint in the public wage bill. These may hinder the achievement of the MTO by the target year 2010. In terms of the long-term sustainability of public finances, Malta is at medium risk. The Council invited Malta to: \u00a1 pursue further fiscal consolidation as envis- aged in the programme so as to reach the MTO by 2010 and ensure that the debt-to-GDP ratio is reduced accordingly, by spelling out the measures supporting the planned consolidation, especially on the expenditure side; \u00a1 enhance the efficiency and flexibility of pub- lic spending, including by accelerating the design and implementation of a comprehensive health- care reform. OJ C 74, 20.3.2008 Austria 1.7.14. Council opinion in accordance with the third paragraph of Article 5 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 on the updated stability pro- gramme of Austria, 2007\u201310. Reference: Council opinion in accordance with Article 5(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/ 97 on the updated stability programme of Austria, 2006\u201310: OJ C 182, 4.8.2007; Bull. 7/8-2007, point 1.6.3 Commission recommendation: SEC(2008) 175 Adopted by the Council on 4 March. The Coun- cil considers that in a context of growth remain- ing close to its potential, the programme envis- ages slow progress towards the medium-term objective (MTO) through a relatively back-loaded adjustment that is based on not fully specified expenditure restraint. There are risks to the achievement of the budgetary targets after 2008 and the MTO might not be reached by the end of the programme period. In terms of long-term sus- tainability of public finances, Austria appears to be at low risk. Therefore, the Council invited Austria to take advantage of the slightly lower- than-targeted deficit outcome in 2007 to strengthen the adjustment effort in 2008 as well as to under- pin the adjustment planned for the two final years of the programme with specific and sufficient measures. In this way, the MTO should be achieved earlier than foreseen, in particular by more rig- orously implementing expenditure restraint and ",

References: Council decision on the existence of an exces- sive deficit in Portugal; Council recommendation to Portugal with a view to bringing the situation of an excessive deficit to an end: Bull. 9-2005, point 1.3.1 Council opinion in accordance with Article 5(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 on the updated stability programme of Portugal, 2006\u201310: OJ C 71, 28.3.2007; Bull. 1/2-2007, point 1.6.19 Commission recommendation: SEC(2008) 178 Adopted by the Council on 4 March. According to the Council, the programme is consistent with a correction of the excessive deficit no later than 2008. The programme aims at further medium- term fiscal consolidation, including the achieve- ment of the medium-term objective (MTO) by 2010, and foresees a declining path for the government debt ratio over the entire programme period. However, achieving these objectives is subject to effective implementation of the measures announced in the programme and may require additional efforts, notably in the light of the risk of lower-than-projected economic growth. Further progress with fiscal consolidation, as planned, could also help to address the external imbalances and improve the prospect of the long- term sustainability of public finances, for which Portugal is considered to be at medium risk, after the significant reform of the pension sys- tem. Finally, envisaged improvements in the qual- ity and efficiency of public expenditure, includ- ing the public administration and the budgetary framework, can have a favourable impact on potential GDP growth and thereby help resume the catching-up process. The Council invited Por- tugal to: \u00a1 implement with determination the fiscal con- solidation envisaged in the programme so as to secure the correction of the excessive deficit; \u00a1 carry out the planned adjustment towards the MTO, backing it up with reinforced measures if necessary; and, in view of the risks to the sustainability of public finances, ensure a rapid reduction in the debt-to-GDP ratio, notably by continuing to allocate any better-than-expected budgetary results to deficit reduction; \u00a1 maintain expenditure moderation in a perma- nent way and enhance the quality of public expen- diture, by pursuing the ongoing reform of public administration and further improving the budget- ary framework as outlined in the programme.

Council opinion in accordance with the third paragraph of Article 5 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 on the updated stability pro- gramme of Slovenia, 2007\u201310. Reference: Council opinion in accordance with Article 5(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/ 97 on the updated stability programme of Slovenia, 2006\u201309: OJ C 70, 27.3.2007; Bull. 1/2-2007, point 1.6.20 Commission recommendation: SEC(2008) 181 Adopted by the Council on 4 March. The Coun- cil considers that Slovenia met its medium-term objective (MTO) in 2007, two years ahead of previous plans, and that the programme aims at respecting the MTO by a growing margin over the programme period. However, for 2008, a slight deterioration of the structural balance is envisaged despite the continuing strong growth prospects. The expansionary stance in 2008 may turn out to be pro-cyclical. A tighter fiscal stance than presently envisaged for 2008 appears also to be warranted given the current strong infla- tionary pressures. The high projected increase in public sector wage settlements is also a concern for the inflation outlook. In spite of the current low debt level, Slovenia is assessed to be at high risk with regard to the long-term sustainability of public finances due to the significant projected budgetary impact of ageing. The Council invited Slovenia: \u00a1 to build on a probably better-than-expected outcome in 2007, aim for stronger budgetary posi- tions in 2008 and beyond than planned in the pro- gramme, thereby avoiding pro-cyclical policies; ",

Furthermore, if the social partners are to take action to integrate young people more effec- tively into the labour market, they will require the cooperation of national, regional and local gov- ernments and of the different civil society play- ers, with a particular focus on the role of youth organisations and of universities as research and science centres.

In this context it is crucial to improve the functioning of the \u2018e-single market\u2019 by put- ting in place cross-border interoperable solu- tions for electronic signature and e-authentication ( \u2192 point I.7).

The purpose of this own- initiative opinion is to spur the EU to face glob- alisation and to take the opportunities arising from it. Europe\u2019s economic success has not been built on protectionism but on the four freedoms on which the original EEC was constructed. According to the Committee, an important part of the challenge of globalisation is the role of the WTO, the ILO and the increasingly interdepend- ent world financial markets, an interdependence which has been underlined by the crisis on stock markets and other financial markets in the second half of 2007. The European single market is not sufficient in itself. The EU needs to trade and develop its relations with the rest of the world. It also needs to remain competitive with benefit to workers, employers and all citizens. The Lis- bon strategy has been developed in order to achieve this and to enable the EU to become a more competitive economy on the world scene. The EU itself needs to ensure that remaining internal barriers are removed. Free movement of goods Veterinary and plant health legislation 1.11.4.

The Commission adopted proposals for the amendment of the VAT directive and the VAT administrative cooperation regula- tion to speed up the collection and exchange of information on intra-Community transactions as from 2010. This will enable the Member States to detect carousel fraud very quickly. The pro- posals follow on from the communication on the improvement of administrative cooperation between Member States to improve the fight against VAT fraud. The Commission proposed to: \u00a1 harmonise and reduce to one month the period which persons liable to VAT have for declaring intra-Community transactions involving the sup- ply of goods or services within the Community and to reduce to one month the period of trans- mission of this information between Member States; \u00a1 collect monthly information on intra-Com- munity purchases of goods or services where the buyer or customer is liable for VAT to make it easier to cross-check the data with that provided by suppliers; \u00a1 simplify the procedures for submitting dec- larations on intra-Community transactions in Member States in which these procedures are abnormally complex, in order to reduce the burden which the procedures may impose on undertakings.

In the EU strategy for growth and jobs, the Commission and the Coun- cil have identified standardisation as a key instru- ment for improvement in order to foster innova- tion. This communication focuses on a greater contribution from standardisation to innovation and competitiveness. It identified the most impor- tant challenges faced, presents concrete objectives for standardisation and the use of standards, and consolidates ongoing efforts and proposed meas- ures to be launched both by relevant stakeholders and by the Commission. Indeed, a stronger role for standardisation in the support of innovation is important for the European effort to address economic, environmental and social challenges. The current standardisation models in Europe and at international level are questioned by chal- lenges such as accelerated market cycles, the con- vergence in technologies and the trend towards global markets. It follows that standardisation must adapt to this changed landscape, while strengthening its role in support of innovation and competitiveness.

Within the EU, medicines are regulated throughout their entire lifetime. Their placing on the market cannot be made without a marketing authorisation: the require- ments are fully harmonised at Community level, through EU legislation. Changes to medicines that are subsequent to their placing on the mar- ket are called \u2018variations\u2019. They are handled according to a Community legislative framework: the \u2018variations regulations\u2019. Today\u2019s paradoxical situation is that the requirements for granting a marketing authorisation are fully harmonised, while the requirements for post-authorisation changes \u2014 variations \u2014 are not. This proposal is of purely legal nature: it consists solely of an amendment to the legal basis of the variations regulations. Therefore, this proposal alone does not achieve the above-mentioned objectives of simplification and harmonisation: it only empow- ers the Commission with the legal competence to do so, by subsequently modifying the scope and content of the variations regulations by the \u2018comi- tology\u2019 procedure to make the rules concerning variations clearer, simpler, more flexible and truly harmonised.

This proposal seeks to amend Council Directive 76/769/EEC by limiting the marketing and use of chemicals. The Committee supported some but not all of the proposals made. It recognised that this is, almost, the last such amendment of Council Directive 76/769/EEC before it is replaced on 1 June 2009 by Regula- tion (EC) 1907/2006 (REACH). However, as with previous amendments, the Committee regretted that unrelated substances and preparations have been brought together in this manner. It clearly sup- ported the European Council\u2019s declaration of 2004 on combating terrorism and the many individual actions that follow from this and it believes that it has a key role to play in this process.

The Committee recalled that the UN has proposed a model for a \u2018globally har- monised system\u2019 (GHS) for the criteria and processes used in the classification, packaging and labelling of chemicals. This is intended to support world trade and to assist less developed economies in their efforts to protect the safety and health of workers and consumers. The Com- mittee strongly supported this aim of global harmonisation, the form and legal basis of the implementing legislation hereby proposed by the Commission and the timetable proposed for implementation by manufacturers and suppliers to coincide with the first major deadline for the registration of \u2018substances\u2019 under Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 (REACH). It also agreed with the Commission\u2019s assessment that, although the changes to the system developed in the EU over the last 40 years are both inevitable and widely supported, the short-term benefits within ",
        "Enterprise Bull. EU 3-2008 49 the EU are likely to be negligible and the costs potentially high. The Committee therefore believes that greater attention should have been paid to these, quite unusual, circumstances in the origi- nal impact assessment. Given the very tight timetable, and the need to contain start-up costs, there is scope for flexibility in the proposal and its immediate application. The Committee noted, with concern, the length of this proposal, in itself and in conjunction with recent proposals such as REACH, the many other pieces of EU legislation with which these both interact, and the ever grow- ing volume of guidance notes now deemed nec- essary. Under this same heading it regretted the absence of key definitions and also noted the twin dangers of over-classification and over-labelling, and of relying on labels as the only sources of information for workers and consumers alike. Finally the Committee noted that there will be a growing need to review the quality of the data used and the decisions made under the different jurisdictions worldwide. ",

The Committee welcomes the decision on setting up the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking. It considers that relaunching the investments in R & D through this approach will favour the establishment of a stable frame of reference for European businesses, making it possible to overcome the current fragmentation of Community financing and to coordinate often too widely dispersed research. The Committee under- lined the importance for the EU of the proposed strategy for investment and coordination of research. However, according to the Committee, in view of the multiplicity of sources of funding, the number of stakeholders and the substantial Community resources involved, the use and ownership of the end products of the research should be better defined, particularly with regard to intellectual property rights and patents. Finally, the Committee feels that it is necessary to carry on with a genuine simplification of procedures, in view of avoiding the inhibitive impact of administrative complexity. ",

Parliament believes that the 2003 CAP reform was a great success in key aspects, as it markedly improved the trans- parency and efficiency of the CAP on the one hand, and the responsibility and market-orienta- tion of farmers on the other hand. This process must thus be continued on the basis of the com- mitment by the Heads of State or Government in December 2002 to maintain the first-pillar agri- cultural funds in full until 2013. In return, Parliament pointed out that the administrative simplification of the CAP and the many EU directives and regulations which have an impact on farmers must be intensified, although this sim- plification must not lead to a renationalisation of the CAP or to a larger cut in the aids received by EU farmers. 1.19.2.

Adopted by the Council on 17 March. The CMO (common market organisation) for flax and hemp, set up by Regulation (EC) No 1673/2000, does not foresee the granting of any aid for the production of short flax fibre and hemp fibre as of marketing year 2008/2009. Regulation (EC) No 1673/2000 will be repealed by Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 (single CMO regulation) with effect from 1 July 2008 which is the start of marketing year 2008/ 2009 for the flax and hemp sector. The amend- ments contained in the proposal therefore concern the single CMO regulation. Therefore, the Coun- cil considers that the current aid scheme should be prolonged for another marketing year and final decisions only be taken as of the following mar- keting year in the framework of the policy reviews to be undertaken under the health check of the common agricultural policy.

New organisation of the Commission will boost the implementation of an EU integrated maritime policy and of the common fisheries. Entry into force on 29 March. The Commission decided on a reorganisation of the Directorate- General in charge of fisheries and maritime affairs which will be known as the Directorate- General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries. The main change involves the setting up of three geographic directorates which will be responsi- ble for managing both the CFP and the new EU integrated maritime policy in Europe\u2019s three main maritime regions (Arctic, Atlantic and outermost regions; Mediterranean and Black Sea; North Sea, Baltic Sea and landlocked countries). These will be complemented by a new directorate in charge of coordination and policy development. The two other directorates (external policy, and resources and legal affairs) will remain largely unchanged. There will be greater focus on Mediter- ranean fisheries and on control in international waters. IP/08/471 Conservation and management of resources Internal aspects 1.20.2. Proposal for a Council regulation open- ing and providing for the administration of autonomous Community tariff quotas on imports of certain fishery products into the Canary Islands.

The exceptional geograph- ical situation of the Canary Islands in relation to the sources of certain fishery products which are essential for domestic consumption entails addi- tional costs for this sector. This proposal for the opening and provision of duty free tariff quotas is in line with Article 299(2) of the EC Treaty providing for specific measures to assist the out- ermost regions. It also corresponds to the Com- mission\u2019s commitment given in its communica- tion on a stronger partnership for the outermost regions to consider the reduction, even elimination, of CCT duties in order to allow the supply of non- agricultural raw materials to promote production in the outermost regions. COM(2008) 129 1.20.3.

The objective of this pro- posal is to provide the rules and conditions for the deduction of the amount of cod catches fished in excess of the quota allocated to Poland for cod in subdivisions 25\u201332 in 2007. According to offi- cial data on catches of cod in subdivisions 25\u201332, in the Baltic Sea, by Polish vessels in 2007 the national quota has been exceeded by 8 000 tonnes. Given the high amount of overfishing and the resulting socioeconomic consequences of its immediate payback in this particular case and the commitment by Poland to develop and implement an action plan to overcome present shortcomings in their national control system and to address the underlying causes of this incident, it is appro- priate to derogate from Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 847/96. In this case specific rules will be adopted for the deduction of the quantities fished in excess. COM(2008) 88 External aspects C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire 1.20.4.

The purpose of this Green Paper is to launch a broad consultation among interested parties on how to improve the trans- parency of debtors\u2019 assets in the EU. There is a risk that problems of cross-border debt recovery may be an obstacle to the free circulation of pay- ment orders within the EU and may impede the proper functioning of the internal market. Late payment and non-payment jeopardise the interests of businesses and consumers alike. This is particularly the case when the creditor and the enforcement authorities have no information about the debtor\u2019s whereabouts or his assets. The Green Paper describes the problems of the current situation and possible solutions. COM(2008) 128 Visas, crossing external borders and internal movement 1.21.3.

It noted that the action plan devotes a great deal of attention to the familiar objectives of improving European cooperation in the field of vocational training.

The overall objective of the European Year is to promote creativity for all as a driver for innovation and as a key factor for the development of personal, occupational, entre- preneurial and social competences through life- long learning. The promotion of creativity and a capacity for innovation will be tailored to all stages of lifelong learning, from early learning through compulsory and post-compulsory edu- cation and training, extending through working life to the post-retirement phase. It will apply to formal, non-formal and informal learning envi- ronments. As in other European Years, measures will include information and promotion campaigns, events and initiatives at European, national, regional and local levels to convey key messages and disseminate information about examples of good practice. The Year will be implemented using existing Community programmes, in par- ticular the lifelong learning programme 2007\u201313 and the culture programme 2007\u201313, and other programmes and initiatives within the priorities set for each instrument for the period including 2009.

Regarding civil protec- tion, the Committee congratulated the Commis- sion for swiftly setting up a European solidar- ity system, which is not only interregional but also international, and has its own resources enabling it to act efficiently both in response to disasters and in rehabilitating affected areas. It considers that improved implementation of national provisions and information on the con- sequences of non-compliance with preventive legislation or on harmful acts by both citizens and the competent authorities could help to alle- viate the effects of natural disasters.

The Committee regretted that the regulation does not apply to international transport movements of less than 3.5 tonnes. It however welcomed that the new defini- tions of \u2018host Member State\u2019, \u2018non-resident haulier\u2019 and \u2018cabotage operations\u2019 are clearer. It considers that the social aspect of access to the international road haulage market warrants closer attention. It is of the opinion that \u2018cabo- tage\u2019 can only be allowed where it follows an international journey and that its monitoring should form part of a national strategy for mon- itoring the implementation of road haulage leg- islation and should be coordinated by the Com- mission. Finally, the Committee is in favour of a legal framework that encourages regulated com- petition and not the complete liberalisation of cabotage. Opening up inland waterway transport 1.24.3.

This communication takes stock of the exploratory talks launched in spring 2007 with the neighbouring countries to make an estimation of their interest and commitment to strengthening the existing transport axes coordi- nation frameworks. The first round demonstrated the neighbouring countries\u2019 keen interest and that of other stakeholders in strengthening the regional cooperation structures and coordination between the broader policy dialogue and the cre- ation of transport axes. In the western Balkan region, the talks have already been successfully concluded and, also on 5 March, the Commission proposed the adoption of negotiating directives aiming to establish a transport community in this region.

The Committee is of the opinion that an integrated approach could speed up the implementation of planned trans-European networks and reduce associated construction costs. It considers that the Commission should put forward proposals to broaden the scope of financial support for integrated approaches. The Committee underlined that this approach can play a very important role by limiting environmental damage and by reducing the number of disputes sparked by conflicts of interest involving the construction and operation of networks. It also considers that fibre-optic networks will have to be used to a greater extent for commercial pur- poses (such as telecommunication services and transmitting information).

The objective of this pro- posal is to facilitate the enforcement of sanctions against drivers who commit an offence in a Mem- ber State other than the one in which their vehi- cle is registered. The main feature of the proposal is the establishment of a system for the exchange of data between the authorities responsible for national databases on vehicle registration docu- ments, which will make it possible to identify the holder of the registration certificate of the vehicle concerned. The proposal also describes the procedures for data exchange and provides a model for the offence notification that will be sent to the holder of the registration certificate. The Commission underlined that this proposal does not interfere with the application of Coun- cil Framework Decision 2005/214/JHA on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to financial penalties (third pillar). The proposed directive applies to the phases before a final sanc- tion has been imposed, whereas the framework decision starts to apply when the offender has not paid the fine and a final decision has been taken obliging him to do so.

The additional recommended provisions concern the definition of criminal offence, the scope of legal persons\u2019 liability and the nature of the penal- ties. The proposed amendments follow the recent ECJ case-law which confirmed that the content of these provisions can be adopted in a first pil- lar instrument (cases C-176/03 and C-440/05).

Parliament stressed that the transport sector must also meet the EU goals of reducing oil consumption and greenhouse gas emissions by at least 20% over the 1990 levels by 2020. It also emphasised that the EU and Mem- ber States need to focus their efforts on the key elements of the system, namely: \u00a1 large congested cities and urban areas; \u00a1 the main European intercity corridors; \u00a1 environmentally sensitive areas (such as the Alpine region and the Baltic Sea). Parliament made proposals in the field of road, rail, air and maritime transport and called on the Commission and Member States to invest more in research to enable more energy-efficient and CO 2 - emission-reducing technologies to be developed.

Parliament recognised that biogas is a vital energy source which contributes to sustainable economic, agricultural and rural development as well as environmental protec- tion. It believes that the use of biogas, especially for heat and electricity production, could signif- icantly contribute to the binding target of 20% renewable energy in overall EU energy con- sumption by 2020. It stressed the consequences for the environment, energy efficiency and sus- tainability. In particular, Parliament called for greater effort to be put into researching and pro- moting new technologies for biogas, particularly into the exploitation of biomass as a biofuel. It also called for a simplified planning permission procedure to be introduced for the construction of biogas installations. Finally, Parliament con- siders it necessary to review EU legislation on biogas. 1.25.5. Visit by Mr Piebalgs, Member of the Com- mission, to Washington, on 4 March ( \u2192 point 1.35.21). ",

Dependency on care is one of life\u2019s risks, the impact of which is difficult for an individual to bear alone and which therefore calls for intergenerational solidarity-based shared responsibility. The form which this responsibility takes must be decided mainly at national or regional level, taking account of different family and tax structures, employment situations, mobility, hous- ing, population density, established traditions and attitudes. As there are similarities in this area in relation to the problems facing the individual ",
        "Health and consumer protection Bull. EU 3-2008 83 Member States as well as issues which transcend national boundaries, it is both right and necessary for the subject to be dealt with by the EU institu- tions. The exchange of experience, through the open method of coordination for example, has a particularly important role to play here, and in some cases legislative measures are also needed. As in the healthcare system, the bulk of the costs of long-term care arise in the last years of a per- son\u2019s life. Since current social security systems (healthcare and pensions systems) were estab- lished, life expectancy has increased considerably. Facing up to the resulting new needs requires tackling difficult questions of intergenerational justice and solidarity, which require appropriate information and educational responses as well as policy measures.

To this end, the EU should be ready to accelerate pre-accession preparations with all countries of the region, provided they meet the necessary conditions. The progress of each country towards the EU is performance-driven, depending on its individual merits and success in establishing a track record of achievements in addressing reform priorities. The purpose of this communication is to reiterate the EU\u2019s commit- ment to the European perspective of the western Balkans and to point the way forward for enhanced progress of the region towards the EU. It sets out new initiatives for promoting people-to-people contacts, covering areas such as visa liberalisation and scholarships, for developing civil society and for enhancing the region\u2019s economic and social development.

The Council noted that Bosnia and Herzegovina has made progress with regard to the stabilisation and association agreement (SAA) and urged Bosnian authorities to make further efforts to ensure swift and effective fulfilment of all the four conditions necessary for signing the SAA. The Council reiterated its full support to Bosnia and Herze- govina\u2019s European perspective. It underlined the importance of regional cooperation in south- eastern Europe and welcomed the successful out- come of the joint meeting of the final regional table of the stability pact for south-eastern Europe and the inaugural meeting of the regional cooper- ation Council (RCC) on 27 February in Sofia, which marked the formal handover from the sta- bility pact to the RCC. The establishment of the RCC is proof of substantial progress in regional cooperation on democratic, economic and security issues. 1.27.11.

Parliament urged the EU Member States that are opposed to a legally bind- ing code to reconsider their position. It believes that the EU\u2019s contribution to an internationally binding arms trade treaty will gain in credibility as soon as its own arms control regime becomes legally binding. Parliament is also convinced that action should be taken, inter alia, to: \u00a1 prevent irresponsible arms transfers by strict application of the code\u2019s criteria to both compa- nies and national armed forces; \u00a1 improve and apply brokering controls, and prevent illegal arms trafficking by air and sea; \u00a1 ensure prompt investigation of recent allega- tions of violations of arms embargos; \u00a1 prevent the selling-off to private brokers of arms collected in the course of ESDP and security system reform operations and other EU initiatives and their subsequent transfer; \u00a1 improve the transparency and quality of data submitted by Member States in the context of the annual report on the code; 1.28.2.

Parliament stressed that development policy is entirely part of the acquis communautaire and recalled the international commitments of the new Member States in this field. It recognised the progress made by the latter in their evolution from aid recipient coun- tries to donor countries and acknowledged the challenges that lie ahead. It called for a division of labour between the Member States with regard to the value-added of each actor\u2019s input and with the objective of working together effectively. Parliament also noted that the links between the private sector and development cooperation constitute a promising new possibility for the new Member States: a more active participation on the part of private enterprises in the procurement of development cooperation projects at EU level could raise awareness of such cooperation. 1.31.2.

Parliament pointed out that people\u2019s understanding of the role of women in post-war societies and of their contributions to post-war reconstruction must go beyond the universalistic narrative of \u2018women\u2019s experience of war\u2019 and that the specificity and diversity of women\u2019s experiences must be acknowledged. It deplored the fact that most development coop- eration instrument country strategy papers refer to gender as a cross-cutting area, without indicating any specific gender-related targets or activities. Parliament thus strongly called for gender-spe- cific targets and activities to be included in future strategies. It stressed the need to not only focus ",

The economy is now booming but the pace of progress towards the introduction of universal suffrage in Hong Kong\u2019s govern- mental institutions remains a cause for concern.

According to the Commit- tee, the review of the EU budget comes in the context of the sensitive ratification period of the Lisbon Treaty and is directly connected to the debate on cohesion and research policy and the CAP \u2018health check\u2019. The Committee stressed that a courageous analysis of the Structural Funds, Cohesion Funds, regional policies etc. needs to be carried out, in order to analyse in particular their impact and effectiveness in the new Member States. The Committee believes that a broad consensus will have to be sought with national parliaments and local and regional authorities and that, above all, priority should be given to the prin- ciple of each Member State\u2019s fiscal capacity, also taking into account the increased scale of spend- ing objectives. The Committee underlined that greater sharing of responsibility between the Commission and Member States in budget imple- mentation is an important element, not least in involving all the economic and social players (as set out in the new Article 274 of the Lisbon Treaty).

The Council considered that the budgetary procedure 2009, the third one ",
        "Budgets 110 Bull. EU 3-2008 within the 2007\u201313 financial framework, will play a pivotal role in the pursuit and development of the EU\u2019s objectives and priorities, as the vast majority of programmes and actions are likely to reach their cruising speed. It emphasised the importance of continuing to strengthen the good collaboration between the two arms of the bud- getary authority and the Commission in 2009. It stressed the necessity of strict compliance with the multiannual financial framework, as revised on 18 December 2007. Expenditure must strictly remain within the limits fixed therein and suffi- cient margins must be maintained under all the ceilings of various headings. The Council urged the Commission to deliver, together with its pre- liminary draft budget, the underlying assumptions on which the figures for each heading or sub- heading are based. It also noted with concern the volume of outstanding commitments and con- sidered that the relation between the level of com- mitment and payment appropriations must be carefully weighed against the absorption capacity. Moreover, the Council noted with satisfaction the constant improvements in the functioning of the Commission\u2019s \u2018budget forecast alert (BFA) sys- tem\u2019, which allows adjustments to the level of the appropriations in a more realistic and rigorous way. While recalling that the objective of the \u2018activity based budgeting\u2019 is to match human and financial resources to political priorities, it pointed out that high-quality activity statements and timely financial information on spending propos- als are crucial for the budget authority to estab- lish, confirm or modify budgetary priorities. As regards some sectoral issues, the Council identified in particular the following elements as crucial in preparing the 2009 budget: \u00a1 concerning competitiveness for growth and employment, the Council attaches the greatest importance to a proper implementation of the var- ious programmes and actions within the ceiling of this sub-heading as revised in 2007; \u00a1 the Council reiterated its encouragement to the Commission to continue its efforts together with the Member States in order to establish a realistic and accurate level of payments for struc- tural policies: \u00a1 as regards citizenship, freedom, security and justice, the Council recalled the importance of allocating sufficient resources to EU immigration policy; \u00a1 the Council drew attention to the constantly growing role of the common foreign and security policy and the need for it to continue to be ade- quately funded; \u00a1 it expected all the institutions to provide in advance all the necessary information for a clear consolidated picture of the administrative expen- diture, thus allowing the budgetary authority to evaluate the situation and take well-founded deci- sion on the allocation and use of resources; \u00a1 it also welcomed the Commission\u2019s commit- ment to include assigned revenue in the BFA. 2008 financial year 1.36.4.

This entails an increase in commitment appropriations of EUR 378 million for sub-head- ing 1b (Cohesion for growth and employment) and of EUR 393.6 million for heading 2 (Preser- vation and management of natural resources); \u00a1 modifications to the establishment plan of the EMEA, following the creation of the \u2018Paediatric Committee\u2019; \u00a1 modifications to the establishment plan of the EMSA to take account of the creation of a ",

Applying Community law, the national court must order the aid recipient to pay interest in respect of the period of unlawfulness. Within the framework of its domestic law, it may, if appropriate, also order the recovery of the unlawful aid, without prejudice to the Member State\u2019s right to re-implement it, subsequently. It may also be required to uphold claims for compen- sation for damage caused by reason of the unlawful nature of the aid. 2) In a procedural situation such as that in the main proceedings, the obligation, arising from the last sen- tence of Article 88(3) EC, to remedy the consequences of the aid\u2019s unlawfulness extends also, for the purposes of calculating the sums to be paid by the recipient, and save for exceptional circumstances, to the period between a decision of the Commission of the Euro- pean Communities declaring the aid to be compatible with the common market and the annulment of that decision by the Community court.

The Member States nevertheless remain free to set reasonable time- limits for seeking remedies, in a manner consistent with the Community principles of effectiveness and equivalence.

However, Community law requires that, when transposing those directives, the Member States take care to rely on an interpretation of them which allows a fair balance to be struck between the various fundamental rights protected by the Community legal order. Further, when implementing the measures transposing those directives, the authorities and courts of the Member States must not only interpret their national law in a manner consistent with those direc- tives but also make sure that they do not rely on an interpretation of them which would be in conflict with those fundamental rights or with the other general principles of Community law, such as the principle of proportionality.

Case C-2/06 Willy Kempter KG v Haupt- zollamt Hamburg-Jonas Institutional affairs The Court clarified certain conditions of its judgment in K\u00fchne & Heitz (C-453/00) of 13 January 2004. In the above judgment the Court had ruled that the principle of cooperation arising from Article 10 EC imposes on an administrative body an obligation to review a final administrative decision, where an appli- cation for such review is made to it, in order to take account of the interpretation of the relevant provision given in the meantime by the Court where: \u00a1 under national law, it has the power to reopen that decision; \u00a1 the administrative decision in question has become final as a result of a judgment of a national court ruling at final instance; \u00a1 that judgment is, in the light of a decision given by the Court subsequent to it, based on a misinterpretation of Community law which was adopted without a ques- tion being referred to the Court for a preliminary rul- ing under [the third paragraph] of Article 234 EC; and \u00a1 the person concerned complained to the adminis- trative body immediately after becoming aware of that decision of the Court. The Finanzgericht Hamburg asked the Court for a pre- liminary ruling on the interpretation of the last two conditions set out by the Court in the abovementioned judgment. In its first question , the Finanzgericht asks whether K\u00fchne & Heitz requires an administrative decision that has become final by virtue of a judgment of a court of final instance to be reviewed and amended only if the claimant relied on Community law in the legal action under domestic law which he brought against that decision. The Court\u2019s ruling is that it is not necessary for the claimant to have relied on Community law in the legal action under domestic law which he brought against that decision. The second question relates to the fourth condition of K\u00fchne & Heitz , namely whether Community law imposes a limit in time for making an application for review of an administrative decision that has become final. The Court\u2019s conclusion is that Community law does not impose any limit in time for making an application for review of an administrative decision that has become final. The Member States nevertheless remain free to set reasonable time limits for seeking remedies, in a manner consistent with the Community principles of effectiveness and equivalence. 1.37.47. Case C-294/06 Ezgi Payir, Burhan Akyuz, Birol Ozturk v Secretary of State for the Home Department Immigration policy This reference for a preliminary ruling concerns the interpretation of Article 6(1) of Decision No 1/80 of the Association Council of 19 September 1980 on the development of the Association (Decision No 1/80). The Association Council was set up by the Agreement establishing an Association between the European Economic Community and Turkey, signed on 12 Sep- tember 1963 by the Republic of Turkey and by the Member States of the EEC and the Community and concluded, approved and confirmed on behalf of the Community by Council Decision 64/732/EEC of 23 December 1963. The Court first refers to the three conditions laid down in Article 6(1) of Decision No 1/80, namely: The first condition concerns the status of worker . It is set- tled case-law that, in order to satisfy that condition, the Turkish national must perform activities which are real and genuine, to the exclusion of activities which are on such a small scale as to be regarded as purely marginal and ancillary. The essential feature of an employment rela- tionship is that, for a certain period of time, a person per- forms services for and under the direction of another per- son, in return for which he receives remuneration. The second condition concerns the concept of being duly registered as belonging to the labour force . The Court has held that this concept embraces all workers who have met the conditions laid down by law or regulation in the host Member State and who are thus entitled to pursue an occupation in its territory. The third condition is that of legal employment , that is to say, a stable and secure situation as a member of the ",
        "Decisions by the Court of Justice and other Courts 118 Bull. EU 3-2008 labour force of the host Member State and, by virtue of that situation, an undisputed right of residence. After finding that the three Turkish nationals satisfied the three conditions, the Court then considered the question of whether the au pair or student status, with activities that otherwise satisfy the three above condi- tions, precludes these Turkish nationals from the status of workers and from being duly registered as belonging to the labour force of a Member State, within the meaning of that provision. The Court\u2019s ruling is as follows: the fact that a Turk- ish national was granted leave to enter the territory of a Member State as an au pair or as a student cannot deprive him of the status of \u2018worker\u2019 and prevent him from being regarded as \u2018duly registered as belonging to the labour force\u2019 of that Member State within the meaning of Article 6(1) of Decision No 1/80 of the Asso- ciation Council of 19 September 1980 on the develop- ment of the Association. Accordingly, that fact cannot prevent that national from being able to rely on that provision for the purposes of obtaining renewed per- mission to work and a corollary right of residence. 1.37.48. Case C-274/06 Commission v Spain Internal market and freedom of movement This action was brought against the Spanish law that limits the voting rights of shares held by public bodies in Spanish undertakings operating in the energy sector. The Court first referred to its established case-law defining \u2018capital movements\u2019 in the context of free movement of capital under Article 56 EC. The Court points out that any national measures that may prevent or limit the acquisition of shares in the undertakings concerned or which may deter investors in other Member States from investing in their capital must be considered to be \u2018restrictions\u2019within the mean- ing of Article 56(1) CE. Concerning the Spanish law, it notes that while the supplementary provision (DA 27) does not strictly speaking place any limits on the acquisition of shareholdings, it does have the effect of preventing or restricting the exercise of the voting rights of the shares held. The Court accordingly finds that regardless of the objective of DA 27, it may deter public bodies estab- lished in other Member States from acquiring shares in Spanish undertakings operating in the energy sector and is therefore a restriction on the free movement of capital within the meaning of Article 56(1) EC. 1.37.49. Case C-132/05 Commission v Germany In this action for failure to fulfil its obligations, the Com- mission argued that Germany had not taken appropriate measures to proceed against the use, on its territory, of the name \u2018Parmesan\u2019 on the labelling of products which do not comply with the requirements of the specification for the protected designation of origin (PDO) \u2018Parmigiano Reggiano\u2019. One point noted by the Court is that various factors are such as to bring to the mind of the consumer the cheese protected by the PDO \u2018Parmigiano Reggiano\u2019, when he is confronted by a hard cheese, grated or intended to be grated, bearing the name \u2018Parmesan\u2019. But it did not find that there was an obligation on the Member State to take on its own initiative the measures required to protect the specification of the PDO. 1.37.50. Case C-275/06 Productores de M\u00fasica de Espa\u00f1a (Promusicae) v Telef\u00f3nica de Espa\u00f1a SAU The Court found that the directives concerned by this case (Directives 2000/31/EC of the European Parlia- ment and of the Council of 8 June 2000 on certain legal aspects of information society services, in particular electronic commerce, in the Internal Market (\u2018Directive on electronic commerce\u2019), 2001/29/EC of the Euro- pean Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society, 2004/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement of intellectual property rights and 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications), do not require the Member States in a situation such as that of the main proceedings, to lay down, in order to ensure effective protection of copyright, an obligation to communicate personal data in the context of civil proceedings. How- ever, Community law does require that Member States must, when transposing these directives, rely on an interpretation of the directives which allows a fair bal- ance to be struck between the various fundamental rights protected by the Community legal order. Further, when implementing the measures transposing those directives, the authorities and courts of the Member States must not only interpret their national law in a manner consistent with the directives but also make sure that they do not rely on an interpretation of them which would be in conflict with those fundamental rights or with the other general principles of Commu- nity law, such as the principle of proportionality. 1.37.51. Case C-506/06 Sabine Mayr v B\u00e4ckerei und Konditorei Gerhard Fl\u00f6ckner OHG Social policy The main proceedings were brought by Ms Mayr against her former employer following her dismissal. ",
        "Decisions by the Court of Justice and other Courts Bull. EU 3-2008 119 In the course of attempted in vitro fertilisation (mean- ing fertilisation of an ovum outside a woman\u2019s body), a follicular puncture was carried out on Ms Mayr on 8 March 2005. Her general practitioner certified her sick from 8 to 13 March 2005. The transfer of the fertilised ova into her uterus was planned for 13 March 2005. Meanwhile, on 10 March, Ms Mayr was dis- missed with effect from 26 March 2005. At the date Ms Mayr was given notice of her dismissal, on 10 March 2005, the ova taken from her had already been fertilised with her partner\u2019s sperm cells and, there- fore, in vitro fertilised ova already existed on that date. Ms Mayr challenged her dismissal on the grounds that when she was given notice, she was entitled to protec- tion against dismissal by reason of her pregnancy. The Court found that Council Directive 92/85/EEC of 19 October 1992 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding (OJ L 348, 1992), and in particular the prohibition on the dismissal of pregnant workers in point 1 of Article 10, does not concern a worker undergoing in vitro fertilisation where, on the date on which notice of dismissal is given, the woman\u2019s ova had already been fertilised by the partner\u2019s sperm, with the result that fertilised ova exist in vitro , but they have not yet been transferred to the woman\u2019s uterus. While finding that Directive 92/85 does not apply in this case, the Court points out that in accordance with its case-law, the Court may deem it necessary to consider provisions of Community law to which the national court has not referred in its question. The Court accordingly considered whether a woman in this situation could rely on the protection against discrimination on the grounds of sex provided by Directive 76/207. The Court has already ruled that dis- missal of a female worker on account of pregnancy, or for a reason essentially based on that state, affects only women and therefore constitutes direct discrimination on the grounds of sex. The Court thus concludes that Council Directive 76/207/EEC of 9 February 1976 on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working condi- tions precludes the dismissal of a female worker who, in circumstances such as those in the main proceedings, is at an advanced stage of in vitro fertilisation treat- ment, that is, between the follicular puncture and the immediate transfer of the in vitro fertilised ova into the uterus, inasmuch as it is established that the dismissal is essentially based on the fact that the woman has undergone such treatment. 1.37.52. Case C-199/06 Centre d\u2019exportation du livre fran\u00e7ais (CELF), Ministre de la Culture et de la Communication v Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 internationale de diffusion et d\u2019\u00e9dition (SIDE) Competition and State aid The question in this case was about how to deal with aid that was illegal because it was not notified but was subsequently declared compatible with the common market. The Court found that the last sentence of Article 88(3) EC is to be interpreted as meaning that the national court is not bound to order the recovery of aid imple- mented contrary to that provision, where the Com- mission has adopted a final decision declaring that aid to be compatible with the common market, within the meaning of Article 87 EC. Applying Community law, the national court must order the aid recipient to pay interest in respect of the period of unlawfulness. Within the framework of its domestic law, it may, if appropriate, also order the recovery of the unlawful aid, without prejudice to the Member State\u2019s right to re-implement it subsequently. It may also be required to uphold claims for compensation for damage caused by reason of the unlawful nature of the aid. In addition, in a procedural situation such as that in the main proceedings, the obligation, arising from the last sentence of Article 88(3) EC, to remedy the conse- quences of the aid\u2019s unlawfulness extends also, for the purposes of calculating the sums to be paid by the recipient, and save for exceptional circumstances, to the period between a Commission decision declaring the aid to be compatible with the common market and the annulment of that decision by the Community court. 1.37.53. Case C-196/07 Commission v Spain In this case concerning E.On/Endesa, the Court found that by not withdrawing, within the periods prescribed conditions 1 to 6, 8 and 17 imposed by the decision of the National Energy Committee, which were declared incompatible with Community law by Article 1 of the Commission Decision of 26 September 2006, and con- ditions 1, 10, 11 and 15, as amended, imposed by deci- sion of the Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Trade, which were declared incompatible with Community law by Article 1 of the Commission Decision of 20 December 2006, Spain has failed to fulfil its obliga- tions under Article 2 of each of those decisions.

        "120 Bull. EU 3-2008 38. Community Institutions European Parliament Strasbourg, 10\u201313 March 1.38.1. The Parliament held a key debate in prepa- ration of the spring European Council on the new cycle of the renewed Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs (2008\u201310), with the participation of Mr Lenar c i c , the Slovenian Secretary of State, and Mr Barroso, President of the Commission. Both Mr Lenar c i c and Mr Barroso conveyed a strong message that the Lisbon strategy was working well and that it should be forcefully con- tinued, whilst strengthening its social dimension. More specifically, Mr Lenar c i c hoped that the legislative measures on climate change and energy would be adopted before the parliamentary elec- tions in 2009. President Barroso noted that even if the text on the broad economic policy guidelines was left unchanged, the points raised by Parliament were already included in the Commission\u2019s policy. Moreover he argued in favour of the adoption of a \u2018post-Kyoto\u2019 agreement and for the adoption of a genuine European energy market. The ensuing lengthy debate showed that, despite sometimes quite divergent opinions, an over- whelming majority of Members of Parliament sup- ported a continuous pursuit of the Lisbon strategy and other measures considered. It should be noted, however, that at the end of the debate, Mr Schulz (PES/DE) strongly expressed the view that leaving the orientations of Lisbon unchanged would cause unacceptable social injustice and consequently called for their revision. His stance was, however, not followed by other group leaders. Another key debate concerned the Commission\u2019s annual policy strategy (APS) 2009. President Barroso\u2019s statement was generally welcomed by the major political groups, with the Group of the European People\u2019s Party and European Democrats (EPP-ED), the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) and the Union for Europe of the Nations Group (UEN) fully supporting the Commission, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament (PSE) calling for a clear focus on social and ecological elements, and the Greens considering that the Commission was too cautious as regards environmental stan- dards. Other important topics discussed during the ses- sion included the negotiations on bilateral agree- ments between the US and some Member States with regard to visas and PNR, sustainable trans- port policy, the setting up of a Global Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Fund and the CAP Health Check. In the context of the latter debate some Irish MEPs led by Ms McGuinness (PPE-DE) raised some concerns related to the impact of the ongoing WTO negotiations on the Irish referendum to be held on the Treaty of Lis- bon. In the field of external policy, topical debates took place concerning the situation in Gaza and in Chad as well as on the EU\u2019s role in Iraq. By means of an oral question the issue of Euro- pean supervision of financial markets was also in the limelight. This discussion was particularly rel- evant in the light of the recent financial turmoil and with regard to the experience gained with the current system of cooperation between national supervisors under the \u2018Lamfalussy procedure\u2019. Parliament also held a formal session to celebrate 50 years of the European Parliament. This cere- monial session was carried out in the presence of presidents P\u00f6ttering, Jan s a and Barroso, with a European youth orchestra providing music. Mr P\u00f6ttering recalled landmarks in the history of Parliament, such as Parliament\u2019s role in budget- ary affairs since 1971, the 1986 Single European Act and the advent of co-decision. He applauded the representation of European values and the \u2018unwritten rules of European co-existence\u2019. The President in office of the Council completed this speech with reflections on the reunification of Eastern and Western Europe, the single market, and the Euro. He looked forward to the projection ",
        "Council Bull. EU 3-2008 121 of European ideals, including environmental val- ues, on the world stage. Mr Barroso also warned against any \u2018arrogance\u2019 of a strong Europe and emphasised the key role played by inter-institu- tional cooperation. Another formal session was organised with the participation of the President of Estonia, Mr Ilves, who is a former Member of the European Parliament. In the legislative field, Parliament carried out a successful third reading by endorsing the joint text previously approved by the Conciliation Committee on common rules in the field of civil aviation safety. Moreover, by approving the Council\u2019s common position without amendments, Parliament confirmed a second reading agree- ment on the European Institute for Innovation and Technology (EIT). The only amendment sub- mitted (by the Greens) called for the rejection of the common position due to the lack of proper funding but it was largely defeated. Furthermore, the amendment (in consultation procedure) of Council\u2019s single regulation on the common organisation of agricultural markets, as regards specifically national milk quotas, gave rise to some divergence since the compromise amend- ments strongly defended by the Rapporteur (Ms Jeggle \u2014 PPE-DE/DE) could not be sup- ported by the Commission. Parliament also deplored the fact that the Council could not achieve a common position on a binding code of conduct on arms export. It should be also noted that Parliament decided to create a specific budget line for administrative expenditure for Galileo (through the adoption of Amending Budget No 1/2008) but at the same time it adopted an amendment which stipulates that as long as the outcome of the legislative procedure concerning Galileo was not clear, no money should be actually spent on the newly cre- ated budget line. Brussels, extraordinary plenary session, 26 March 1.38.2. This extraordinary session was mainly dedicated to the results of the European Council meeting of 13\u201314 March 2008. Slovenian Prime Minister Jansa and Commission President Bar- roso briefed Members on the outcome of the summit, insisting on the positive impacts of the reforms undertaken and underlining the social dimension of the Lisbon strategy. President Bar- roso noted in particular that the summit had brought more clarity on the tasks ahead which include as key goals the completion of the inter- nal energy market and the adoption of the climate change and renewable energy package before the end of the 6th legislature. As in previous debates, Members broadly supported the continuation of the Lisbon strategy and other envisaged measures. An extraordinary point was also added to the agenda: the situation in Tibet, in view of the recent violence and unrest. Members called on China to end human rights violations and a major- ity believed that as a form of protest EU politicians should not attend the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games. The debate was preceded by a strong statement of President P\u00f6ttering, which was not fully \u2018endorsed\u2019by all Members, with most notably Mr Schulz (PSE/DE) not applauding the President\u2019s speech. Finally, this mini-session gave the opportunity to Mr Bonde (DK), co-president of the IND/DEM Group and one of the longest-serving MEPs in the House (first elected in 1979), to announce his retirement from the European Parliament.

Council: Mr Solana, Secretary-General/High Representative for the CFSP. The Council discussed the state of play in the WTO Doha Development Agenda negotiations, in view of possible WTO ministerial discussions in Geneva. It reconfirmed the importance of achieving a comprehensive, ambitious and balanced final outcome within and across all of the areas of the Doha Development Agenda, as regards agricul- ture and non-agricultural market access but also including services, rules, trade facilitation and geographical indications. It also reconfirmed its commitment to a success- ful result, meeting the main objectives of the EU and the needs and interests of developing countries, in particular less developed countries. To that end, the Council urged WTO partners to make meaningful contributions to the negotiations, commensurate with their level of development. For emerging economies this requires granting additional market access, concerning industrial tariffs in particular. In this context, the Council expressed its support to the Commission in seek- ing further improvements of the Presidency\u2019s negotiating texts, that are needed to bring the negotiations forward, alongside further progress on the whole of the single undertaking, including services and geographical indications.

EU 3-2008 123 The Council expressed continued concern about the humanitarian, political and economic situa- tion in Zimbabwe and conditions on the field, which may endanger the holding of free and fair parliamentary and presidential elections on 29 March. It noted that no formal invitation has been made to the EU to send an official electoral observation mission. It urged the government of Zimbabwe to ensure that the forthcoming elec- tions meet international norms and standards. In the context of its general affairs session, the Council: \u00a1 took note of the fact that the parliamentary and provincial elections in Pakistan on 18 Febru- ary were competitive. The elections were an important step in the democratic development of Pakistan. The Council reaffirmed the EU\u2019s com- mitment to supporting Pakistan in building a prosperous and stable society based on the prin- ciples of democracy, the rule of law and human rights; \u00a1 reaffirmed the EU\u2019s commitment to long- term support for the people and government of Afghanistan and supported the approach taken towards an international conference to be held in Paris in June to review progress in implementa- tion of the Afghanistan Compact and reaffirm the international community\u2019s commitment to the country. The Council also welcomed the progress of the EU police mission in Afghanistan towards full deployment at central, regional and provincial level by the end of March and expressed its readi- ness to consider further enhancement of EU engagement, particularly in the field of police and more generally the rule of law. 2860th meeting 1.38.7.

EU 3-2008 Within the European Union: 1.822 billion euros The EIB granted the following loans in support of Community policies: \u00a1 EUR 624 million for the economic develop- ment of disadvantaged regions; \u00a1 EUR 497 million for environmental protec- tion and improvement of the quality of life; \u00a1 EUR 381 million for the improvement of transport and of telecommunications infrastructure of benefit to the Community; \u00a1 EUR 300 million for the energy sector; \u00a1 EUR 91 million for the i2i programme; \u00a1 EUR 20 million for investment in human capital. Moreover, the EIB continued its action for the SMEs by the partner bank network, on the current global loans. Often, the EIB\u2019S loans respond simultaneously to several Community policies; the above head- ings are not therefore cumulable.

European Economic and Social Committee 443rd plenary session 1.38.12. The European Economic and Social Com- mittee held its 443rd plenary session, on 12 and 13 March, chaired by Mr Dimitriadis, President. The session was marked by the presence of Mr Barnier, French Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries. He relaunched his proposal for the creation of a European civil protection force and was pleased with the adoption of the Commis- sion communication aiming at reinforcing the EU\u2019s capacities to provide civil protection and humanitarian aid on its territory. The EU plans to transform the current follow-up and training mechanism into a genuine operational centre. Therefore it is essential to promote a culture of European common security; the creation of a training institute managing a national expertise network is also desirable. Moreover, according to the speaker, given that the collaboration at European level has to be done on a voluntary basis, a genuine partnership between Member States who would share their expertise and the EU who would provide capacity for financing must be aimed at. The future treaty pro- vides two important tools which will make it pos- sible to progress towards the ideal of citizens Europe of solidarity: the shared competence in the field of civil protection and the solidarity clause. Some advisers recalled the conflict of jurisdic- tion at the national and European levels, the lack of supranational collaboration in the field of com- pensation to disaster victims, the relation between ",
        "European Economic and Social Committee 126 Bull. EU 3-2008 civil protection and criminal law and the narrow- ness of the criteria of eligibility for the Solidarity Fund. The possibility of transferring some CAP resources towards prevention measures (epizooties) was put forward. Mr Barnier pointed out that preventing was less expensive than remedying and that Member States therefore had to be encouraged to carry out a prevention policy. Opinions on the improvement of the Community civil protection mechanism were approved. They conform to the Committee\u2019s reactions that followed the serious fires that struck Greece in August 2007. At that time the Committee had dis- cussed the need to allocate sufficient resources to the European civil protection mechanism in order to ensure coordinated interventions when natural disasters occur inside or outside the European borders. The Committee adopted a draft own-initiative opinion on the budget review so as to take part in the reflection put forward by the Commission on the matter. Ms Florio (IT) considered that any debate on resources required a review of the EU\u2019s priorities. She evoked the need to \u2018bravely\u2019 ques- tion the relevance of the \u2018first generation\u2019 policies in light of the new challenges to be taken into account (such as economic and social cohesion, climate change and immigration). She stressed the need to seriously address the current exceptions and reductions which are no longer needed; more- over, in light of the Lisbon Treaty and referring to Parliament\u2019s Lamassoure report, she considered that the EU budget should be based on a system of new forms of own resources. Nonetheless, during the discussion only the issue regarding the justification of the \u2018British cheque\u2019 held the attention. The speakers of the group of employees constituted a united front stating that both the aim of European integration and the response to the current challenges argue for an increase of available Community means; conse- quently, rebates and other exemptions are no longer justified nor sustainable. The Committee approved an own-initiative opinion on the sanctions against employers of third coun- try nationals residing without authorisation. Sev- eral amendments were introduced by members of the employer\u2019s group to take into account difficul- ties encountered by enterprises, in particular the SMEs, in verifying their workers\u2019 statutes. On the other hand, the group of the workers called for strong measures to be taken against enterprises that do not respect the legislation, in order to combat the exploitation of illegal workers more efficiently. The opinion on the exhibition of workers to the risks due to the physical agents gave rise to abun- dant editorial amendments. As regards the content, the Committee considered that a simple extension of the period allowed for the transposition of Directive 2004/40/EC will not solve the problems in the practical application of the provisions. The exploratory opinion on the role of social part- ners in the improvement of the situation of young people on the labour market was requested by the Slovenian presidency that realises Europe has to invest in its future and that more emphasis must be put on young people and on their place in enterprises. In this context, the Slovenian pres- idency will organise a conference entitled \u2018young people on the labour market\u2019 in March 2008 and called on the Committee to present its opinion in the conference. The opinion on access to the transport of goods by road was the subject of lively discussions between members of the former EU-15 and the 12 mem- bers that joined the EU in 2004 and 2007. The lat- ter wished to withdraw the following mention in the opinion: \u2018the new Member States are the sin- gle source of negative social aspects of cabotage\u2019. Several opinions were adopted without debate: on the Commission communication for a \u2018Europe of results \u2014 applying Community law\u2019; and on the own-initiative opinion \u2018future of the single market \u2014 destination: the world\u2019. Other opinions were also approved: on the trans-European networks \u2018Towards an integrated approach\u2019; on new airport management for CO 2 reduction; on education and adult training; and the exploratory opinion requested by the Sloven- ian Presidency on the topic of \u2018guaranteeing access to long-term care\u2019. The Committee approved the amendment of Arti- cle 72 of its rules of procedure, which concerns the conditions of the Secretary-General\u2019s nomi- nation, while extending the possibility of being designated to this position to agents other than officials (i.e. temporary and auxiliary).
