Mrs Simons, Mr Marin (Commission) 26 Mr Langer 28 Adjournment of the session 28 IN THE CHAIR: MR KLEPSCH President (The sitting was opened at 4 p.m.) I. Resumption of the session PRESIDENT. - The sitting is opened. I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament which was adjourned on Friday, 17 September 1993. Ladies and gentlemen, this additional part-session today in our new Chamber is a great event in the life of the European Parliament. Maastricht is due to enter into force shortly. As a result the Community will become more democratic and relevant to its citizens provided that we as a Parliament make full use of our powers. This Treaty will lend the European Parliament far greater weight in the decision-making process within the Euro pean Community. Alongside the Council of Ministers our Parliament will become an equal partner in the legislative process. This means that we must adjust our rhythm of work to the progress of deliberations in the Council and Commission. The deadlines set out in the Treaty make this necessary if we are to exert our influence to the full. The deadlines have become shorter. Additional part-sessions will be needed as a result. With this new Chamber we now have an opportunity, by holding additional part-sessions, to make a greater impact on the European public. The sittings today and tomorrow are certainly a premi\u00e8re but they are not the first plenary sittings of the European Parliament in Brussels because, as I am sure you will remember, these took place from 26-28 April 1983 in the Palais des Congr\u00e8s. Our sitting today, on the other hand, is taking place in an entirely new Chamber which was designed for the enlarged Community of the future. I should like to thank all those who were involved in the planning and construc tion of this new building. (Applause) I am sure that some technical teething problems are inevitable. I would ask you to exercise patience and I know that all the services concerned have done their utmost to ensure that the technical services function as smoothly as possible. Moving house is always something of an adventure in private life. So we are all the more concerned to see how this sitting will develop and we all hope for the best. Let us help each other to ensure that this first plenary sitting in Brussels sets the stage for greater relevance to the citizens and democracy in Europe. (Applause) ",
        "No 3-435/2 Debates of the European Parliament 29. 9. 93 2. Approval of the Minutes PRESIDENT. - The Minutes of the sitting of Friday, 17 September 1993 have been distributed. Are there any comments? BLOT (DR). - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should simply like to refer to the Rules of Procedure to say that this first mini-session in Brussels does not seem to me compatible with the spirit of the Edinburgh agreement fixing Strasbourg as the definitive seat for the work of the European Parliament, in particular plenary sittings. We are not taken in by this manoeuvre in favour of Brussels and our Group formally and totally denounces it. It is contrary to all agreements made at government level. PRESIDENT. - The point is noted but I am not going to allow a debate on the seat of Parliament to develop. PRAG (PPE). - Mr President, regarding the Minutes of Friday, 17 September. If the voting is checked I think it will be seen that I was present. As far as I can remember I also signed in though I sometimes do forget. PRESIDENT. - Thank you, Mr Prag, this will be checked and, if necessary, rectified. HINDLEY (PSE). - Mr President, could I continue what I hope is a new tradition by raising a point of order on the accuracy of the Minutes. I will not go into detail but there was some confusion about the vote on the resolutions on Japan. I do not expect us to disentangle that now but may I point out that there is a discrepancy between what Members recall happening and what is recorded in the Minutes. Briefly, a Socialist resolution, which clearly obtained a majority, is in the Minutes as having been rejected. I would ask the services to correct that and, if it is not craving too much of your indulgence, not to ratify the Minutes until that correction has been made. PRESIDENT. - Mr Hindley, the Minutes record precise ly what happened in the Chamber, i.e. the motion for resolution from the Committee on External Economic Relations and the motion for resolution from the Group of the European People's Party were adopted. The motion for resolution tabled by the Group of the European Democratic Alliance was rejected. Under our Rules the President then declared the resolution from the Group of the Party of European Socialists to have fallen. I have looked into this and established that the motions for resolutions certainly did not rule each other out. I therefore believe it would be possible to hold a vote on the motion for resolution tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists, No 1239/93. Should this be the wish of the House, I will include this in voting time tomorrow. ELLIOTT (PSE). - Mr President, I would like first of all to support very strongly indeed your congratulations to all those responsible for getting this magnificent meeting chamber in order at this time. I intend to respect, of course, your ruling and will therefore make no comment on the question of the seat of Parliament. But in the light of your ruling I think it was very unfortunate that the remarks by Mr Blot were made without any response to them being given. I hope that we will not allow one-sided comments of that kind to be made in future without any proper reply. VAN OUTRIVE (PSE). - (NL) Mr President, I asked in July whether there was yet an answer from the Danish Presidency about the fact that at one time there had been a refusal to send the draft agreement on Europol to the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs. Mr President, I have still not had any answer from you on this. PRESIDENT. - We have not received an answer yet. IMBENI (PSE). - (IT) Mr President, I saw Mr Wijsen- beek come into the Chamber and start to smoke his pipe. Perhaps he did it to show that there are no notices forbidding smoking in the h\u00e9micycle. But it seems to me that the Rules of Procedure should be observed. A second question which has nothing to do with the Rules: I wish the sound of the President's microphone could be adjusted to that of the interpreters' microphones. In fact there is such an explosion of volume that we risk having burst eardrums by the end of the day! PRESIDENT. - The technicians are already working to resolve this problem. BELO (PSE). - (PT) Mr President, I would like to ask the Enlarged Bureau how Members who are in their offices can find out about the progress of the debate in the h\u00e9micycle. Is there any sort of phone link that we can use to find out about the progress of the debate? PRESIDENT. - This can be established just as in Strasbourg, Mrs Belo. MOORHOUSE (PPE). - Mr President, on the point of order raised by Mr Hindley. Speaking on behalf of the REX Committee in the last plenary session, I was more than willing to accept the Socialist Group's motion for a resolution at the time. Therefore I am glad that we have decided to vote in favour of it tomorrow morning. PRESIDENT. - The vote on this takes place tomorrow morning. GAIBISSO (PPE). - (IT) Mr President, I much appre ciated what you said in opening the sitting, above all about being closer to the citizens. I am in no doubt about that, knowing your personal honesty, your profound cultural honesty. I am sure, Mr President, that you will take a more appropriate occasion to hold a press confer ence and tell the citizens of Europe in detail what the cost of putting up all these buildings has been, so that they too may have the opportunity to be proud of what has been done here, but also so that they may know how much they have to pay. (Applause) PRESIDENT. - I think that arrangements have been made. ANDREWS (RDE). - Mr President, I endorse everything you have said about this magnificent h\u00e9micycle and I would like to congratulate the Brussels authorities on the job they have done here. It is an absolutely superb job and I think they deserve congratulations. (Applause) Could I appeal to them, however, to round off the magnificence of this lovely day and this lovely h\u00e9micycle by ending luggage-trolley payments at Brussels airport, which are an absolute disgrace! ",
        "29. 9. 93 Debates of the European Parliament No 3-435/3 (Applause) PRESIDENT. - We will look into that. LANE (RDE). - Mr President, I was delighted when I saw the draft agenda for today's part-session because it meant we would have a statement from the Commission and the Council on the GATT Agreement and the progress up to now. However, I understand that the Council is not prepared to make a statement today. It is only going to participate in the debate or make com ments. I regret that although it is more than one year since we started discussing this subject in this House the Council is still not prepared to make a statement provid ing us with the figures it has been using in its discussions over past months. At this late stage I appeal to the Council to come forward and let us see where it stands at the moment in these discussions and what figures its discussions are based on. PRESIDENT. - Mr Lane, the Council is here and there is provision on the agenda for this. I think your complaint is a bit premature. TAURAN (DR). - (FR) Mr President, last week the European Parliament's office premises in Paris were closed - it seems for security reasons. It is surprising that we have had to take such precautions in Paris, where there are innumerable public buildings of every kind, foreign embassies and consulates and international organizations, under police surveillance. So why has our Assembly been penalized in this way? It would be unpleasant and unacceptable if that were to continue. So very firm representations must be made to the French authorities to enable our offices to operate normally and to avoid giving the impression that our Assembly is being penalized for its actions. PRESIDENT. - Mr Tauran, I have already written to the French authorities in this connection and asked them to take the appropriate steps. DILLEN (DR). - (NL) Mr President, at the last part- session in Strasbourg I addressed myself to the Chair both orally and in writing about a disconcerting, bewil dering and unacceptable report. That report was made at the beginning of a meeting of the Austrian Delegation with the EC-Austria Joint Parliamentary Committee. It was to the effect that at the meeting the following week in Vienna there were to be only three active and six passive languages. This linguistic discrimination is entirely con trary both to Parliament's Rules of Procedure and to the Treaty of Rome. I was told then that the matter was to be investigated by the Enlarged Bureau. I should be glad if you could tell us what the final decision was. PRESIDENT. - I will inform you of the decision by the Enlarged Bureau as soon as it has been taken. (Parliament approved the Minutes) (') ') Membership of delegations \u2014 Verification of Credentials - Commu nication of common positions of the Council - Documents received \u2014 Texts of Treaties forwarded by the Council - Written declarations (Rule 65): see Minutes 3. Order of business PRESIDENT. - We now come to the order of business. The draft agenda for the current part-session has been distributed and the following changes proposed or made to it (Rule 73 and 74): No changes have been proposed for Wednesday. It has been proposed for Thursday that the oral question with debate tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Doc. B3-1197/93 rev) and the oral question with debate tabled by the Green Group in the European Parliament (Doc. B3-1198/93) on the implementation of the common organization of the market for bananas should be included in a joint debate with the oral question on the same subject by the Group of the Party of European Socialists. I have also received a proposal from Mr Mendes de Vigo and 14 other signatories to remove this item from the agenda. M\u00c9NDEZ DE VIGO - (PPE) Mr President, there are three reasons why we - together with 14 colleagues, and under the protection afforded by Rule 74 of the Rules of Procedure - asked that the proposal presented by the Group of the Party of European Socialists to be with drawn. Firstly, because we feel it is an ill-timed initiative. In a few days there will be a debate within a GATT panel on the suitability of this common organization of the market vis-a-vis the GATT rules. We therefore feel that to begin a debate now on this issue here in this House - which already made a decision on the same issue a few months ago, with an overwhelming result - will in no way help to advance the GATT negotiations. In our opinion, enough fronts have already been opened in GATT and we would be ill-advised to open more. Secondly, we feel that this initiative serves no purpose. We feel this way because the common organization of the market in bananas - as you all know - entered into force on 1 July. It is not possible - and this is not political statement, but just common sense - to rigorously analyze the functioning, or assess the consequences of a common organization of the market which is planned to last 10 years. As I said, it is not possible to analyze it when it has not even been in force for three months. Lastly, Mr President, it is inconsistent with the position taken by this House, which introduced an amendment into the final version of the common organization of the market, whereby the first assessment of the impact of the COM would be made three years after it entered into force. Therefore, since it is ill-timed, purposeless and inconsis tent, we ask this House to have it removed from the agenda. von der VRING (PSE). - (DE) Mr President, I wish to speak against the motion for a resolution which seems to me to be rather unfair and inconsiderate. Introducing the organization of the market in bananas is a difficult business, and the Commission had promised to all it could to resolve the problem without prejudice to those concerned. I am not in principle opposed to this organi zation of the market, but we have to talk to the Commis sion and establish whether it is keeping its promise and exercising caution. I have been approached by workers at ",
        "No 3-435/4 Debates of the European Parliament 29. 9. 93 von der VRING Bremerhaven who are concerned about their jobs, because the introduction of the common organization of the market has already brought considerable disruption, a fall in freight and transshipment revenue and, indeed, redundancies. I do not want to see this particular organi zation of the market brought into discredit and so I want Parliament to enter immediately into talks with the Commission on how to make it into a success rather than a failure. That has nothing whatever to do with the GATT. It is an internal issue. We have also agreed that, in these circumstances, there is absolutely no point in voting on a resolution. We do not wish to vote on a resolution. In line with the recommen dation of the Court of Justice, however, we want to remind the Commission to be very careful, flexible and sensitive in dealing with this issue, and we must be able to discuss it in this House, if we are to be a proper Parliament. OOMEN-RUIJTEN (PPE). - (NL) Mr President, I should like to see whether we cannot reach a compromise. Mr M\u00e9ndez de Vigo has raised a number of points about this organization of the market, which we cannot very well overlook. That is why the EPP Group would like to put to you the proposal that we discuss this organization of the market for bananas with the Commission - to have some of Parliament's arguments considered in the debate - but then do not vote on a resolution, because I think Mr M\u00e9ndez de Vigo is right that it is still too early for that. We should be very pleased if it were possible to manage things in that way. PRESIDENT. - Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, you are expressing the same view as Mr von der Vring. (Parliament rejected the motion) HOWELL (PPE). - Mr President, on this inaugural day of our Parliament here in Brussels, it is interesting to make the parallel between the Parliament in Brussels and the affairs that are taking place in another parliament in Moscow. I wonder if you can bring us up to date on whether we will be having a debate on the situation in Moscow this week. BETHELL, The Lord (PPE). - Mr President, I have been asked to raise a point on behalf of your delegation to Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States. Your delegation met this morning, Mr President, and there was an overwhelming feeling that, because of the importance of events in Moscow and other parts of Russia, this Parliament should debate the matter briefly and give its view in public to the world. There was an overwhelming view that the elected government of the President of Russia should be supported by this Parlia ment against the unelected so-called Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation. I therefore hope that this Parlia ment will find some way of expressing that point of view. (Applause) PRESIDENT. - Ladies and gentlemen, I am afraid that all the speakers are essentially saying the same as Mr Howell. The Group of the Party of European Socialists has tabled a request for a Council statement followed by debate. I have been in touch with the Council and after giving the matter its consideration, the Council does not feel it can issue a statement which should be followed by debate. I have asked the Council to make provision for this at the next part-session. The Council informed me, however, that there is so far no joint position of the Council which could form the basis for such a statement. It is therefore impossible to hold a debate on this basis. No other provision under the Rules of Procedure has been sug gested by anybody. BOMBARD (PSE). - (FR) Mr President, I have a techni cal observation. The acoustics are unbearable at present and we cannot last out here for several hours. We hear the speakers so loud, in addition to the interpreters, that we are completely deafened. When you banged your gavel just now I thought my head would burst. This simply must be put right! PRESIDENT. - All right, I will only use the handle from now on. SPERONI (PSE). - (IT) Mr President, I think this agenda is rather unbalanced. Let me explain: practically the same amount of discussion time is envisaged for a matter of great importance such as GATT as for the question, which is certainly important but not so serious, on the banana agreement. I think it would have been more appropriate to increase the time for the GATT discussion and at the same time to reduce the time for speeches on bananas. COT (PSE). - (FR) Mr President, I thought I had understood that we were meeting in Brussels to deal with topical matters and fulfil our parliamentary r\u00f4le. If, with regard to the most immediately topical matter, that is, today's events in Russia, we are not entitled to speak because the Council has not managed to agree on some thing or other, and if, with regard to the most immediately topical matter, namely what is taking place at the moment in the Russian parliament, we have no right to discuss it because, it seems, further reflection is needed, that is the very negation of the purpose of parliamentary review! (Applause) In these circumstances, I ask why this h\u00e9micycle has been built. In these circumstances it would have been better to wait quietly to meet in a few weeks' time in Strasbourg at the senatorial pace which only recently was the hallmark of our institution. So I insist that this debate be held. If the Council decides to absent itself in this matter, let it take the responsibility, but as far as we are concerned I cannot see why we should shirk our responsibility in that respect, because this is a matter of shirking. On behalf of my Group I insist that Parliament should be able today to discuss the situation in Russia. That situation is too serious for us to let it go by in silence and wait till their lordships the permanent repre sentatives agree on a common position, although I hope that in the meantime there will be a happy outcome in Moscow. (Loud applause) PRESIDENT. - Mr Cot, normally there are two ways of tabling an oral question, either to the Council or to the Commission. The first procedure has been followed in that the Council has been asked to make a statement. A statement cannot be made but there is nothing to stop the groups agreeing to hold a debate on this issue. I do not understand this: we are hurling accusations but in fact they are directed against ourselves! Such a proposal has ",
        "29. 9. 93 Debates of the European Parliament No 3-435/5 PRESIDENT not been made! If all the groups want this to happen we can take a vote and arrange a debate for tomorrow morning. OOMEN-RUUTEN (PPE). - (NL) I should like to associate myself with a number of remarks which you have made. There are many arguments for a debate tomorrow morning about the situation in Russia, but also a number against, as for example the fact that the Council is not yet in a position to discuss actual events with us. But, Mr President, this morning the EPP Group at the meeting of the Enlarged Bureau thought that the debate should take place, but we were outvoted; as good demo crats we accepted that this morning at our Group meeting. Now that it seems, however, that others have changed their minds, we are ready for the debate to be held. PRESIDENT. - There was no vote this morning. Given the Council's answer to our question, we simply assumed that there would be no statement and therefore there could not be a debate to follow it up. URBAIN, President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Mr President, I shall make a very brief statement following Mr Cot's speech insisting, as he is entitled to do, that the situation in the Soviet Union be put on the agenda. Naturally the Council regards Parliament as being master of its own agenda. As for saying that it could not debate because the Council's position is not available, the explanation is very simple. These events have come up between the date of the last Council meeting, 20 Septem ber, and the departure of the Foreign Ministers of the Twelve for the United States, where they are taking part in the General Assembly. In these circumstances it was impossible for the Council to define its position before today's sitting. I am sure this point will come up on the Council's agenda for Monday in Luxembourg. PRESIDENT. - You have just heard a very clear state ment by the Council which was exactly what was conveyed to the members of the Bureau this morning. TOMLINSON (PSE). - Mr President, I regret that mine is a more pedestrian point of order. We have before us on our desks a note which tells us how to use the electronic voting. It seems to me to be a deliberate piece of sabotage. In English it tells me that in Brussels I insert the card horizontally, whereas in French it tells me that in Brussels I should insert it vertically. This is obviously a deliberate attempt to sabotage our first meeting here. I hope you can institute an immediate inquiry into which French member of the administration was responsible for this and take them to task. You can then save some money for our administrative budget by making sure that post is deleted from the establishment plan. As the voting machine only accepts the card one way, perhaps in future the administration might leave us to make up our own mind about how it fits. PRESIDENT. - I pointed out in my opening remarks that there would be technical teething problems of one sort or another. I think, however, that we have all worked out how to use the machines. LANGER (V). - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentle men, let me begin with a brief comment on the voting machines: it was announced just now that there had been a total of 141 votes recorded. That does not seem to me to plausible given how full the chamber is. Someone ought perhaps to check that all the machines are in fact working. Turning now to the agenda: you said, Mr President, that there has yet to be a workable suggestion. I should like to make one: we also have the Commission, and, last week, Commissioner Van den Broek made a statement on events in Russia to the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Security. Could we not invite the Commission, which is based here in Brussels, to come and make a statement to us. That is not, of course, the same as a statement by the Council, but it would mean that there would be a basis in the agenda for a debate. I should like therefore to suggest that we do that and so avoid debating in a vacuum, just among ourselves, and have at least one partner in discus sion in the form of the Commission. PRESIDENT. - As far as your first remark is concerned, Mr Langer, I think that some colleagues did not have their cards ready. I assume that in future the number of votes cast will be the same as the number of members present. Secondly, I pointed out there are two possibilities: questions to the Council and questions to the Commis sion; but nobody tabled a question to the Commission. The Commission has always been willing to respond to questions of that kind. I will contact the Commission to see if it is willing to make a statement. WOLTJER (PSE). - (NL) Mr President, I am glad that you are now coming to a conclusion; I had hoped that the Bureau had already done that, because it is in any case important for this Parliament to have a debate here in Brussels about the situation in Russia. After the Coun cil's refusal, cannot you now persuade the Bureau to see that there is still a need to discuss Russia - that was the express meaning of our Group's request. So my proposal to the Bureau is to invite the Commission to make a statement as it did in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and if that is impossible, then to let the Groups organize the debate themselves, but in any case to organize a debate about the situation in Russia somehow or other tomorrow morning. That is an official proposal to the Bureau. PRESIDENT. - I am going to contact the Commission and I will give you an answer afterwards. McMAHON (PSE). - Mr President, I wonder if today we will have an opportunity to debate the abominable deci sion of the Enlarged Bureau and the Quaestors to refuse the use of the premises here to the disabled people of Europe on 3 December. Like a considerable number of Members I have received faxes from disabled groups saying that they intend to hold the parliament of the disabled on 3 December and had requested permission to use this new building here. If we are serious about building a genuine citizens' Europe, an ordinary citizens' Europe, and not just an elite talking shop for politicians, then we should be helping them. I understand you offered them Luxembourg but they really wanted Brussels, as it is becoming more important. I would hope that under Rule 25(2) the Bureau would see if it could explain to Parliament why it reached this decision and whether it would reconsider the decision. PRESIDENT. - Mr McMahon, this decision was taken by the Bureau. We are perfectly prepared to provide the use of Parliament's premises for such a meeting. We are also prepared to offer rooms in Luxembourg but the Bureau decided that the Chamber itself should not be ",
        "No 3-435/6 Debates of the European Parliament 29. 9. 93 PRESIDENT used for such meetings. If you like I will put this matter to the Bureau again. JACKSON, Christopher (PPE). - Mr President, I fear you are too sanguine about voting and that there will in fact be a very large number of false votes if we are not careful. There is a law in Britain, popularly called 'Sod's law', that if something can go wrong, it will go wrong. If you go beyond Mr Tomlinson's sabotage paragraph in the instructions you find that the next paragraph in English is ambiguous. The card can in fact be vertically inserted in four different ways. If you read that paragraph it still leaves two ways. And most of the people around me inserted the card the wrong way. Perhaps we could make it clear that the card has to be inserted with the little electronic chip towards 'one' and 'down'. That is unam biguous. MIRANDA DA SILVA (CG). - (PT) Mr President, I too would like to mention the matter of the agenda, and more specifically the inclusion of a debate on the events and situation in Russia. As I mentioned today during the meeting of the Enlarged Bureau, I think that this is an event of great importance. The fact that this House is meeting at this time is a de facto justification for holding a debate on this matter. Consequently, I would like to confirm the words of Chairman Cot on this matter in particular: I think that tomorrow - even though no decision has been taken on the matter, and even though the Council has not made a statement on the matter - we will see that the various political groups will have an opportunity to express themselves on the matter. I feel that we could make room tomorrow morning for a debate lasting an hour or an hour and a half on an issue of such great importance to us. WIJSENBEEK (LDR). - (NL) Mr President, according to the Rules of Procedure there are two possibilities for a debate about Russia. We may ask the Commission under Rule 56 to make a statement, which may be followed by a debate, or under Rule 64, if one of the Groups or at least 23 Members put in a written request, we can decide about it today and hold a debate tomorrow. So those possibili ties are open and I think that is what we should do. In any event I give you firm notice that I shall not need violence to be used to force me to leave the building this evening. PRESIDENT. - Mr Wijsenbeek, I am going to contact the Commission and the Commission must, of course, get in touch with Mr Van den Broek and see if this is possible. It is looking for ways of making a statement tomorrow morning and I will let you know as soon as possible whether this can be done. CAUDRON (PSE). - (FR) Mr President, I am speaking here as a mere Member of Parliament. I confess that although we should not underestimate the importance of the debates we have about the right way up for voting cards or more seriously the state of the GATT negotia tions, Mrs Simons's report or the banana market, I find it hard to understand, on reading such a skeletal agenda, why we need to meet here for two days in Brussels for a special part-session unless the necessity is made to appear more pressing, as some fellow-Members are asking. And I add, as a mere Member, that if we do not manage in some way, in response to topical questions, to make our agenda more worth while, that will simply be proving that those who are saying today that this part-session is only being held to justify a super-expensive investment are right, to which I would add some manoeuvres which I, as a Member, still do not understand. (Applause) PRESIDENT. - Mr Caudron, it is difficult to do anything other than that which you have decided upon yourselves. If you hear today a statement on GATT and want to debate GATT, someone might take the view that this is important while somebody else may think it is a rather slim agenda. It is up to everyone to assess the issue as he or she sees fit. But we must adhere to our joint decisions. DE VRIES (LDR). - (NL) Mr President, a point of order. It says on the agenda that we are to discuss GATT at four o'clock. There is an important reason for that: there has just been a discussion in Washington between Sir Leon Brittan and Mickey Kantor; that is a matter in which tens of thousands of jobs are at stake, it is a matter of importance to the whole world economy. We have now devoted an hour to internal domestic matters, so confirm ing once again the image that as a Parliament our thoughts turn inwards rather than outwards, that we look to ourselves rather than to our electors. Can we now call a halt to the interruptions, Mr President, and ask Sir Leon Brittan to speak? (Applause) PRAG (PPE). - Mr President, I rise as Chairman of the Intergroup on Disablement to support Mr McMahon. The European Day of Disabled Persons is being held on 3 December. The European Committee of Disabled People asked us if they could use our h\u00e9micycle. This h\u00e9micycle is the only large debating chamber in Europe which is totally accessible to disabled people. It is no use offering them either the Luxembourg or the Strasbourg h\u00e9micy cles, because both are quite inaccessible to disabled people in wheelchairs. Moreover, some parliaments keep their debating chambers exclusively for their own use, but by no means all of them. I have taken part in a meeting in the chamber of the Bundestag in Bonn which had nothing to do with the parliament. The week before last, several of our national parliaments allowed children to use their debating chambers because it was United Nations World Children's Day. It is absolutely outra geous that the Enlarged Bureau was unable to make an exception for the European Day of Disabled People. (Applause) It was bureaucratic and totally unacceptable, and I would like to make a formal proposal that the European Com mittee of Disabled People be authorized to use this h\u00e9micycle for their proceedings on the European Day of Disabled People on 3 December. I request a vote on this proposal. (Applause) PRESIDENT. - Mr Prag, you have been a Member of this House for many years and you know our Rules of Procedure and practice. Mr De Vries just pointed out to great applause that we have now been talking for about one hour on every subject under the sun except that about which we are supposed to be talking. What you have just ",
        "29. 9. 93 Debates of the European Parliament No 3-435/7 PRESIDENT said is a typical example. No one has suggested that this item be placed on the agenda. There is no particular need for urgency. There is no need to take a decision today. I am sure a number of Members would be only too willing to speak on this subject but we must get on with our agenda. Mr De Vries has just pointed that out quite rightly. I have already promised that I will refer the matter back to the Enlarged Bureau and let you know its decision. If you want, you can table a motion for the next plenary sitting which has to be received in writing one hour before the sitting begins. We are talking about something which is planned for December. (Parliament adopted the agenda as amended) (') 4. GATT PRESIDENT. - The next item is the statement by the Commission on GATT. BRITTAN, Sir Leon, Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, it is fitting that the important subject of GATT should be the first substantial subject to be discussed in this splendid new chamber that Parliament is inaugurating today. I would like to give you the latest situation as far as GATT is concerned. Let me start, however, by reminding you of the challenge that we face and of the enormous advantages and benefits if we complete the GATT round successfully. Not only will this bring a boost of confidence to the European economy at a time when it is badly needed. It will also lead to the opportunity of greater exports from the European Community from the later period of 1995. It will constrain the use of unilateral power to handle trade disputes. It will replace the GATT with a stronger body, a multilateral trade organization, able to police and to control the handling of disputes in a far more effective way. Above all, it will secure the future of European Community policies on textiles, culture, agriculture, the Airbus, steel, all areas where our policies have to be safeguarded and where our policies are at present vulner able to attack under the existing GATT rules. That is the nature of the challenge, and we have made good progress towards a solution to these problems and a completion of a GATT round. We made a big step forward in Japan last July when we reached agreement on a number of areas where there would be no tariffs at all and where we also reached agreement on a framework for the remainder of the negotiations. Since then the Council has considered the matter at a jumbo Council on 20 September. Let me remind the House of the decisions the Council took. First of all, the Council itself reaffirmed the importance of reaching a conclusion to the GATT round. Secondly, the Council accepted 15 December as being the date by which those negotiations should be completed. In doing so, let me remind the House that we were not accepting an Ameri can deadline. We ourselves were party to that deadline of 15 December. Indeed if anything we asked the Ameri cans to accept an earlier deadline. Moreover, I can assure the House that it is not just a question of the European Community and the United States. It is a question of over ') Deadline for tabling amendments and motions for resolutions Speaking time: see Minutes 110 countries, and the idea that after 15 December we could seriously persuade all those other countries, suffer ing from battle fatigue after seven weary years of nego tiations in Geneva, to continue yet further and to take it seriously is absolutely inconceivable. So the Council accepted that deadline. It also considered the important question of agriculture as well as the other issues at stake for the European Community in the negotiations. It listened to the points that were made, not only by France, but by a number of other countries, about the Blair House Agreement. Let me be quite clear. The suggestion that the Blair House Agreement was incompa tible with the reform of the common agricultural policy was raised. The Council did not take a decision to that effect. And as far as Blair House itself is concerned, the Commission's position has not changed, but in the Council a number of points were suggested, ways were put forward in which the Blair House Agreement could be improved to the benefit of European agriculture. I will not go into those in detail. Mr Steichen will, if necessary, deal with the specific agricultural points. The Council decided that it should not ask for a renego tiation of Blair House. Not one country actually asked for a renegotiation of the Blair House Agreement. I sug gested to the Council and the Council accepted that it was reasonable, in the light of the points that were made by a number of countries - France at the fore but others as well - for us to explore the possibility of a clarification, amplification, interpretation or even an addition to the Blair House Agreement which would meet the concerns that had been expressed on behalf of European industry. The Council did not create a new mandate for the Commission as would have been necessary if a renego tiation were involved. It invited me to pursue further the possibility of negotiating with the United States these improvements, or some of them, to the Blair House Agreement, as well of course as to continue the discus sions more generally with the United States on a number of important issues. It is on that basis that I went and met not only Mr Kantor but also Secretary Bentsen to discuss the whole range of the GATT negotiations in Washington last Monday. Now I am here to tell you the outcome of those discussions. I will deal first of all with the non-agricultural aspects of the negotiations. I was struck by the urgency with which Mr Kantor approached the task. He stressed to me that we only had 79 days to complete the negotiations. Today we only have 77 days to complete the negotiations. We both agreed that the number of outstanding issues was small. The difficulties in resolving them were great but they were political difficulties. If we achieved a political resolution of those difficulties we had the time to com plete the round. And we discussed each one of the outstanding points, the question of market access in goods, the question of market access in services, in all their aspects. I believe that we made considerable progress in those discussions, sufficient progress for us jointly to be able to say to the other 110-odd countries with whom we are negotiating: do not think that there is any pretext for not participating actively in those negotiations in Geneva. It is time for you to come forward with your offers, or your improved offers, and to join in those negotiations active ly. The progress that we have made is sufficient to justify ",
        "No 3-435/8 Debates of the European Parliament 29. 9. 93 BRITTAN, Sir Leon that. I found, for example, for the first time in the United States not a solution to the problem of culture but at least an understanding that culture is not the same as ordinary physical goods, that there is a specificity about this sector that has to be recognized in the outcome of the negotia tions. We need a global GATT deal. I do not think we can simply exclude the cultural dimension from that deal, and it is our task to protect the specificity of European culture and the interests of European culture in the context of GATT. I believe that we can do so and I made it clear to Mr Kantor that we are determined to do so. I think that we see the glimmerings of the beginning of a solution to that problem, even though there is much negotiating still to be done. There are other important sectors which we have to defend: steel, the aeronautical sector and others. I can see the possibility of progress in all those areas even though I hasten to add that specific deals were not done. Then we came to the question of agriculture. I put forward every single one of the suggestions that had been made by our agricultural community for ways of improv ing the agricultural settlement without formally renego tiating the Blair House Agreement. There was no propo sal, large or small, which I did not put forward, some with variations, some quite simply. And the debate in the Council and also what has been said on numerous occasions in Parliament enabled me to appreciate the varying weight attached to the different ideas, and the kind of concerns expressed. All of those were put forward vigorously to Mr Kantor. I would further add that I explained to him not only the details of the suggestions and the ideas that have been put forward by France and others for improvement of the position as far as agriculture is concerned, but I also explained to him the political importance of this in the European Community and that a European Community divided on this issue was not in the interests of the United States at all. Cooperation between the United States and the European Community is important in areas going beyond trade: in handling the Middle East, in handling Russia and in handling many other problems, even perhaps in the future the problems of Yugoslavia after the war. And a divided and weakened European Community is not in the United States' interest because it needs us for this process of cooperation in the world. In any event a GATT round that was jeopardized by a dispute of this kind was not in the interests of the United States from a trade point of view either. So I urged him to show the necessary flexibility to be able to respond to the concerns of the European Community, to complete the negotiations on other matters but to respond on agricul ture as well. As you will expect, since I was putting the proposals in detail to Mr Kantor for the first time, he was not in a position to respond. He of course underlined the difficulties for the United States. The House must under stand that in the United States - and not only in the United States but also in the countries of the Cairns Group, in the countries of the Rio Group, and in most other parts of the world - the Blair House deal is regarded as something that is beneficial to the Community and not a great success for the United States. It is beneficial to the Community because it assures protection for the first time for a common agricultural policy that has been under threat in GATT and elsewhere almost as long as it has existed. So Mr Kantor said that he could give no assurances whatsoever. He insisted that the Blair House Agreement could not be renegotiated. As to the question of whether the changes - not renegotiation - that I put forward were acceptable to the United States, he made it clear that he could give no opinion instantly. If we are serious about this matter it is an answer that one would expect. You could not expect one member of the United States Administration, however distinguished, hearing these proposals in detail for the first time, to give an instant answer. So we left it at that. Of course he appreciates and understands that we will be expecting a response in due course, just as we will be expecting a response on all the other areas of concern to European industry, whether in goods or in services. I happened to mention the audiovi sual area, but there are many others as well. And of course the handling of all these issues has to be done together on a global basis and urgently because, as I have said, we only have 77 days left. We will be having the next meeting with Mr Kantor here in Brussels on 13 October. Before then the experts on both sides will be meeting to discuss a number of issues. When we meet on 13 October we will continue the discussions, both on agriculture and on these other issues. I am sure that we will be able eventually to make it quite clear that we must resolve all these issues if we are to have a successful conclusion to the GATT round. I cannot tell you exactly how it will all end. I can tell you that on behalf of the Commission and on behalf of the Council and the Community I have made very clear to the Americans what we want and I have made it very clear how high the stakes are. I have urged them, in their interests and in the interests of the world trading com munity, to show the necessary flexibility to reach a successful conclusion. That is the state of play as it stands, but you can rest assured that the Commission will - not only in the area of agriculture but in all other areas - continue the negotia tions, seeking a positive conclusion not only with the United States but with all our trading partners in the interests of world trade, in the interests of European industry and agriculture, in order to achieve that boost of confidence and that impetus to the European economy which we so desperately need and which we can certainly attain. (Applause) STEICHEN, Member of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, I should like to thank Parliament for giving the Commission the opportunity today to deal with the question of the Uruguay Round and particularly the agricultural section following the conclusions of the recent Jumbo Council. At its last part-session Parliament pointed the way, by the indirect means of its resolution on the effects of trade agreements and the success of the reform of the CAP. In the main you accepted the Blair House compromise, whilst asking for the necessary elucidations and amplifi cations. That wise counsel was what the Council finally followed; it has already made it possible to avoid dishar mony in the Community. I am sure it will make it possible ",
        "29. 9. 93 Debates of the European Parliament No 3-435/9 STEICHEN to conclude the Uruguay Round. Sir Leon Brittan has just told us the position with regard to his conversations with Mr Kantor. It is now for the Commission, with, I hope, Parliament's renewed support, to finalize discussions with the Americans. But perhaps I may say a little more about the spirit in which I understand the Commission's steps as regards the agricultural sector. I should like to say a word straight away about the well-known Blair House agreement. It has called forth many comments, some criticisms and even some polemics. In fact Blair House is the result of long and difficult negotiations making fairly substantial improvements to Mr Dunkel's draft final act, which was the basis of the negotiations. I should like to repeat that essentially these improve ments relate to four points: first of all the preliminary agreement has a peace clause. Secondly it exempts aids linked to the reform of the CAP from any commitment with regard to reduction of domestic support. Thirdly, the cutback in subsidized exports is reduced from 24 to 21 %, and finally it contains a clause for consultation in the event of an increase in cereal substitution products. The talks which the Council has asked the Commission to continue with the Americans in the agricultural sphere, and the first exchange of views on which took place at Monday's meeting between Sir Leon and Mickey Kantor cannot, in the Commission's view, call in question the improvements I have just mentioned. I can only repeat that reopening this subject would risk achieving a worse result than that obtained by the Commission at Blair House. In the second place, as the Commissioner responsible for agriculture, I should also like to state formally that the Commission could not accept any threat of any kind to the CAP reform from the clarification procedure upon which we have embarked. It has been too frequently suggested that ideas on the compatibility between Blair House and the CAP have fundamentally changed since the preliminary agreement was signed. That amounts to saying that the reform is failing to meet its objectives. Some of the parameters actually seem to be moving more in the direction of our forecasts. Thus the areas sown for this year's harvest are well within the forecasts made when the reform was worked out. The cereals harvest itself will very probably be less than these forecasts. As regards stocks, there has been a clear improvement in the beef and veal sector, where it has been possible to keep amounts taken into intervention to a minimum. It is true that for cereals present stocks are higher than last Nov ember when the Commission made a study of the compatibility of the reform with Blair House. But com parisons must be made between what is comparable. At the end of this marketing year stocks should be roughly 34.1 m tonnes, which is actually slightly less than forecasts, namely 34.3 m tonnes when we worked out the preliminary draft budget for 1994. So the first year of application of the reform seems far from being a failure. On the other hand it must be admitted that the agri-monetary trend is worrying, to say the least. But in this field the problem is not only with regard to the Uruguay Round but also, and perhaps above all, with regard to the budget and the actual implementa tion of the reform. We must therefore remain on our guard. Now I should like to say a word about the consequences to be expected from the Jumbo Council. I still think that Blair House is an essential anchor for finalizing a global agreement with all parties to GATT, and that the reform cannot be called in question on that occasion, but equally I think that the positions arrived at by the Jumbo Council are entirely correct. I think in particular of the willing ness, unanimously expressed, not to call in question by means of the Uruguay Round the main principles on which the common agricultural policy is based, that is, its permanent nature, or Community preference, or our place on the world market. The Commission is entirely in favour of it and it is in this spirit that I see our discussions with the Americans in the coming months. A final Uruguay Round agreement requires a minimum of good will on both sides. Our American friends must understand that our demands are serious. As long as the agreement is not concluded, the European Community is entitled to raise points, to seek clarifications, even addi tions to Blair House. To reject our requests straight away would amount to taking responsibility for the failure of trade negotiations, whereas it must be possible to find a way to allay the fears of some of our Member States. I do not think the Americans are out to obstruct things, or that that would be in their interests, but they clearly need a little time to evaluate the questions we have put to them, which are mentioned in the conclusions of the Jumbo Council. For its part, the Commission will set to work to explore all the avenues mentioned, with the firm intention of not restricting questions to the agricultural section alone. Without a global view of the negotiations there can be no hope of making progress in the direction desired by the Council. (Applause) WOLTJER (PSE). - (NL) Mr President, I have often had the chance to say here on behalf of my Group that we want to give all support to the vast amount of work the Commissioners have done to reach a successful conclu sion of the Uruguay Round. We wish to take the oppor tunity of this debate again to promise that support to both Commissioners in an attempt to reach an actual conclu sion before the end of the year. We know how hard it is, and has been in the past, but the Commissioners may expect in the European Parliament all the support they need. That is my Group's starting point in this debate, to give support to our negotiators in this difficult period, to give support so that they may round things off success fully, and we are 100% behind what the Commissioners have said about the importance for us of a successful conclusion to the GATT round. The negotiations often look like a real night-time procession I might almost say: two steps forward, one step back. And sometimes it even seems that instead of two steps forward and one step back we are taking one step forward and two back, often getting right back to the beginning. But, Mr President, I am pleased with the statement that has now been made, in which Sir Leon Brittan has clearly said again that he is optimistic and that he really means that, for that is the way I understood what he said; his last mission showed signs of a successful rounding off, the political will is there, both with Europe and with the Americans, to cut through the knots and to say: at this time of recession we can no longer play a hesitant part, ",
        "No 3-435/10 Debates of the European Parliament 29. 9. 93 WOLTJER pussyfoot around and offer no prospect of finishing things off. That is how I understood it and I am pleased with what I have heard. I should have been glad to have some rather more specific promises, indicating that that optimism arose not only from the general approach but also from the progress of all dossiers, but I also under stand that during this negotiating process we have to work very carefully, otherwise toes will be trodden on, which then leads to moves backwards rather than for wards. Mr President, I have already said here often that the Uruguay Round is enormously important for employ ment and for the economy in the European Community. Naturally we also have to deal with the agricultural dossier, and that is one of the many, but it is a question of the whole package and - in recent weeks it has again been impressed upon us by the OECD and the World Bank - a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round will have an enormous impact on the growth of the world economy and it is just those advantages which will go to the European Community and the United States which have been fighting one another so bitterly on one dossier. Mr President, I should just like to stress again that if it should appear - and these months are dominated by the question of employment - that political knots still have to be cut through, that the Community must clearly do that; that is what we mean to suggest by the resolution, support for the negotiators but also to give the Council the task of cutting through those knots. When we are always talking about a tremendous recession and employment, the position cannot be that we let such a chance slip and fail to come to a successful conclusion before the end of the year. I think we are all aware of that and know that we must all devote ourselves to it. The last point I want to mention here, Mr President, is that at present I think it is also important for Parliament, the whole House I should like to say, to give its support to the negotiators who stand in the breach for us; for the whole House to state again what its concerns are, as regards the other partners too, so that our Commissioners, our negotiators may once again have available specifical ly from our Parliament a number of illustrations to show the Americans but also the other partners, because there are multilateral partners to the discussion, the concerns that we have here. At the same time the entire Parliament must show that in this matter we are all behind the Commissioners and want to reach a successful conclu sion. That is the issue in this discussion and in that respect I should like to thank the Commissioners here once more because, once again, it is essential to achieve a successful end to the GATT negotiations by the end of December. STAVROU (PPE). - (GR) Mr President, the day after the Council of Ministers met on 20 September we rejoiced that the crisis provoked by the difference of opinion between France and Germany concerning the Blair House agreement had been overcome. What we clearly failed to recognise was that the Council of Ministers had paid more attention to the crisis within the Community than was its due, and of course, less to the dispute between the United States and the Community, which had provoked the crisis in the first place. That is why the crisis still exists and will continue to do so. There has been some confusion and this still persists in full, since even after Sir Leon Brittan's last journey nobody knows what difference there is between renego tiation and further discussion. Which of the two is taking place? With a disarming frankness that does him credit, the Commissioner admitted today that the Council of Ministers did not authorize him to renegotiate but instructed him to present to the other side, in other words to the United States, certain interpretations, amplifica tions, clarifications and, if needs be, additions to the text of the Blair House agreement. I do not know whether all that amounts to a renegotiation, the essence of some new demand, or whatever else. Of course, as was natural, Sir Leon Brittan stressed to Mr Kantor the obvious importance that the Community attributes to these new proposals, their political signifi cance, as he told us earlier, and he ended by expressing the hope that there would be a constructive response on the part of the Americans. Mr Kantor's answer, not to Mr Brittan as we read in the Press, but to the representatives of the newspapers and television, was clear. First, that the United States do not intend to reopen the Blair House file. Secondly, and I think more important, that the disagree ments are an internal matter and can only be solved at the Community level, in the sense of course that the Com munity must decide whether or not it intends to honour the texts signed by the two previous and former Commis sioners, Mr McSharry and Mr Andriessen. I myself, Mr President, am glad that the Commissioner responsible for Agriculture told us a little while ago that they will in fact be honoured, and I am glad not because the Blair House decisions satisfy me, but because the statement by the Commissioner for Agriculture reinforces the Commun ity's credibility, which would be called into question if it did not abide by those agreements. Mr President, the question is what happens next? We have no answer, we have nothing at all, and we are waiting either for the Ministers' meeting on 5 and 6 October \u2014 and they will know nothing new, since there will have been no developments by that time \u2014 or for the meeting between the Commissioner responsible and Mr Kantoron 13 October. I think the dilemma is fast approaching explosive propor tions. The Commissioner told us how important it is to conclude this agreement if vital European problems are to be solved. If I remember correctly, world trade will benefit by a transfusion of some 200 billion dollars per year if the agreement is concluded, and since we have tried every other means, we all know already that neither unemployment, nor monetary instability will be solved unless the problems of the Uruguay Round are solved first. Consequently, Mr President, this is an issue that domi nates our most fundamental problems today. I do not know whether excessive publicity or political vested interests are at fault. I think the Community must make its position clear as soon as possible and explain exactly what is involved, so that we can avoid sieges of our cities, strikes, or whatever else in connection with a matter that concerns us all. One last word, Mr President, relating to the deadline. I am glad Sir Leon Brittan made that clear. Indeed, the deadline of 15 December concerns us all. It was not a knife held to our throats by the Americans, it was something we too asked for, and I think we must make every effort as a Parliament \u2014 and on this point I agree ",
        "29. 9. 93 Debates of the European Parliament No 3-435/11 STAVROU with Mr Woltjer \u2014 to support the two Commissioners and to conclude this agreement at the earliest. GALLAND (LDR). - (FR) Mr President, Members of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, GATT is an issue of paramount importance, involving 110 countries and representing a volume of 4 300 000 m dollars' worth of trade in 1990. And in all that agriculture represents only 10%. Only 10%, one may say, but GATT is a whole. There must be agreement on everything. We know the richness of our European countryside with the things it produces, its remarkable men and women, their courage and the exemplary value for our Community of agricul tural policy as a common policy. This agricultural 10% is therefore of paramount impor tance for seeing that our Community's view is respected. They are, Members of the Commission, the cornerstone of GATT. We must lift the mortgages weighing upon our agriculture. We ourselves have discussed reform of the CAP here a great deal and it has been harsh, very very harsh. And then came the constraints of the Blair House preliminary agreement too. It seems more and more that these provisions, cumulatively, are unbearable in certain sectors. In the light of the figures which the analysts - as you know - supply us with day after day we are entitled to wonder about consistency. You have the term 'incom patibility' between these two systems. I thought the Commission agreed entirely with the Council's ques tions. Mr Steichen, you made me a little anxious but then you reassured me when you said that the Community's request must be heeded straight away, because ruining the negotiations would amount to taking a risk for the Americans. We can only welcome the Council's initiative of 20 September and the mandate it gave the Commission for reopening the discussion, for making the American positions more flexible. That is why paragraph 4 of the compromise resolution in fact follows the Council com muniqu\u00e9. Not 'renegotiation', you say, Sir Leon. Like me, the speakers before me are wondering. Not 'renego tiation' but 'interpretation', 'addition'. If you like! I shall not argue with you about semantics if all that is a synonym for improvement. It also seems essential to us that the cultural exception about which you have spoken must be stauchly defended by the Commission. If we do not want to see our high-quality audio-visual sector from Lisbon to London, from Athens to Paris, in ruins, if we want our cultural identity to be preserved, you are right and we support you whole-heartedly. Those are the stakes. They are not the stakes for France, as you say, they are not the stakes for Ireland or Luxembourg or any one or other of our countries. They are the stakes for our Community. We must all be united to make sure that our views are respected, that the negotiations are the best possible for our European countries. Feelings do not come into it for the United States when it comes to defending their interests. We must trust you, Sir Leon, you are a free-trader it is true, but in French that rhymes with justice. You are British and European, you know how to see that our essential interests are respected by our partners and competitors in GATT. You have taken suggestions into account and have done so with determination. I am sure you were a good advocate. Sir Leon, for yourself, for the Commis sion, for the cohesion and institutional effectiveness of our Community, we must regain the confidence of doubting Europeans, which they never should have lost. Sir Leon, you can succeed, you will succeed. You have only 77 days left, but you must succeed. (Applause) LANNOYE (V) - (FR) Mr President, people often com plain about the democratic deficit in the European Com munity, and rightly so. There is less talk about the democratic deficit with regard to the way in which the GATT negotiations have taken place. When GATT was set up in 1947 it was a matter of bringing order to the post-war trade chaos. It was not very serious. Today there are 118 signatory nations and GATT controls four fifths of world trade. The negotiations taking place, because they have been extended in particu lar to agriculture, services, intellectual property and textiles, are actually preventing states from adopting their own domestic economic policies. That is an essential issue. Incantatory and peremptory declarations about the virtues of generalized free trade are no substitute for lines of policy. But unfortunately we must recognize that that is what is being proposed to us. Today we may say that transparency and democratic control are lacking and the speeches of the two Commis sioners whom I have just heard do not change my point of view. In fact we are not going to re-negotiate, we are going to re-discuss, but what are we going to re-discuss? We cannot make out any right and clear line in the matter. For more than a year the agricultural sector has been the news of the day and various circles have rightly com plained that the future of European agriculture was being jeopardized. It is good that there should be re-negotiation - I think what we call it is not very important. But we must state today that the field of argument has been enlarged. Other sectors are at stake: from textiles, where employers and unions are raising their voices in unison, to the audio-visual sector where the artistic world is also united in demanding a general and unlimited cultural exception clause. I could name other sectors. We notice also an acceleration in uprooting of jobs which is threatening employment in the north without bringing jobs to the south or east. We must move away from this narrow debate about growth creating jobs. There are two possible attitudes today: either we continue to negotiate whilst trying to win market shares, and there will be winners and losers - personally I think the only winners will be the multinationals and that the citizens and peoples will be the losers - or we change our philosophy, call a halt to the negotiations, change our ground to regulate international trade on the basis of rules which make it possible to resist ecological and social dumping, which allow states to carry out a policy of their own. I think the Commission and the Council must accept their responsibility and stop saying that they cannot counten ance the failure of negotiations which in any case, when they are concluded, will lead to generalized social and ecological destruction. (Applause) GUERMEUR (RDE). - (FR) Mr President, our discus sion on GATT is welcome because it allows us to acclaim the unanimous Council decision to get out of the ",
        "No 3-435/12 Debates of the European Parliament 29. 9. 93 GUERMEUR impasse created by a so-called agreement which set the Council's powers at nought and regarded it as super fluous by describing as an agreement a document not approved by the body lawfully empowered to take decisions in the Community. The so-called agreement also set at nought the Council decision to revise the CAP and to guarantee in the long term the protection of farmers and European agriculture. The Commission itself also recognized that there was a problem with regard to compatibility between Blair House and the revised and reformed CAP. That is particularly true in the agri- monetary field, the safeguard clause, the peace clause, the disposal of stocks, cereal substitutes, assessment of commitments at the end of the period, aggregation of products and growth of the world market. In this respect I deplore the eagerness of certain groups and certain Commission circles to minimize the impor tance of the Council's recognition that Blair House was not acceptable, eagerness to water down The Commis sion's mandate and, according to the Council minutes, to enter into discussions with the United States to obtain an agreement acceptable to all parties. If I read this aright, that means of course, to negotiate an acceptable agree ment which does not yet exist. It is essentially for our Parliament to show its solidarity with the Council as regards the serious reasons for the new task entrusted to the Commission - a concern not to sacrifice the most poverty-stricken, our own poor and those of the third world, a desire not to ruin European agriculture so as to obtain a few concessions which are often illusory since, moreover there will be no machinery to ensure monitoring; the requirement to safeguard the balance of European territory by a rural programme which will avoid serious rents in the fabric of European social cohesion; the clarity of vision which leads us to see for what it is the United States' attempt to dominate the world although, as we know, its leadership is everywhere under attack; our attachment to our European cultural identity, and finally the determination not to allow Europe to be dismembered by an aggressive return of free trade which, as we well know, is the enemy of common policies and of Community preference. For all these reasons, Mr President, and to suit their actions to their words, my friends will vote for the motion for a resolu tion on GATT adopted by the Committee on External Economic Relations, even though certain amendments here and there have tried to reduce its political force and the impact of the text submitted by the Chairman of the Committee on External Economic Relations, Mr Willy De Clercq. (Applause) BARRERA I COSTA (ARC). - (FR) Mr President, the words I have heard from the Commission hardly reassure me and I am disquieted to see Sir Leon Brittan appointed as spokesman for Europe to defend our agriculture. Much as I respect him as a person, that would be appointing a fox to defend the henhouse. I can only say, as I have very little time, that I think it is altogether wrong to claim that the signature of the GATT agreements will benefit the interests of the great majority of European citizens, that signature may allow us to overcome the crisis and reduce unemployment, that not to sign would bring about our technological obsoles cence, that GATT poses a problem for us only as regards agriculture and the audio-visual field, or finally that the only alternative to fresh agreements is simple, harsh protectionism. As I understand it, if the agreements were not signed the status quo, which has nothing protectionist about it, would be maintained. I therefore think that the signature of the agreements envisaged would be a disaster for Europe. Of course there would be a few who would benefit, but in our twelve countries the rich would grow richer and the poor poorer. It is the peripheral countries, the poorest in the Commun ity, which would suffer the most. It would be dangerous for the future of the Community if it were always the poorest who had to pay. (Applause) MARTINEZ (DR). - (FR) Mr President, Mr Steichen, Sir Leon Brittan, I suggest that we start with the facts, with the dossiers, to see the dangers clearly. The first dossier in this GATT affair concerns the audio-visual field. On 17 September 1993 at six in the morning, TNT, the Ted Turner chain, started broadcast ing, that is, 8 500 cartoon films, and 2 500 Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer films which are to wash over 13 million German homes and 100 000 French homes to start with from the European satellite Astra, with all the dangers which in this very place Claude Autant-Lara, to your scorn, denounced long before Depardieu. I would remind you simply that 'Jurassic Park' is being shown at 25% of the 425 French cinemas, showing, moreover the victory of the reptilian brain over the neo-cortex. The second dossier is that of aeronautics, the very symbol of European cooperation on Airbus, aircraft assembled for example in Hamburg with British Aerospace, with Dutch Aerospace - 400 000 jobs at stake. United States aggression is permanent. I would remind you that in 1985 when we sold Airbuses to Air India, we were hauled before the GATT panels. Today the aircraft manufactur ers are in danger. Finally the agricultural dossier. On Monday 20 Septem ber the Jumbo Council took place: it was a question of renegotiating the GATT agreement which holds, I would remind you in five figures, 5, 6, 20, 21 and 36.5% minimum access to our market; a six year peace clause; 20% reduction in our domestic aids; 21 % reduction of our exports in subsidized value; 36% reduction in our exports. All that because of the Blair House agreement. Sir Leon Brittan, I ask you a simple question. Can you provide each of the Members here with the Blair House agree ment? Can you provide a photocopy of the agreement? You cannot do that because the agreement does not exist. Mr Soisson, the French Minister for Agriculture, has just published a book in which he says, on page 87: 'On Friday 19 November 1992, the European negotiators left Blair House without signing any text. Mr Bush's mother had died, so he could not be disturbed. On 7 December 1992 we still had no text'. And today you still have no text! Why? Because in the framework of a multilateral agreement like GATT, you could not sign a bilateral agreement! I refer you - Jean-Pierre Cot is no longer here - to the Vienna Convention on the law of treaties. Let us not dwell on the matter. What does this mean? It means that you are constantly in breach of the Treaty of Rome. You are infringing Article ",
        "29. 9. 93 Debates of the European Parliament No 3-435/13 MARTINEZ 44(2) of the Treaty of Rome on Community preference. It is all coming in - New Zealand lamb, Thai manioc, Brazilian soya, Polish cattle, Chilean grapes, Kenyan green beans, Israeli cauliflowers, mushrooms from Poland, Burgundy snails from Hungary and even Chinese garlic. You are infringing Article 228 of the Treaty on the conclusion of treaties, to which you did not have regard for the Blair House agreement. Article 216 of the Treaty on the fixing of the seat, the European Parliament's seat, could not have been changed except by common accord of the governments. We are the example of the breach. But then, in renouncing the essential chapters of the Treaty of Rome you are renouncing the Treaty itself, and in doing so renouncing the Community it established. With one example upon another of denying equality you have called in question once more the legal foundations of the Community, which destroys legitimacy. The peo ple are no longer following. The farmers blocking the roads, the steel-workers, the miners, the fishermen, the aircraft manufacturers, the textile workers, those in the aeronautics sector, all those who work in the fields, in the factories, even the artists - all of them are challenging this Europe which cannot hold its own but is Japan's Trojan horse for motor-vehicles with British transplants and the United States' Trojan horse for agricultural products. It is no longer the Europe of Jean Monnet, of de Gasperi, of Adenauer, it is Ricardo's Europe. So, Mr President, Sir Leon Brittan, the peoples cannot sacrifice their sovereignty, give up their security. You do not divorce a young, beautiful, rich, kind wife or homeland to go and live with an old, ugly, poor shrew with world ambitions who welcomes to her bed all the merchants, the nomads, the barbarians, with all the inherent health risks, including AIDS. (Applause from the Technical Group of the European Right) RIBEIRO (CG). - (PT) The GATT negotiations are dragging on like a soap opera without heroes, although there is no shortage of villains. The date has again been set for December just as in 1990, but this time on the 15th. This, however, is more an attempt to apply pressure - not to say blackmail - than a simple reference date by which the negotiations can be concluded honourably for all parties. Hypocrisy prevails, illustrating a certain way of behaving in life and in politics. There is talk of transparency and the peoples of the Member States are being inundated with information, turning the Uruguay Round into a sham cockfight, in which semantics seems to overshadow substance. Our side rejects the ambiguity that typifies commitments made in desperation. We reaffirm our opposition to the Blair House preliminary agreement, since we feel that it is incompatible with the CAP reform and that it will aggravate the consequences of the agreement on Com munity agricultural production and the output of farmers. We also stress the need to comply with the forgotten system of community preferences, not in favour of protectionism but to encourage it as an economic activity for utilizing resources. We also emphasize that the GATT negotiations must be global negotiations and not simply agricultural negotia tions, with other issues at stake. Productive activity should prevail over speculative activity. We cannot wipe out national activities - steelmaking or air transport for example - in the name of grand liberal principles, but in the service of transnationalized interests. A sector such as textiles, which is relevant to Community industry and crucial to the economies of the Member States, demands increased discipline, such as the safeguarding and defence of unfair - and in many cases anti-social - competition. This has led to the need to fight for the inclusion of social and economic safeguard clauses that reject the trend towards transnational relocation whose only rationale is the return on capital. Last but not least, we do not accept that culture is a mere good and we demand the recognition of the cultural and audiovisual exception. There will only be a Europe if it is multicultural and multicolored, and not an enormous culturally monochromatic, grey market, in which capital and goods - and only these - move freely whatever their origin, the social conditions under which they were produced or the objectives of their movement. IN THE CHAIR: MR CRAVINHO Vice-President DOMINGO SEGARRA (NI). - (ES) Mr President, gen erally speaking, all of us Members support the negotia tions undertaken by the Commissioners on these difficult agreements that will one day have to be signed in order to conclude the Uruguay Round of GATT. Over the past decades international trade has increased considerably, not only in terms of volume but in the fact that trade is becoming increasingly complex. Services are being introduced into the equation, which are intermixed with distribution mechanisms, payment systems and international financing. At the end of the day, it becomes difficult to identify the geographical origin of a given product. For this reason, it is urgent that we move beyond the Uruguay Round of GATT so that we can lay the foundation for institutions to clearly regulate the rules of the game by which companies and products will have to play. There must be clarity in the rules, for whether you call it an international trade organization or a multilateral trade organization, this institution will also have to be responsible for - and this is not insignificant - redistri buting the global benefits which the GATT agreements are supposed to bring us. It has been said here that it is important to conclude the Uruguay Round of GATT because it will yield benefits. I would say that it will yield global benefits, but also costs - costs which will be hard to swallow at local and sectoral level. Someone will have to redistribute these costs and benefits so that nobody is prejudiced by this type of agreement. The Commission received its mandate from this House to negotiate the GATT agreement on agriculture and within the framework of CAP reform. The Commissioners said earlier that, in the first year of the reform's application, it has not been a failure. Of course it is expected that there will be a reduction in production and surpluses, but I would say that major problems are being caused as regards farmers' incomes - not generally speaking - but primarily farmers in certain areas. It is possible that part of the responsibility lies with the Community and is not ",
        "No 3-435/14 Debates of the European Parliament 29. 9. 93 DOMINGO SEGARRA just due to fear of the GATT agreements, but then the Commission would also have to take responsibility for advancing direct aid for income, compensatory meas ures, and all the policies aimed at compensating for the negative effects that agriculture will surely suffer as a result of the current round of GATT. I believe that the Blair House agreement - as the Commissioner was saying - should be reinterpreted and redefined. Additions should be made and clauses should be introduced, while guaranteeing that at least the spirit of CAP reform will be retained. If concessions have to be made, let them be made in favour of the Third World, whose agricultural exports are their only source of foreign exchange, and which enable them to rise out of underdevelopment. I would prefer to see a part of the Community's cooperation policy channelled towards opening up markets as well as towards the countries of the Third World, and not just to the United States which does not need an influx of foreign exchange from agricultural exports. I would also like to say that I regret the fact that the Blair House agreement did not include social or environmental clauses, since - as the Commissioner will be aware, for it falls within his field of competence - it is difficult to consider that two companies are competing with each other if they have to comply with different criteria governing the regulation of the market. Therefore, equal ity of conditions will continue to be a pipe dream until such time as social and environmental clauses are included. In my opinion, the clause on the cultural exclusion is not negotiable, since culture is an essential issue of crucial significance to the Community. I would like to conclude by saying that it is important that the GATT agreements are signed as soon as possible. I would not say, however, that we should sign just any agreement, for this agreement will regulate future trade for the next few decades. PRESIDENT. - I have received nine motions for resolu tions with a request for an early vote to wind up the debate. (') The vote on the request for an early vote will take place at the end of the debate. RANDZIO-PLATH (PSE). - (DE) Mr President, like a Tibetan prayer wheel, the European Parliament continues to utter its entreaties for a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round, and, in my view, rightly so. Bearing in mind that, in 1992, trade in goods accounted for $ 3,700 billion and trade in services $ 960 billion, we have to be aware in putting our arguments of our responsibility for jobs and for reversing the decline in growth, both of which will be significantly helped along by a successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round. I have to ask why it is that we have not been able to achieve a breakthrough? Is it not the case that the globalization of markets is not being matched by a broadening of the sense of responsibility of all govern ments and that the capacity of the Member States of the European Community to function as a Community must be demonstrated in the form of a clear negotiating mandate? Have we not heard all the heads of government declare, at all G7 meetings, their support for free and fair 1 ) See Minutes world trade, only inevitably to find, when it came to the crunch, a breakdown in the negotiating process and a lack of consistent approach in all 15 important negotiating rounds? I consider it important - and this is why we have genuinely to support the Commission in its continuing and unrelenting endeavours to arrive at compromises - that the Americans should shoulder their responsibility in the same way as the Europeans. And this is a responsibil ity which is not confined to the people in those regions; it relates also to people in the South, who must at last be accorded general market access. What is the point in our professing solidarity with the countries of the South if we then fail to respond to the concession they make to us - in regard to trade in services, for example - by bringing the Uruguay Round to a swift conclusion and thus enabling them rapidly to benefit from those advantages? They have to be able to benefit from them rapidly because the debt burden of the countries of the South is increasing and will not be able to be offset without trade. We also bear responsibility for Eastern Europe here. As far as our own position is concerned, I think it proper that we should demand clarification and an unequivocal interpretation of the Blair House Agreement. The Com munity's farmers are entitled to that! We do not want further dispute - we want clarity and clarification. Also important is the weight attached to agriculture in relation to the other sectors. Think about the problems in the industrial sector. We are faced with difficulties in opening up markets for our products, and the Uruguay Round is therefore of vital significance to us. If we wish to achieve socially and environmentally acceptable pro duction, then we have to argue for socially and environ mentally acceptable trade. That objective will not be able to be attained unless there is a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round. Without it, there will be no possible opening in regard to new world trade issues to which we need urgently to find a solution. We have also to think of consumers who suffer particu larly from the fact that we are unable to achieve more extensive market opening: it is, after all, completely absurd that, in the US, the same quantity of rice costs a third what it costs in Tokyo. It is absurd that we have often to pay more than in other countries for cars we produce in our own countries, or that other industrial goods are offered to consumers only at higher prices. We shall cover all of these aspects when formulating our position and must not therefore call excessively into question compromises that have been reached. The pro posed compromise on the basis of which the House adopted a position at the last plenary on the Blair House Agreement affords a good opportunity of telling the Commission that it is taking the right approach but that it must do all that it can to obtain clarification of the Blair House Agreement and call upon the Americans to make further concessions in other sectors. Allow me a further question on the institution of the GATT. It is my view that there is a lack of democracy in the decision-making processes of the major international organizations. That is not understood and, above all, not accepted in our countries and states. We are seeking clarification on certain points in connection with the Uruguay Round, but we have also to ensure that a ",
        "29. 9. 93 Debates of the European Parliament No 3-435/15 RANDZIO-PLATH minimum of democratic principles are respected in the multilateral world trade system. This too, Sir Leon, is an important responsibility of yours: to listen to what the European Parliament has to say here, to take the message with you and ensure that the negotiations cover not only arbitration proceedings and compromise but that the way to democratic decision- taking is cleared. (Applause) PEIJS (PPE). - (NL) Mr President, it is a real pleasure for me to see you here in the Chair in the first plenary debate in Brussels. Then the Uruguay Round. It has gradually become almost painful to discuss it. Whenever I meet members of the public I tell them that a successful conclusion will give an important stimulus to the economy and to exports, which may offset the heavy economic recession. Our citizens are extraordinarily concerned about the ever-increasing unemployment, and rightly so. How can I explain to them that it is those very government leaders who continually put it in the papers that they are so worried about employment, about the economic situation and about the lack of interest in politics in general and in Europe in particular who are leaving them in the lurch? How can I explain to them that after seven years' hesitation and wrangling there may be a breakdown at the last moment? How do I explain the agriculture problem to textile workers on both sides of the ocean who will certainly lose their jobs, to shipyard workers throughout the world, to people from the footwear industry, from the mines, to the tens of thousands of steel workers every where in the world who lose their jobs, all without compensation? I was recently asked to show my solidarity with the French steel workers in the form of import restrictions from Eastern European countries. I welcomed the soli darity but not the restrictive measures. Members assumed then that the Netherlands had no steel industry. Their ignorance shocked me but, Mr President, now it is really time for solidarity, solidarity with French industrial workers, French employees in the service industries, and perhaps the most important thing in the world, solidarity of American and European farmers for Germans, Dutch, Belgians, in brief with those in jobs and the unemployed in twelve countries of the European Community and countless people in America and the rest of the world. Mr President, I shall not keep mentioning the points at issue, we have dealt with them in countless debates and unfortunately they scarcely change. We shall attain tranquillity in world trade by strict rules and disciplines which we must preserve together. The present GATT secretariat cannot do that. For that we need a multilateral trade organization, with powers. Apart from that, we by no means underestimate the difficult choices which must be made or have actually already been made with regard to agriculture. It is clear that the trading system which will come from a GATT agreement, the reformed CAP and the financial guide lines for agriculture must be compatible with one anoth er. Perhaps that compatibility was not made sufficiently clear at the time of the negotiations. Here the necessary flexibility and courage are demanded from all partici pants but above all from the US and the EC to proceed along the path on which they have started. Because the breakdown of the round brings no advantage for anyone, even for the farmers. I hope the very cautious optimism of the Commissioner is based on genuine goodwill from the Americans. Sir Leon, we are behind the Commission and behind you in particular. DE CLERCQ (LDR). - (NL) Mr President, Mr President of the Council, Members of the Commission, I am glad that the first public debate in a full plenary part-session here in Brussels is dealing with such a topically, politi cally and economically important subject as the GATT discussions. But at the same time I regret the attitude of the Belgian Presidency in refusing to take part in the debate in the first meeting of Parliament in Brussels. The Jumbo Council of 20 September last has averted a serious crisis with the Community, but the problems remain. To solve the problems we must fully recognize that the necessary strength and cogency of the Commun ity depend upon its credibility. The Community's credi bility in turn is determined by unanimity within the Community, by the recognition of the Commission's leading r\u00f4le in conducting the negotiations and the Commission's essential margin of manoeuvre. If those conditions are not met it seems to me difficult indeed to persuade the Americans to show any goodwill about the Blair House agreement. If the Americans think or are convinced that we ourselves do not really know what we want, that we ourselves are hopelessly divided, how are they to make concessions? The conditions I have just mentioned are all the more necessary if we wish to persuade the other trading partners to make better proposals than they have so far made with regard to all dossiers apart from agriculture such as tariff reductions, opening up the market, trade in the services sector or public contracts. Finally I welcome Sir Leon Brittan's statement about the deadline. In fact 15 December 1993 is not a hard and fast condition for the Americans. The Community has always pressed for a quick solution and the date of 15 December has been laid down in common discussion between the more than 100 participants. After seven years' negotia tions it will not be too early to round the whole subject off now in a well balanced way. For this we are counting on the Commission, we are counting above all on you, Mr Chief Negotiator, Sir Leon Brittan, and may we hope that the Council, which is silent here, will speak clearly and positively towards 15 December. VERBEEK (V). - (NL) Mr President, I must confess that I regard this hall, this aquarium, as an insult to ears and eyes - to eyes too, Mr President: you actually need a telescope to see me and I need one to see you. That may well be symbolic for a Europe in which seeing and hearing have been forgotten. Ladies and gentlemen, it must at last be clear to you that the Uruguay Round is a patient in a coma whom we have been trying to revive for seven years and for whom we are now going to have one more go. It must at last have become clear to you large Groups that GATT is a monster which devours everything social, ecological and demo cratic. What you want is the over-confidence of the Tower of Babel and you will not succeed. Once again the Greens are clearly the only realists who dare to say that and you are the visionaries who want to do something impossible at world level. Even if you were to succeed in ",
        "No 3-435/16 Debates of the European Parliament 29. 9. 93 VERBEEK concluding an agreement on 15 December, it would immediately appear that it cannot be carried out. How will you cram 118 economies and then also all the sectors of those economies in one pot and then put a ribbon round them and say: we have an agreement. The actual problem of GATT is that of the rich countries which can get nowhere with their structural over-produc tion and which then want to come with price-cutting on the world market not just by social and ecological dumping but above all with price dumping and then they want to legalize all that and call it a free market. The Greens have another concept; they say: we need a GATT where policy takes social, ecological and demo cratic factors as the starting point and trade as a function of that. That would be a GATT which had the future and the next century in the bag. It is for that that we have tabled our amendments. LANE (RDE). - Mr President, first of all I would refer to the statement I made at the start of today's meeting. I said I had expected a statement from the Council backed up by the figures that the Council are using to show that the Blair House Agreement does not go beyond the terms of CAP reform. We have not got those figures even though I asked for them as long as seven months ago in Stras bourg. However, the depression now affecting most developed countries will not be ended until a new impetus is given to world trade. The conclusion of the GATT Round in mid-December is vital if our ever-rising unemployment numbers are to be halted and reversed. Many industries and services, especially multi-national companies, will not invest in new developments until the future of world trade is secure. Therefore the Parliament, Council and Commission must combine efforts to seek a solution to outstanding issues. However, for Ireland we still await clarification on three elements of the Blair House Agreement. These relate to the selling off of the present 1 million tonnes of intervention beef products, which should not be part of the 21% cutback. The Community must have the right to donate food aid also outside any cutbacks. Finally, the phasing-in of the beef agreement should be in Years 5 and 6, not in Years 1 and 2.1 believe that if we can get that three-fold clarification then the Blair House Agreement will in fact not go beyond the terms of CAP reform and will be acceptable to the European Community. BLANEY (ARC). - Mr President, in my view CAP reform is the beginning of the end of our farming community as we have known it in countries such as my own. GATT, if concluded as intended, will spell the total end of everything we have known and the Blair House Agreement that so much is talked about is nothing less than a hijack of the small farms and family farms. The imports from America in particular must be deplored. The Americans do support their agriculture. They have cut nothing. But we have. We have cut our farmers to the bone and we now propose to cut them by a further 21 % so far as our exports are concerned. Unemployment has risen to an unprecedented figure. Those who would have us believe that the conclusion of the Uruguay Round will create employment should stop kidding themselves and, above all, stop kidding the people whose livelihood depends on the land of our Community. BRITO (CG). - (PT) Mr President, Members, Mr Com missioner, it is important to bear in mind that neither the current GATT rules nor those that are now on the negotiating table will establish equitable market rela tions, correct imbalances in the distribution of the bene fits and development of knowledge and technical and scientific resources, or reduce asymmetry among the regions, or even reduce the increasing dependence and strangulation of the economies and sovereignty of the least developed countries. On the contrary, in these countries we are witnessing a worsening situation of food dependency, trade balance deficits and foreign debt, while producers are committed to extremely low levels of pay and to the systematic expropriation of their resources and added value. This is especially true in agriculture, and it is in this context that Community agriculture should be linked to the GATT agreements. If truth be told, what the Community is doing now and what the Commission is proposing to us is to consolidate the inequity that dominates North-South relations, subor dinating it to the interests of the United States. I am astonished that instead of opting to correct the inequities currently shaping market relations, and thus enable the economic, productive and social development of under developed countries or populations, the Commission is opting to impose patterns of competitiveness that are unacceptable to European farmers, with the aggravating result that the currency of barter is not at all the same value for each of the twelve Member States. The question is whether, in the GATT negotiations, the interests and rights of the people are being borne in mind, or rather the interests of the agri-food multinationals. The Community's economic model is being drained. The economic model of North-South relations is draining the already fragile or dying economies of underdeveloped countries and now threatens to drain Community agricul ture. GERAGHTY (NI). - Mr President, I welcome the recent indication from the Commission that the log jam in the Uruguay Round negotiations may be about to be broken. At this time of very serious recession and rising unem ployment, I believe that failure to conclude an agreement would have incalculable consequences. I believe we cannot afford another trade war arising from the lack of a proper perspective on the relative importance of the different sectors of our economy. To date, it appears that agriculture has been given the top political priority by many of the Member States. But there are many other sectors that are concerned in these negotiations and that would be in serious jeopardy if we do not conclude the right type of agreement. For example, what are we doing about social and environmental dumping? How are we going to counteract those? Will there be an insistence on a proper and effective social clause which would guaran tee trade union rights, which would also ensure that we had fair balance within the agreement? I am well aware of the importance of agriculture to France and, indeed, to Ireland, but there is concern about the impact of the Blair House Agreement. I believe we must not give a disproportionate emphasis to that particu lar sector. I would also like to hear the opinion of the Commission and Council on some recent speculation that there will not be any change in the Blair House Agreement but that the problem might be dealt with by additional funds from ",
        "29. 9. 93 Debates of the European Parliament No 3-435/17 GERAGHTY the agricultural budget within the EC under some other heading. If there is any truth in that speculation, perhaps we could be enlightened as to where that money would come from. At present the CAP is absorbing 50% of the budget and that is ECU 36 billion. It is already set to exceed that guideline by close to ECU 2 billion in the current year, with the Commission and Council being very coy about where that money is going to be found. Any further transfer of funds from the existing budget would be nothing short of an outrage given the enormous sums, much of them already wasted, that have been spent in that sector. I am particularly incensed that we are now contemplating a major cut in other social operations in the current budget. Cuts of 30% are proposed to the amount allocated last year, for example, to actions to combat poverty within the Community. We are having a reduction of two-thirds in the amount proposed by the Commission for actions promoting equality between men and women, the elimination of allocations to actions in favour of migrant workers and immigrants, and a cut of one-third in the support for industrial relations and social dialogue and the promotion of meetings between trans-national employee representatives. So much for social Europe and the fight against inequal ity within the Community and globally. There will, I am certain, be a major battle on many of these issues when we come to debate the budget. In that context, I warn against any backdoor deals which would placate a small section of agriculture, be it in France or in Ireland, at the expense of the larger sections who depend on industrial employment in the industries and services of the Com munity. I wish the negotiations well and I hope they can secure agreement before the 15 December deadline. But above all we want a balanced trade agreement which protects the environment, eliminates social dumping, tackles the unemployment problem and gives a boost to our econo my which is badly needed at this time of economic recession. COLINO SALAMANCA (PSE). - (ES) Mr President, it would be worthwhile to reiterate that the Commission can count on the support of this House for finalizing the Uruguay Round negotiations. However, I still think it is necessary to make a few clarifications at this juncture. The Commissioner mentioned the interest shown by the Council in finishing the negotiations by 15 December, but the Council also emphasized the need - as did this House - to finalize the negotiations under conditions satisfactory to all parties. In other words, it is not merely a matter of concluding by 15 December, but of concluding in a manner that satisfies all the parties concerned. In this connection, there is some doubt as to whether this will actually be the case. Perhaps this is due to the lack of information, at least with respect to the issue of agricul ture, which is of interest to me. This House's Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Rural Development mentioned yesterday that we still did not know the exact content of the Blair House agreement. We cannot measure what this agreement will mean for European agriculture nor ascertain whether it is compati ble with the recent CAP reform. Nor can we know what will happen with the non- reformed sectors of the Community - whether or not, and in what form, they will be bound by the new agreements, since the Commission has been changing its position since 1986. The rebalancing formula, for example, has been abandoned. Now there is talk of a 'cautionary' clause, or a 'consultation' clause, but no more talk of 'rebalancing'. In any case, we need complete information from the Commission so that not only the Members of Parliament but also the rural and farming population of Europe can give these negotiations their blessing. CHABERT (PPE). - (FR) Mr President, naturally we are in favour of concluding the GATT agreements. However, it is not just when we are taking stock of the difficulties to be overcome to bring seven years of negotiations to an end in 77 days that we should lose sight of certain essential facts, above all, if I may say so, on the last straight. Much has already been said about the economic and agricultural sections, so in the time allowed me I should like simply to make two political observations and to tackle the problem of the cultural exception. First remark on the matter of GATT, it was essential for the Council to adopt a unanimous position on 20 Septem ber last. We have enough problems to overcome in view of the unprecedented crisis that we are experiencing without an additional fresh political crisis. The European citizens and our 17 or 20 million unemployed would not understand. That unity which demands a great capacity for mutual understanding is more necessary than ever for continuing the negotiations. Ssecondly, some people are astonished that we should defend our positions staunchly and with determination and that we should regard the interests of the peoples of Europe as essential. But what is more natural? If we do not defend for ourselves what we regard as essential, who will do it for us? So do not let us be swayed by those who sing of altruism. Let us just be ourselves, in favour of development of world trade and careful to keep our place on that scene. What point would there be, moreover, in the United States or the rest of the world weakening Europe when the world situation, particularly in Central Europe, and the eastern or ACP countries, need us to show greater solidarity? The cultural exception brings us to the heart of an essential question, not only our Europeanness but our very identity. In fact it is impossible to regard cultural products as everyday, interchangeable goods. It is true that powerful economic forces are the winners, but in this field to let the market operate freely would be to ignore the unbalanced nature of such competition against our culture. If audience ratings alone are to dictate the content of audio-visual works, if the writing-off of a production by the greatest number of spectators is to become the sole criterion of quality, then at every turn we shall be re-enacting the story of the earthenware pot versus the iron pot and we shall be losing a part, I would risk saying the essential part, of our soul. Mr Commissioner, we see the enormity of your task within the framework of your mandate. We also know your gifts. May they successfully serve a more cooper ative world, finding again the way to a more fairly- distributed progress which is able to retain the values which are the basis of a humanism to which our continent is so attached. ",
        "No 3-435/18 Debates of the European Parliament 29. 9. 93 PORTO PORTO (LDR). - (PT) Mr President, the delay in the conclusion of the Uruguay Round is causing sensitive problems in the world economy, and especially sensitive problems - it should be stressed - in the Community economy. We have long had a tradition of being open, with the ensuing global advantages that nobody can seriously doubt. Now, on the eve of a new century in which economic spaces are being reinforced in America and Asia - as in Europe - having greater prospects for growth than ours, any separation would be dangerous - especial ly for us, since we would be the main victims. Within this context, it would be seriously naive to think that in Europe and the surrounding area we have a valid alternative to this proposition. Without prejudicing the increased commitment that we must have here, we must bear in mind the different dimension and the different demands made by these markets, with the result that we will be most harmed if we fall out of the front ranks of world competition. In defending this position we are in no way defending a position of weakness in the negotiations. It is obvious that, since the general level of European protection is lower, we are all entitled to demand from others a reciprocal attitude of trade openness. However, it is unacceptable that, among ourselves, the interests of particular sectors should overshadow the general inter ests of consumers and the transformation industry as a whole, thus calling into question the trade opportunities of sectors which, on the whole, are much more significant to the economy and the Community labour force. In terms of balance, we feel that the proposal for a resolution for an agreement does not deviate from the correct path to be followed, and we should welcome the fact that the inauguration of this h\u00e9micycle in Brussels has been marked with the adoption of this position on such a sensitive issue, and one of such great importance to Europe and world progress. FREMION (V). - (FR) Mr President, since finding out what is planned for culture and the audio-visual sector in the GATT negotiations, we are in favour of the cultural exception - that is, we are in favour of negotiating these questions separately. The Greens, like other Groups, agreed in July to a mere mention of the specific nature of culture so that Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan might leave with an almost unanimous mandate and not with the impression that we were in disagreement. The politi cal Groups in favour of liberalism were then opposed to the term 'exception'. So we were surprised to see the French ministers of the same political tendency support ing with all their might in the past few weeks this exception which their friends here did not want. Let us rejoice that from now on we may see everyone defending it alongside the thousands of creative artists, producers, performers, but also broadcasters and distri butors in all countries in the world, including the United States. Such unanimity in the cultural world, which is unique in our history, has for the first time aroused the enthusiasm of artists and intellectuals for what is happen ing here. This debate will make its mark in cultural history. We, elected European representatives, must today, whatever our pre-conceived ideas about GATT and the state of negotiations, make ourselves the expres sion of this unanimity. For that reason, we ask that, over and above the minimum principle of the exception, the Community should undertake to defend in its entirety the directive on television without frontiers, the principle of quotas and above all the moral right of authors. I shall end with a wish: this agreement is coming in for so much criticism today, and not only in Europe, that in view of American obstinacy one ends up simply hoping that it will fail. Thus we might perhaps reopen negotiations on proper foundations and might succeed in building some thing other than a world subject only to the law of the market, that is, the law of the jungle. KILLILEA (RDE). - Mr President, despite what some speakers have said about the CAP reform, we need to remember it is the very first year of its operation, it is being successful, it is the first time in five years that we have had a stable market in the products that are impor tant to our country, notably sheep and beef meat. At every opportunity this Parliament has asked the Commission to give us the figures, if they exist, to show that the Blair House Agreement does or does not go beyond CAP reform. For my part.I have never been aware of such figures. I think it is about time the Commission circulated the figures to Parliament, figures which in my opinion are not inconsistent with the CAP reform. By so doing it will help the GATT negotiations to come to a conclusion in December. I think nothing was more silly than that the Council of Ministers last week sent Sir Leon Brittan off to America. He was not to renegotiate the Blair House Agreement but to seek clarification and amplification. I want to know from the Council today what exactly they meant by sending our Commissioner across to America to discuss such matters. They would have done better to send a fax to the American Government rather than waste the time of a man who has very important business to attend to. So I say, if it be to the benefit of the people of Europe that we have a GATT agreement by December, let us - Council, Commission and Parliament - tackle the matter and get it settled forthwith. Ib CHRISTENSEN (ARC). - (DA) Mr President, I hope that with the Commission's open mandate there will be an end to French protectionism blocking the way to a conclusion of the GATT negotiations. Not even French protectionism - or protectionism on the part of some other countries - can prevent a successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round when it comes to the deadline in December. The liberalization of world trade which is envisaged will be able to set in motion the whole world economy to the benefit of all, but particularly the third world. It will help employment, prosperity and welfare. The EC must adapt itself so that we open our markets to the rest of the world, especially Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and the Maghreb countries, otherwise the stream of economic refugees will grow even more. We must avoid a division of the world into contending trade blocs, but that will happen if the GATT negotiations break down. The development of a North Atlantic free-trade area or the conversion of the OECD into a great free-trade area may be a durable and constructive way forward. EPHREMIDIS (CG). - (GR) Mr President, to begin with I would like to ask a question: ",
        "29. 9. 93 Debates of the European Parliament No 3-435/19 EPHREMIDIS If we were to print the full texts of the talks held by the two Commissioners and hand them out to the Commun ity's farmers, to the workers, to small and medium businesses, to professional craftsmen and to the Com munity's young people, how would they respond? 'We do not understand any of this!' 'Long on words, short on meaning', as we say in Greece about such cases. And I would add that this is not by chance. It is a deliberate attempt, by vagueness, to try to beautify the unpleasant situation created by the amend ment, for example, of the CAP. The agreement signed with the USA by the two Commissioners will worsen the situation, especially to the disadvantage of small and medium farmers, but also to the cost of employment generally within the Community and against our trading performance. And they are hiding that from us, together with the fact that the Commissioners did not dare to tell us openly that if this is a bad agreement which is likely to become still worse when the Round is completed, that will be because of the arrogance, the intransigence and the dominance of the United States. Why are you pretending otherwise? Why do you not come clean? Yet, there are forecasts that unless the negotiations are successful and the Round is completed, disasters will follow and there will be no progress. This is just scaremongering. The problem is not whether or not the Round of talks will be completed, but before that happens, to safeguard the interests of the Community and its working people. Otherwise, you yourselves will be undermining the future of the Community's agricultural economy, the future of employment in the whole of our area, where the number of unemployed is now 20 million and on its way towards 25 million. For those reasons, Mr President, we oppose these state ments because they do not address the essence of the problems. BENOIT (PSE). - (FR) Mr President, Mr Commissioner, we are engaged in negotiations the details of which when they are concluded will be decisive for the future of Europe, for its economic capacity and for its trade capacity. I do not want to go back over the past, but I cannot regard the pseudo-agreement of Blair House as an example of diplomatic genius and political effectiveness. But this pseudo-agreement exists and we are obliged to discuss it. Nor do I want to discuss semantics. We are not re negotiating, but if the Commissioner goes to Washington that indicates that he is continuing to negotiate. I some times have difficulty in distinguishing between renego tiation and the continuance of negotiations, because if we continue to negotiate so as to change nothing, to improve nothing, I do not see the point of the dialogue. Having said that, I have two questions: what does Parliament expect from you, Mr Commissioner, and what can you be exepcting from Parliament? The European Council, the Jumbo Council, has rightly avoiding piling crisis on crisis after the monetary disturbances and the uncertainties of the political, economic and monetary union of Europe. A compromise had to be found. But this compromise sets limits and definitions, not to speak of a fresh mandate, and we are expecting the Commissioner to be the strict, watchful mouthpiece of this Council and of the interests of Europe, which must be an equal partner to the United States, determined to be respected just as it can respect the commitments of others. What can you be expecting of this Parliament, Mr Commissioner? You cannot be expecting an encomium before things have been concluded. I have sometimes been surprised to hear some Members, even from my own Group, falling enthusiastically into step, with nego tiations which are not concluded. This Parliament needs to reaffirm clearly, which I hope it will do tomorrow, a number of principles which must guide and conclude these negotiations, perhaps on 15 December if things go well. What are these principles? The first principle is a global and balanced agreement, acceptable to everyone, because a partial agreement is of no value unless the Council's and Parliament's negotia tors know the whole of it. The second principle is that on the sensitive dossiers centred on the markets, public contracts, tariff peaks, aeronautics, in short, Europe must demonstrate its capac ity and be watchful in defence of its interests. It must do the same on the cultural problem and I am a little worried about the concept of cultural specificity, as you cleverly define it, Mr Commissioner. I prefer cultural exception because it has a legal basis, Article 14 of GATT. Upon the identity, upon the cultural capacity of Europe depend in a way, its freedom of choice and its political future. These are the few principles on which you should negotiate and Parliament must say so clearly. That is the best help we can give you, by supporting you without approving in advance, before we know the result of your efforts. CHANTERIE (PPE). - (NL) Mr President, Members of the Commission, Mr President of the Council, I should like to call your attention to the enormous importance of the GATT negotiations for the European clothing and textile sector. Here there is indeed a great deal at stake. With a mere three million employees, the European Community textile and clothing industry is one of our most important industrial sectors. It is generally accepted that it is necessary to integrate this sector gradually into GATT. I am convinced that the interests of the European textile and clothing industry are served by a gradual liberalization of trade in clothing and textile products. In general the European industry is competitive and easy to adapt to improved export possibilities on the world market. The European Community has a clear and important supply, particularly with the further opening up of the European market, that is, an integrated market with 340 million consumers, the largest in the world. The conditions under which this supply operates should also be clear, namely mutual opening up of the markets of the United States and other trading partners and strengthen ing of the GATT rules and disciplines with a view to fair competition. We have already repeatedly put this propo sition before the European Parliament and the joint Council of Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Agriculture in its resolution of 21 September last subscribed to this view. The great question today, Mr Commissioner, is whether these are to be mere words. Taking stock of the negotiations in progress we must say that at the moment the conditions mentioned are not met. The first stumbling block is the unwillingness of the United States to open up their market. In spite of the positive decisions of the G7 meeting in Tokyo, the ",
        "No 3-435/20 Debates of the European Parliament 29. 9. 93 CHANTERIE proposals put on the table by the US negotiators remain completely unacceptable and do not come anywhere near the aim of reducing the highest tariffs by 50%. The unwillingness of the United States to make a significant move towards the opening up of the markets is in striking contrast with the US argument for liberalization which is made so emphatically in other dossiers. For clothing and textile products the European Community is the world's greatest and most liberal market. Half the imports are free of import duties. For the other half of the imported products tariffs are very low. In the US on the other hand tariffs amount to 47%; this can no longer be justified. The second main point is that of the opening up of the markets of other trading partners. We recognize that at present there are still very great market disturbances. According to GATT figures India exports 2 900 million dollars' worth of clothing to the European Community, but no clothing products may be imported from the European Community. It is the same for Pakistan and China. There are great imbalances too with regard to Australia, Indon esia and South America. That is an intolerable situation and I ask, Mr Commissioner, what the Commission's attitude will be if the objective of the opening up of the markets is not attained. The third stumbling-block is that of the strengthening of GATT rules and disciplines. Here we are speaking of non-tariff barriers to trade, import tariffs, subsidization and so on. Once more I wish to emphasize that a satisfactory agreement with regard to both content and timing is a sine qua non for free trade in clothing and textiles. This condition is still not fulfilled. I ask the Commission what initiatives it will take to move in this direction. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is of the greatest importance for a global GATT agreement to be con cluded towards the target date of 15 December. The European social and economic context only makes this task more urgent. There is only one answer to the ever-louder cry for protectionist measures: free and fair world trade. But all parties must contribute to it. The Community must in no circumstances allow itself to be enticed into a unilateral step, otherwise it will put millions of jobs at stake. (Applause from the EPP Group) DE VRIES (LDR). - (NL) Mr President, there is great concern in Europe about the import from Asia of products manufactured in low-wage areas. There is also much concern about products which are manufactured cheaply by paying too little attention to environmental require ments. Without a GATT agreement and multilateral discussions in this sphere we shall be unable to deal with these problems. There is a lot of anxiety about a tendency to bilateralism and unilateralism in American trade poli cy. Without a GATT agreement we shall never be able to resist these tendencies. There is great anxiety in Central and Eastern Europe about the lack of readiness in the west to support Central and Eastern Europe economically by means of liberalization of trade. Without a GATT agreement we can no longer offer any hope to our neighbours in the east. There is exceptional concern, Mr President, about the 23 million unemployed in our part of the world; nowadays there are additional thousands by the day. Without a GATT agreement and the resulting stimulus to the international economy, this problem cannot be effective ly tackled. The economic arguments for a GATT agree ment are overwhelming, but the political arguments are perhaps even more important and I shall mention two of them. Without a GATT agreement, an agreement which will not come through closing off the European Com munity, this European Community will be plunged into a crisis which it has not experienced since it was esta blished: the political crisis which would be the result of the European Community's lack of capacity to accumulate a qualified majority for a GATT agreement, a crisis which cannot be overcome by a Treaty of Maastricht and would delay European inte gration for years. There would be consequences in the sphere of security. The failure of a GATT agreement as a result of the failure of the European Community and the US to come to an agreement would undoubtedly deliver an extremely ser ious blow to NATO as an effective military organization. It is an illusion to think that the American Congress is ready to send troops to trouble spots on our continent if we do not conclude this GATT agreement. Mr President, these arguments must also apply to a country such as France, France which rightly attaches great importance to the Community as a political organi zation. We shall make ourselves the laughing-stock of the world if we are not able to conclude this agreement... (The President cut the speaker off) DE LOS SANTOS LOPEZ (ARC). - (ES) Mr President, the conditions imposed since 1986 on the GATT negotia tions will actually determine the type of Common Agri cultural Policy reform that we approve. Other arguments will undoubtedly be wielded to justify this reform, which itself represents a 180 degree about-face in the Common Agricultural Policy. However, the disproportionate size of the reform has been imposed on us from outside the Community, by a power that is greater than our own. The repercussions of this change - which, as I said, has been imposed - on Europe as a whole have led to an unprecedented log-jam in the completion of European political union. The answer from our citizens was so illuminating that, at the end of the day, a certain Member State wanted to go so far as to renegotiate the Blair House agreement. The Community's proven inability to create a genuine supranational power enabling it to negotiate on equal terms with the United States reveals a negotiating weak ness that allows American interests to prevail over our own. In fact, the Blair House agreement means the end of Community agriculture and the destruction of Europe's entire rural community, something which our society has said it is not prepared to accept. ROUMELIOTIS (PSE). - (GR) Mr President, the world's economy, and more particularly Europe's, are in a phase of dangerous recession that is bringing increased unemployment. The monetary crisis is threatening world trade because of the danger of competitive devaluations. The Community itself is at risk of falling into disorgani zation unless it deals in a coordinated way with the double menace of recession and monetary crisis. Furthermore, the Community must as soon as possible become party to a more general agreement on the freeing of international trade. Protectionism is no solution to the difficult structural problems of Europe's economy. ",
        "29. 9. 93 Debates of the European Parliament No 3-435/21 ROUMELIOTIS Today, Community products encounter many barriers when they try to penetrate other markets, especially the American and the Japanese. It is a fact that while the Community fully deregulated the market for telecommu nications equipment from 1st January 1993, the United States continue to restrict the corresponding Community products in their own market. The anti-dumping policy has become a way to discourage European steel exports. The Community's aircraft industry is threatened by exclusion because it has made itself more competitive than its American counterpart. Japan remains a market closed to many European products, and direct investment in Japan is very difficult for European companies to achieve. For these reasons I believe that the Community will gain from the freeing of international trade, always provided that it strives to secure the reciprocity that it must demand from the United States and Japan, not just formally but in substance as well, in other words, in practice. Only in that way will we be able to make up lost ground, particularly in the sectors of industry and the services, the only ones that can offer the promise of a better future. IN THE CHAIR: MR BARZANTI Vice-President ELLES (PPE). - Mr President, in recent debates in the Community many have felt that we should try to resolve our problems internally by looking at job creation and social legislation to promote growth while leaving aside the trade agenda as a secondary priority. I do not support that particular approach. I am one of those who believe that the best way to restore vigour in our economies is to complete the GATT Round as soon as possible, preserv ing a traditional international perspective to our trading relationship. There are no bonus points for a further delay as some might want; no prizes for failure. On the contrary, there is a real danger that we will face the collapse of the multilateral trading system and we will then be unleashing irresistible protectionist pressures which will also affect our own fragile creation of the single European market. Three points in particular to the Commission: firstly, on procedure. Should you be successful in concluding a deal on 15 December, Commissioner, what are the difficulties that are likely to be encountered in ratification? Is the process to be concluded at ministerial level? Are we likely to fall into another Heysel disaster, not of the footballing kind but of the negotiating kind? What is the date for the final implementation of this agreement? Secondly, on agriculture. We have a problem here of a long-term negotiation. Blair House was concluded nearly a year ago and we are now faced with internal problems, such as Commissioner Steichen referred to on monetary questions, which are not of a transatlantic nature. And yet Commissioner Steichen did not tell us what the budgetary cost of monetary movements would be. Is this going to be an additional budgetary cost in 1994? We on the Budgets Committee would certainly like to know. Above all in agriculture we should realise it is an on-going process and as the Centre for European Policy Studies has just revealed, the Copenhagen Summit with its extension of the Community to Central and Eastern Europe will mean that agriculture will continue to be reformed. We cannot avoid this process. Lastly, I endorse the comments made by my colleague, Mr de Vries, on the risks of not concluding the Round. They extend beyond the economic into the political and strategic area. Early in the New Year we have a Nato Summit. It is quite clear that if we do not reach a GATT agreement, the way in which the Americans will approach that Nato Summit will compromise the form of our security arrangements in Europe for a long time to come. I would therefore join with those who have urged in this House this evening that we should put our trust in our negotiators. We should not prejudge them before they have concluded. I urge our negotiators to come back with a successful agreement which we in the House can then applaud on behalf of the European peoples. (Applause) VAN PUTTEN (PSE). - (NL) Mr President, as rapporteur on behalf of the Committee on Development and Coop eration I think it is a good thing to discuss GATT and its importance for the developing countries. A number of things are often overlooked in debate. In the first place, in the Punta del Este declaration the following English text was adopted, Mr Commissioner; it is very impressive and I hope you are listening. 'In order to ensure effective application of differen tial and more favourable treatment, the group of negotiators on goods shall, before the formal comple tion of the negotiations, conduct an evaluation of the results attained therein in terms of the objectives and the general principles governing negotiations as set out in the declaration, taking into account all issues of interest to least-developed contracting parties.' There you see the interests of the developing countries. It is very questionable whether the developing countries will be treated in this way. Amongst the general princi ples it was also recorded, and now I am reading from a Dutch translation of the Punta del Este declaration: 'that the negotiations must be conducted in a transparent manner, that developed countries shall not expect devel oping countries to make contributions which are not in accordance with their needs in the sphere of develop ment, finance, services and trade, and that special atten tion shall be devoted to the situation and problems of the least developed countries and the extension of their opportunities for trade', again a quotation from the actual Punta del Este texts. In the third place the OECD has calculated that with a tariff reduction of 30% in the agriculture sector a total world-wide increase in income of 195 000 million dollars would be produced by the year 2002. That contrasts, according to the OECD, with a net loss of 7 000 million dollars for the African countries to the south of the Sahara. I should have liked to say more but as the Committee on Development we do not of course get sufficient speaking time on this subject. The world must in any case take the developing countries into account in the negotiations in accordance with the Punta del Este declaration and there is still hope that what I have written here will not apply to the present plan. ",
        "No 3-435/22 Debates of the European Parliament 29. 9. 93 McCARTIN McCARTIN (PPE). - Mr President, I too can express absolute confidence in our negotiators, Sir Leon Brittan and Mr Steichen, and hope that they will work out a final agreement. Of course I cannot give unconditional support to that agreement. In this situation we have our hopes and concerns. Some people have expressed the hopes, but there are also concerns to be expressed. I would have liked, when we expressed the hope that we will generate growth, increase employment and increase the volume of trade, that we could define it a little bit better and say exactly where we expect the growth to occur, where the benefits for the Community are and where the losses are. I think there are gains and there are losses. Looking at the agriculture situation and envisaging a reduction of 15% to 10% in exports or even a reduction of 30%, as is suggested in one sector - the beef sector - plus an increased penetration of our markets, I can well imagine that we might have a reduction of perhaps 1 million jobs in that particular sector. Upstream and downstream you can add at least 2 million jobs. We should ask ourselves what is the economic growth that we require, considering the relationship between economic growth and gains in employment, to replace these 3 million jobs which we can expect to lose as a result of the Blair House Agree ment. I have a suspicion that in fact the gains will be mainly in the capital-intensive high-tech areas and the losses will be in agriculture and labour-intensive sectors. The gains will be in the richer areas and the losses will be in the poorer areas. I have to say that I admire the fortitude and loyalty of the French Government to its rural areas and its farming and food sector. Their concerns have been well documented and well represented. Everybody knows what French agriculture stands to lose, but ljust want to draw the line and say that the constituency that I represent stands to lose far more in relation to the size of its economy than the French does. Our government has not given its support to the French Government in their stand to bring about the sort of improvements that Sir Leon mentioned in the Blair House deal to make it acceptable to European farmers. I regret that the Irish Government has not supported its farmers because, perhaps, of the slight embarrassment they felt that an ex-colleague, an ex-member of an Irish Government, had in fact negotiated the Blair House deal. Nevertheless, that deal was not satisfactory from an Irish farmer's point of view and I want to say that the losses that will occur throughout this Community in the rural world will occur in a greater proportion in the Irish economy than elsewhere. That is my concern. I look forward to a successful conclusion. I trust our negotia tors. I know they will not let down either urban or rural Europe easily and I hope we will have a more orderly world trading situation when this matter is concluded. DELCROIX (PSE). - (FR) Mr President, Mr Commis sioner, in public opinion the Europeans are often accused of altruism, probably because the European market repre sents the most open economic area in the world. If Japan is an oyster, we are a sponge. Our people say that we pay for this altruism in unemployment: figures: 17 million today, 20 million tomorrow. All too frequently we cite world crisis to justify our selves, refusing to understand that the problem lies elsewhere, that there is a real change in the world economy. A crisis deals a harsh blow, then things return to what they previously were. Things will never return to what they were. We cannot hope to resolve our problems by enclosing ourselves in a narrow protectionism which would isolate us from the rest of the world and give us a false sense of internal security, but for how long? We must therefore go along with the world distribution of work and resources, proclaiming our values, our specific nature, our identity, but are we capable of this, are we not too cloistered? Our attitude must be clear as regards the Uruguay Round. Yes, we should like to show solidarity with world development and our solidarity will be expressed first towards the weakest. No, we shall not be naive and we shall refuse unbalanced trade. We shall say no to social dumping because the social dimension is a fundamental value in our society. No to environmental dumping, for we wish to consider seriously the needs of the sustainable economy. No to all forms of dumping, in its most recent forms and in monetary dumping. The debate on GATT forces us to recognize that the building of Europe, as we find it today, based solely on the pillar of the economy, is a failure, and to state, also in the debate on GATT, the need to consider simultaneously the economy and the social, environmental and cultural factors. If we are weak we shall not be able to use GATT to express our solidarity with the rest of the world. von WOGAU (PPE). - (DE) Mr President, Commission er, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by expressing to the Commissioner our appreciation for having provided us with such comprehensive information. It is a good thing that this debate has taken place in the House in the light of the concerns that have been expressed in the various countries of the European Community. It has also been brought home to us on this occasion how much stronger we are because, despite all the difficulties, the European Community has established a joint negotiating mandate; and how much stronger is the European Com munity at the negotiations than would have been the case had France, Germany, Italy and the rest been negotiating separately. While we do have a common position on the basis of Blair House, further clarification and additional elements are needed. The economy being my subject, I also take the view that this GATT agreement should not be signed at the expense of agriculture. I consider it particularly important that the regional aids - which are land- and farm-specific - should be outside the Blair House agreement, as this is where the future of our agricultural policy lies. We also need further clarification concerning the import of feedingstuffs from the US. It will not be possible to give a final assessment of the agreement until the whole pack age is on the table and we can see what it looks like, what has been able to be agreed, whether Europe's cultural specificity has been able to be preserved and what has been agreed on textiles and services. We have again to realize that what we are currently experiencing in Europe is not a short-term economic crisis but that this is crisis that is very much structural in nature. The successful conclusion of the GATT can provide an impetus and demonstrate that the European Community is not partitioning itself off from the outside world - and that is particularly important to the peripher al regions of the Community, because they would suffer most from a policy of that kind. ",
        "29. 9. 93 Debates of the European Parliament No 3-435/23 FANTUZZI FANTUZZI (PSE). - (IT) Mr Commissioner, the optim ism of your intentions sustains us and we should like to give you our full support to conclude this episode, in the knowledge that such an uncertain and precarious state of affairs cannot go on too long. I think some points must be stressed, for example the fact that it has been decided to stick to the intention to conclude by 15 December and to regard the agricultural chapter closed only when everyth ing is closed and the Community's other partners have taken some steps forward in their turn. However, there is nothing to be too confident about, because the way this affair has been managed does not seem to me to be an exemplary page in the Community's more recent history. France has not only backed up its farmers' protest, but has added to it, and now I wonder whether the result obtained, namely the recognition of a political problem within the country, which moreover was obvious for sime time, will be sufficient to bring the whole European front together in a way which will not be purely temporary or tactical. But I am not one of those who think that the whole responsibility falls on France alone. The Commis sion too, in my view, has shown weak points, in particular the inability to bring effective political management to the Blair House preliminary agreement with the United States as regards the Community countries and to present in time an economic proposal which would give some body to the margins of discretion which the agreement reserved to the Community for internal compensatory payments. Now everything must be done at top speed and we hope that the time between now and 15 December will be used not to grant more to this or that country which has protested the most in exchange for a last minute assent, but to do what is still possible from the point of view of the clarity and transparency of the line we are pursuing. B\u00d6GE (PPE). - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentle men: one thing is clear - all in this House want to see a global and fair GATT compromise in the interest of an expanding and flourishing world economy. But, Com missioner Brittan, the big mistake of which the European Community was guilty from the start was to play along, that is to act as if the fate of the world economy depended solely and exclusively on reaching a deal in the agricul tural sector. That meant that we had already lost half the battle. This too is apparent: some 9% of world trade concerns agricultural products, and the positive expan sion of the world economy is above all dependent on our reaching a sensible outcome in other sectors, some of which we are seeking to bring into the GATT for the first time. I have therefore three questions to put to you, Commis sioner, and I would ask you to answer them. We are, of course, insisting that we should at long last be provided with the actual wording, the exact text of the Blair House agreement with all the points covered in it. Secondly, it is important that you, as the Commission representative, should answer the following question of public interest: how do matters stand in other areas such as services, finance, shipping and telecommunications? Are the negotiations already producing results in these difficult areas, in such a way that you are able to say: we are in a position to conclude a preliminary agreement compara ble to the Blair House compromise? Political fairness demands that it be made clear to the public how much progress we have made in the agricul tural sector and what problems and difficulties remain in other areas. Commissioner, it is the small things that cause the problems. The common agricultural policy is still suffering from the fact that the repercussions of some details of the Dillon Round were not properly worked out in advance. The substitutes are an example of this: we now import 10 million tonnes; we also import one million tonnes of nitrogen and 500,000 tonnes of phosphates which are pumped into the European Community's environmental cycle. That too is an important element. I should like also to remind the House that the oil seed panel was set up only because the US decided, in the early seventies, to impose an oil seed boycott; it was only as a consequence of that that the Community gave a massive boost to its oil seed production. As far as the technical details of the rules on substitutes are concerned - on corn gluten and cutting back non-food production - there has to be a permanent safeguard contained in the peace formula. One last point, Commis sioner: if President Clinton is able to introduce into the NAFTA agreement secondary agreements encompassing environmental and employment protection standards, then we have to ask whether these do not also belong in the secondary agreements to the GATT Round. HAPPART (PSE). - (FR) Mr President, when we speak of GATT it is to conjure up the idea of big business and so on, never of people, particularly the poor. GATT is the antithesis of humanism. With GATT we import unem ployment, the product of social and environmental dump ing. The reform of the common agricultural policy together with the ghastly GATT preliminary agreement spells death for family agriculture, which creates jobs and respects mankind and nature. To my way of thinking, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, GATT is bad from all points of view. After agriculture, culture, steel and glass, services will be sacrificed. The aim of the agreements which the United States wants are first to kill off social security, as it exists in Europe. We are required to be competitive. Competitive as compared with whom? Those regions of the world where goods are produced with contempt fir any social welfare? Where women and children are made to work for inhu man wages reminiscent of slavery? Competitive with regions which show contempt for the environment? In my view free competition does not exist. Economic liberalism has nothing to do with the word liberty, in the sense of right to existence. Economic liberalism is simply the right of the strongest to crush the weakest, the law of the jungle. The reasoning of the capitalist system is money for money's sake. I do not agree with that reasoning and in my opinion time is running out for that system. We shall have to invent a new one which will make it possible to respect humanity and nature for humanity's sake. The fall of the Berlin wall is not just the end of a totalitarian dictatorship of the proletariat but also, and in the near future, the end of the dictatorship of capital. We urgently need a European state, which alone is capable of defend ing the true humanist values of Europe. SCHWARTZENBERG (PSE). - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Brezinski, an adviser of Presi dent Carter, stated in 1990 that the basis of American power owed much to its domination of the world commu- ",
        "No 3-435/24 Debates of the European Parliament 29. 9. 93 SCHWARTZENBERG nications market, which created a mass culture which was a force for political imitation. But if, as Jean-Luc Godard says, the cinema has one foot in art and one foot in industry, it is time to say here that even if it is an industrial product, the cinema film must be regarded primarily as a work of art. The cultural exception must be inserted in Article 14 of the GATT framework agreement, which excludes meas ures adopted on the basis of a higher order: grounds of public morality, the protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants. That clause may be expressed as meaning that there is to be nothing to prevent a member country of GATT from adopting or applying measures regulating the supply of audio-visual services in pursuance of policies intended to preserve or to promote cultural, supranational, national or regional identities. We ask the Commission not to agree to any concession which might endanger the preservation or the future blossoming of European cultures. Sir Leon Brittan, cul ture is the soul of a people. Help us to protect the soul of Europe. (Applause) URBAIN, President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Mr President, Members of the Parliament, do I need to say that I have followed with the greatest interest the impor tant discussion which has just taken place? I did not speak earlier because in the circumstances I could not, as representing the Council Presidency, have done anything other than to give you a complete reading of the conclu sions of the joint Council of 20 September which you all know because they have been distributed to you - conclusions which are the reflection of a delicate balance achieved at the Jumbo Council. Following that Council, the Commission has had fresh contacts with our American partners, which it described a short while ago, but which it has not yet been able to report to the Council. It will be doing so at the General Affairs Council next Monday 4 October in Luxembourg, where the Uruguay Round will undoubtedly be an impor tant point on the agenda. At that debate, what has been said here will no doubt be taken into consideration, as I shall certainly make a faithful report of your discussion. Having said that, I would remind you of the two basic principles which guide and will guide the Council in its assessment of the Uruguay Round negotiations. On the one hand they are multilateral negotiations involving 108 countries and cannot be reduced to a dialogue between the Community and the United States. And on the other hand this is a global agreement which therefore calls for a global judgment. Any attempt to approach it as a succes sion of sectoral agreements to be approved in isolation one after the other can lead only to failure. The Council and, I am sure at the end of this discussion, the Parliament too are unanimous in recognizing that the world economy and therefore the European economy in particular are at stake in the Uruguay Round. So I can say that the Commission, with the support and full confidence of the Council, will negotiate to reach a settlement before 15 December on the understanding that in the last resort it will be for the Council to make the final judgment on the results obtained in terms of global, balanced agreement. For the rest, as I have said, I have carefully noted what has been said here so as to inform the Council at its next meeting. BRITTAN, Sir Leon, Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, the House will know that normally I like to comment on each of the contributions made in the debate, but I think I will not only be excused but perhaps applauded at this hour after so long a debate for not doing so but talking rather about some of the themes that have been raised. On the whole, the House has accepted that the benefits of the Uruguay Round being successfully concluded are very substantial. I think that those who have said that the Round is a global one and that we have to reach agreements with the other countries in the world and not just with the United States, and cover all sectors and not just agriculture, are absolutely right. That is exactly the way that the Commission sees it. But it is worth pointing out for those who doubt the overall benefits, even of a Round successfully concluded on that basis, that GATT liberalization is not something new. It is the case that the growth of the world economy over the last 45 years has in very large part been due to successive GATT rounds of liberalization: the Dillon Round, the Kennedy Round, the Tokyo Round. These rounds have contributed more to the growth of the economy than any internal growth within the individual countries. So I believe it will be, too, with the Uruguay Round, which is different only in that it is more ambitious than any of the previous ones. One job in ten in the European Community is directly generated by exports. Every 10% cut in world tariff and non-tariff barriers will produce a 1% increase in world GDP. So a 30 plus per cent cut overall would be worth over ECU 100 billion to the European Community economy. Of course there are additional but incalculable benefits flowing from the new rules regarding European Community investment and the protection of intellectual property. I think it is important to stress in this context that what we are talking about is not just an extension of free trade. At least as important is the extension of an ordered, legal framework for the conduct of world trade. I mentioned intellectual property a second ago. The European Community par excellence produces products which are dependent upon the exercise of imagination and intellectual activity. Design, whether you are talking about textiles which have been mentioned, rightly, by one Member, or other areas, is something crucial because it adds to the quality and value of European products, and particularly in the case of our products. Today huge quantities of money are lost to European industry because those products are frankly stolen in certain parts of the world where there is no protection for intellectual proper ty. This is one of the areas where already there is a substantial agreement in the GATT greatly strengthening the protection of intellectual property. I was asked whether it was the case that we were ready to sign an agreement in all areas other than agriculture. That is certainly not the case. There are many matters out standing relating to access to market in products other than agriculture, relating to the textile question that has been mentioned, relating to services, maritime, audiovi sual and other, as well as the rules of the Dunkel text and the extent to which we depart from them. But we have made progress and are continuing to make progress. ",
        "29. 9. 93 Debates of the European Parliament No 3-435/25 BRITTAN, Sir Leon Already in Tokyo in July we agreed on the total elimina tion of tariffs as far as the Quad are concerned - the European Community, Japan, the United States and Canada - on products where the European Community is in surplus, products which are of particular interest to us, a result incidentally which was acclaimed unanimously in the Council of Ministers and, I think, supported strongly in Parliament. So we are making progress. Since then we have taken the talks further, but it is indeed not the case that agriculture is the only thing holding it up. I agree with those who say that agriculture should not be singled out as the villain of the piece. Of course that is not the case. There are other problems. But if it is the case that agriculture should be considered alongside other sectors and other areas of industry, it is also the case that we should not expect a conclusion on agriculture to be reached and affirmed ahead of a conclusion of the round as a whole. That is the way we have been proceeding, and it is for exactly that reason that the Commission has never invited either Parliament or the Council to approve Blair House ahead, because nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. That is why we have no problem at all about exploring the question of further improvements, further improvements which do not amount to a renegotiation of Blair House but do amount to an exploration in the sense that I have described it in my earlier intervention. Some people have said: What is the difference between a renegotiation and what we are doing? I think there is a difference. Of course there is a narrow borderline between the two, but if you ask to renegotiate you are saying that you wish to fundamentally change an agree ment. If you talk about improving it, it is clear that there are limits beyond which you cannot expect to go, even though there may be a fine line between the two. That I think is a sensible approach. The analogy that somebody made with NAFTA is a good one, because there the text was not changed but substantial improvements were secured nonetheless in the subsequent discussions. I think that that is a reasonable aspiration. It is indeed the case that there are many other areas that we have to discuss, but I will only focus, as time is short, on one of them and that is the area of culture about which much has been said. In my opening remarks I made it clear that I yield to none in my determination to support the genuine interests of European culture which have been supported so strongly in this House today. I also made it clear that I shared the view that cultural products cannot be regarded in the same light as ball bearings or industrial products of one kind or another. They are different in character and they require a differ ent approach in trade issues as in everything else. I share that view to the full and am determined to defend the capacity of the European Community to support and advance its culture. Nonetheless, although culture is not just trade, it cannot be divorced from trade and there is a considerable trade in cultural goods. I would say to the many people from the cultural world who campaign on this issue and who are experts in and vigorous defenders of culture, that when it comes to the best legal way, the best way in the context of a global agreement, to protect culture, I hope they will have the generosity of spirit to accept that there may be those who defend them, and who genuinely wish to defend them - indeed who are genuinely determined to defend them - who nonetheless take a different view as to the best way of defending them. Therefore I think that the question of cultural exception should not be something on which we get too closely and too exclusively involved. I am glad that this Parliament, when we discussed it on previous occasions, did not do so. That is why we prefer to talk in terms of cultural specificity. I can understand that some may think that the concept of cultural 'specificity' is rather vague. 'Exception' is clear; it is in or out. But if it is out it means that other things which are of interest to the European Community will also be out. It is not just a question of sacrificing culture to financial services or other important interests. There is a real disadvantage to culture itself if culture is totally excluded from the Uruguay Round. If you do that culture is more at risk. It has no protection and the capacity of countries such as the United States to take action against the European Community in the name of free trade in culture will be unfettered because culture will be totally excluded from the disciplines of world trade. On the other hand, of course it is right that just to talk about cultural specificity is not sufficient. Of course we have to protect, for example, our directive with regard to television. That is not the only thing we have to protect though. And when we talk about cultural specificity it will be our intention in the negotiations to give it a specific meaning and a specific place. It will not just be a vague mantra to refer to as being an indication that we think culture is important. So when we enter into these negotiations, in this area as in all the other ones that have been mentioned - textiles, aircraft, steel, all these important sectors which I do not have time to go into in detail today - we will listen to what has been said in Parliament. We will listen and are in close contact with the representatives of European industry and culture in these various debates. We have to find a balanced agreement, I entirely agree. We have to find a global agreement, I entirely agree. And I entirely agree that we have to do it within the timescale. It can be done within the timescale. The issues are defined. What is needed is the political capacity to move, not the technical capacity to analyze. We have had seven years of analysis. We need now seven weeks of action and decision. The Commission is determined to provide the leadership in this area which it is our task to provide, our duty to provide, and our privilege to provide; in the interests of fighting and defending the European culture; European industry; European agriculture; knowing that the stakes are high; knowing that the consequences of failure are every bit as great as some distinguished speakers in this gathering have pointed out; but knowing that while success is not assured it is most certainly within our grasp! (Applause) GOLLNISCH (DR). - (FR) Mr President, this is a genuine procedural motion and it will be very brief. Could we have the text of this Blair House preliminary agreement which we are discussing unseen? I am sure, Mr President, if you take a poll, that there is not one Member in five, not one in ten or fifty, perhaps not even one in a hundred who is really familiar with the text of ",
        "No 3-435/26 Debates of the European Parliament 29. 9. 93 GOLLNISCH that agreement. I am not speaking of press or political commentaries or that kind of thing. It seems incredible that such a debate can take place and that European Members of Parliament, whatever their political colour, however much they support or oppose that agreement, should not have the text. I would add - and then I shall have finished - a little note to the legal service to ask them if they know by what exact procedure this document, if it exists, is finally to become law in our countries. I am only a doctor of international law and a prizeman of the University of Paris, but I have still not understood. So we must perhaps be rather stupid! BRITTAN, Sir Leon, Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, I omitted to mention that the text of the Blair House Agreement and the Commission document regarding the compatibility of the Agreement with the reform of the common agricultural policy is available for those Members of this House who want it from DG VI of the Commission.

Development cooperation PRESIDENT. - The next item is the report (Doc. A3- 0249/93), by Mrs Simons, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on development cooper ation policy in the run-up to 2000. SIMONS (PSE), rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, I am sorry that the time has run on, but I am particularly pleased to see Commissioner Marin here and I hope that we may be allowed to overrun a little so that we can hear what he has to say this evening. He is, unfortunately, not able to be here tomorrow. I should like to make a brief preliminary comment and remind the House of its efforts and achievements in this connection in the past. Our late colleague, Willy Brandt, for example, delivered a major speech on fighting hunger in the world, in Strasbourg, in September 1980, in which he said: 'Europe has without doubt a responsibility to alleviate, fight and help resolve the problem of hunger in the world.' That duty is consistent with our own best interest. What was said at the time still holds true. I would remind you also of the major debates we have held under the heading: 'one future or no future!' - last year, for example, when we adopted the slogan 'For a new, global partnership'. Those examples - and there are many more - reveal how this House has always been committed to an outward- looking policy for the European Community. If we fast-forward twelve years of parliamentary work, one thing is clear - and it is depressing: the misery of refugees, hunger throughout the world, poverty and the gap between the rich and the poor are increasing and not decreasing. We know that more than a billion people are hungry and dying of starvation. We know that thirteen million children die before they reach the age of five and that child mortality in Africa is ten times higher than in the industrialized countries. We have learnt that the world's 20% richest have 150 times the income of the 20% poorest. These horrifying figures will get worse because the growth in population is primarily affecting the poorest regions of the world. We also know, at least since huge movements of migrants have crossed our frontiers and at least since the Rio summit, that we have to identify and embark on the route to a global policy. That challenge, perhaps the most important political responsibility of the next century, is also reflected in the Maastricht Treaty, although it has to be admitted that the wording here is still somewhat weak. It is in this context that the Commission has focused its endeavours to devise a proposal for North-South policy in the medium term. This was submitted to the Council and Parliament in the form of a communication in July 1992 and entitled: 'Development cooperation policy in the run-up to 2000'. The Committee on Development and Cooperation, on whose behalf I am speaking as rapporteur, has looked in detail at this issue both on the basis of valuable discussion among its members but also in extensive consultation with the United Kingdom and Danish presidencies, Commissioner Matutes and Commissioner Marin, the non-governmental organizations and other public bodies. The outcome of those discussions is contained in the report, which the Committee adopted unanimously. I shall deal briefly with the most important points, but should like to begin by expressing to the Commission my appreciation for having taken the initiative and attempted to provide, for the first time, a systematic approach, and to do so at an important juncture. The Commission stressed that its communication was designed to be an invitation to dialogue - to the Council, the Parliament and other interested parties. The Committee on Develop ment and Cooperation took up the invitation and is unanimous in its response: the approach suggested does include a range of interesting ideas but it is, unfortunate ly, incomplete and contradictory; it falls short of what is needed and fails to take account of factors which have already become commonplace for Europe and Rio and for many non-governmental organizations. Specific criticism is directed at the following: the analy sis of the situation in the developing countries - although amply illustrated with statistical material - is made solely on a macroeconomic basis. Social, cultural and environ mental factors are simply not included. The causes of poverty are inadequately explained; the main explanation given, for example, is bad government in the poor countries. Not enough attention is paid, in contrast, to the debt problem, the continuing fall in commodity prices, the late effects of colonialism and the devastating conse quences of the programmes of structural adjustment of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The capital outflow from the South resulting from debt service has, since 1983, been substantially higher than the inflow of new credits, so that we now have a net transfer of capital from the South to the North. According to IMF estimates, while US $ 170 billion are paid out in debt interest only US $ 50 billion is received by way of publicly funded development aid. This defective analysis hinders the development of a promising new approach. It is not clear what shape this is to take. Improved coordination - yes, but to what end? Our colleague, Mrs P\u00e9ry, will be tabling an excellent ",
        "29. 9. 93 Debates of the European Parliament No 3-435/27 SIMONS report on this subject in October. And although right and important, the commitment to democracy and human rights is not enough, and it is far from sufficient simply to attempt to integrate the countries of the South into the world market. We in fact need an approach which takes into account the mutual dependency of the industrialized and the developing countries within the meaning of the Rio decisions and which at last places support for democracy on an international footing, at the level of the Bretton Woods institutions, the UN Security Council and GATT, as persuasively called for by Mrs Randzio-Plath in this chamber a short while ago. A glaring omission from the Commission document is the Community's existing development policy. It deserved to be included separately and with an indication of its unquestionably positive aspects. Let me give one example: the Lom\u00e9 agreements continue to provide a valuable partnership model based on cooperation. And why? Because they were developed in accordance with the principle of solidarity with the countries of the South and are based on the process which the Community applies in its own affairs, which lie at the heart of the Community: partnership and compromise rather than conflict and might is right. It would be a severe loss to European development policy were it to abandon its established forms of cooperation geared to long-term objectives and replace them with a short-term, neo-liberal approach on the macroeconomic and Euro-centric model. This danger exists in regard to many Member States but also within the Commission. My report contains a range of demands arising out of the assessment I have briefly given and which the Committee anticipates will provide the Commission as well as the Council and the Member States with pointers for their future work: in complying with Article 17 of the EEC Treaty, in updating the various agreements and protocols, in budgetary policy and not least the internal organiza tional structure of the Commission itself. That is indeed a wide remit. Our list of demands contains long-term guidelines needed if we are to establish what it is we want to achieve. It includes primarily, however, issues that need to be dealt with in the short term, and I would ask the Commission to mention these in particular in its res ponse: the drawing-up of a programme to combat pover ty; translating the Rio decisions into specific measures; developing a European strategy for debt remission and thereby persuading the multilateral donors, the IMF and the World Bank, finally to take part in measures for debt remission; the negotiation of new commodity agree ments; and the preparation of studies on the effects on the developing countries of agricultural and trade policy and Economic and Monetary Union. This concerns far more than development policy strictu sensu. It means getting to grips with world internal policy and translating it into specific measures. Thank you for your attention. I would thank my collea gues in the Committee on Development and Cooperation for their valuable cooperation and ask the House to adopt this report. (Applause) MARIN, Vice-President of the Commission. - (ES) Mr President, I am taking the floor in order to briefly react to some of the ideas put forward by Mrs Simons. As Mrs Simons pointed out, when the document on development cooperation policy in the run-up to 2000 was drafted, our aim was simply to stimulate a debate. We felt that this debate was necessary, bearing in mind the future of cooperation policy in the Treaty of Maas tricht and the degree of divergence among Community policies, as well as the difference between Community policies and those of the Member States - differences which have arisen from a lack of coordination. It was therefore not a document with any pretensions of being comprehensive, much less of giving an answer to each and every problem involved in development cooperation. We are satisfied in so far as the document has made it possible to get the debate going and we are pleased to note the criticism levelled by Mrs Simons, which points out the gaps and weaknesses in our document so that we can take them into account and give the most wise and sensible response. I would like to go over two points so that no doubt can remain. The report contains a description - perhaps relatively superficial - of poverty and solidarity. How ever, I would like to make it quite clear that solidarity and the fight against poverty continue to be at the core of our cooperation policy. Perhaps the description we gave of these problems was too brief, but there is no doubt that solidarity and the fight against poverty are the two central elements in the future of development cooperation poli cy. We had the opportunity to discuss a number of issues regarding the renegotiation of the Lom\u00e9 Convention, in which we aimed to be pioneers and mark out certain future orientations in this new round of negotiations. As you are well aware, we are now at the beginning. We have the whole of next year to return to a discussion of these issues. As regards her comments on the debt, I am afraid that I do not agree. We should be fair with the Commission. The Commission cannot give a response to the debt issue. You will recall that at my initiative the Commission proposed to reduce the Community debt of the ACP countries. Some Member States vetoed this proposal because they felt that the Commission was not competent on the matter of Community debt. Let us 'render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's' and unto the Member States that which is the Member States'. I would like to go over another important point. Will we or won't we adopt a liberal orientation? Is 'liberalism' positive or negative? I do not wish to give the word 'liberal' any sort of negative nuance, since I myself feel that I am a lover of liberalism, a lover of freedoms, and I believe that the word 'liberal' also has a positive aspect. In fact, and as I had the opportunity to say with regard to the revision of the Lom\u00e9 Convention, I believe that we should try to include the least developed countries within the framework of the world economy, since there is no other possibility. But does this mean that we accept the negative consequences of the openness? No. I will give an example at the small scale of our labour market: 65% of resources provided for in the Lom\u00e9 Convention for structural adjustments was spent on health, and the rest on education. These were two innovations that we intro duced three years ago. In other words the social aspect is taken into account. I do not doubt that it can be further improved, but the effort made over the past few years has ",
        "No 3-435/28 Debates of the European Parliament 29. 9. 93 MAR\u00cdN been considerable. The Lom\u00e9 III Convention made no provisions for the social dimension - none at all. More over, in the coordination we set up with the Member States, they agreed - for the first time - to coordination in three key sectors related to the social dimension: health, education and training, and food safety. These were the Council resolutions of 1993. There are now four sectors in which it is possible to seek out complementarity. Nevertheless, there still remains much to be done. Mr President, tomorrow I intend to take part in the debate as early as possible. First, however, please allow me to say that the criticism of this House is welcome. I believe in the debate, and it is very positive indeed that every person should say - in freedom and with respect - what they think of the future of development cooperation. I therefore thank you, Mrs Simons, for the quality of your report, which was very detailed. I know that you have done much work with NGOs. I know that you have consulted a lot of people. Consequently, the Commission will take account of the lacunae you mention in your report, for we agree that they do indeed exist. (Applause) LANGER (V). - (IT) Mr President, I have already raised this point of order in a previous speech. So I should like to know whether the Commission will be speaking tomor row under Rule 57 on the crisis in Russia. 1 would ask you to give us the answer now if possible. PRESIDENT. - Mr Langer, that is exactly what I was going to do. The Commission will probably not be able to say until tomorrow whether it is able to make a statement on the situation in Russia. Clearly, if it does, the President at the beginning of the sitting will propose a change to the agenda ('). 6.

Approval of the Minutes PRESIDENT. - The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed. Are there any comments? BETTINI (V). - (IT) Mr President, yesterday in opening the sitting, the President asked Members not to speak about the construction of this building. I read in the Minutes that Mr Gaibisso, however, did speak; previous ly I heard him ask the President to announce the cost of the new Chamber. Mr President, yesterday in the Committee on Energy we discussed the first report on the application of bio- climatic principles to the architecture of buildings. I should like to point out, Mr President, that although we discussed it and we think that the walls of buildings ought to be transformed into dynamic membranes and that we should immediately start to use window panes and polymerized synthetic materials capable of absorbing solar energy and distributing it by thermodynamic princi ples and make them the standard for buildings to be constructed in future in the Community, we are occupy ing a building - which is also our symbol - which is unfortunately the absolute negation of these principles. PRESIDENT. - We do not have a lot of time this morning and there are three important items to discuss. I would therefore urge you most strongly not to ask for the floor unless it is a point relating directly to the Minutes. As far as the building is concerned we will ask the President to comment in writing on the various items raised. POLLACK (PSE). - Mr President, there is news just coming in of a very large earthquake in India, in Maha rashtra State. According to the BBC news the police ",
        "No 3-435/30 Debates of the European Parliament 30. 9. 93 POLLACK estimate that there are 1000 people dead and at least one small town has been wiped out. Could I ask the President to send a letter of condolence to the families of those who are in trouble to the Indian Government, and also to ask the Commission to set in train the normal procedures with regard to emergencies? PRESIDENT. - Messages of condolence will be sent by the President, Mrs Pollack. ELLIOTT (PSE). - Mr President, strictly on the Minutes, can I ask that my name be added to the list of those present. While I am on my feet I would just like to support what my colleague, Anita Pollack, has said. We must remember that there are hundreds of thousands of citizens and residents of this Community who will have many friends and relatives in India in the area devastated by this earthquake. So it is all the more important that we should express, on behalf of our own citizens with friends and relatives there, our deep concern. PRESIDENT. - Yes, we will take care of that. COONEY (PPE). - Mr President, what I have to say relates to yesterday's proceedings. We received a notice from the Quaestors telling us that among the services now operational in this building was the bar reserved for Members on the twelfth floor. I visited the bar on the twelfth floor at 6 o'clock and found that it was occupied by a private firm, authorized apparently by the Quaestors. I want to protest about that action by the Quaestors in giving away our premises for a commercial purpose. I would ask you to instruct the Quaestors to write to Members indicating which firm it is, what is its influence and what is the justification for their gross contempt of our rights. PRESIDENT. - That will be done, Mr Cooney. (Parliament approved the Minutes) 2. Order of business PRESIDENT. - The Council and Commission are will ing to make statements on the situation in Russia. I would therefore suggest the following agenda for today: Firstly, continuation of the debate on the report by Mrs Simons but with only one speaker per group and one speaker for the non-attached Members. Secondly, a one-hour debate on the situation in Russia at about 10.30 a.m. Thirdly, about 11.30 a.m., a joint debate on the common organization of the market in bananas. I suggest speaking time for the tablers of questions should be two minutes each and thirty minutes after that for various other Members. Fourthly, we will begin the vote at about 12.30 p.m. von der VRING (PSE). - (DE) Mr President, I submitted an oral question, and my speaking-time cannot be cut in this way - that is just not acceptable! I would ask you to leave it at five minutes. PRESIDENT. - Mr von der Vring, if you insist on having your five minutes, they have to come off other Members of the House. That would be your responsibility. SIMONS (PSE), rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, I accept this compromise proposal, albeit very unwillingly. As far as the discussion of my report is concerned, it is clear that the individual groups had an opportunity of preparing for it. I was not at the meeting of my own group this morning, as I had a group of visitors to attend to. I do not know whether the groups were able to amend their lists of speakers. If they were not able to do so, I would ask you to facilitate that now. PRESIDENT. - Mrs Simons, I am very sad to be curtailing this debate but it seems to me the most reasonable way of doing things. The groups have been informed. It is up to them to decide who is still able to speak in the debate. (Parliament accepted the agenda as proposed by the President) 3. Decision on urgency Proposal from the Commission to the Council (COM(93) 0214 - Doc. C3-0223/93) for a regulation on the conclu sion of the agreement in the form of exchanges of letters between the EEC and Canada concerning their relations in the fisheries sector McCARTIN (PPE). - Mr President, I would like to inform Parliament that the Fisheries Committee is not in favour of granting urgency in this case and we expect to take it in November during the ordinary part-session. (Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure) Proposal from the Commission to the Council (COM (93) 0343 - Doc. C3-0307/93) for a regulation setting the terms under which fishing vessels flying a third country flag may land and market their catches at Community ports (Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure) 4. Development cooperation (continuation) PRESIDENT. - The next item is the continuation of the debate on the report (Doc. A3-0249/93) by Mrs Simons, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Coop eration, on development cooperation policy in the run-up to the year 2000. BELO (PSE). - (PT) Mr President, it might seem mad or immodest at this time to write a report on what is going to happen in the year 2000. Indeed, the changes will be political, commercial and social. I would reiterate that the four-day working week, which now seems to be about to get off the ground, will certainly have no less important consequences on the lives of all of us than did the fall of the Berlin Wall. For this reason, my group is pleased and honoured that our colleague, Barbara Simons, was given the task of looking into this sensitive issue. The report, which was unanimously approved in the Committee, deals with and summarizes the most impor tant aspects that North-South relations - and especially relations between the EC and the developing countries - still have to confront. We do not have much time and I would like to leave my colleagues with some, so I am not going to go into the fundamental priorities which are covered in the report and which have already been tackled. ",
        "30. 9. 93 Debates of the European Parliament No 3-435/31 BELO I am simply going to reiterate that the shortcoming of this report is that it is merely an opinion of this House and not binding. For this reason, my group calls upon the Com mission - and especially upon Commissioner Marin, in view of the cold and slightly nationalistic pragmatism of the governments - to take up imaginatively the challenge of Mrs Simons report. We hope that in the work he does on the review of Lom\u00e9 IV, the Commissioner is already opening up the way for cooperation in the year 2000. However, we would also ask the Commissioner to take all necessary steps to ensure that this House is officially consulted on the review of Lom\u00e9 IV, even though the rules do not oblige him to do so. This would provide us with the best practical exercise on the unquestionably technical material contained in the report. CASSANMAGNAGO-CERRETTI (PPE). - (IT) Mr Pre sident, I listened carefully to Mrs Simons's report - which I welcome - and to the answer given by Mr Vice-President Mann, and I have gathered that we are all taking a fresh view of world development. The real challenge of the coming years is that of being able to regard ourselves as citizens of the world and that will be possible by our observing the values which we should like to see as the introduction to a development policy for the year 2000. The people of the south and the people of Europe want the principle of subsidiarity to be respected, closely linked to the principle of solidarity. In addition the principle of transparency must be one of the problems to be tackled in order to achieve a certain credibility. Mrs Simons's report demonstrates the need to introduce in the post-Maastricht period certain important themes for laying down a new strategy. There is a cultural and human factor in cooperation. The concept of human development is included in various international charters and declarations; hence a new strategy for policy in the run-up to 2000 must be concentrated on the new individ ual whose rights and freedoms are acknowledged, a person at the centre of the environment and hence also in the centre of development. Economic growth must be tailored to mankind: the primary importance, therefore, with a view to new prospects, will be the training of a new managerial class, of new generations which will contribute to development in various sectors: education, health, agriculture, contra ception and environment. Without a credible spokesman none of the projects will turn out well. Subsidiarity, solidarity, transparency with a view to a stable democra cy: these are the important subjects at such a difficult time when certain countries - I am referring to Angola and Somalia - are rent with bloody conflicts. The opportunities for real development and for realizing the potentialities within this society are made closely condi tional on the capacity to bring peace through the inter mediary of credible spokesmen. Peace, as Mrs Simons rightly said, is the integration of peoples and consequent ly the recognition of every individual so as to guarantee the rule of democracy. Let me stress, finally, the importance of the section relating to the subject of indebtedness. I agree with what is stated: a solution must be found to debt, otherwise we shall never be able to get out of this vicious circle. I thank the Vice-President, who said yesterday evening that the document was provisional, so that all our observations, if they are approved, will be inserted in the new text. MENDES BOTA (LDR). - (PT) Mr President, I would like to begin by extending my congratulations to Mrs Simons for her report, and especially for highlighting poverty as an issue of central concern. However, when one speaks of poverty, one is also talking about democratic control. The world's population is growing at a rate of 100 million people per year. In 2020, the population of the developing countries will account for 84% of the world's population; it already accounts for 77% today. Given this prospect, poverty is inevitable. The struggle for food, clothes and even the struggle for comfort and leisure, is at the heart of environmental imbalance. The open mouth and extended hand will carry on unless developing countries are guaranteed self- sufficiency in food. Such a situation will develop with the support of small and medium-sized producers, irrigation systems, and means of communication. However, it can also be developed by not making the provision of food aid dependent on such aid being bought from donor countries. The policy on development aid does not have to be dependent on excessive neoliberalism or socialistic nos talgia. The model for the future is that which links democracy to the privatization of economies while res pecting human rights. The granting of aid must not be exclusively dependent on fluid concepts of democracy, which vary with the casuist judgements of Community officials. However, efforts made by countries in the direction of democratization must be rewarded, while those efforts which do not respect human rights must be penalized. Servicing debts is so expensive that many developing countries pay out more than what they receive in loans, investments, and other aid. This is an aberration and a perverse effect of the structural policies dictated by Bretton Woods. The downward trend in interest rates means that this is a good time to undertake a global renegotiation of Third World debt. The opening up of European markets to Third World products is important, but we must be quite objective in our assessment so that we can find out whether the benefits touted by the proponents of the total liberalization of world trade will also be passed on to the developing countries. Mention should also be made of the relocation of indus trial activities and services from the North to the South, causing waves of unemployment and ruin in entire sectors and regions in the North, without being reflected in durable development in the countries of the South. This is a mistaken conception of the sharing of risks, which is reflected - in practice - by a sharing of poverty, something with which I clearly do not agree. MELANDRI (V). - (IT) Mr President, the Green Group has tabled a number of amendments to Mrs Simons's report. They call attention above all to our responsibili ties as regards the problem of development but, having submitted them, I think I must, in any case, on behalf of the whole Group, thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for ali the subjects she brings to Parliament's agenda. The world is taking on a new shape before our eyes and this new shape has relegated the problem of under development to a r\u00f4le which is no longer of primary ",
        "No 3-435/32 Debates of the European Parliament 30. 9. 93 MELANDRI importance. All too frequently the so-called under developed countries, no longer covering a strategic sector in the life of the world, risk being cast into the swamps of oblivion. It has been to the Commission's credit - for which we must thank Mr Vice-President Marin - starting with the attempts the Community has made over the past few decades, to call for discussion by means of the document on cooperation in the run-up to 2000, which has started up, as he himself was reminding us yesterday evening, a debate which Parliament has welcomed. On the basis ofthat document the Simons report attempts to broaden the debate and, in a certain sense, to humanize it, bringing it closer to people's daily experience, spread ing an awareness of the fight against poverty, of the fundamental needs of the individual and not restricting itself to purely macro-economic problems. Finally I should like to point out - and here I turn particularly to the Commission - that it is essential to have coordination between the Member States on coop eration policies, but what is needed above all is a coordination between the various sectors of coordination. Yesterday we discussed GATT: we are discussing trade policy, we are discussing agricultural policy. To what extent are these policies coordinated with the cooperation policy? Too often we destroy some of them by what we do in another field! PERREAU DE PINNINCK DOMENECH (RDE). - (ES) Mr President, colleagues, I would first like to make it clear that my group can obviously not be against Com munity solidarity or development cooperation with Third World countries and countries in the process of indus trialization. We are obviously in favour of having this aid used to help combat poverty, promote democracy and the respect of human rights, and we are also in favour of having this aid used to implement a rational environmen tal policy. For all these reasons, my group shall vote in favour of Mrs Simons's report. However, we would have liked it if Mrs Simons report, as well as the Commission report, had put more emphasis on the social and labour dimension of development cooper ation. It is very well to make our aid conditional on the establishment of democratic governments or the creation of environmental policies, but it would be better to make in conditional on a genuine improvement in the living and working conditions of workers in these countries. Not only must we be concerned about maintaining the level of social welfare achieved by European workers, but we must also aim to ensure that workers in developing countries achieve working conditions that are at least dignified. As long as this is not the case, and as long as we fail to provide an incentive in this direction to the governments of these countries by making our aid condi tional on the social advancement of workers, we will be allowing our contributions - which are the sacrifice of the poorest people in the rich countries - to finance the richest people in the poor countries. POSADA GONZALEZ (ARC). - (PT) Mr President, in my ancient Galician-Portuguese tongue, I would like to speak of my experience of two peoples - in Galicia and Portugal - in supporting the development of America, Angola and Mozambique, through their entrepreneurs, enterprises and emigrants. I would like to highlight the human side, since it was only marginally dealt with in the report. The transfer of... PRESIDENT. - Mr Posada Gonz\u00e1lez, there is a problem: our interpreters cannot work from Galician. POSADA GONZALEZ (ARC). - (PT) I shall speak in Portuguese, which is quite clear. I would like to emphasize the human aspect, since it was only marginally dealt with in the report. In the transfer of technology and resources, one should highlight the importance of the human factor. My proposal calls for an increase, in so far as possible, in training for the social partners, and men and women from developing countries, for we must train them in training centres or through work experience with enterprises taking part in this pro gramme. These trained people will return to their countries, give impetus to their economies and thus take responsibility for the creation and monitoring of cooperation and aid programmes established by the Community. They will be the link between their countries and the Community and its organizations, thus encouraging the creation of the small and medium-sized enterprises that will be at the heart of development, (...), the creation of risk at the origin. VAN DER WAAL (NI). - (NL) Mr President, the verdict given in the Commission white paper on the results of development cooperation as compared with the total amounts paid is certainly not a good one. We read that the impression is of an enormous squandering of resources. What lessons can we learn from this in considering policy until the year 2000? To begin with, I subscribe to the ideas in Mrs Simons's report to the effect that we cannot be satisfied with a one-sided economic approach. It must be a question of a much wider mutual involvement between the industrial countries and the developing countries in which full account is taken of each developing country's own culture and history. Moreover there are different, partly new problems. The drugs and AIDS problems, migration, refugees and the question of the environment, questions increasing in scope and with a strongly international character. In the white paper these points receive too little attention in my opinion. My second remark concerns the distinct r\u00f4le of the European Community and the Member States. In the white paper the Commission points to the fragmented approach by the Member States which it says reduces the effectiveness of the provision of aid. But what does the Commission mean by its recommendation of a gradual supplementary adaptation at Community level? Does the Commission think that the application of the principle of subsidiarity which it advocates should lead to an exten sion of its tasks and improved effectiveness? It is striking in this connection that the white paper scarcely mentions the functioning of the Commission itself. But is suffi ciently clear from the reports of the Court of Auditors and of Price-Waterhouse that there is a good deal wrong with the Commission's work. So I see no occasion for an amended division of tasks between the European Com- ",
        "30. 9. 93 Debates of the European Parliament No 3-435/33 VAN DER WAAL munity and the Member States. First there should be a complete stock-taking and analysis of the activities of the Member States. On that basis it may then be determined whether, and in which fields, it might be advantageous to coordinate Commission action. In the Treaty of Maastricht the prime responsibility for the provision of aid is emphatically placed on the Mem ber States. Although I have a great appreciation of Mrs Simons's report, I cannot agree with her recommendation of Europeanizing development aid. I see the European Community's duties principally in spheres in which it can clearly take more effective action than the Member States, as with the environment, agriculture, trade, the internal market and, as regards development aid, in coordination and the provision of emergency aid. But I think that development aid must remain in principle a matter for the Member States. VECCHI (PSE). - (IT) Mr President, I too should like to thank not only Barbara Simons for her excellent work but also the Commission for the considerable effort at draft ing which it has put into working out this document on the run-up to 2000. Other Members have already said, and I agree, that this document is very interesting in view of the problems which it tackles. However, it must not be regarded as an exhaustive document on all aspects of the Community's cooperation policies. On two of them in particular it is necessary to make an analysis in greater depth and to think out instruments for action, above all on the way to pursue the aim of human development and to confirm those three types of consistency in the Community's action without which it will be very difficult for us to be as effective as we should like: the need for consistency between Community and sectoral development cooper ation policies; consistency between national and Com munity policies; and consistency in the approach taken by EEC countries in the field of international bodies. That having been said, it is clear that the problem, and hence the faults and omissions, are those of the Council and the Member States' governments rather than of the Commission. But it is for us as a Parliament to point them out. In this document the Community rightly lays down four major axes in cooperation strategy. I agree, but I should also like to say that if we wish to avoid the risk of a purely neo-liberal approach it is essential to deal with the aspects directly linked to these objectives, namely the need to create both the external and the internal condi tions for promoting development. Then there is no doubt that a criticism of the rigorous policies of structural readjustment of the Monetary Fund and of the traditional policies of conditional aid must bring us a fresh concept, that of human development and democratic adjustment. PAISLEY (NI). - Mr President, I welcome this debate today on development cooperation policy in the run-up to the next millennium. The figures on poverty in the underdeveloped countries of the world which have right ly been placed centrally in this report must make the EC redouble its efforts to alleviate the causes and effects of the suffering. One billion people in the world are starv ing, 13 million children a year die before the age of five. Tragically these figures are set to rise, as the report says, because the population is growing most rapidly in the world's poorest regions. I am concerned at the conclusion of the Commission's report that resources have to a large extent been wasted. Undoubtedly this is true in many cases but there are other examples where aid has been properly directed and effectively used. The essence of the matter is that the Community has a vital role to play since the Member States grant 40% of all development aid, whereas the United States and Japan contribute just over 14% each. Europe is the main donor in many regions of the world. There needs therefore to be more coordination of national policies so that we can all act together with the same objectives and avoid unnecessary duplication and waste. In this Community, with all its problems, there is the capacity to reach out and help the Third World. We must not be deaf to the cries of the suffering. Much has been done, but this report highlights the need for greater efforts. I trust the Commission and the Council will respond positively to its conclusions, and I congratulate Mrs Simons on her report. VAN HEMELDONCK (PSE). - (IT) Mr President, yes terday the Commissioner asked us to concentrate our comments on his document and that is therefore the line of approach I shall take. As members of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, and for my part more especially as a member of Mrs Simons's Group, we are naturally in favour of her report, and I congratulate her on having made such trenchant counter-proposals; apart from the explanatory statement in the report I should like to point out to the Commission that it has actually overlooked three factors in its evaluation of her docu ment. The first is the AIDS factor. Towards the year 2000 you will have first of all to take the economic and social consequences of the AIDS factor into account in your development policy. I refer here to the recommendations of the working party made in this connection in the context of the joint meeting. The second factor in the debate about democracy, but also for example in the debate about the population issue, is the ethnic and cultural factors. I have the impression that the Commission thinks principally in terms of state frontiers and has not actually mastered, does not actually know, these factors. Still, it is necessary to take account of them if the intention is to strengthen the structures of a civilian society or if specific types of policy are to be pursued; I am thinking amongst other things of the population issue. And finally, the third and most important factor is the factor of women. It is not only in Europe that we have continually to say that half the population consists of women, but remember also that that is true in the developing countries also and that in addition they are the major economic and the major agricultural factor there, with the result that you cannot pursue any policy, with regard to provision of food, population, the structure of the future, without involving women and without taking the factor of women into account. As a result of our insistence, a Women and Development desk has been set up in both DG I and DG VIII, and is doing excellent work. I should like to ask the Commission to listen to its advice and to the advice it receives from this Parliament. ",
        "No 3-435/34 Debates of the European Parliament 30. 9. 93 McGOWAN McGOWAN (PSE). - Mr President, I welcome this report and I welcome the fact that we are having this debate at the launching of sittings in Brussels, particularly as we are talking about three-quarters of the world's population and the relationship between the European Community and the whole social dimension of European cooperation. It is perhaps a little unfortunate that this wonderful building, which is a great resource for the European Community, nevertheless contains substantial tropical forest products. I am pleased that this has been somewhat nipped in the bud, but it is unfortunate that this is the situation in the building. I would just mention three areas which I do not think have really been given a proper emphasis in the document from the Commission. We have now made substantial progress in relation to East-West relations. Less money is being spent in the area of arms and the arms trade, but we have to give more priority in our development cooper ation policy to the whole link between disarmament and development. There is a fantastic opportunity to shift resources away from war preparation towards positive development cooperation. We need to give greater prior ity to development aid and the whole development cooperation policy in our national budgets. It is sad that the European Community itself in recent years has reduced the amount of money within its budget that is spent on development cooperation. The changes in East-West relations across Europe pro vide us with an opportunity that we should take very seriously indeed. Again, I would like us to maintain the best development cooperation, the particular distinctive priorities that the European Community has, unlike the Bretton Woods institutions. PRESIDENT. - The debate is closed. The vote will take place at 12.30 today. 5. Situation in Russia PRESIDENT. - The next item is the statements by the Council and Commission on the situation in Russia. URBAIN, President-in-Offtce of the Council. - (FR) Mr President, Honourable Members, for two years past Russia has occupied an important place in the work of the European institutions, an important place in the Council's activities with the preparation of humanitarian aid pro grammes to the newly-independent states, the setting up of the important technical aid programme, TACIS, and with the discussions necessary for negotiating the future partnership and cooperation agreement between the Rus sian Federation and the Community. It has an important place in this Assembly too, because the European Parliament is following the political, econ omic and social situation in Russia very closely and encouraging the efforts made on both sides to integrate Russia further into a Europe which we should all like to make more stable, more prosperous and more democrat ic. It has an important place, finally, in European political cooperation where the experts and political directors of our Ministers for Foreign Affairs ceaselessly analyse the numerous and sometimes contradictory events which enliven Russian political life so as to allow the Council of Ministers to determine clearly the Community's political positions with regard to Russia. That was the case last week when, right away on 22 September, the Twelve immediately published a declaration following the announcement by President Boris Yeltsin suspending the legislative, administrative and supervisory powers of the Russian Parliament and Congress. In that declaration the Community and its Member States: - supported the continuation of the process of demo cratization in Russia; - supported President Yeltsin, the sole directly elected Russian authority, in his efforts to maintain the momentum of that progress; - reaffirmed that it was for the Russian people alone to determine their system of government and their constitution; - appreciated the fact that free and democratic elec tions making it possible to unfreeze the present political situation, were to take place on 11 or 12 December next; - expressed the hope in addition that those elections would take place in an orderly manner and would be a decisive turning point towards that goal. I must stress that last point, ladies and gentlemen. We are actually following the present crisis very closely and must also hope for an outcome free from violence. The political support thus given to President Yeltsin by the Community and its Member States is justified first by the fact that we regard Boris Yeltsin today as being the sole legitimately empowered authority in the Russian Federation today. This legitimacy results from the fact that Boris Yeltsin was elected by universal suffrage on 12 June 1991 with 57.3% of the votes, from the fact that Boris Yeltsin in August 1991 courageously took the lead in opposing the reactionary coup and from the fact that 58% of voters gave him their confidence in the referen dum of 25 April last. I should also like to point out that our political support for President Yeltsin also stems from the fact that his political initiative was necessary, and on at least three levels. In the first place it was necessary so that the Russian authorities might at last tackle an economic situation which had become catastrophic and which is making millions of men, women and children the pover ty-stricken victims of the uncontrolled transition, without any social welfare protection, to a new economic system. I am convinced that the success of the economic reforms in Russia will condition the whole of the process of democratization of Russian society. For two years past these economic reforms have been systematically blocked by the Parliament: privatization of land and businesses, independence of the Central Bank, restructur ing of obsolete industrial sectors, the setting up of a modern tax system. In all fields of management and reform of the economy the Parliament has placed obsta cles in the path of the Russian Government. A society in which inflation is at present approaching 20% per month, where the budget imposed by the Parliament envisaged a budget deficit of some 25% of the gross national product is a society which can only move away from democracy, from stability and so from social justice. ",
        "30. 9. 93 Debates of the European Parliament No 3-435/35 URBAIN In the second place, President Yeltsin's political initia tive was needed in addition to bring a solution to the institutional freeze which has been paralysing Russia for months. Here in fact is a country of 350 million inhabi tants, the largest and most densely populated in Europe, which had become incapable of taking, in a balanced, democratic manner, the major political decisions necess ary for shaping the Russia of tomorrow. For more than two years the conservative and ulta-nationalist forces, with a majority in the Russian Parliament, have been preventing the adoption in Russia of a new constitution. The present constitution dates from 1977. It has been amended several times and no longer offers Russia the clear, democratic and effective political institutions suit able for a great country. Since December last, the date of the Seventh Congress of People's Deputies, Boris Yeltsin has spared no efforts to find a compromise with the Parliament on a new draft constitution. Neither the referendum of 25 April last, when 58% of voters expressed their confidence in Boris Yeltsin, nor the meeting in June last of a constitutional conference have made it possible to overcome the block age created by the Parliament. Moreover I draw your attention to the fact that these political uncertainties have had consequences for the stability of the Russian Federation. Each camp has tended to redouble promises of greater autonomy to the 88 republics and regions of the federation, some of which are showing disturbing centrifugal tendencies. Finally President Yeltsin's political initiative was also necessary at diplomatic level - whether in the former Yugoslavia, in the Baltic States, in relations with Japan or above all in relations with the other ex-soviet republics - Russian policy has been characterized by U-turns and constant uncertainties. In certain regions these uncertain ties have contributed to the development of instability. In conclusion, Mr President, Honourable Members, I should like to reaffirm to you the political confidence which the Community and its Member States have placed in Boris Yeltsin. That confidence is based on his indis putable legitimacy and on the essential nature of the political initiative which he attempted to take on 21 September last. Naturally that confidence is not unlim ited. We are continuing to follow the situation very closely and we think it very important that the legislative elections on 11 and 12 December next should respect the democratic principles defined by the CSCE. That pre supposes, inter alia, that the parties which wish to do so may put up for election, that the candidates should have uncensored access to the various media and that each citizen should be in a position to exercise freely, without pressure or constraint, the right which is the foundation of all democracies: the right to vote. (Applause) STEICHEN, Member of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, I should like to add a few words on behalf of the Commission to Mr Urbain's statement on behalf of the Council, to reaffirm that the European Community is following with the closest attention the events taking place at present in Moscow. The Commission acknow ledges the intention of the President of the Russian Federation, the first and only one to have been elected following an undeniable expression of the electorate's wishes, to guide his country towards a liberal society in the political and economic sense of the word. The Community also takes note of President Yeltsin's formal and repeated promises to organize in the near future both real legislative elections and a presidential election before his present mandate expires. The Community's view is that the continuation of the process of economic reforms is of paramount importance for Russia and for the republics which previously made up the USSR. The Community, like the Russian authorities, therefore intends to pursue the negotiations at present under way. In this connexion I can report that a new round of negotiations in the framework of the partnership and cooperation agreement has just ended in Brussels with encouraging results. A further round is already envisaged for the end of October this year. (Applause) WOLTJER (PSE). - (NL) Mr President, I am glad that we can hold a debate here in the European Parliament so quickly with the participation of both the Council and the Commission about the situation in Russia. That shows that the European Parliament's battle-readiness is remarkably improved now that we have the opportunity to hold plenary sittings here in Brussels. By blowing the offside whistle to the conservative parliament in Russia, which was elected as far back as the communist r\u00e9gime, the legally elected president of Rus sia has taken an essential step towards speeding up the process of democratization in Russia. Admittedly this action was defacto in conflict with the existing constitu tion and therefore unlawful. But the president had no other choice. The political impasse had to be broken so as to win back the trust of the population, to be able to tackle the vast problems of Russia, which have been discussed by both the Commission and the Council, and even more to forestall anarchy which has been raising its head more and more in Russia. So in these very specific circumstances, the president deserves our entire support. On that point we agree with the Commission and the Council. It is precisely in these circumstances that great statesmanship is required and in our view it will also be of importance for President Yeltsin to do everything now to avoid further polariza tion, which might easily lead to bloodshed. In our opinion it would also show great statesmanship if the president could not only persuade all the regions to cooperate after the elections but also to put his own position to the electorate by calling in addition elections for president as quickly as possible. The period of six months now envisaged between parliamentary and presi dential elections might possibly be too long for that. It would show flexibility on the president's part if he were ready to review this period. There is much to be gained in Russia on this point and it would be a good thing if an attempt were now made on both sides to bridge over again the gulf which has opened up and to come to a solution which would greatly benefit the process of democratization in Russia. PENDERS (PPE). - (NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in Moscow at present is full of risks and dangers. The disbanding of the Russian Peo ple's Congress by President Yeltsin is in itself nothing to rejoice about. It is a sad situation. I say this moreover ",
        "No 3-435/36 Debates of the European Parliament 30. 9. 93 PENDERS fully realizing that the People's Congress was elected in 1990 under the domination of the communist party of the Soviet Union and in accordance with the 1978 constitu tion, which was enacted during the communist dictator ship. That is of course the crux of the matter. There was no working with the Russian parliament. I am thinking simply of the fact that they had control over the printing of bank notes. One may wonder why Yeltsin did not strike straight after the referendum of 25 April 1993. Probably he was hoping that the parliament would understand the evidence of the referendum and take a more cooperative course. The EPP Group, and I hope, what is more, the whole European Parliament, supports President Yeltsin. It is in the inter ests of the EEC to help to ensure, politically, economical ly and financially, that he is now actually in a position to carry out his reform policy. The fact that he has re appointed Mr Gaidar is an encouraging sign in this respect. Occasionally it is suggested, and Mr Woltjer too alluded to it, that it should be considered whether the parliament ary elections could not be combined with the presidential elections. Yeltsin does not want that. I think he is right. Simultaneous elections are risky, too risky, for the stability of the country. But perhaps it would be worth recommending that the period between parliamentary and presidential elections - and the socialist Group spoke in favour of this - should be kept as short as possible. That is perhaps a subject which we might discuss in the framework of the CSCE. Meanwhile armed conflicts are raging on the periphery of Russia: Nagorno Karabakh, Azerbaijan, Abkhazia, Tadz hikistan. Is there a question of Russian military involve ment? So it seems. Of course, no one benefits from chaos in the territory of the former Soviet Union, but naturally Yeltsin must not be able, either, to buy the support of Moscow's armed forces, as it were, by allowing them a free hand in the outlying regions. To sum up, Mr President, support for Yeltsin, no combi nation of parliamentary and presidential elections, and control of the military by the civil authorities so that the former may not develop into instruments of adventurism and expansionism. PIMENTA (LDR). - (PT) Mr President, colleagues, at this time the European Parliament and, for us, the LDR, will have to take two or three political decisions. The first is to make a clear unambiguous statement in support of President Yeltsin, the dissolution of a Parliament that has lost all credibility, and the maintenance of a peaceful and democratic reform process. Secondly, we must support the holding of free elections, which will be the first genuinely multiparty elections in the Russian Federation. The European Parliament must give all the support asked of it by the Russian authorities, whether logistical or technical, for the holding of these elections. For if they are properly undertaken, they will form an important political framework. After all, at stake is democracy in one-sixth of the world's land area. I think that the European Parliament must immediately begin work aimed at sending a delegation to observe the Russian elections. The delegation would fit in with the international observers who are to guarantee the legitima cy of the elections and their recognition internationally. Lastly, regarding the aid programme, TACIS, the Euro pean Commission, and especially the Council must alter the form in which this programme is run so it is more along the lines of what the European Parliament approved in July. It is unbelievable that until this year the money from the TACIS programme was primarily spent on consultants and not on work in situ. We hope that the resources announced to us by Sir Leon Brittan in July will see the light of day in July and that commitology will stop being an obstacle to a programme that is necessary for the development, transformation and modernization of the Russian economy, which has received little help so far in concrete terms in situ. IN THE CHAIR: MR D. MARTIN Vice-President CRAIMON-DAIBER (V). - (DE) Mr President, the Green Group in the European Parliament is very disap pointed at the statements made by both the Council and the Commission. We feel that it would have been more interesting to spend the time watching CNN on television than listening to these empty statements. We are very glad that the highly explosive situation in Russia remains contained and urge the opposing parties to avoid anything that could lead to an escalation. The weakness of the current democratic structure in the Russian Federation is in fact reflected in the dangerous situation that has arisen. And while we in this House call so extensively for democracy in Russia, we ought also to reflect on the democratic deficit that we face here in the Community. We welcome the fact that parliamentary elections are to be held soon, as these are the only way in which the people of the Russian Federation will be able to express their sovereign will. But there is one thing we want to make clear: the period of transition in which the Russian Federation currently finds itself is an unique and unparal leled historical event, and the West is being extremely naive in the demands it is trying to make of it at a very early stage. What this process really involves is funda mental political renewal and that is a slow - and I would stress slow - and difficult process of economic and social change. A number of the reforms introduced so far have, for example, contributed to the collapse of Russia's internal market. The excessively early introduction of so-called market economy principles has resulted in the development of an economic mafia whose potential for crime is considered by experts to be greater than we have seen in the Sicilian Mafia. How else would it be that former spies from the West and the KGB are now on the best of terms and cooperating perfectly as consultants in Moscow and London? The European Parliament and the European Community must try to develop new strategies for cooperation, and I should like to reiterate here two proposals which the Greens put forward long ago. We take the view that the European Parliament should take an initiative for politi cal cooperation, such as that already in existence between the Community and the ACP countries. This would offer a good opportunity of encouraging democracy. Secondly, we urge the Commission to direct the TACIS programme and the other economic proerammes it \u00a1panels develop- ",
        "30. 9. 93 Debates of the European Parliament No 3-435/37 CRAIMON-DAIBER ing not only to Moscow but to the regions. There has to be direct regional cooperation between the Community and the Russian Federation. Thirdly, we consider that there is a definite possibility of constructing a kind of bridge linking the CIS countries and Western Europe by, for example, setting in place in the longer term a common European Environment Agen cy and an Energy Agency. DILLEN (DR). - (NL) Mr President, for most European politicians it is a disgraceful thing to have to record how, recklessly and without forethought, they make from one day to the next, so to speak, a complete U-turn as regards their policy towards the former Soviet Union and later towards the new states which have been created out of the Soviet Union. One day Gorbachev is praised to high heaven, the next day he is dropped like a stone. One day Yeltsin is treated as dirt, the next day he is a gift from providence. One day Shevardnadze is praised as the warning against approaching dictatorship, the next day he becomes a dubious Georgian warlord. I shall say nothing about the worst case, Stalin of evil memory! We seek in vain for the only line there should be in European politics, namely European interests and Euro pean interests alone. On that basis all unconditional aid to anyone in the former Soviet Union must be refused. Conditions must be imposed in the interests of Europe. Playing Santa Claus is all very well on condition that there are no subsequent regrets. Those who today regard Yeltsin as a sort of favourite cuddly toy of the west are at least very rash in their judgment. One may have admira tion for Yeltsin's qualities, but one must never lose sight of the fact that his policy is the Russian policy, the CIS policy. It does not necessarily coincide with ours, Euro pean policy. Prudence is therefore called for. European conditions must be laid down and we must follow a hard line, every son of the Soviet Union must understand and accept that. (Applause from the Technical Group of the European Right) MIRANDA DA SILVA (CG). - (PT) Mr President, I would first of all like to express my pleasure on behalf of my group with regard to this debate on the current situation in Russia, not only because it gives each group the opportunity to express its position, but also because, at the end of the day, the Council managed to clearly state its position on the matter. Naturally, we deplore this position, as we deplored the positions reaffirmed here previously and today by the Commission. We also deplore it because the Council and the Commission are simply sweeping aside a number of important questions. Consequently, we would like to say that President Yelt sin's decision to dissolve the Russian Parliament, which gave rise to the current political crisis in Russia, was undoubtedly an unconstitutional decision that is nothing more than a coup d'\u00e9tat and, by all indications, a clear desire to install a personal authoritarian power in that country. Now, people do not understand - much less accept - that there is the systematic invoking of the defence of the state of law. Yet now, a position of complicity has been assumed with a flagrant violation of constitutional legitimacy in a country where the situation is likely to degenerate into a serious armed conflict, with the ensuing incalculable consequences, not only for the Russian people, but also for all of Europe. In our opinion, the Community has a role to play in this crisis. This role should not - of course - be that of a judge, nor should it heighten tensions, but it should also not be to side with those who violate the established constitutional rules, as is being done with the positions taken by the Council, the Commission and the govern ments of the Member States. The Community should, however, contribute towards establishing a climate which encourages the resolution of the political crisis in Russia in such a way that it does not degenerate, as I said earlier, into a serious conflict. This should be done without interfering in Russia's internal affairs, whilst paying particular attention to the genuinely disastrous social situation and the economic catastrophe facing the coun try. PUERTA GUTIERREZ (NI). - (ES) Mr President, the European Unitary Left cannot agree to the arguments advanced by the European Communities. Both in the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Security, via the Commission representative, and today, we have listened to arguments for giving full support to President Yeltsin's decision, based on the economic management of the Soviet Union, the positive position of the International Monetary Fund, and NATO's initial reflex. I believe that we should give some more thought to this. We should not sign blank cheques or lend our total personal support. The same group, the same people and the same institutions which at one time did not welcome Boris Yeltsin or mistreated him in some way are now his main supporters. I cannot understand this. I also cannot help but think of one person who is such a prominent figure in the democratization process in the Soviet Union, former President Gorbachev, who has expressed serious doubts about the position taken by President Yeltsin, whose main support lies in the hands of the former Soviet army leadership. We defend totally the democratization process, with all its attendant consequences. For this reason, we believe that we must encourage every aspect of it, from agree ment to dialogue to consensus, all of which have been expressed here today. May the various institutions in the Soviet Union - even though they are not fully democratic - come together to draw up a timetable and a number of goals for the democratization process. As a representa tive from the Spanish constituency, I should reiterate that in Spain's democratization process it proved very impor tant not to employ authoritarian measures, but rather dialogue, consensus and, finally, the philosophy that gives rise to democracy. (Applause) HOFF (PSE). - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Russia is travelling a difficult path. We are following with both great sympathy but also with concern the dramatic events in the Russian Federation. The discussion within Parliament's Delegation for rela tions with the Republics of the CIS was not contradictory in its finding that Russia's specific situation in the process of transition from dictatorship to democracy requires not a one-sided but a more complex assessment - an assessment which may not be based on formal criteria alone and does not put legality before legitimacy. Our sympathy goes to those forces in Russia which are working for democracy and pluralism and a socially- oriented market economy. Taking that approach, it has to ",
        "No 3-435/38 Debates of the European Parliament 30. 9. 93 HOFF be said that the President got rid of the Congress of Peoples deputies by circumventing the anachronistic constitution, and, formally speaking, that is contrary to the letter of the law as it stands. This is, however, to a large degree a legitimate step on the part of the President, as he was freely elected during the Soviet period and, in the referendum of April 1993, he obtained de facto confirmation from the electorate for his economic and social programme. The actions of the President will, however, enjoy com plete legitimacy only when further, consistent progress is made on the way to democracy and the federal system. Subject to that condition, I appeal to the Russian State authorities to avoid any form of violence against political opponents, to abide by the aim of establishing democracy and continue their work on a new democratic constitu tion. This has to contain the principle of separation of powers and the bases of democratic federalism as well as the division of responsibilities between Moscow and the subjects of the Federation. I appeal here to the Russian State authorities to hold to the deadline set for the forthcoming parliamentary elections. This House looks forward to having a democratic and legitimate partner in Russia as soon as possible to develop contacts further and give a fresh impetus to relations with Russia. We further call for freedom of the press to be secured, as this is the most important element in supervising the exercise of power. I hope that no-one will construe this appeal as interfer ence in Russia's internal affairs. We are, however, persuaded that it is only as a democracy and under the rule of law that Russia will have a place in the Europe of the future. Against that background, we will seek to establish contact with the newly elected Russian Parlia ment as soon as possible and continue the dialogue with all those partners who support the concept of allowing the peaceful expression of political differences in Russia. (Applause) CATHERWOOD, Sir Fred (PPE). - Mr President, a year ago Parliament pointed out that Russia could not fulfil the IMF conditions on inflation without our aid. And yet all but $ 1 billion of the G7 package of aid was dependent on their fulfilling these conditions. That is exactly like telling a sick person that they can have medicine just as soon as their temperature is normal! But as we said then and in May this year in our resolution, our failure to give the help they need puts impossible pressures on these new, friendly, democratic regimes. It puts democracy at risk and risks a hostile autocracy or the break up of Russia. It is just as well, Mr President, there are no nuclear weapons in Georgia. The countries who are in NATO spend $150 billion a year on weapons and weapon research. And the IMF, who threaten to remove the $1.5 billion unconditional aid, have no moral right to lecture the Russians and no right to criticise the Russian Parliament for attacking the policies that we have made President Yeltsin perform. We want democracy in Russia. We have a tiny democrat ic fund which needs to be at least three times as big. But what they need to preserve democracy is deeds not words. The World Bank told me that Russia needs $15 billion to preserve democracy; $15 billion to stabilize the currency and also give an absolutely necessary social safety net for industrial restructuring. We would not do that industrial restructuring without a social safety net and we are asking them to turn millions of people out on the streets to fulfil IMF conditions. That $15 billion is only 10% of what NATO now spends every year on new weapons. Just 10%! It is in order to make certain that we do not need those new weapons that Parliament, in May, added $5 billion for East/West joint ventures to equip them to make the investment in their key industries which they absolutely have to have if they are going to have economic recovery to underpin any financial recovery. Now Yeltsin has bought time. But if Member States do not act on the Parliament's very practical May resolution and, with the Americans, match deeds to words in practical support of this elected President, then we will either have central autocracy or regional warlords as in Georgia in full control of nuclear weapons. If the Council and Commission mean what they say in support of President Yeltsin, they should attend to the heavily researched and unanimously agreed proposals that this Parliament has now made twice. (Applause) GOLLNISCH (DR). - (FR) Mr President, for us Russian affairs are legally speaking the domestic affairs of a foreign state. That ought to urge us to be prudent. What is said in this Parliament will hardly influence the situation over there and that ought to urge us to be modest. Our socialist colleague Mr Woltjer's enthusiastic support for Mr Yeltsin is in contrast to the vulgar welcome which Mr Cot gave him some months ago. I shall merely make three points. The first is of a semantic nature. The President of the Council describes the sup porters of the old order as conservatives and the attempt to eliminate Mr Gorbachev in 1991 as a reactionary coup d'\u00e9tat. In the United Kingdom the conservatives are the right wing. In the European Parliament the reactionaries are the right wing. This disinformation is not accidental; we are speaking of communists, that system of which all the Groups, or nearly all, in this h\u00e9micycle were the accomplices, the allies, the flatterers. No doubt you are ashamed of it, but call a cat a cat and a communist a communist! My second remark is that for you there are good and bad coups d'\u00e9tat. Everything you have said to justify the Russian coup d'\u00e9tat - galloping inflation, economic ruin, political stalemate, breach of legality, lack of popular support - could have been said to justify the 1973 coup d'\u00e9tat in Chile. Perhaps I may be allowed to laugh rather than to cry. My third remark is that present difficulties are bound up with the Russian people's immense disillusionment about democracy, which over there they now call only 'dungocracy'. We have only succeeded in exporting the vices of our society: absolute materialism, the permissive society, laxity, drugs, violence, hard rock, McDonald's, Coca-Cola, the all-powerful dollar. The very dregs of free-trade dogma, which for you takes the place of religion. The Russian people are ruined, but they are proud. They feel humiliated. Mr Clinton supports Mr Yeltsin, it seems. Well he supports him in the soul of the Russian people as the rope supports the hanged man. I should prefer to hear the great voice of a Solzhenitsin in this Parliament, which, in any case has no more powers ",
        "30. 9. 93 Debates of the European Parliament No 3-435/39 GOLLNISCH than Mr Khasbulatov's parliament. The only difference is that here our electricity has not yet been cut off. (Applause from the DR Group) FORTE (PPE). - (IT) Mr President, I should like Parlia ment to discuss the question, any failure to do so would diminish an authoritative voice in the political debate on the emergencies arising in Russia. A Parliament, in fact, which had not given its views today would have been responsible for a silence which might have been inter preted as a real and genuine, albeit unavowed, political incapacity. We appreciate that the difficult situation, so full of tensions, might counsel silence, but we are not diplomats, we are Members of Parliament. So our voice should be raised loud and clear in support of Yeltsin and his ideas. Yeltin's position is not in fact debatable; he is holding new free elections intended to free a situation which by now has reached a point of no-return in the relations between his government and a parliament which is preponderantly conservative. It is unquestionable therefore that this Parliament must line up with the requirements of democracy and that the reforms must proceed. It is also unquestionable that there is a need for all initiatives which might lead to an honourable com promise which would safeguard on the one hand the principle of renewal thanks to parliamentary and presi dential elections but on the other hand would not give rise to police actions or armed conflict with the members of parliament who are now barricaded in the Moscow White House. This is our best course of action: not to interfere in matters internal to Russia but to send a warning inviting, as Members of Parliament, colleagues who are opposed to Yeltsin not to allow their conduct to degenerate, to accept a possible compromise and to ask Yeltsin not to resort to coercive measures which would in any case leave an unfortunate stain on the prospects of reform and - what counts for the most - on his political image at international level. COIMBRA MARTINS (PSE). - (PT) Mr President, the former President Khasbulatov is blinded by the memory of Mirabeau. He will not leave it behind except at bayonet-point. The weakness in his role is that he is not in Parliament due to the will of the people. I believe that the communications from the Council and the Commission express the basic position, even though blood is being shed in Georgia right now. I would like to express our clear support for the suspension of an outmoded Parlia ment and free elections within a short period of time. My feeling is that the elected president of Russia lost a lot of time before deciding what had to be done. He hesitated a lot. I envision another role for him - the Hamlet of Sverdlovsk. The situation is extremely touchy. Not all the regions approved of it, nor did all of Russia, nor did all Musco vites. The Russians are not applauding for anything just yet. Their life is starting to become impossible. The comedy, or tragedy, or tragi-comedy cannot go on. The ineffectualness of the government, the draining of resources, and the omnipresence of the mafia are causing despair among the people, whose patience has so far withstood every test. Our support for Yeltsin should also express our apprehension. Our solidarity must be more fruitful, our programmes more effective, and the associa tion agreement rapidly concluded. There is no time to lose in Russia. Yes, elections are urgently needed. Yes terday, Kozyrev asked the world to observe them. How ever, it will be difficult to do what is necessary to ensure that they are held on the announced date. On the contrary, the International Centre for Science and Technology, to which we have allocated twenty million escudos, can now begin its activities if the Russian president signs the necessary decree. Parliament, which failed to ratify the relevant instrument, has stopped legislating and obstruct ing. The Commission should write to the president of Russia in this connection. BARON CRESPO (PSE). - (ES) Mr President, when speaking of the Community institutions, Jean Monnet used to quote the Swiss philosopher Amiel, saying that 'the experience of men starts anew. Only the institutions become wiser.' This is relevant today, for Russia is now experiencing the construction of democratic institutions. I agree that we should support the consolidation process of these institu tions, for this will be a long and painful process. It is also painful that the Russian Parliament, an institution similar to our own - bearing in mind the differences - should be besieged. We must state the absolute necessity that the Russian people, who are experiencing for the first time in their history a peaceful transition to democracy, should be able to continue having their parliament. In this connection, I feel it is fitting to support the continuation of the reform process and support President Yeltsin in so far as he is capable of leading the people forward. Such support must not, however, be unconditional. We must insist on the need to hold democratic elections under the same conditions as the democratic elections held in our countries, namely with freedom of the press, freedom of access to the media for all candidates, and within the shortest time possible. We must clearly say that we are in favour of establishing these values in a continent that saw the signing of the Charter of Paris, by lending the Russian people support so they can continue down this path and by demanding that their leader, President Yeltsin, manage to face up to the consequences of the decisions he has taken. I feel that this is the position the Community should adopt and I do not believe that it would be a good idea to place all our confidence in one person. I believe that, in a democracy, people earn merit and recognition in so far as they comply with the rules of democracy. PRESIDENT. - The debate is closed. The vote will take place at 12 noon today. 6. Market in bananas PRESIDENT. - The next item is the joint debate on the following Oral Questions: - by Mr von der Vring, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, to the Commission (B3-1004/93/rev. - 0-190/93) on the implementation of the common organization of the market in bana nas; - by Mr von Wogau, Mrs Daly, Mrs Hermans and Mr Verhagen, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, to the Commission, (B3-1197/93 - 0-213/93) on the implementation of the banana market regulation of 13 February 1992, and ",
        "No 3-435/40 Debates of the European Parliament 30. 9. 93 PRESIDENT - by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, Mr Telk\u00e4mper and Mr Verbeek, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament, to the Commission, (B3-1198/ 93 - 0-215/93) on the implementation of the com mon organization of the market in bananas. von der VRING (PSE). - (DE) Mr President, I am not opposed to the common organization of the market. I have defended it in difficult circumstances at home and reported back there the promises and explanations of the Commission, and I now insist that these promises be kept. The European Court has very shrewdly ruled that there is sufficient flexibility in the common organization of the market in bananas to prevent disruption to supply and prejudice to the traditional importers. The workers in Bremerhaven alerted me: their jobs are suddenly under threat. It is plain that nobody knows what is really happening on the banana market - not even the Commission! But the workers are losing their jobs, and I beg you to accept that this is not a game and that they will not wait until the confusion has lifted. The fact is that, in the Northern European ports, there has been a substantial decline in the transshipment of bananas; that applies to Bremen, Hamburg, Antwerp, Rotterdam and Rostock. The consequences are job losses which have already taken place and, if the trend continues, then by the end of the year a third of those employed in that area will have to expect to lose their jobs. Bananas have become considerably more expensive in Germany, and we have to compare here bananas of the same quality and not two different kinds of fruit. There were significant price increases in August and Septem ber, and even if the price levels off again in October, it will rise further in the autumn. Both of these indicate an - artificial - shortfall in supply. There are two reasons for this. The current tariff quota is 15% lower than the level of imports of dollar bananas into the Federal Republic in the preceding year. The traditional importers of dollar bananas were accorded import rights for ACP bananas which were of no use to them. At present, they have no access to ACP bananas, which are committed under contract for years to come, and the Commission is unable to accord them such access, although this is in fact its responsibility. That is a mistake. It is totally beyond belief that the import licences for dollar bananas, which were taken away from the tradi tional importers, are now being auctioned in Spain as bits of paper for DM 0.40 per kg. That is almost a black market and is indicative of an artificial monopoly bonus! It is a scandal on which the Commission must act! I would not dispute that it is very difficult to deal with this. The Commission is taking courageous action, and I would support it in this. But I would call for the requisite flexibility to avoid damage to anyone and also to ensure that the reputation of the common organization of the market is not irretrievably damaged in the very first days of its existence. The Commission ought therefore to raise the import quotas immediately to remedy the shortfall in supply on the German market and redistribute the licences so that they can actually be used, to avoid a situation where fictitious licences are distributed and a black market comes into being. I believe that the Com mission can easily do this. Let me conclude by saying that I am not the mouthpiece of some lobby but that I speak for the workers and for sensible implementation of the common organization of the market in bananas. But the importers of ACP bananas who sent the House a telex by way of propaganda against my oral question are far from being the representatives of Amnesty International or some private humanitarian body. They are capitalist undertakings and are opposing me to protect their profits. von WOGAU (PPE). - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to point out that my Group's question is not directed against this organization of the market as such. There are, as we know, similar organiza tions of the market in other areas. We are not attacking the organization of the market as such but the way it is being put into effect, particularly in Germany. We know that only 66.5% of licences are going to the existing, the traditional importers and that 30% are going to the ACP market operators and that, as a result, and combined with the overall cutback, the traditional market operators - and these are often small and medium-sized undertakings - are able to turn over only 50% of their past turnover. In addition to this, there is the fact - according to my information - that there are to be further reductions in October. I take the view that the effects on prices of these new organizations of the market are often exaggerated and that we need to wait and see how matters turn out in the long term. We object to traditional patterns of trade being diverted in this way and to the fact the small and medium-sized undertakings are being deprived of 50% of their existing business; we are not objecting to the producers in the countries of the South and the ACP States. We therefore consider it vital that the number of licences for these importers is increased so that these very specific problems can be resolved and the jobs which are at issue here can be protected. GRAEFE ZU BARINGDORF (V). - (DE) Mr President, Mr von der Vring said that this was a dispute between capitalist undertakings. That may be so, but perhaps we still need to differentiate a little. Our basic concern is the producers and not the marketing monopolies. But if you look at the campaign conducted in Germany by the importers of 'dollar bananas', including the large posters proclaiming that our children would soon be at risk from drugs because this is the direction in which the banana plantations would diversify, it is apparent that this has been a fight with no holds barred. We take the view that those companies would in any case have cut back because they had overestimated demand on the German market after a veritable boom following German unification. But they lay the blame for the cuts they are having to make at the door of the regulation. In response to the claim that small firms are now being taken over, we should point to the practices of those monopolies which controlled the banana market: they are now buying into companies which previously operated in the ACP market and are trying to extend their monopoly here also. These are practices of which we cannot approve ! We, however, are - as I have said - more concerned about the producers, and the production of bananas in the ACP countries is more environmentally acceptable - even though all is not as it should be - than in Latin America. The reason for this is that the dollar banana importers have influenced production and pressed ahead ",
        "30. 9. 93 Debates of the European Parliament No 3-435/41 GRAEFE ZU BARINGDORF with it in a socially and environmentally irresponsible way. The Commission must ensure here that the small banana producers in both the Community and the ACP countries are supported via programmes and money. We take the view that we need a minimum cost price for bananas and that the adjustment levies should be channelled back into a programme of diversification, including in the ACP States, to promote environmentally acceptable produc tion of not only bananas but also basic foodstuffs. We would urge the Commission to follow this line of action but to observe the general principles of this banana agreement. STEICHEN, Member of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, let me say first of all that the organization of the banana market adopted by the Council in February tries to reconcile different, sometimes even contradicto ry, interests. I think we must always bear that fact in mind. The interests of the banana-producers, those of the Community and the ACP on the one hand and those of the dollar-banana on the other, the realization of the internal market and the Community's international obligations are the many factors which were taken into account when this new common organization of the banana market was adopted. The aim of the new organization of the banana market was not so much to modify fundamentally the traditional structures applicable to the importation and distribution of bananas as simply an attempt by the Commission to avoid disturbing normal trade relations between traders situated at different points of the chain of trade in this sector. It was in this spirit that the Commission made sure there was a fair sharing out of the tariff quota, thus offering the same opportunities to traders throughout the Member States. It is now for the traders to take up the challenges of this single banana market - since previously there was none - and take their place on this single market. So much for the spirit and philosophy of this new organiza tion of the banana market. I should like to say a word about the detailed arrange ments, to reaffirm that the Commission is actively engaged in establishing all the necessary detailed rules for application concerning the external and internal aspects of this new common organization of the market. As regards first the new system of importation, the criteria to be taken into account for drawing up the list of traders and their reference quantities with a view to the use of the tariff quota have been adopted. Discussions are now under way with the Member States on the determi nation of the list of traders and their reference quantities with a view to the final issue of import licences for the second half of 1993. So as to make it possible to draw up the final list of traders, the Commission decided on two provisional grants of import licences from the month of July, on the basis of imports effected during previous years, for the period July to October 1993. Any under-supply of the Community market must in fact be avoided. There I should like to reassure once more Mr von der Vring, who said here that there would be bottle-necks. In the Com mission's view there are none, and I shall come back to this point presently. Now I should like to say a word about the trend of the Community market, and particularly prices. The whole sale price of yellow bananas, which at the beginning of July showed an increase on the markets in the north of the Community and a decrease on the markets which were formerly protected, seems now to be showing the reverse trend. We are seeing a certain convergence at Commun ity level where the present wholesale price is some ECU 0.9 per kilo. The data recorded in Germany during the early part of September are comparable to those of previous normal years, account being taken of the speculation noted at the end of 1991 and during 1992. I must make it clear that those were abnormal years because of the speculation and because too of the tendency clearly shown by some traders to enter the market for periods beginning after the adoption of the common organization. The Commis sion's officers are closely following this price trend in the Community. As regards the quantities available, it should be noted that for the German market the data do not show any shortage of supply, as I previously mentioned. Elsewhere the Commission has had no news of of any problem of banana shortages in the other Member States, but it is remaining attentive to the need for the Community market to be sufficiently supplied at all times. Moreover this point has been mentioned in the claims made in the application to the Court for interim measures, mentioned earlier. In that connection I would mention that the Community rules envisage the possibility of altering the level of the tariff quota on the basis of a balance sheet the marketing year which is to be compiled by the Commis sion's officers. With your permission, Mr President, I shall now deal with another subject which has been raised, the situation in the German ports. In this connection the Commission has figures which do not show any clear fall in activity. Mr von der Vring mentioned job losses, but I think we must approach this information carefully. The COM in bananas came into force on 1 July, so it is hard to judge whether these new provisions had a negative effect on the level of employ ment. Sometimes firms use the pretext of a change in the situation to shed jobs. Mr von der Vring mentioned quantities unloaded 15% below normal. According to my officers and the German customs authorities quantities unloaded amounted to roughly 12 000 tonnes a week which, extrapolated for one month, gives 50 000 tonnes, and for one year 600 000 tonnes. That is equivalent to bananas unloaded in Germa ny in 1990 and 1991. Once again, I have not referred to 1992, which was a year of heavy speculation in bananas, as I have just mentioned. Another point has been raised - Latin-American produc ers. As the Commission, we think that the common organization of the market in bananas will make it possible to maintain, or even to increase, traditional exports from Latin-American producer countries, of course if market conditions allow. However, the Com mission thinks it is necessary to strengthen cooperation between the Community and our Latin-American part ners producing bananas. It is convinced that the best way of developing that cooperation consists in establishing diversification and development funds for those coun- ",
        "No 3-435/42 Debates of the European Parliament 30. 9. 93 STEICHEN tries. It is therefore maintaining the proposal it has made to that effect. Now as regards the ACP countries, the Commission will continue to press the Council to adopt without delay its proposal with regard to a special system of aid to traditional ACP suppliers. The Commission thinks, in fact, that that proposal is an essential complement to the common organization of the markets and an indispensa ble means for the Commission to meet its obligations towards the ACP countries. Finally, Mr President, the Commission thinks that the recent adoption of the common organization of the market in bananas needs a certain period for the adoption of the detailed rules for application. We are following the market trend very closely and the application of the rules of this new common organization. I would remind you that this COM involves interests which it is sometimes hard to reconcile. That is why it must be carefully administered with the maximum flexibility, the essential aim being to ensure that the Community market is satisfactorily supplied, which does not seem to be the case at present. Lastly, Mr President, the Commission emphasizes that the administration of this system can only be effective in close collaboration with the Member States. SUAREZ GONZALEZ (PPE). - (ES) Mr President, I noticed a certain contradiction in the words of the Commission representative which I would like to clear up. On the one hand, he maintains the proposal for aid to diversifying banana production in the Latin American countries. But on the other hand, in the proposed budget for next year, he has withdrawn the quantity needed to make this aid effective. I would like to have a clear explanation of this matter. PRESIDENT. - I would inform the House that I have received two motions for resolutions with a request for an early vote to wind up the debate. (') The vote on the request for an early vote will take place at the end of the debate. COLINO SALAMANCA (PSE). - (ES) Mr President, I would first like to express my satisfaction with the response given by the Commissioner responsible for agriculture to the questions asked, since at times propa ganda exaggerates the data and gives the impression that the entry into force of the COM in bananas is the cause of a number of problems which are not problems as such or, at least, do not have the magnitude attributed to them in these issues. Secondly, I would like to draw the speakers' attention to the unusual procedure of banning a common organization of the market which entered into force on 1 July - scarcely a month and a half before the questions were formulated - when, as the Commissioner has acknow ledged, we still do not have proof enabling us to blame these regulations for the problems. What is more, as the Commissioner also mentioned, I feel it is important to recall that we do not have any compa rative data. The comparisons of July and August 1993 with July and August 1992 and 1991 are not valid because one part of the commercial agents active in the 1 ) See Minutes banana market were making preparations to distort the banana market when the time came. Everyone knows what happened in 1992, when the Commission announced that it was working on a common organiza tion of the market in bananas: a number of companies took up a position. For this reason, mere comparisons of transshipments of goods in 1993 and 1992 are not enough. Other data should be taken into account. For this reason, we have said and we maintain that there was no need to call into question the common organization of the market in bananas. In any case, we maintain that there are no temporary factors from which one could deduce the serious consequences as explained by the German repre sentatives in this House. Thirdly, mention was also made of prices. It should be recalled that, even in Germany, when the 20% tariff was not being charged in the past, prices were higher than they were for the same goods in Benelux ports. Why? Because the companies had a tremendous impact. Finally, I would simply like to say for the record that I feel that the concern for workers in German ports is important, whether or not they unload bananas. However, I would like to remind you of the jobs that would have been lost in the European Community, in the Canary Islands, in Madeira, and in a number of French overseas territories, if we had been unfortunate enough not to have a COM in bananas. Consequently, may those speakers take into account the delicate balance required for the common organization of the market so that they do not indirectly attempt to put an end to it, for I believe that it has benefitted the sector. HERMANS (PPE). - (NL) Mr President, Mr Commis sioner, ladies and gentlemen, now that the Commissioner has already answered the questions, we no longer need to go further into them ourselves and in the first place I should like to thank him for the explanation he has given. He has done all that repeatedly in a carefully balanced and objective way and he has tried to make clear the difficult balancing act which this organization of the market actually represents. From his answer it also appears that it is still too early to shade in and evaluate the precise effects. But I should like to say this: Belgium has not too many big ports, one big port, Antwerp, and if the workforce there is unemployed, Mr Commissioner, it does not actually matter to them what the exact cause is. I should therefore like to ask you to continue to keep a carefully eye on this and take any necessary measures. In particular I am glad that Parliament has again expressed its entire support for the whole project. We have already done that repeatedly and from the original reactions I was previously a little surprised and sometimes angry that journalists and politicians too allowed themselves to be so easily swept along on the wings of big business and to adopt information about certain aspects. I am glad that we in Parliament are again supporting the whole plan, as I actually think, and I am speaking here primarily on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, that we in Parliament must also continue to support the arrangement with regard to the ACP countries. There is great anxiety there and I am well aware that often the people working in the plantations and the producers are not the highest paid. I should like to ask too for particular attention and care to be paid to this. The arrangement has ",
        "30. 9. 93 Debates of the European Parliament No 3-435/43 HERMANS been made in order to keep the market open to bananas from the ACP countries, and let us guarantee that. From the answer you gave, Mr Commissioner, it seems that it concerns our European market, but the develop ment policy is also involved. Would it not be a good thing to have more, and more constructive, consultation in both the Commission and the Council? I still remember what the Danish Minister for Development Cooperation said when we wanted to discuss this arrangement with her. She said 'I have just been an observer like you, because it has been decided without me'. I think any self-respecting authority must be accessible for proper consultation. PORTO (LDR). - (PT) (...) The haste with which the common organization of the market entered into force on 1 July of this year must appear odd, as there was certainly not enough time to evaluate whether it was correct. We are convinced of this, as we had the opportunity to emphasize in the explanation of the vote we submitted in the plenary session last 15 December. We are in complete agreement that an assessment should be made after three years, as planned. Indeed, our group initially suggested a preliminary assessment at the end of this year. However, we must insist that a similarly rigorous assessment also be made of the other common organizations of the market, since the reductions in transshipments and jobs resulting over three decades of common agricultural policy are undoubtedly much greater. This discourages imports of meat, grains, milk and a great many other important products that could come to Europe at more accessible prices. Since our defenders are convinced of the virtues of free trade, we must continue to be sensitive to the social and environmental problems linked to agriculture and to the need to promote well-advised readjustments. What we fail to understand is that, since the common organizations of the market rooted in the CAP have infinitely greater problems, there is now hasty and unusual concern being shown for a new organization that is small and temporary. In addition to bananas, there is also some question about a few products that come from a limited number of regions, including from the Portuguese region of Madeira. This is production that is enormously important at local level, providing work for 12% of the working population and accounting for 20% of the agricultural output and 33% of the region's total exports. It also represents - and this should be stressed - something special and irreplaceable in the rural and social fabric of the region, thus contributing to its tourist appeal, which was the main reason the region did not have to seek out alternatives of equal value. It is therefore important to support these regions. It is on this point that I would like to hear what the Commissioner has to say. ARCHIMBAUD (V). - (FR) Mr President, the events which took place at the end of November 1992 in Martinique and Guadeloupe, when thousands of produc ers held a massive demonstration and blocked the airports reminded us of the profound anxiety amongst small-scale banana producers in what are called the ultra-peripheral regions of the European Community. Of course it is not a question of setting the small-scale banana producers of the EEC against those of the ACP, but we must find a comprehensive solution to this dramatic situation. There are solutions provided that we take eco-development and long-term development as our framework. First of all it is urgent to revise the common organization of the banana market by involving the unions, the agricultural cooperatives and the small-scale producers in the negotiations. From this point of view market penetration by multi-national groups is very worrying. We must also fix export quotas for the producer countries and not for the importers, and ensure that small-scale producers are paid a fair price. Then too we mjust encourage those who are cutting down the use of chemi cal products and those who, more generally, are growing bananas in conditions compatible with ecological and social requirements and who respect eco-systems, for example forests and wetlands. Finally, the European Community must resolutely encou rage any initiatives to move away from the single-crop systems for bananas or sugar cane. There are many possibilities for diversification in agriculture. That is the direction we must take if we want to restore disrupted balances and revive local products and distribution chains, in short, to help to get out of this infernal spiral of unemployment, of under-development, of reliance on assistance and of dependence. But that would require more than words; it would take real financial support and the granting of European funds. BARRERA I COSTA (ARC). - (FR) Mr President, what we are doing here is, in my opinion, the epitome of what we ought not to be doing. Our plenary sittings are not frequent and our time is very limited. Instead of concern ing ourselves with absolutely vital questions which war rant an in-depth debate, we are talking about bananas. Of course they are important, but one may wonder whether it is appropriate to rake over again such a recent agreement. If there are problems it seems to me it would have been better to consider them calmly at meetings of parliament ary committees. The information for which the Commis sion is being asked could have been obtained in another way. But since it has been decided that we should talk about bananas, let us do so. In fact we are seeing attempts by certain very powerful pressure groups to make us bow to their interests. Great transnational undertakings, exploiting in Central Ameri ca a defenceless labour-force, are not content to preserve their market share, they would like it all. Community preference, the survival of banana producers in the island periphery of the Community are set at nought. We are told of firms in difficulties, of job losses in Germany. The Commission seems doubtful. But has not the Commun ity's commercial policy always resulted in modifications of certain trade patterns? Are we concerned about the present situation facing many workers and farmers in the southern countries of the Community? Ladies and gentlemen, I am obliged to repeat what I was saying yesterday in the debate on GATT: 'Let us be careful. Our Europe seems to be more and more in the service of the rich countries. Every day we stray further away from the generous objectives which the founding fathers set themselves'. IN THE CHAIR: MRS FONTAINE Vice-President DOMINGO SEGARRA (NI). - (ES) Madam President, I would like to begin by saying that I am surprised by the attacks launched here against the COM in bananas, given the fact that it has only been in force for two or three ",
        "No 3-435/44 Debates of the European Parliament 30. 9. 93 DOMINGO SEGARRA months. I do not know what happened with other pro ducts, but I seriously doubt that the Commission or the Members of this House have the instruments needed to assess the effectiveness of the COM after only two or three months in operation. In any case that would be like trying to predict the future. Secondly, I think that, despite everything, the effects of not having this COM would have been much worse if, several months into the Single Market, we had found ourselves without a COM to regulate a sector in which one country was not subject to the common external tariff. That could have generated much more distortion in the Community market. Therefore the European Unitary Left welcomes the COM and the regulation governing it, on the understanding that it is always difficult to create a regulation that has to divide up a single area of demand - the Community market - among the three major producer areas: the Community, the ACP countries and the 'dollar banana' zone. In any case, we are satisfied that it will ensure the survival of Community businesses. This has already been said here in this h\u00e9micycle. However, those areas - most of which are overseas - that produce bananas in the Community comply with the objective of the social cohesion policy and environmental policy. In this area, we have the mechanisms to ensure that these areas can subsist by continuing their production as they have been doing for so long. In the ACP countries we can guarantee, as a minimum, export opportunities which will allow these countries to stabilize their balance of trade. This regulation is also in line with the philosophy of GATT, which makes it possible for growth in demand to be met with new imports. However, I would like to return to a point dealt with yesterday in the debate on GATT, namely the difficulty of defining the geographical origin of many products when operators and multinationals have begun to take up operations in third countries using intensive production techniques which damage the environment and which fail to comply with minimum social demands. For this reason, we are asking the Commission to be careful when granting certificates, and especially when lending its support to producers' associations and trade unions so that they can have some negotiating strength vis-a-vis the major production companies. In this connection, we feel that if negative effects are being generated for German middlemen, the Commission could apply compensatory measures, but such measures must be applied equally in all sectors throughout the Community that are affected by the Single Market. We are calling for equal treatment for everyone who has the same problem. PERREAU DE PINNINCK DOMENECH (RDE). - (ES) Madam President, once upon a time a disciple of Saint Thomas Aquinas - not one of his brightest disciples - was very anxious to demonstrate the greatness of God. He uses very picturesque arguments, such as the follow ing: 'God is so great that he made rivers run through the middle of cities.' I have noted this same distortion of cause and effect in the current debate. It is unfair to blame all these problems on the common organization of the market in bananas. It is the agreement that has reduced and remedied the prob lems in the banana market. The more I talk to the parties involved, the more I am convinced that it is a perfect agreement, namely one that satisfies nobody. It would be a bad agreement if one of the many interested parties was happy with it. We must realize that the Single Market has a great many implications, and we must accept the delicate balance between various interests, which are less contrasting then we often depict. Let us give the agreement time. Let us give the common organization of the market time. When it can be shown that it is having damaging effects for some sectors or zones, then we will quickly take the necessary steps. VAN PUTTEN (PSE). - (NL) Mr President, we have seen in the Netherlands too that the publications about the EEC organization of the market are disparaged on false grounds. People have still not understood what is actually in the organization of the market or in this banana regulation. I think the problems now arising, the German examples, and possibly we can add in the future Antwerp, or Rotterdam from the Netherlands, are problems regard ing the internal section. I think that in the discussion it is important for us to make it very clear as regards this banana regulation, that we have the external section and the internal section. The external section must stay as laid down by the Commission with the opportunities, con tained in the articles, as the Commissioner has also mentioned, for modest increases in the tariff preferences and tonnages. But that concerns again the external section in which a legal arrangement is offered to the ACP countries, and we may call it by its Dutch name, a 'sterfhuisconstructie', or a hive-down or separation into viable and moribund businesses, for the ACP countries within the Lom\u00e9 protocol, the banana protocol. I do not know the word for it in other languages, but it entails for us the moral obligation to comply with this protocol. The ACP banana countries have a right for us to support them and to work for a run-down, so let us not disparage it. That gives the Commission now the problem that they must deal with the internal section, and there I agree with what the previous speakers have said: for the coming period we need to watch quietly how it works out and to make grants and licences transparent, because it is important for us to see to it that the business firms are fairly treated. M\u00c9NDEZ DE VIGO (PPE). - (PT) Madam President, I had some doubts about my speech of this morning since, you all will recall, I suggested yesterday that this issue be withdrawn from the agenda. However, I am pleased that I asked for the floor since after listening to the author of the question I must confirm what I said yesterday: this is a pointless debate. Moreover, this opinion is shared by most of the speakers from all the political groups. It is simple common sense to realize that it is impossible to evaluate the effects - be they positive or negative - of the common organization of the market in bananas after just three months. As someone said - and quite rightly too - this COM is being blamed for all that bad things that have happened in the banana sector over the past decades. I feel such allegations cannot be taken seriously. Commissioner Steichen responded - and I feel encou raged by this answer - to many of the concerns voiced by ",
        "30. 9. 93 Debates of the European Parliament No 3-435/45 M\u00c9NDEZ DE VIGO the author of the question. I have also noticed that the author of the question was misinformed, judging by a passing reference made to practices in my country. I believe that one should take great care when attributing blame for certain types of conduct to certain countries. One should certainly not believe what is written in certain sensationalist newspapers. I think the author of the report should check his sources better. Madam President, I would like us to return to a serious climate, the climate of consensus that led to the approval of the COM in bananas - something which took a lot of effort by this House. I would like to return to a climate of consensus, for I would be very worried indeed if a policy of constantly discrediting the COM in bananas were to take root. That would worry me a lot. I was already concerned by the first question on the results of the COM, even though it had not yet entered into force. And now there is a second question after just three months. I would like to make an appeal for calm in this House, as well as discipline by the Members. This COM required a great deal of effort. This COM achieved the consensus of an enormous majority of our producers and the ACP countries with whom we are contractually linked, includ ing those in the dollar zone. This climate of consensus, which was achieved in this House, is weakened every time the question is raised in this House of the goodness of the COM in bananas. We must not forget, as someone pointed out correctly, that the majority of Community banana producers are in ultraperipheral and island regions. Lastly, Madam President, I would like to repeat to Mr Steichen the question posed by my colleague Suarez Gonzalez regarding the diversification and development fund. HOLZFUSS (LDR). - (DE) Madam President, I am speaking neither on behalf of my Group nor on behalf of a multinational, but I wish to voice my objection. On 12 December last, this House voted, in a roll-call vote, with 250 votes for and 8 against, for the common organization of the market in bananas. I was one of those who voted against. This organization of the market in bananas has got completely out of hand in Germany. It has become a negative symbol of excessive regulation by the Brussels Eurocracy. It is also contrary to the spirit of the agricul tural reform. It creates a kind of banana-fortress Europe and provokes distortion of competition. It is causing a decline in exports for the poor developing countries. It is making Germany's favourite fruit more expensive and does not provide any incentive to purchase less well-liked bana nas. It requires further subsidies instead of making increased structural resources available for diversifica tion. It is resulting in compensatory payments to develop ing countries or the desperate cultivation of unwanted products. In many places, it is resulting in increased unemployment, as Mr von der Vring has pointed out. There is no need for a common organization of the market in a fruit only 20% of Community demand for which is produced in the Community itself. Instead of gradually dismantling costly organizations of the market and final ly embarking on deregulation, we are once again simply patching things up. That is no way to sell either bananas or Europe. DE LOS SANTOS LOPEZ (ARC). - (ES) Madam President, we do not really understand why the question on bananas was introduced here in this first part-session in Brussels. We do not agree with the reasons advanced by our colleague Mr von der Vring. It seems advisable, however, to recall that the Treaty of Rome was respected - at least theoretically - in the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. Bananas are a product in short supply in the Community, as they come from ultraperipheral and island regions of the Community where the system of preferences must be applied without question. Just two months ago, and in acknowledgement of this preference, the new COM in bananas was finally approved, although we must not forget that it includes measures - such as the first one, covering the uprooting of banana plantations - aimed at gradually dismantling banana production. Consequently, the COM is likely to disappear in the not-too-distant future. In addition, the application of new measures demands an adaptation by the conventional trade system, which has given rise to certain trade upheavals which apparently have had an impact on a Community port. But do you really know the impact that the gradual decrease in banana production is going to have in our ultraperipheral and island regions? Should European citizens in ultraper ipheral regions be considered second or third-class citiz ens? Are we to understand that the Community is using the structural funds to subsidize unemployment in Objec tive 1 regions, while, on the other hand, it is dismantling the primary sector which is, in turn, one of the main causes of unemployment? Perhaps we want assisted regions which have no other possibility for development? WYNN (PSE). - Mr President, the implication of the question is that the quota for imports of dollar and other bananas other than the traditional ACP supplies is inade quate and causing hardship and unemployment. I think the Commission went some way to alleviating some of those fears. The Commission gave us several facts. I would like to add one or two other facts. The supplies in the European Community market as a whole are at least as great as in the last half of 1992. The dollar quota for the last six months of 1992 was 1 million tonnes and dollar imports in that period slightly exceeded that, by 8000 tonnes. In addition there was a substantial stock build-up imme diately prior to 1 July - and we should not forget that - to beat the introduction of the quota. Another fact is that at least one shipper has reported failing to find a market for dollar bananas in Germany and having to sell them elsewhere in the Community. The Commission made the point about prices. So far prices in Germany have been a little higher than a year ago and those in the previously restricted markets a little lower, as would be expected. But in Germany the official list price is being heavily discounted. These are not indications of a market being starved of supplies. I think the concerns of the question put by Mr von der Vring are valid and we should share those concerns, but I also think that the Commission's reply was extremely helpful. Mr President, the one thing that must come from this House today - and is coming from this House and certainly from the Commission - is the message to the people we will meet here next week, that ",
        "No 3-435/46 Debates of the European Parliament 30. 9. 93 WYNN is the ACP Joint Assembly, that in no way whatsoever does this Parliament wish to see the common market in bananas altered from that already agreed last year. FROMENT-MEURICE (PPE). - (FR) Madam President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, some months ago following many discussions and complicated nego tiations, a common organization of the market in bananas was established. Inevitably that innovation entailed a series of changes on the markets and naturally such market changes entailed changes consumer practices in one member country or another, but it is not acceptable to use that as an argument for trying to call in question so brusquely, and so precipitately after it was set up, a system which only began to operate on 1 July. What do we find today? First, as regards prices, the COM system is working correctly. There has not been a price explosion, contrary to the impression some people wished to convey. Prices have remained reasonable. They have stayed level and that, for the producers, is altogether decisive. It is true they tell us that in Germany there has been a drop in consumption of 40% and in that respect I should like to put a first question to the Commission: is it not true that in 1992, in order to obtain reference figures before the common organization of the market in bananas was established, certain importers on the German market went in for intensive over-stocking, which means that in fact the reference figures for entry into the COM were distorted in comparison with normal annual consumption? Is it true, Mr Commissioner, that Eurostat noted an error of 400 000 tonnes in the statistics for imports of bananas into Germany because the Ger mans were including in their statistics the amounts they themselves were re-exporting to the markets of Eastern Europe, regarding them statistically as imports for domestic consumption? That is an important point which would in fact explain the movements noted on the German banana market. My second remark is that I am rather astonished that we have not mentioned, or have hardly mentioned, GATT this morning. I recall that the COM in bananas comes under GATT and that any discussion which might tend to show us divided vis-\u00e0-vis GATT leaves us open to criticism, following the work of the panel of experts, under GATT, which at such a time would ruin the whole system of the COM in bananas. Our discussions certainly weaken the Commission's position in the GATT panel discussions where we are trusting that the Commission will defend the Community position and the validity of the COM as regards the rules of international trade. My last remark is that producers, be they French, Spanish or German, the Community producers, have made enor mous efforts to modernize their production. These efforts are bearing fruit today and it would be quite out of order for them to be called in question once more. Ladies and gentlemen, speaking today in this new h\u00e9mi cycle, of this question of bananas which is certainly central to the future of the Community, I should just like to say that according to my sums, this h\u00e9micycle and the building represent 234 years of European banana con sumption! JARZEMBOWSKI (PPE). - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, your response, Mr Steichen, will not enable me to convince the workers, undertakings and consumers in Hamburg and Bremen. If all you can do is say that you are taking as a basis the reference period and that there was no fall in imports during that period, that will do nothing to persuade someone whose job is under threat or has already been lost. It is a fact that, as compared with the period before the entry into force of the common organization of the market, we are exper iencing a substantial fall in imports into Germany. In that connection, you have yourself said that the Commis sion's initial approach was prevent distortion of patterns of trade and the economic flows. It is quite plain that the ratio of 66% for traditional importers as compared with 30% for ACP market opera tors is completely out of proportion, and that alone is what is making possible the current trade in licences. Trading in licences is the worst thing that can happen to a market operator. Operators should trade in goods not licences. But where there is trade in licences, this means that the products for which there is consumer demand are arriving in the wrong place and in the wrong amounts, and this must be resolved. I have no wish to dispute the figures, Commissioner, but it has to be said that the cost of bananas in Germany has risen, and, Mr Meurice, statistics from past years will do nothing to change the view of 80 million Germans. They go to the grocer's, and if the bananas are more expensive, they say: 'That is the result of a bad Community policy!' I need a reasonable answer to that, Commissioner! I should like therefore to ask you to explain the facts! According to information I have obtained from the various Bonn ministries, imports have fallen and prices risen; there are problems with jobs in the trade and in the ports. To that extent, Mr von der Vring, I am unable to understand your viewpoint either. I think the ratio of 66% to 30% is incorrect, and if that is the case, then that section of the organization of the market is wrong and must be reviewed. Commissioner, you yourself said earlier that you wish to monitor this market situation and that you are prepared to increase the quotas if necessary. Answer me one ques tion: when is the Commission going to investigate once and for all the situation on the markets for consumers and for employees in the ports and in the trade and submit proposals? I should like to leave this House feeling that the European Parliament has a genuine sense of respon sibility towards consumers and employees! STEICHEN, Member of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, I should not wish to detain your Assembly too long. I should just like to reply briefly to various questions raised, but first I must thank all those who have spoken on the common organization of the market in bananas. That question has kept the media busy for months, but the situation, as I explained, is now becom ing altogether normal. We are keeping a careful eye on this subject, Madam President. We must watch the market trends. We shall also proceed to the final issue of licences and we shall, as some have just mentioned, also draw up the balance sheet of the market situation. We must do so, according to the rules, before the end of November, and if there is need we shall adjust the tariff quota under Article 16(3) of our regulation. I should like to tell Mr Su\u00e1rez Gonz\u00e1lez, who asked why the diversification aid had been abolished, that it was not ",
        "30. 9. 93 Debates of the European Parliament No 3-435/47 STEICHEN the Commission which abolished it. It was the Council of Ministers for Finance or the Budget which struck out an item of ECU 15 m proposed by the Commission and which is now entered as p.m. If necessary Parliament will have to restore the balance in this respect. As regards Mrs Herman's question about operations in the Belgian ports, I would say that new unloading facilities became available at Zeebrugge in the spring. So there are certainly no grounds for pessimism as regards port operations in Belgium. I should also like to say briefly, Madam President, that the internal section, as certain speakers asked about it, is in place. So a compensatory income subsidy is envis aged. Similarly since 1992 everything has been in place for improving structures, in particular on the basis of the POSEIDON, POSEICAN and POSEIMA programmes. Considerable structural aid is envisaged. As regards the other two sections of the organization of the market in bananas, that is, aid to the ACP countries and those countries in the dollar zone, namely the Latin-American countries, those two sets of rules, which form a whole with the internal rules, are still being considered by the Council. I hope it will be possible for the Council to adopt them in the near future. PRESIDENT. - We shall now vote on the request for an early vote. GRAEFE ZU BARINGDORF (V). - (DE) Madam Presi dent, I wish, on behalf of my Group, to withdraw our motion for a resolution for the following reason: we consider the further development, called for in the reso lution, of the organization of the market in bananas from the environmental and social points of view to be, of course, crucial, and above all countries must be allocated quotas. In the Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Rural Development, we did, however, agree that we wished to hold a discussion on the organization of the market in bananas but did not want to take any decisions on motions for resolutions. I endorsed that decision, or at least did not oppose it, and therefore feel bound by it. My Group has therefore decided to withdraw the motion. (Parliament rejected the request) (') 7. Votes Motion for resolution (Doc. B3-1239/93) by the Group of the Party of European Socialists on trade relations with Japan Explanations of vote DE VRIES (LDR). - (NL) Mr President, I should just like to explain, extremely briefly, why my Group cannot vote for this resolution. It makes only one request, and I will read you the English text: 'calls on the Commission to step up its dialogue with Japan'. Mr President, such a text has simply no political meaning. I think that we, as Parliament, must be on our guard against an inflation of texts and it is for that reason and not for any reason regarding the content, that we shall vote against this text. S\u00c4LZER (PPE). - (DE) Madam President, to salvage the honour of the Group of the European People's Party, I should like to make the following point: had those honourable Members who are speaking on this issue been present on Friday morning in Strasbourg, when in fact a total of 27 trusty souls from all the Groups were present - the majority of them, by the way, from my own Group - they would know that we have seen the way in which the motions for a resolution fit together and that we therefore approve the socialist resolution because, combined with the motion of the European People's Party, it makes proper sense. I would therefore ask you not to be influenced by what Mr de Vries has had to say; express ing approval is simply a formal process because the President forgot to hold a vote on the issue. We are now remedying that. In terms of substance, the motions adopted belong together. (Parliament adopted the resolution) Joint motion for a resolution ( 2 ) on the GATT negotia tions Explanations of vote HINDLEY (PSE). - Madam President, may I in my brief remarks remind the European Parliament that when the present round of GATT talks began there was great scepticisim in the developing world about the intent of the advanced world on GATT talks. The main problem was that other trading entities did not take seriously our commitment to agricultural reform. When the present GATT Round started some seven years ago, there was some considerable reluctance by the developing countries to come to the table. This reluctance was first of all based on the feeling that the European Community would not make concessions on agriculture and neither would the USA. Seven years on we find that GATT cannot be concluded because the USA and the EEC cannot come to an agreement on agriculture. The general concern also at that time - some seven years ago - was the understandable apprehension in the developing world that they were being forced to trade on terms drawn up by the dominant trading partners. Some seven years on that apprehension has not diminished by seeing the major trading partners unable to come to terms. If we are to have a global economy, Madam President, it is important that everyone on that globe feels equally part of the decision-making process. There is a danger emerg ing of a block chauvinism to replace the old national chauvinisms. I have heard that throughout this debate - an identification with something called Europe and a need to compete with something called Japan and the USA. It must be pointed out at a time when all the European economies are failing to come out of recession that a false sense of competition, particularly with Asia, can only lead to a further lowering of wages and social standards. In that respect, I would remind the European 1 ) Deadline for tabling amendments and motions for resolutions: see Minutes : ) Tabled by Mr Woltjer. on behalf of the Croup of the Party of European Socialists.

For that reason the Socialist Group, and indeed this entire Parliament, has always supported the notion that there should be a social clause in GATT. I would ask that we take that point seriously, that we conclude the present GATT Round and press on with a world trading system that takes social matters seriously and places them high on the agenda. ANTONY (DR). - (FR) Madam President, you rightly noted that the acoustics were bad. We can hardly hear anything in this hubbub. What a come-down, when we think that there were the theatres of Epidavros, the Parthenon, the cathedrals, that everywhere our ancestors could master the acoustics! Here in this conglomeration, in this frightful area where we can well see that the ugliness surrounding us reveals... (The President cut the speaker off) GUERMEUR (RDE). - (FR) Madam President, some Members expressed here yesterday their hopes and fears about the outcome of the negotiations taken up again with the United States on the agricultural section of GATT, in pursuance of the very firm and clear mandate given by the Council to the Commission. I shall not refer again to the wooden translation of the Council's mandate. My Group has a different concern. That is, above all, to give its fullest support to that mandate so that it is imple mented without weakness, without ambiguity, without reservations, but with the will to achieve some results which for us are essential. First the re-establishment - and I repeat, the re-establish ment, - of compatibility between the CAP on the one hand, as it has been reformed, as it aims to preserve agricultural activity and life in rural areas, as it attempts to avoid tearing the fabric of the social cohesion of Europe, and on the other hand the agreement as it is being renegotiated. Furthermore, we regard it as essential to exclude from GATT everything that concerns the cultural sphere. We also think it is dangerous to regard agriculture as the sole remaining obstacle to reaching an agreement before the end of the year. We have proposed amendments giving a comprehensive list of subjects still to be resolved, and it is very long. Consequently, Madam President, this debate, which is still centred on agricul ture, must not give the impression that once this obstacle has been removed all will go well and be settled by 15 December. I should like to end, Madam President, by expressing my regret that a resolution submitted to the Committee on External Economic Relations, debated by Members of all Groups in that committee, which has been adopted and may therefore be regarded as a compromise between Members of Parliament, has had to yield to a resolution discussed somewhere by four or five people round the corner of a table. That resolution has been put to the vote first and so has superseded the committee's resolution. That is quite out of order and in my view infringes Rule 56 of our Rules of Procedure, which carefully gives priority to the work of committees, that is, over the work of Groups or Members of Parliament. LANNOYE (V). - (FR) Madam President, I must say that when I saw the text of the joint resolution yesterday I was puzzled and wondered whether it was a compromise drafted by Sir Leon Brittan, Mr Mickey Kantor and Mr Sutherland. After studying it in depth I am convinced that that was the case. Paragraph 4 was obviously written by Sir Leon Brittan, who is absolutely unwilling to go back on his position as regards the Blair House compromise. Para graph 7, even though it has been a little bit raked over in an EPP stylistic exercise today, takes note of the cultural exception, which Mr Mickey Kantor might very well do, because it would commit him to nothing. As regards paragraph 10, it asks for support for the Director General of GATT so that after the general agreement a debate might be held with a view to reaching if possible an agreement on ecological and social problems. I note the socialist statement on this subject, postponing debate on ecological and social dumping, which always give us cause for concern. You will understand that in these circumstances we do not intend to make ourselves ridiculous by associating ourselves with a vote in favour. So we shall vote against. (Applause) BLANEY (ARC). - Madam President, may ljust say that in recent years we have been hearing how the GATT Uruguay Round has not been concluded because of the difficulties of agreeing on agriculture. Yet, now that we are down to the end of the line and talk about a deadline in December, there are so many other things that have not yet been agreed. And agriculture is not only still being blamed but Blair House is being forced upon us. Blair House is a disaster. It compounds what had gone before under the CAP reform. More small farmers and family farms are on their way out. A long time ago there was a Commissioner Gundelach and he prophesied, or stated, just what is happening today and he was practically howled down. Nobody could credit that this Community would do what it has been doing, i.e. driving the people off our small farms and off their land, despite the articles in the Treaty of Rome that guarantee their continuance. This is a total aberration. The 21% on top of what we have already sacrificed is scandalous to say the least. Had all the amendments been carried... (The President cut the speaker off) ISLER BEGUIN (V). - (FR) Madam President, by rejecting the amendments of the Green Group, the Euro pean Parliament has shown its cowardice in the face of the challenges to our society. The resolution is only a fleeting compromise in which the basic problems are approached with the usual stylistic subtleties: we invite, we adhere, we note, but above all we do nothing. Our Parliament reflects shades of French Government policy which makes a great splash in the media, striking poses, making statements and making a show of firmness on GATT, then the souffl\u00e9 falls flat and nothing changes. Are we going to keep on cherishing illusions about the increased economic growth which the signature of the GATT agreements is supposed to bring? The comprom ise resolution, in recital C, even goes so far as to put a figure on the gain in dollars, 313 000 m. What a pity they have forgotten the unemployment figures. Infinite ",
        "30. 9. 93 Debates of the European Parliament No 3-435/49 ISLER BEGUIN growth is impossible in a finite world. When shall we accept that fact? To vote for the compromise resolution would amount to failing to question the Blair House preliminary agree ments and the obsolescence of GATT. Our most brilliant discussions are no use if at voting time we run away from our responsibilities. Are we going to be instrumental in driving the poorest people on our planet to the end of their tether and to revolt by still imposing on them the rules of another age? Let us dare to vote for a real and lasting change based on ecologically sustainable development. The only hope for us is for each individual to recover dignity. Political wisdom would be to vote for the Green Group's resolution. There is still time. Courage! There is no roll- call vote on the compromise resolution. (Applause) ANDRE-LEONARD (LDR). - (FR) Madam President, I shall vote for the compromise motion for a resolution, whilst nevertheless pointing out that it is a compromise. As regards the agricultural sector we must remain par ticularly vigilant on the clarification of the compatibility of the Blair House preliminary, agreement with the common agricultural policy. Of course that is essential. As regards the audio-visual sector, I am glad that Parlia ment is stating very clearly its intention to defend the cultural identities of Europe by inserting a cultural exception in the text of the agreement. Today it seems that that is the best and the surest direction to take. It was important for us to specify that. For heaven's sake let us not fall into the trap of an audi-GATT. COONEY (PPE). - Madam President, I always think it a little churlish to vote against a compromise resolution but I have to do so because paragraph 4 can only mean that the Blair House Agreement stands, even if the Commun ity negotiators fail to achieve the clarification, amplifica tions and additions needed by the Community's agricul tural industry. In my view, failure to achieve these adjustments would justify jettisoning Blair House altogether. Consequently it would be inconsistent with that belief to vote for a resolution containing the paragraph stating that the Par liament adheres, in principle, to the Blair House com promise. DINGUIRARD (V). - (FR) Madam President, the liberal world lives on the myth of the invisible hand of Adam Smith when it would be more accurate to speak of the dirty hands of GATT. We might have expected more consistency, even more dignity, from our Parliament. Let us take a single exam ple: paragraph 10 which urges the negotiators to conclude later fresh multilateral agreements on minimum stan dards for labour conditions and protection of the environ ment. Why, in your opinion, ladies and gentlemen, must we hurry to conclude by the end of 1993 if not precisely so as to avoid starting negotiations on the social and environmental clauses? That was the Greens' proposal. At the moment our responsibility is complete. It will not be the Commission but we, the elected representatives, who will have to answer to history for commitments entered into today in the name of Europe. I shall not answer for a text which, whilst it is part of the reality of GATT, very skilfully exonerates itself vis-\u00e0-vis its elec torate. That is like corrective ecology: first I pollute and then I promise to remove the pollution. So I ask all my fellow-Members to show a minimum of intellectual honesty and to reject such a compromise. SPENCER (PPE). - Madam President, it is very reveal ing that the original text of this resolution, until amended by Amendment 2, made no reference to the Multilateral Trade Organization. I would draw French colleagues' attention in particular to the importance of the Multilater al Trade Organization because that is what will police the new system. That is what will inhibit the American unilateralism that they purport to oppose. So the MTO has to be in there. It is now in there and I shall therefore support this resolution. In addition, that amendment draws attention to the need to use the MTO in order to start the debate on trade and environment and not to be deluded into delaying it for a further ten years for some entirely fictional green round. So I support this resolution. Madam President, on a separate matter concerning this splendid Chamber. I wonder if you would like to ask our technicians to enquire what quality of the French lan guage it is which renders it less usable in this Chamber when everyone else seems to find the acoustics perfectly reasonable. GRAEFE ZU BARINGDORF (V). - (DE) Madam Presi dent, I shall be voting against the resolution as it represents a classic attempt to extend the European Community's quantitative approach to economic issues via so-called free trade to the furthest corners of the earth, enabling the Community to then extract from the ravaged structures in those countries anything valuable remaining for what we call the European way. And once, as a result of this free trade, we have destroyed their social and environmental fabric, we will start discussing how that destruction is to be remedied! That is inconsistent econ omic logic, and the Greens have sought in their resolution to do what is now needed: to apply and make clear, as an integral part of economic policy, social and environmen tal criteria. The Green Group in the European Parliament is therefore very realistic in its assessment of the situation. We have already stated this frequently before the House. Those who believe that they must pursue further this quantita tive approach to economics have lost touch with reality; we are the only realists - including in economic matters! FREMION (V). - (FR) Madam President, whereas a majority in this Parliament had reservations about the cultural exception in July, the House has just come down unanimously in favour of it. No doubt that is due to the presence in our h\u00e9micycle of numerous producers, actors and actresses whose message has reached us. From now on our negotiators are bound: either get this exception from the Americans or be disowned by all European opinion. For that reason I should like to see performers in the House more frequently. They are good counsellors. Perhaps their presence would slightly enliven this sinister place, designed more for cameras than for parliamentary work, distant, cold and impractical. Either the next part-session must be in proper conditions or it must be held in Strasbourg. To tell the truth a few clowns in our ",
        "No 3-435/50 Debates of the European Parliament 30. 9. 93 FREMION corridors would impart a little soul to this building, which seems to me as badly designed as GATT. DURY (PSE). - (FR) Madame President, I regret that in our resolution we have simply taken note of the cultural exception and that we are not supporting the idea that culture is not an item of merchandise like any other and that it must not come under the rule of the strongest, that is, the free-trade rule. There again, we want a political Europe, a Europe which takes into account the socio-ecological aspects of econ omic development. That requirement is not sufficiently expressed in our resolution. What is demanded for Europe must be demanded at world level too. Like other people, I should hope that what is decided at GATT level does not give farmers the impression that they must make sacrifices twice over: once for the reform of the common agricultural policy and a second time in order to bow down before GATT. Nevertheless, I should like to say that I shall abstain on this resolution because it contains minimum guidelines which we call upon the Commission to follow. The Commission has the negotiating mandate. At the plenary sitting the Commissioner present arrogantly stated that he did not wish to renegotiate anything. The Commission must realize that there are elected political authorities in our countries, namely our governments and that those who interrogate it are the representatives of the citizens of whom perhaps it ought also to take account from time to time. CANAVARRO (ARC), in writing. - (PT) I think that the majority of my colleagues will agree with me in the explanation of the vote, after witnessing yesterday the enthusiasm with which the issue of culture was tackled, both by the Members and in the closing words of Sir Leon Brittan. Such attitudes encourage me to support this proposal for a joint resolution, confident in the fact that the Community will be able to secure a special place for culture within the GATT agreements. For this can only be developed within the progress of Member States' cul tures, the preservation of lesser used languages, and in artistic and literary creation, which naturally includes the audiovisual sector. For this reason, it is essential that the specific characteristic of the audiovisual industries be expressly recognized as a central component in the GATT agreement. It is also crucial that the quota system existing in the 'Television Without Borders' directive is supported and that the most favoured nation clause is repealed so that European viewers will no longer see just their own culture reflected on their screens, but also the cultures of their closest Community neighbours. This implies, of course, that the MEDIA and EUROIMAGEM pro grammes and the cooperation agreements can continue to develop, without hindering opportunities for co-produc tion on both sides of the Atlantic. In this perspective and confident in the fact that success will be possible, I will vote in favour of the proposal for a joint resolution. CAUDRON (PSE), in writing. - (FR) On the occasion of this debate I should like to express my profound dissatis faction with Sir Leon Brittan's statements, which contrast with the optimism shown by the French Government. As regards the Blair House preliminary agreement, one feels that very little has been demanded by the European negotiator and that nothing has been obtained from the American negotiator apart from another meeting. So I am very anxious about European agriculture. As regards European culture, the Commission's state ments are not clear. Is it asking for the cultural exception or not? As regards the rest of the negotiations, one feels there is a great hurry which can only be damaging to European interests. I mentioned yesterday my perplexity at the skeletal agenda for this first Brussels part-session, to say nothing more. After this debate I am even more perplexed and deeply worried. Europe is in disarray and we are not far away from a situation of every-man-for-himself. Liberalism is showing, for those who still have doubts, its lack of adaptability, even that it is dangerous at a time of crisis. How many more million unemployed will it take for Europeans to recognize that? CUSHNAHAN (PPE), in writing. - I cannot support this joint resolution because it expresses continued support 'in principle' for the Blair House Agreement. I wish to see a successful conclusion to the GATT Uruguay Round as it would provide a new impetus for the overall world economic situation. However, I do not believe in achieving an agreement at any price. It has to be a balanced agreement and certainly not one which uses agriculture as the sacrificial lamb. The reform of the Common Agricultural Policy created significant hardship for Community farmers, particularly in my own country. The Blair House Agreement asks them to make even more sacrifices. It is time to say 'enough is enough' and I would hope that my own government would be prepared to exercise its national veto if it fails to secure modifica tions to the Blair House Agreement. DILLEN (DR), in writing. - (NL) If simple sound reason is ever to be victorious in European public life, in European politics, in the European institutions - a mira cle is not impossible - then the words 'Blair House' will undoubtedly be a quarter synonym or a half synonym or a complete synonym for blanket of fog or optical illusion or - something worse - self-deception or just plain decep tion. All lawyers will heartily agree about that, at least all lawyers for whom the law must not be misused for political aims, at least all those for whom twice two are still four, all those for whom truth is still truth. They will all recognize and state that the so-called Blair House agreement is simply not a legally valid agreement as the customs of the international law of treaties require. Professional conjurers pale into insignificance alongside the Eurocrats' tricks presenting a soap bubble as a precious stone. And yet Blair House does represent something. It exposes the doormat condition of the European negotiatora. It exposes their subjection, their self-subjection, to non-European interests. It also exposes the indifference, the cool indifference of the Eurocrats to the actual European human being, here in particular the European farmer, the European peasant ",
        "30. 9. 93 Debates of the European Parliament No 3-435/51 DILLEN who does not want to go under, does not want to be done for, because he not only has an irreplaceable economic function for Europe but also and above all because he embodies an irreplaceable human value. That alone ought to have been enough for the European negotiators to dig their heels in with the greatest obstina cy and to reject without hesitation non-European demands which are unacceptable for Europe, especially American demands. The European negotiators had just one task, one mission, one mandate: that task, that mission and that mandate were the defence of Europe's interests, the defence of the justified aspirations of Europe's farmers. Unfortunately none of that has been arranged. The European negotiators leave the European farmers out in the cold, and not only the farmers. The European negotiators have not acted as the advocates of their people and of the European Community. The European negotiators, infected with world-ambitions, have de serted and are deserting from the colours. They have left and are leaving their people, leaving Europe in the lurch. No wonder then that they were not only shown the cold shoulder by America but were sent away without ceremo ny with a flea in their ears, this time with an American 'njet'. What is the great lesson from all this? We cannot expect anything good from the Europe of Maastricht, from the Commission's Eurocrats. We do not want to hear of a weak Europe, becoming weaker and weaker, with a bargain-sale of its material interests, of the national values of its peoples, of the spiritual and ethical values which once constituted the Occident. Welfare and well-being for Europe and its peoples, a new greatness for the Occident, can only be acquired from a united Europe, that is, a Europe strong in the unison of its strong, free peoples. RAFFARIN (LDR), in writing. - (FR) I shall vote against the joint resolution proposed to Parliament on the GATT negotiations. I also intend to oppose the obscure steps being taken by the Brussels Commission. Parliament is entitled to the truth. What is truth for Sir Leon Brittan when he told us yesterday that the Council meeting of 15 December did not ask for renegotiation of the Blair House preliminary agreement, contrary to what he had indicated himself previously on French television? What is the truth about this 'preliminary agreement' of which the European Parliament has not yet even got a written copy? What is truth about the Council in its strategy with the United States? The GATT negotiations present the whole world with a caricature of European democracy. The European Parlia ment cannot be an accomplice to that. (Parliament adopted the resolution) Report (Doc. A3-0249/93), by Mrs Simons,on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on development cooperation policy in the run-up to 2000 Explanations of vote ERNST DE LA GRAETE (V). - (FR) Madam President, I wanted to say that I regard Mrs Simons's report as a good one, for two specific reasons. The first is that it shows well to what extent the Commission communication is essentially intended to clear the way for restricting aid given by the European Community to the countries of the south. It also shows the need for our Parliament to give its views very clearly on the fact that Community policy must be a pilot policy as regards development cooper ation, because it is freer from colonial ties than the Member States as far as the countries of the third world are concerned. I shall therefore vote for Mrs Simons's report. ALVAREZ DE PAZ (PSE), in writing. - (ES) It is certain that the new international situation emerging out of the dismemberment of Eastern Europe has aggravated the situation in the Third World, and weakened the political influence of the developing countries. The differences are becoming greater every day, and the most illustrative example can be found in Africa - the cradle of humanity - where the debt, worsening trade relations, and population growth that exceeds resources are leading to hunger and mass death, while social misery increases dramatically. New relations are necessary on the basis of equality, and it is certainly not neoliberal politics that is going to re-establish upset balances, including the ecological bal ance of the planet and the creation of efficient and participatory cooperation models. I invite the Commis sion to continue its efforts to encourage all sectoral policies by the Community aimed at genuine develop ment policy. ARBELOA MURU (PSE), in writing. - (ES) If viewed from the outside or skimmed through, the report by my colleague, Mrs Simons, might appear to be bitterly critical towards the European Commission. That would be too easy a judgement, apart from being only partially correct. The report concentrates valiantly on explaining the rea sons for the agonizing - and sometimes dying - situa tions of the underdeveloped countries, which we here call the 'developing countries'. It then analyzes the causes of underdevelopment and here it criticizes quite reasonably the analysis made by the Commission in its 1992 docu ment (15 May), where macroeconomic considerations prevailed and many external factors in underdevelop ment were overlooked. The author attempts to assert the specificity of the EC's development policy and its importance in the world as a whole - namely in point 21 - although it is ultimately subordinated to the criteria of the Bretton Woods institu tions. Here, with her vast experience on the Committee and a rich Community background underlying her reflec tions on development, she plunders the Commission document, not to undo it, but to complement it and bring it more into line with the desire expressed in the docu ment to 'create a unique conception of world develop- ",

The most powerful theoretical proposal is the projection of this mechanism, which makes it possible to analyze - in principle and automatically - in future the conse quences for development policy of any political decisions taken by the Community. The inclusion of this policy in foreign policy cannot be identified with the subordination to the its objectives, something which would be a step backwards. The foundations of authentic development cooperation must be rooted in global interdependence and world solidarity. My vote is my agreement, my commitment and also my hope. DEPREZ (PPE), in writing. - (FR) The economic and social order governing present world relations is still based on the principles and institutions set up immediate ly after the second world war. The opening up of the world market as a result of the fall of the Berlin wall and the crumbling of the Soviet empire for the countries which were part of it, the advent of new economic powers on the international stage and the resultant challenges even in our own pattern of society have made it essential to make an in-depth re-examina tion of world trade mechanisms and the way in which the institutions and responsible bodies are composed and operate. Fresh challenges need fresh responses. We must have the courage to face them and to respond in line with the ideals we support, before others convince our peoples that there are no solutions other than those based on intolerance, racism and xenophobia. We European Members of Parliament must have the courage to explain that there are no democratic solutions other than those based on tolerance, partnership, interde pendence and shared development. We must therefore call for an in-depth re-examination of mechanisms and institutions which today are manifestly ill- suited to the new realities. I am thinking first of all and in particular of the need for a gradual elimination of tariff and non-tariff barriers which hinder exports to the European Community from the medium- and low-income countries and thus put a brake on their development. Next we must strive to ensure that the European strategy in the matter of indebtedness aims at encouraging repay ment of the debt in local currency and its allocation on the spot to priority areas such as health, education, commu nications, the environment and the like. Finally we must without delay exert pressure on the Council and the Commission for the preparation of a real plan of action aimed at defining and constructing a new world economic and social order, more fair and more balanced. That would be based, inter alia, on the estab lishment of a world trade organization placed under the high authority of the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations, renewed and democratized, whose duties would be to regulate world economic, commercial and financial exchanges and which would have available the means to ensure that all parties observe the rules jointly laid down. HERMANS (PPE), in writing. - (NL) 'Horizon 2000' was a discussion document in which the Commission traced out a number of broad lines of development policy. Today's developments in the world, but also the new requirements of the Treaty of Maastricht make it necess ary and possible to redefine European development policy. I congratulate Mrs Simons on including in such a succinct report a reflection of many discussions in the Committee on Development and I also welcome the fact that 'Horizon 2000' has become a concept in many organizations and aid societies. There was not always praise there, but criticism may also be constructive. We hope that the Commission will take account of the emphases expressed in this report. They interpret also to a great extent the concern of many in Europe who know that Europe must not remain a closed fortress and do not wish that it should, but that Europe must continue to play a r\u00f4le in the south too - a r\u00f4le of help and cooperation in the world! I should like to stress three points. They want the development policy of the Community and that of the Member States to be better coordinated. The Treaty of Maastricht provides new opportunities for this. The Council has already drawn up a timetable to convert this aim of coordination into more operational objectives. In it the fight against poverty was rightly brought forward as a priority area of policy, since combating poverty ought indeed to remain the principal aim of European develop ment policy: improvement of living conditions, giving the population of the third world the means to help themselves, supporting longer-term programmes which make it possible to build up institutional capacity. Above all the causes of poverty must be tackled, otherwise much Community aid will go to emergency aid programmes, as is now all too often the case. In the second place I should like to lay stress on the consistency of European policy. All too often we see a number of contradictions throughout European policy. We adopt measures which are pernicious for the develop ment of the south: by subsidized export of European agricultural products to the third world we upset the local markets; by retaining tied assistance we withhold from the developing countries an average of 15% of financial resources; by protectionist trade measures we give third world countries no fair chances on our European market. In that light Community councils of Ministers for Agri culture for example and for Development Cooperation might certainly be a help. Finally I should like to emphasize the importance of help and support for the development of democracies in the south. We have recently supported elections in several countries - rightly, but building up a democratic society is more than setting up a multi-party system and helping to establish a parliament. Democracy begins with training and instruction of people (men and women), with the construction of cooperative ",
        "30. 9. 93 Debates of the European Parliament No 3-435/53 HERMANS structures, trade unions, cooperatives, a free press, with the development of a culture in which there are chances for self-development and free initiatives. Only then will people in the countries of the south attain their dignity and self-respect, only then will those countries become worthy partners for consultation in international rela tions. Europe can play a unique r\u00f4le in this construction of democracy, not only of a political but of a socio economic democracy. (Parliament adopted the resolution) 8.
