        "Avian Flu Situation Reports EUROPEAN COMMISSION DIRECTORATE GENERAL JRC JOINT RESEARCH CENTRE Institute for the Protection and Security of the Citizen Support to External Security Avian Flu Situation Reports 2006 This report collects together information about Avian Flu outbreaks from 1997 to the time of writing, and includes a short review of the 1919 influenza pandemic. IPSC has provided Commission Services, Council SitCen, ECDC and FAO with a daily situation report on the spread of Avian Flu from January to April 2006. This covered the critical period when the disease spread to Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The situation reports were written based on media reports automatically filtered by the JRC\u2019s Europe Media Monitor. These reports were backed up by rapid mapping and geocoding services of IPSC and the MediSys automated intelligence gathering. In August 2005 JRC were asked to prepare a briefing note on Avian Flu. This earlier report exploited EMM\u2019s long term archive of News and covers the period from first detection in 1997 until August 2005. It has now been extended to cover the period until the daily reports begin. An update to this report covers the period from August to the outbreaks in Turkey. The seriousness of the situation in Turkey triggered the daily reports. All these reports are included in this overview document. At the time of writing a weekly report is being produced as there is a noticeable downturn in reported cases. Flu veracity normally falls in summer. This work also led to a study of available literature study concerning the 1918 influenza pandemic, whose devastating effects underlies current concern about the spread of H5N1 Avian Flu.

        "Avian Flu Situation Reports Introduction The use of media monitoring to alert health authorities to emerging communicable diseases and other health threats has been applied in two systems. The first is the Global Public Health Information Network (GPHIN) developed by Canada Health and more recently the MedISys developed by JRC for DG SANCO. MedISys is based on the Europe Media Monitor (EMM) which detects news articles published across nearly 1000 selected Web based news sites and also News Agency reports. There was a growing concern about the threat of Avian flu in 2005 following the spread outside of Asia to Russia. This was particularly of concern to Europe as migratory birds were proposed as a possible vector for the spread of the disease through known flypaths between Siberia and Europe. In August JRC was asked to produce a briefing paper on Avian Flu for DG RTD based on information gathered by EMM. This briefing note forms the first section of this report which covers the period between first emergence of the Virus in China sometime before 1997. The next section is a brief overview of the main developments which occurred between August 2005 and the start of the daily reports in early January 2006. First reports of poultry outbreaks in Turkey occurred in October 2005 and seemed to be under control when in January the first deaths from H5N1 in children from the east of Turkey came as a shock and reminder of the threat. JRC began a daily update on January 11 th and continued this until April 12 th by which time the disease had spread to wild birds across Europe. H5N1 is a pandemic for water fowl, poultry and scavenger birds, but can infect mammals and humans exposed to high concentrations of the virus either through ingestion or respiration. There is hardly any evidence that it is infectious between people. In 1918 a virus of avian origin did become highly infectious between humans and provoked one of the worst pandemics in human history. A review of the research literature into what happened in 1918 was carried out and a short summary of this study is included here. Finally, media coverage of events reflects public concern about a given issue. EMM keeps statistics on the number of articles published per hour which reflects the relative importance paid to events by Europe\u2019s press. The last section shows how the media reported the various developments of avian flu effecting individual countries Information Source: EMM news monitoring 4 ",
        "Avian Flu Situation Reports Avian Flu Briefing Note 28/8/2005 1. Pre 2003 A virulent avian flu virus H5N1 has been simmering for about a decade in Southeast Asia. It may have originated in the intense poultry farming regions of China, and first came to public attention in 1997, when the avian virus made the unusual jump to humans. Six persons died in Hong Kong, and the province\u2019s entire chicken population was culled. Further preventative measures were taken in Hong Kong in 2001 and 2002 after more infected birds were discovered. No further human cases occurred until February 2003 when a Hong Kong man died after contracting H5N1 after visiting relatives in China\u2019s Fujian province, who kept chickens. China has an active vaccination programme which may have suppressed infections but has not fully eliminated the disease. 2. Dutch Outbreak 2003 In March 2003, a seemingly unrelated outbreak of H7N7 avian flu started at 3 turkey farms in Dinteloord, near Roosendaal, Holland. This rapidly spread to nearby poultry farms and resulted in a 70% mortality rate among chickens. A Dutch vet became the first human victim of H7N7 and many farm workers caught conjunctivitis eye infections from the virus. The outbreak reached North-Rhine Westphalia by May before being eliminated through mass culling of chickens. 3. Further Outbreaks outside Asia 2004 H7 outbreaks occurred in Texas, USA and in British Columbia Canada during February to May 2004, leading to an EU ban on imports of poultry. This ban was lifted some months later, after the infection was eliminated. An H5N2 (milder form of H5N1) outbreak occurred in Ostrich farms in South Africa in August 2004 resulting in the culling of 15,000 Ostriches. 4. Major Asian Outbreak 2004 Korea was the first country reporting a severe outbreak in December 2003, which was quickly followed by reports of the first human deaths from Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia and Indonesia. The outbreak seemed to be under control by March 2004, but a second wave of infections was announced in China and Vietnam in June. In total 108 people had been infected in Southeast Asia from December 2003 until August 2005, lethal to half of them. All these infections were directly from birds, either through handling sick birds or by eating uncooked infected birds. Pigs have also been infected both in Asia and in the Dutch outbreak. There is no evidence to date that the bird flu virus can be transmitted readily among humans, but epidemiologists fear that it could mutate into one that does. 5. Spread of Avian Flu The most likely spread of Avian Flu from one area to another is the trade in domestic chickens and ducks. EU control measures are to ban imports from infected areas where possible. In Asia, however, agreements on vaccination programmes for transported birds are common. This is controversial as the disease may still be present in vaccinated birds. Most Information Source: EMM news monitoring 5 ",
        "Avian Flu Situation Reports concern is now being expressed over the possibility of infections being carried over long distances by migratory birds, or through illegal smuggling of birds. 6. Bird Migration . In March and December 2004 both Japan and Taiwan reported infections carried into their Islands by migratory birds from Korea and China. These are the only two reports found during 2004. However, the Chinese announced in March 2005 that 178 bar-headed geese had been found with the H5N1 virus in a nature reserve in Qinghai province. Qinghai (pronounced ching-high) Lake is the largest saltwater lake in China. It is located some 9,000 feet above sea level and serves in particular as a summer haven for numerous wild birds that eventually head south, over the Himalayas, to India and Burma for the winter. \"There is a danger that (H5N1) might be carried along the birds' winter migration routes to densely populated areas in the south Asia subcontinent, a region that seems free of this virus, and spread along migratory flyways linked to Europe,'' wrote University of Hong Kong researcher Yi Guan and colleagues from China and the United States in the British science journal Nature. Another paper by Chinese scientists in Science speculates that the virus emerged from a mixture of strains in birds over-wintering in S.E. Asia. Then in early August Mongolia issued an emergency report following the death of 89 migratory birds at two lakes in the northern part of the country. At the same time an outbreak of H5N1 was detected in Tibet, China. Reports on large poultry outbreaks OF H5N1 in Siberia and Kazachstan began in late July. The outbreaks have been attributed to contact between domestic birds and wild waterfowl at shared water sources. However, some ornithologists dispute migratory birds from Lake Qinghai as the cause, since during the breeding season the ducks are flightless and then migrate south for the winter. They suspect human transport of infected birds as a more likely mechanism for the outbreak. 7. Risks to Europe There are two pathways whereby the virus could enter Europe. Firstly human transport of infected birds, and secondly by sick migratory birds infecting poultry. In October 2004 a Thai man smuggled two eagles into Brussels airport both infected with H5N1. The emergence in late 2003 and 2004 of 3 outbreaks of avian flu in Holland, N. America and South Africa, suggests transport a more likely mechanism than bird migration. The birds infected in Lake Qinghai will migrate south for the winter, this is more of a threat to South Asia and India than Europe. Dr. Carol Cardona, a US expert on avian influenza, thinks \u201cThe situation could be dire if the virus figures out how to go from migratory bird to migratory bird, and those birds survive.\u201d Some birds in Siberia do migrate from east to west for the winter, unlike the so far mainly infected waterfowl. But Cardona still remains skeptical that the flu virus had been carried long distances by migrating birds. \"This virus has been around for nearly a decade, and human movement of domesticated birds usually Information Source: EMM news monitoring 6 ",

        "Avian Flu Situation Reports 1918 Flu Pandemic The Spanish influenza pandemic of 1918-19 infected about one third of the world\u2019s human population (500 million people) killing perhaps 50 million people. It caused the worst ever death toll by an infectious disease in recorded human history, exceeding the \u201cBlack Death\u201d plagues of the middle ages. The main wave of infection occurred over just a 10 week period from October to early December and caused 80 % of fatalities. All influenza A pandemics since that time (except human infection from avian viruses like H5N1) have been caused by descendants of the 1918 virus. Much information at the time was subsumed by the first world war effort, but actually the pandemic killed far more people than did the hostilities. More US soldiers died from the flu than died in battle. The flu was particularly cruel because, unlike all other pandemics before or since it hit mostly young healthy persons rather than the elderly or the very young. This age profile made the disease even more deadly and was reflected in a long term dip in age distribution of populations . In many badly affected areas schools were closed, public activities suspended, and people wore face masks in an attempt to control the spread. Spain was particularly badly hit, and because there were no war restrictions the first reports came from \u201cAgencia Fabra\u201d about a mystery deadly infection. This explains why the pandemic got the name Spanish influenza, although the Spanish themselves called it Naples or French Flu. Troop encampments along the war front were badly hit and the failure of the German offensive in 1918, perhaps eventually leading to their defeat has been blamed on the large numbers of soldiers incapacitated with the Flu. President Woodrow Wilson caught the flu just before the Yalta negotiations and some people argue his illness consequently clouded judgment in agreeing to the harsh war reparation terms proposed by the French. This then became one of the precursors to the second world war. The Pandemic was unique prior or since as it swept the world in three Information Source: EMM news monitoring 11 ",
        "Avian Flu Situation Reports waves separated by a few months. The first wave occurred in the spring and early summer, before the main wave in the autumn. A third wave occurred in early 1919 before essentially disappearing, but exact timings depended on location. Mass troop movements at the end of the First World War helped the spread around the world and every continent was consequently affected. 1918 Pandemic Overview: In 1998 the virus was reconstructed using lung tissue from soldiers preserved at the time or exhumed from permafrost in Alaska. Analysis showed that the Virus was H1N1 derived from an avian source. However, there was no precursor outbreak of avian flu in birds prior to the human outbreak. The pandemic came in three distinct waves. The first wave in the spring seems to have originated in Kansas US and spread via US army camps to France and then spread to civilian populations by July. The first wave was relatively mild, but somewhere in the late summer, perhaps in the overcrowded troop encampments in France the virus mutated and became much more deadly. A second wave appeared almost simultaneously across the world, being reintroduced back into the USA via Boston and New York, killing up to 50 million people worldwide from October to December. The H1N1 virus responsible was an avian-like virus, which was new to the human population. However all influenza pandemics since then have been caused by descendants of it and direct descendants still circulate in the pig population. Weekly influenza mortality, UK (1918-1919) Where did it start? There have been 3 proposals over the years. 1) China where outbreaks of flu and pulmonary disease early in 1918 were reported, but there is no evidence they spread further and may have been misdiagnosed with pneumonic plague. Earlier pandemics and those since can be traced to origins in Asia, but 1918 was different. 2) An outbreak of purulent bronchitis in 1916/17 at UK troop encampments at Etaples in France proposed by J.S. Oxford (see report: 14/03). However, there is no direct evidence it spread beyond the camp at the time. 3) Haskell County, Kansas a small farming community of 1,720 persons in US. In late January an influenza outbreak started hitting the young and healthy and people started dying. The outbreak in Haskell stopped abruptly in late March but by then young men had probably passed the infection to the local army base at Funston. By March 24, 1100 men were hospitalised and thousands more sick. Other bases in US reported outbreaks, and mortality rates increased in 30 major cities by April \u2013 the first wave. By then this first outbreak had moved to France and the millions of soldiers based there peaking and then fading. Information Source: EMM news monitoring 12 ",
        "Avian Flu Situation Reports The second deadly wave seems to have originated in France in late summer. It consequently returned to the US through ports (Boston and New York) and through the rail network. Simultaneously, it exploded all around the world due to regular troop movements especially to the then British Empire. India was particularly badly affected with many millions dying. The three pandemic waves in one year remain unprecedented and still leaves many questions unanswered. Sources: Barry & Taubenberger How did it start ? Wild waterfowl which were collected by the Smithsonian Museum and preserved in Formaldehyde between 1916 and 1918 have been recently been studied (see: Journal of Virology, August 2002, p. 7860-7862). A bird from 1917 was found to be infected with a virus of the same haemagglutinin (ie. the \u201cH\u201d in H1 or H5) subtype as that of the 1918 pandemic virus. However researchers found that it was closer to the modern avian flu viruses than it was to the 1918 strain. This implies little drift (natural mutation) in avian sequences over the past 85 years and that the 1918 pandemic virus therefore did not acquire its HA directly from a bird. But the farming community in Kansas (assuming it was the original source), raised many pigs, and pigs can be infected by both bird and human flu at the same time. Some experts believe that genetically stable flu viruses reside harmlessly in birds, but that occasionally one of these bird viruses consequently can infects pigs. The swine immune system attacks the virus, forcing it to evolve genetically to survive. If it then spreads to humans, the result could be devastating. Pigs can also be infected by both human and bird viruses simultaneously and it has also been proposed that a process called Viral Shift (interchange of one of the 8 RNA segments) between two separate viruses in a single cell could be the trigger. The host for this process could also be a person instead of a pig. Although much of this is still just speculation it does imply that birds are not the only threat. Two interesting facts are that a) only during the second (and not the first) wave did pigs become sick, and b) people infected in the first spring wave were reportedly immune to the second. How Flu infects people It is thought that the natural host for the influenza virus is water birds. Roughly 6% of water fowl carry an influenza virus. Influenza is a zoonotic virus meaning that it can be transmitted from animal to human. The virus is spherical and contains 8 genetic RNA segments. These segments are translated into viral proteins by the host cell machinery. In some sense viruses are not really alive at all but are a disruptive free rider on living organisisms. The flu virus has a lipid membrane envelope containing two proteins - haemagluttinen (HA) and Nuramidase (N). These have been classified into 16 types for H and 9 types for N. Thus H1N1 represents one combination and H5N1 another. Detailed genetics and geometry A Flu virus is 50-120 nm in diameter Information Source: EMM news monitoring 13 ",
        "Avian Flu Situation Reports determining the fine details are determined by the 8 RNA segments. In humans it is the H proteins that attach to receptor proteins in living cells. Upon binding of the H protein to the cell surface the virus is internalised and RNA is released into the cell nucleus causing reproduction of new viral RNA. The figure below illustrates this process. Viruses need water coated cells which can be the respiratory system, blood or reproductive system to enter the body. Human contagious flu is always spread through water particles and deposits emitted by breath or through mouth contact with infected surfaces. Pandemics occur when a new viral strain adapts to human transmission and is new to the immune system. Eventually, however enough people build defensive antibodies to the virus that it either dies out or dilutes to a less virulent form. This is what happened in 1918 , although why the three waves occurred is still a mystery and could imply three different viral strains emerging each eventually being defeated by the \u201ccollective\u201d immune system. There are two ways that viruses evolve. The first way is called Viral drift. This is the process whereby when a virus is reproduced in a host cell the exact copying of the genetic code is prone to mistakes. This induces natural mutations which eventually can lead to modifications in the way the virus attaches itself and infects cells. This process is underway also with H5N1 as evidenced by the slightly different strains emerging from tests over the last couple of years. However such a process is unlikely to result in a dangerous mutation unleashing a sudden pandemic as happened in 1918. The second mechanism is called viral shift (or Information Source: EMM news monitoring 14 ",
        "Avian Flu Situation Reports recombination). This is thought to occur when two different viruses infect the same cell simultaneously and each release the 8 RNA segment together. Then on reproduction by the cell loose segments are swapped between the two viruses, resulting in a genetically new virus. There are 256 ways that a virus could swap a single segment with another flu virus. If this exchange of RNA segments result in an HA section which can more easily attach to the human respiratory system and the virus is new to the human population then a potentially lethal pandemic could ensue. The host animal for such a viral shift could be a person or an animal such as a pig which can be infected both by avian and human flu viruses. The 1918 virus is an H1N1 type derived from an avian virus which either passed directly from bird to man or via pigs infected by both viruses simultaneously. Perhaps the first wave was transferred to man through pigs and this later mutated in the troop encampments with close contact with poultry. This is pure speculation, but if virus samples could be recovered from the first wave scientists would be able to study this is more detail. The H1N1 viral samples so far recovered are from the second deadly wave. Could it happen again? Clearly a new deadly flu virus easily transmitted among humans could emerge again, but its effect is likely to be less than in 1918. There is a much better understanding of viral infections and the importance of quarantine, and surveillance is much better. The situation is 1918 was special. There was a war going on with rapid flows of men between the front and their homelands, some in far reaching countries of the British Empire. There was also censorship of the news which avoided reporting the looming flu crises in the interests of maintaining national morale for the war effort. The situation in the encampments in France with high density living of young soldiers is not so different from high density poultry farms today. Disease spread rapidly among the troops and there had also been severe outbreaks of mumps and measles earlier. Little attempt was made to impose quarantines or restrictions on movement of people, especially since the war was also ending and celebrations were encouraged. Armistice day was November 17 th where in some countries the flu pandemic was at its peak. In Australia quarantining was actually imposed and this succeeded in limiting the outbreak rather well. Thus if such a pandemic were to appear in the coming years it is possible that even despite modern air travel that: 1) It could be initially contained to a single geographic zone 2) Quarantine measures could restrict rapid spread around the world 3) The use of anti viral drugs could delay spread and reduce mortality rates 4) Enough time could be gained for the development of a vaccine against the new viral form. However world population has more than doubled since 1918, and if measures to limit the spread failed many 10s of millions could be killed by a virus of the same pathogenicity as 1918. References 1.

Turkey: WHO officials are shocked that so many children have been infected in Turkey in such a short time period. Nearly all 15 cases are amongst teenagers and children reported in just one week. That\u2019s nearly as many as in Thailand since 2003 (23 cases). Over 100 people are hospitalised in Turkey with suspicious symptoms awaiting diagnosis. There is widespread criticism of the initial response of the Turkish government to the crisis. Meanwhile efforts to control the outbreak continue, and over 300,000 birds have now been culled in Turkey. Sources point to more suspected cases of bird flu in Izmir and Kusadasi, on the coast facing Greece. Strict checks are taking place at all Turkish entry points to Greece. Study: Bird flu may effect far more people than official statistics suggest, according to a Swedish study published last night. Anna Thorson and colleagues at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm surveyed 45,000 people in Bavi province of north west Vietnam. They conclude that between 650 and 750 persons suffered mild flu-like symptoms through contact with sick or dead birds. Information Source: EMM news monitoring 17 ",

SES Unit, IPSC, Joint Research Centre Positive Avian Flu cases in Wild Birds Turkey: WHO says the situation is improving and expects fewer human cases. 3 young boys are healthy enough to leave hospital. 1.1 million poultry have now been culled, and warnings to avoid contact with sick birds are being heeded. The map shown above is taken from the OIE report and shows confirmed Avian Flu cases in wild birds. It would appear to be unlikely such cases are restricted to just Turkey. London: A paper in the Lancet warns against complacency through over-reliance on Tamiflu and Relenza in the case of a human pandemic. By reducing symptoms, Tamiflu may even cause an increase in the spread, whereas measures of simple hygiene and isolation are more effective. Furthermore, these drugs have not reduced mortality among the few flu victims who have taken them so far. Hong Kong: A dead wild bird tests positive for bird flu. Tests on Poultry so far negative. Iraq : The WHO announced that the 15 year old girl who died near the Turkish border did not have Avian Flu. Iran : The veterinary and public health services are on a state of alert in the border area with Turkey. Last week 30,000 poultry were culled in villages within 10 km of the border.

SES Unit, IPSC, Joint Research Centre WHO \u2013 Pandemic Risk Assessment shows current value = 3 Turkey: Two brothers, Muharrem, five and Iskender, two, were discharged from Ankara hospital, while a third child is improving. Their parents took the children to hospital early after playing with infected gloves. The mortality rate appears to be lower in Turkey than in Asia: 4 deaths, 8 recoveries and 9 still being treated. This has encouraged authorities to suggest that the virus is mutating into a less lethal form. However, the relative number of declared human cases to poultry outbreaks appears higher. Tests on a woman returning to France after a two week visit have proved negative. A poultry outbreak is confirmed in Chorlu, Tekirdag province in the European part of Turkey. London: Mutations found in the Turkish cases are similar to those seen in Russia (August) and at Lake Qinghai, China (March). Lake Xingao is a major breeding site for wild ducks. This strongly supports the theory of wild bird migration seeding infection in backyard Poultry farms. Meanwhile, Prof. Potter (Univ. Sheffield) warns at a recent flu conference, that the H5N1 scare may be diverting attention from the H2 strain, responsible for previous pandemics. Indonesia: The deaths of the 4 year old boy and his 13-year-old sister reported last week have been confirmed as due to Avian Flu after tests in Hong Kong. Their father is being treated in hospital. Doctors announced Saturday that they are treating a new suspected case in the same province of West Java. Indonesia now has 14 confirmed deaths.

She is the 10 th declared case in China with 6 deaths. Cyprus: Reports for some days of bird deaths in the North of Cyprus. Tests are being carried out on two dead birds at a farm said Turkish Cypriot authorities. A large group of dead and sick birds were dumped at a rubbish heap in Dali, but no traces of bird flu have yet been confirmed. A team of EU experts will now visit the area, in addition to Turkey, in the coming days confirmed Commissioner Kyprianou. Turkey: A spokesman for the Ministry of Agriculture expressed optimism after no new cases have been found for several days. The last confirmed human case was 17 th January. WHO attributes this positive development to mass culling of fowl and an information campaign. Thailand: The government introduces new food safety regulations which will force the closure of thousands of substandard poultry slaughterhouses. Avian Flu first hit Thailand in January 2004, claiming 14 lives and 60 million poultry were culled. The country seems free of the disease at present. Bird Migration Debate: The RSPB (Royal Society for Protection of Birds) disputes wild bird migration being the primary blame for the spread of Avian Flu. The trade in wild birds and poultry products, such as chicken manure used to fertilize fish farms, is a much more likely vector, they claim. However, WHO confirm the virus found in Turkey is virtually identical to those found at Lake Qinghai, China (as reported yesterday). The Romanian outbreak was first detected in the remote Danube delta, one of Europe\u2019s largest wetlands, lying on a major migratory route for wild birds. Juan Lubroth from FAO thinks that although wild birds may introduce the virus, it is the poultry trade that spreads the virus. It is also possible that wild birds are infected by poultry when they share the same ecosystem. The ornithologists (Andre Farrar, RSPB, Richard Thomas, Bird Life International) point out that migratory routes are North-South from Asia rather than East-West, and outbreaks should have occurred in Australasia ( see figure right ), which they haven\u2019t. Conservationists are concerned about reports of wild birds being killed in several countries from Madagascar to Vietnam. This debate will no doubt continue.

Turkey: Commissioner Kyprianou will visit Turkey from 25-27 January with a team of Veterinary experts, reinforcing EU support for Turkey in its fight against Avian Flu. Geneva: Shigeru Omi, WHO's Western Pacific regional director claimed that slow reporting by Asian countries could jeopardize the chances of rapidly containing a potential pandemic. Containment measures need to be carried out within 2-3 weeks of a potential pandemic event. Only half the reports of human cases from unnamed countries met this criterion, he said.

Turkey: The EU has allocated EUR 8 million to aid Turkey\u2019s fight against bird flu. Turkish authorities report that 12 out of the 17 patients treated for avian flu have recovered, while another 4 have died. The mortality rate in Turkey appears much lower than in Asia. Whether this reflects under reporting of cases in Asia or that H5N1 is evolving to a milder form is uncertain (see figure). The Hong Kong figure is taken from the first ever outbreak of H5N1 in 1997 resulting in 6 deaths from 18 cases. Science: A report in Nature reveals for the first time how Flu viruses replicate inside cells. Scientists using an electron microscope based 3-d technique have discovered how the virus packages RNA into a circle of seven segments surrounding another segment to make a set of eight. This could speed up the development of anti-viral drugs said Prof. Kawaoka, who headed the team from Japan, Sweden and US. Information Source: EMM news monitoring 29 ",

Iraq: It has emerged that the 54 year old woman is a distant relative of the girl and her uncle who have both died. The girl had close contact with chickens but her uncle didn\u2019t, raising fears of person to person transmission. Doctors treating patients complain of a lack of anti-viral medicines. Hong Kong: Officials ordered the closure of all bird parks in Hong Kong after a dead myna and a chicken tested positive for bird flu, health authorities said Wednesday. 3 people in contact with the infected bird and who ate another bird smuggled across the border, have tested negative for bird flu but remain in hospital. Recent incidents suggest H5N1 is again circulating in Guangdong province, China. Cyprus: Poultry consumption has plummeted. Suggestions to close the border crossings are rejected by House Speaker Demetris Christofias and Director of the Veterinary Services Mr. Neofitou in the north. Science: Scientists at CDC in the US announce that a new type of vaccine has proved effective in mice. It has been genetically engineered by putting an H5N1 gene into a cold virus and then developed in cell cultures. The new technique permits a much quicker production of vaccine than the traditional methods relying on hens\u2019 egg cultures. However, experts warn this technique is still in its early days. Bird Migration: The debate between conservationists and virologists about bird migration being the vector for the spread of avian flu continue. The map above shows that wild duck flyways follow a north south trend. The spread east from China to turkey would, therefore need cross infection. Conservationists blame poultry transport instead.

The WHO has sent a small team of experts to the region but are not expected to arrive in the area until next week because of the security situation. Tests from UK confirm H5N1 infection in the 15-year old girl who died Jan 17, but specimens from the girl\u2019s uncle and the 54 year old woman under treatment are yet to arrive to the UK. What is disturbing WHO officials is that both in Iraq and in the eastern part of Turkey there were no prior warnings of poultry outbreaks before the first human cases appeared. WHO teams are also conducting assessments in nine countries in the area: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Egypt, Georgia, Iran, Lebanon, Moldova, Syria, and Ukraine. Meanwhile, the Arab press (al-Hayat) report as many as 162 persons have been admitted for diagnosis. A Kurd official Najm Eddin Mohammed told al-Hayat infection is widespread in Rania, an area of 50 villages and 400,000 inhabitants on the Turkish border. Cyprus : British experts revealed that the H5N1 virus found in the birds in the northern part of Cyprus is similar to that of the strain located in Turkey. They also confirmed that the government and Veterinary Services in Cyprus have adopted all the necessary EU precautionary measures to prevent and control a pandemic. The two confirmed H5N1 cases detected in the village of Makrasyka may not have originated from the specific area or they may not even have come from Cyprus. The Director of the island\u2019s Veterinary Services told the House Agriculture Committee that it was 'scientifically unprecedented\u2019 that after the two cases no other incidents occurred. Cyprus is currently short of anti-viral drugs with only 580 doses available, another 40,000 will be supplied by March.

Russia: Bird Flu has been confirmed this morning in three villages in Stavropol territory Russia. They are being isolated for disease control measures. Migratory Bird Debate: A report by the Canadian based NGO GRAIN blames industrial poultry production and trade networks as the primary cause for the spread of H5N1. They claim the virus thrives in high density farms, where air thick with the virus can be carried for kilometres. Trade networks transporting live birds, day-old chicks, meat, feathers, hatching eggs, eggs, chicken manure and animal then feed spread infection. Defending backyard poultry rearing, they give the example of Laos where only outbreaks in large farms occurred supplied by chicks from Thai hatcheries. In Malaysia mortality in village chickens was only 5% indicating the virus did not spread easily when density was low. They ask why FAO and others concentrate their efforts on migratory birds and do not investigate how farms and their by-products, such as animal feed and manure, spread the virus. Birdlife International agrees arguing that H5N1 is highly lethal to migratory wild bird species and kills them quickly, that infected migrants cannot move long distances and that the virus is most likely to be contracted locally, close to the site of deaths. China today announced that no cases have yet been found in migratory flocks which began flying through China from Australasia and S.E. Asia one to two weeks ago.

This follows the discovery of a dead cat infected with bird flu yesterday in Island of Ruegen. Germany meanwhile prohibits taking cats out into the streets and also compels people to take dogs out with a leash. Science: The Lancet: Dr Jan-Inge Henter of the Karolinska Hospital in Stockholm and colleagues in Hong Kong propose that a chemotherapy treatment for an immune disorder could also be effective against bird flu. This is because there are similarities between human infection with H5N1 bird flu and an illness known as haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). \"Since the mortality from H5N1 infection is high, and since there is concern that the virus could cause a pandemic, novel treatments for human beings are warranted,\" Dr Henter writes.

Poultry in Europe: (Article: New Scientist) :The map shows that northern Germany and the Netherlands have the highest density of poultry in Europe. The 2003 outbreak of H7N7 bird flu caused the slaughter of 30 million birds. Scientists fear that if H5N1 becomes endemic in the wild bird population, poultry outbreaks are inevitable. Many scientists believe that a policy of culling alone would be devastating and may even fail. They recommend selected vaccination in high density areas. China and other SE Asian countries have a policy of vaccinating birds in high risk areas. Sweden: A duck found in Karlskrona last week had the H5 virus Veterinary sources said.

Why such a spread to Australia did not occur last year during the large S.E. Asian outbreak is still a mystery. The spread westward is different. Dr David Nabarro, of the UN warned that infected birds migrating this spring would probably take the virus from West Africa to the Arctic and Alaska.

Like the 3-year old she was also from central Java. The health minister Siti Fadilah Supari vowed to improve test procedures to protect people from the disease. China: Authorities confirm Sunday the death of a man in Guangzhou as due to bird flu. The Commercial Administration of Guangdong Province has banned on-the-spot poultry slaughtering in both the province's wet markets. Myanmar: Officials confirm an outbreak of bird flu at a poultry farm outside Mandalay where hundreds of birds have died. Russia: An outbreak is confirmed in a poultry processing plant in southern Russia near Stavrapol . Some 70,000 chickens have died or been culled. Poland: Three more cases of H5N1 infection have been announced: 1)in swans at Kostrzyn on Odra and 2) at Bydgoszcz, which is 50 km from Torun where the first case was found. The third case was in a sea goose found at the port town of Swinoujscie. Nigeria: Bird Flu has spread to a farm near Lagos in the state of Ogun which also borders Benin. Officials are now culling and disinfecting the farm of 150,000 birds. An outbreak in Lagos would have severe health consequences as it is home to 13 M people and chickens run freely in the streets. Cameroon: Cameroon has become the fourth country in Africa with H5N1 outbreak in domestic chickens and ducks at Maroua in the far north of the country. Further suspected outbreaks are under investigation in Ethiopia, Gabon, Gambia and Sierra Leone. Africa remains of the highest concern. Brazil: Brazil's chicken industry is the world's largest is feeling the pinch from a drop in worldwide consumption due to fears of a bird flu epidemic. They are laying off workers as a result, according to local media reports. Greece: Two more wild swans have tested positive for H5N1 bringing the total to 32. Bird Migration : Hundreds of thousands of migratory birds are now leaving Jammu Kashmir heading for Siberia, China and Europe reports the Indian Times. No signs of disease in greylag geese, mallards, teals, pochards, coots, gadwalls, pintails and shovellers have been reported at the Shalabugh Migratory Bird Reserve . China: The spread of avian flu to Turkey late 2005 and then on to Europe in Feb 2006 has been directly linked to an outbreak last spring at Lake Qinghai in China. The lake is an important breeding ground for many species of wild geese and ducks. Chinese authorities are now keeping a close watch on the lake as exactly one year ago in March many bar-headed geese were found dying of H5N1. From there it is thought some birds took the disease to Siberia, infecting poultry (July 2005) mixing with other birds which then later flew to Turkey and the Black Sea in early winter and eventually reached Europe. The cold winter in Siberia may have accelerated the westward movement. Information Source: EMM news monitoring 61 ",
        "Avian Flu Situation Reports Avian Flu \u2013 Key Developments 14-Mar-06 09:00 SES Unit, IPSC, Joint Research Centre Azerbaijan: WHO Tests confirm that 3 people have died from H5N1 at the Caspian Sea coast, south of the capital, Baku. It\u2019s thought they are from the same family although this awaits confirmation and include a 16- year old boy and a 17-year old girl. Earlier reports (6/3 & 10/3) spoke of 11 suspected cases in the region. Afghanistan: Agriculture minister Azizullah Osmani confirms three avian- flu infections in the capital Kabul and two in the eastern province of Nangarhar. FAO says the samples were taken from backyard poultry farms in Kabul and Jallalabad. Afghanistan\u2019s veterinary service is weak after years of war and the ministry is asking for international help. Germany: There are fears of an outbreak at a poultry farm in Lichtenfels, Bavaria after seven ducks there died of flu like symptoms. All the animals at the farm have been culled during the night. If confirmed this would be the first case in domestic birds in Germany. Authorities announced that 200 cases have been detected in wild birds so far. Cameroon: Authorities have closed poultry markets in Maroua and banned birds, pigs and related products from coming in or out. Livestock Minister Sarki Aboubakary believes that wild birds infected the farm as there has been no contact between the farm and poultry in Nigeria. Farmers will receive 2,000 CFA francs ($3.63) per bird culled. This is more than double the compensation on offer in Nigeria. Nigeria: Agriculture Minister Adamu Bello confirmed that eleven states have been affected so far - - Kaduna, Kano, Bauchi, Plateau, Katsina, Nasarawa, Anambra, Benue, Rivers and Ogun- as well as the FCT, have been affected so far. However, Kaduna is now free of the disease, and a testing lab is now operational at the National Veterinary Institute in Vom. India: Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) studies at the wetlands in Nandurbar district of Maharashtra have not found evidence of avian influenza among wild birds nor any increase in mortality around Navapur. Since the outbreak of bird flu was restricted only to the poultry farms in Navapur taluka, this suggests that poultry transport was responsible for the outbreak. Clearing up is continuing as the government announce the outbreak is contained and cleaning up is underway. 1918: Equinox (Granada TV): Evidence shows that the devastating pandemic in 1918 after the first world war was caused by mutations in an Avian Flu virus allowing person to person infection through breath. Oxford scientists believe the source may have been in high density troop encampments at a transit hub in Etaples, France where close contact with poultry was common. First fatal cases there were recorded in 1916 and it is thought that returning troops then spread the disease. Studies at US CDC have identified mutations that allowed the 1918 virus to infect deep lung tissue triggering massive immune response in humans. This explains why young and healthy victims with strong immune systems were worst effected. Anti-viral drugs combined with rapid medical intervention if a new human outbreak occurs could prevent a global pandemic occurring with H5N1, which everyone fears. ECDC Director Zsuzsanna Jakab at a press conference in Athens estimates scientists would need 10-12 weeks to develop an effective vaccine if a pandemic started.

        "Avian Flu Situation Reports Avian Flu \u2013 Key Developments 15-Mar-06 09:00 SES Unit, IPSC, Joint Research Centre India: Authorities announced a new outbreak in Maharashtra state at 4 villages in Jalgaon district 140 km from the original site at Navapur, thus dashing hopes that the outbreak was under control. The investigation was triggered after about 700 birds died during the last week in February in Marul village in Yaval. The outbreak is in backyard poultry and will require at least 75,000 birds to be killed. The government is creating an isolation ward at Jalgaon and Yaval hospitals as a precaution. Health officials are going door to door to identify anyone with flu like symptoms. There have been no confirmed human cases in India to date. Denmark: The Veterinary and Food Administration announced this morning that a wild bird has been confirmed infected with H5 bird flu subtype. No further details were available as of 9-45 am. Croatia: A swan for Baranja region on the Danube was infected with H5N1 bringing to 3 the number of regions of infection. Agriculture Ministry spokesman Mladen Pavic believes the bird came from Serbia or Hungary and was not part of a flock. Several seagulls have also tested positive in the southern Pantan ornithological reserve. 100 th death : The 3 deaths announced in Azerbaijan yesterday, if confirmed, bring the total to over 101 but this is more symbolic rather than statistical. \u201cWe are no closer to a pandemic at the 100-death stage than we were at the first death,\u201d said Frederick Leung dean of Microbiology at Hong Kong University. Although a small handful of infections are suspected to have been via infected people, the vast majority are through contact with bird droppings or saliva. Russia: Russia is struggling with a mass outbreak in Poultry in the south. 20,000 birds have died of the disease in Krasnodar terrirtory. 5690 birds have been culled in the last 24 hours in Dagestan. Over a million birds now have been vaccinated and another million slaughtered since February. Africa : A number of incidents in Kenya are leading newspapers to question government response. First over 400 dead chickens were found dumped in Kasarani, Nairobi. Then 500 others were found dead on a commercial farm in Nakuru and wild birds have been found dead. So far the veterinary service have dismissed bird flu as a cause after taking samples, while not investigated the wild bird cases. Uganda: 400 chickens died last week in a farm in Tororo in Eastern Uganda near the Kenyan border. This was the second incident of a large numbers of poultry deaths in the district. Samples have been sent to Nairobi for tests Niger: Niger's economy is 98 percent agricultural and chickens are used to barter. \"When a family member gets sick, we sell a chicken to buy some medicine,\" said villager Adam Bouku, who has 16 chickens and 16 family members all living under the same roof. Science: 1) Robert Webster, credited with being the first scientist to link bird flu to human flu said on national television that the odds are 50:50 that H5N1 will mutate to become a major flu pandemic. He admitted keeping a 3 month supply of food and water at his home. 2) The Hungarian Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany announced that the company Omnivest has developed an effective human vaccine against H5N1. 3) The EU reference lab in Weybridge has been criticised for withholding results of studies to protect the IPR of it\u2019s researchers. The lab in Padova has called for complete disclosure to enable the complex mapping and evolution of the virus. 4) H5N1 sequences found in swan samples from both Iran and Italy have been shown to be similar indicating a common source (data GenBank).

        "Avian Flu Situation Reports Avian Flu \u2013 Key Developments 16-Mar-06 09:00 SES Unit, IPSC, Joint Research Centre Denmark: The new case announced yesterday is a dead buzzard found on the beach in Svinoe, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) southwest of Copenhagen. Meanwhile Weybridge confirms the Swedish ducks found on February 28 th have H5N1. Since then another 28 other dead ducks have been found in Sweden. Romania: is investigating probable outbreaks of bird flu in farms in the towns of Dunarea and Valea Nucarilor. Authorities will cull more than 30,000 birds if samples test positive for the H5N1 strain. Veterinarians have killed more than 300,000 chickens since the virus was first discovered in October. France: Michel Fuzeau (prefect) announced that poultry sales from the protected zone around Versailleux in L\u2019Ain can restart on Saturday. This marks 21 days since the outbreak at a turkey farm. The virus remains active for 21 days. Azerbaijan: Authorities said on Wednesday that bird flu had been detected in a stray dog found in the capital Baku on March 9. This confirms that mammals eating raw infected birds are at risk. Evidence of a family cluster grows \u2013 the three official deaths are linked to two other unconfirmed deaths through family connections. This is similar to the outbreak in Van Turkey where nearly all cases had family connections. Affected areas in Southern Russia where mass poultry outbreaks are underway. Note the vicinity to Azerbaijan India: A health ministry official warns that the new outbreak in Jalgaon is unlikely to be the last. The unnamed official claims that poultry was illegally moved from the first outbreak in Nandapur aided by local politicians. He claimed that only one third of the official total of 900,000 birds were actually culled and the rest moved elsewhere. Myanmar: FAO announced that independent tests carried out in Bangkok confirm H5N1 in samples from near Mandalay, Myanmar. Afghanistan: The government announced that tests confirm H5N1 as the cause of the outbreaks in backyard poultry in Kabul and Jallalabad Science: Chicken is too cheap, according to Earl Brown, a University of Ottawa flu virologist. He claims H5N1 is entirely man made. Bird flu first evolved in commercial poultry in Italy in 1878, and H5N1 itself, is derived from a strain that first appeared in Scotland in 1959. High intensity farming in recent years has amplified health problems. According to the NGO Grain chicken production has jumped eightfold in 30 years in S.E. Asia. China alone produces 10 million tons of chicken a year, and some farms raise 5 million birds at a time. Many Ornithologists dispute the view that wild birds carried the flu virus from Qinghai to Russia and beyond, as the spread occured during the summer months when birds do not migrate. The global poultry trade, much of which is illicit, plays a far larger role in spreading the virus they argue. The Nigerian government traced its outbreak to the illegal importation of day-old chicks. Illegal trading in fighting cocks brought the virus from Thailand to Malaysia in fall 2005. If H5N1 first spread from Qinghai to Russia and Kazakhstan last summer through the sale of contaminated poultry infecting wild birds already there, Europe is now suffering the consequences. China: The man who died in Guangdong early March visited poultry markets and an abattoir, but at the time there were no known poultry outbreaks in the area. This is leading experts to question whether apparently healthy birds were the culprit. It is known from a previous survey that as many as 2% of birds in China seem to have anti-bodies to H5N1. China faces a huge problem this spring as the flu season peaks and large numbers of birds arrive in Qinghai. Surveillance, better education and rapid response measures are planned. Thailand succeeded in eliminating the disease using many thousands of paid volunteers in villages to report any incidents. Information Source: EMM news monitoring 64 ",
        "Avian Flu Situation Reports Avian Flu \u2013 Key Developments 17-Mar-06 09:00 SES Unit, IPSC, Joint Research Centre Israel: Bird flu is suspected on two turkey farms at Ein Hashlosha and the nearby community of Holit, in the southern Negev region, which lies near the densely populated Gaza strip. 11,000 birds have now died in the area. Officials are openly calling it bird flu after initial tests and have placed a 4 mile quarantine around the area. They are preparing to cull thousands of other birds. They suspect H5N1 may have entered from nearby Egypt, rather than Gaza where there is good collaboration on testing. This morning vets report that bird flu may have spread to a kibbutz 25 km from Jerusalem. There have been suspicious turkey deaths at the kibbutz, and initial tests confirm a bird flu. India: A large number of chickens have died in Burhanpur district of Madhya Pradesh in recent days. Samples have been taken to the Bhopal laboratory, but will take around a week for results. The four districts of Madhya Pradesh that have borders with Gujarat and Maharashtra are Burhanpur, Khandwa, Jhabua and Barwani. Another 400 birds have died at a poultry farm in Induri village in Pune district. The laboratory in Bhopal is now overstretched with tests to be carried out. Eritrea: WHO reports mass bird deaths in two regions of Eritrea. Wild fowl have been dying near the Red Sea region and poultry deaths are reported from Gash Barka region. Tests have also revealed bird flu cases in neighbouring Ethiopia. Malaysia: The government announced an outbreak in Perak province in the north of the country on Thursday. Overnight they have culled 40,000 ducks and chickens. The outbreak was in a natural park and in a village nearby. A lake nearby is frequented by migratory wild fowl. Denmark : confirms H5N1 in the dead buzzard. Greece: Greek poultry producers are in despair and asking for government and EU aid. Consumption has dropped by 80% despite there not being a single outbreak in domestic flocks. UK: Tests were carried out in Weybridge on a number of poultry who died at a farm in the Orkneys, Scotland. Late Thursday preliminary results were announced as negative for H5, but final results will take a week. Russia: About 1.6 million birds have been vaccinated in southern Russia. 33,000 birds have either died of bird flu or been slaughtered over the last 24 hours. \u2013 Emergencies Ministry, Tass. Science: 1) A study by The Scripps Research Institute and CDC Atlanta has been published in Science. They found that H5N1 hemagglutinin looked very similar to the virus that caused the 1918 pandemic. However to pass from birds to humans, the virus must mutate enough to allow it to bind to human lung cells. They identified a structure that, in humans is called an alpha 2-6 receptor and in birds an alpha 2-3 receptor. It must change from the bird to human configuration, to cause human epidemics. Without this critical mutation most avian influenza viruses, including the current avian H5N1 are difficult to jump species without massive exposure to the virus. 2) Dr. Nabarro, who heads the UN bird flu program, said that there is still uncertainty whether pets can pass H5N1 onto owners. However, there have been a handful of cases where person to person infection was suspected. 3) Scientists in Vietnam are launching a study to determine the optimum dosage of Tamiflu for effectiveness against H5N1. They plan to double the normal dose in tests, after patients died despite treatment with the standard dose. Tests on animals have shown that twice the dose is enough to stop the virus from replicating. The trial is supported by WHO. Information Source: EMM news monitoring 65 ",

She lived 40km from Cairo and kept chickens some of which have died recently. It was reported she killed the surviving birds and ate at least one. Initial tests from the US Navy lab in Cairo confirm bird flu as the cause. A second case was reported Sunday in a 30 year old male poultry worker from the same province of Qalyoubiya. He was admitted to hospital on Thursday with high fever but is now recovering. Israel: The four people hospitalized on Friday had not contracted H5N1. Bird flu is suspected to have spread to both Moshav Sde Moshe and Kibbutz Nachshon, 25 kilometers from Jerusalem. This morning veterinary sources report that bird flu has spread to two communities - Nir Oz and Amioz, in Negev close to the original infected kibbutz. India: An 11 year old boy and a doctor are under observation in Jalgaon, after thousands of birds have been culled. The boy had a history of exposure to dead birds. Blood samples have been sent for tests. On Sunday a 40 year old woman and a 5 \u2013year old by were isolated. Bird flu may have spread in Jalgaon district. Over a hundred birds have died in backyard poultry in 4 new villages outside the quarantine zone. They are Jamner, Parola, Pachora and Badgaon. As of Monday morning 90,000 birds have been culled and a huge cleanup operation is underway. The medical surveillance zone has been expanded to include 30,000 locals. Sweden: H5N1 was confirmed in a mallard duck on a game farm near Oskarshamn on the east coast. All birds on the farm will be destroyed. Russia: A massive vaccination of poultry in the Rostov region began on Saturday. An outbreak is raging in Krasnodar where 22,000 birds died of flu in a 24 hour period. 8,000 died of the disease in Daghestan in the same period. Kazakhstan: H5N1 has been confirmed in swan samples on the Caspian sea Mangistau region Georgia : Three soldiers were taken to Davit Aghmashenebeli Church Hospital of Kutaisi, to the department of intensive therapy on March 17, suffering from acute respiratory infection with pneumonia and nasal bleeding. Serbia: Four children are in intensive care, after showing symptoms resembling bird flu. Afghanistan: Culling of birds in Kabul and Jallalabd cannot start because of a lack of protective suits. It is already several days since cases appeared. In Nepal there are local reports of domestic birds dying in Rangeli in Morang, but the government dismisses bird flu as the cause. Malaysia: Four people with bird flu symptoms have been put in quarantine. A new outbreak of H5N1 is reported in chickens from a village in northern Penang state. Science: Scientists at Scripps and CDC have shown that relatively small mutations can result in switching the binding site preference of the avian virus from receptors in the intestinal tract of birds to the respiratory tract of humans. This is controlled by the glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) on the virus surface. Avian types (including H5N1) bind to a receptor in bird\u2019s intestines called a2- 3, while human types bind to one called a2-6 in respiratory cells. The authors claim this is one possible, but perhaps not the only route the virus could adapt to humans. The paper will be published in Science. Information Source: EMM news monitoring 66 ",

All three human cases are from the same region. A man admitted to hospital on Sunday has recovered after being treated with Tamiflu, but a woman died on Friday despite receiving the same treatment. So far, 17 of Egypt's 26 governorates and the city of Luxor have reported cases in birds. Israel: Officials believe that bird flu entered Israel from Egypt carried by people. The first cases were near the Egyptian border at Holit and Amioz, and they believe the virus entered on the shoes or personal effects of persons who had visited Sinai. At least one such person was later employed by the turkey farms where the virus first erupted, dealing directly with birds. They rule out migratory birds as a cause, since the outbreaks happened simultaneously. Agriculture ministry on Monday also confirmed infections at Kibbutz Nir Oz and Moshav Amei Oz in the south bringing the total to six flocks at four locations. Cameroon: Fears grow that H5N1 is rampant in Northwest Cameroon as 240 birds were discovered dead in a poultry farm in the Isokolo neighbourhood of Limbe town. Limbe is a commercial seaside town near the Nigerian border and several hundred kilometres from Maroua where the first confirmed cases in ducks were reported. Denmark confirms nine more cases in tufted ducks in Aeroeskoebing in the south of the country making 10 in total. Slovenia: 10 chickens found dead with suspected bird flu in the 3km protection zone around Hotinja. 34 other birds have been found in the last three days and are being tested. Afghanistan: Bird flu is thought to have spread to a third province of Kunar, while culling has still not started despite provision of protective suits by US military. The reports are from Yargul outside the provincial capital, Asadabad. Tests have confirmed H5 type virus in the chickens. Nine hundred chicken farms were closed last week following confirmation of an outbreak in Jalalabad. Cases in Europe 21/03/06 Malaysia: Two new cases of H5N1 bird flu are reported in central Perak state on Tuesday. The virus had been found in live chickens taken from areas near previous outbreaks. Meanwhile tests in Weybridge confirm H5N1 infection in the two farms in Pakistan reported 1 st March. India: The four suspected human cases in Jalgaon have all tested negative but are being treated with Tamiflu as a precaution. Over 90,000 birds have been killed and a big clean up operation is in progress across 4 effected villages spanning 1,100 sq km. Homes, backyards and drainage systems are being disinfected. Science: Researchers at US CDC report they have found two distinct strains of H5N1 which have been able to infected humans. The first strain infected people in 2003 and 2004 in Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand, and the second strain infected people in Indonesia in 2004. CDC's Rebecca Garten told a conference in Atlanta that as the virus spreads geographically it is getting more genetically diverse, more complex to study and emphasised the importance of surveillance. The study was based on 300 virus samples taken from birds and people from 2003 until summer 2005. Information Source: EMM news monitoring 67 ",

Four of them came from a township in Salyan region in the south east 3 of whom were related . A 17-year-old girl died on 23 February. Her first cousin, a 20-year-old woman, died on 3 March. The 16-year-old brother of this woman died on 10 March. A 17-year-old girl, a close friend of the family, died on 8 March. All four of these cases lived together or near each other. The fifth death was from Tarter in the west. 7 of the 11 suspected cases had tested positive for H5N1 An additional two cases from Salyan involve a 10-year-old boy, who has recovered, and a 15-year-old girl, who is currently hospitalized and in critical condition. The seventh case occurred in a 21-year-old woman from the western region of Tarter, who died on 9 March. In addition to the 11 cases tested, there are two further suspected cases, one from Salyan and one from the adjacent region of Neftchela. Both are in hospital with symptoms of bilateral pneumonia, and testing of these patients is currently under way. Azerbaijan: Expand the image to view detail Egypt : A 17 year-old boy with an outbreak on his father\u2019s farm in the Nile delta is the 4 th suspected case in Egypt. His condition is stable. Evidence that the outbreak in poultry is not yet under control came from the Ministry of Health yesterday. They announced that 280 poultry farms have been put in isolation in Qalubia, Dakhlia, Giza, Sharkiya and Manufia provinces. An Egyptian newspaper al-Misri al-Yawm claimed that the actual number of people in hospital with suspicious symptoms was Cairo-8 cases, Manufia-8 cases, Gharbia-5 cases and Giza-3 cases. Bird flu has spread to 15 provinces since February 17. Africa: UN and African officials agreed in Gabon's capital Libreville to set up a continent wide surveillance and monitoring committee. WHO regional director Luis Gomes Sambo said countries finding an outbreak must implement a minimum level of control \u2013 confining poultry, veterinary control and use of protective clothing. UN\u2019s David Nabarro asked for every country to begin an education programme to reduce the risk of spread from bird to man. Director General of OMI, Bernard Vallet, speaking in Atlanta, called for developed countries to help with detection programmes and compensation. \"There are parts of Africa without any surveillance,\" Vallat said. \"Diseases can circulate for weeks in some parts of Africa without being known by the authorities in the capital.\" Serbia: It is reported that 122 people with suspect flu symptoms have been quarantined in Bajina Basta, Serbia. India: Cleanup operations in Jalgaon are finishing. Authorities have checked 400,000 people in and around the 4 effected villages. Over 90,000 birds have been culled and backyards, drains and homes disinfected. The operation should be complete within 2 days. Vietnam: Smuggling of poultry from China is a big problem due to the large price difference over the border. Agriculture minister Phat orders a tightening on customs and illicit crossing point s. Vietnam has been free of bird flu for 3 months with no human cases since November. Russia: Bird flu has killed 1.3 million birds in Russia so far this year compared to 662,000 birds for the whole of 2005, Veterinary Health chief Sergei Dankvert announced yesterday. First cases of bird flu occurred in poultry in Siberia and Kazachstan in July 2005. There is heated debate as to whether this spread probably from Lake Qinghai region of China was due to migratory birds or poultry trade. Information Source: EMM news monitoring 68 ",

Netzarim is a former Jewish settlement evacuated in the pull out from Gaza. This morning it was unclear if there wasn\u2019t in fact a second case after about 200 chickens were found dead in a coop in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip early Wednesday. There is good cooperation between the Palestine Authority and Israel where the tests are being performed. Doctors, Vets and Agriculture experts met yesterday to discuss plans. Israel will donate 1000 protective suits. Israel: A further outbreak of H5N1 is confirmed this morning in Moshav Beka'ot, in the Jordan Valley. Another suspected outbreak at Netaim, in central Israel has not yet been confirmed. although tests are underway. Egypt: The latest human case is Mohammed Mahmoud Abdul Ghani Ghabash, 17. from the province of Gharbiyah, north of Cairo. Ghabash worked on his father\u2019s poultry farm, where 3,000 birds died of flu over the weekend. He was hospitalised on Sunday. The previous case was Fatima Mohammed Yussef, 30, from Qaliubiya. She continued working in her chicken coop and kill fowl despite a ban mid-February. The only confirmed fatal case of the four has been been Amal Mohammed Ismail, from Nawa village also in Qaliubiya province, who kept a backyard poultry farm. There are unconfirmed reports that Fatima may have also died this morning. DRC: Bird flu spreads to the Democratic Republic of Congo. DRC had recorded at least 260 chicken and ducks suspected of having died of avian flu. 100 birds died in a single day at Tshikapa, a town in South Central Province of the Kasai Occidental. Experts visited Ouesso, 800km north of Brazzaville to collect samples from 13 ducks found dead on a poultry farm. It has taken over a week for the deaths to be investigated. There are also rumours of outbreaks in Benin . Uganda was thrown into panic recently after thousands of birds and poultry died in several districts, but the ministry of Agriculture says the birds were dying of Newcastle disease. Kazakhstan: H5N1 has been confirmed in Mangistau province, western Kazachstan in dead wild birds from the Caspian shore. Domestic birds in the area are being vaccinated. Kazachstan suffered a previous outbreak in poultry in August 2005 in the north of the country. Romania: An outbreak in poultry in Magurele in Ilfov County, about 50 miles southwest of Bucharest was confirmed yesterday by Veterinary officials. A quarantine zone has been placed around the village and 100,000 birds will be killed. There have been 50 outbreaks in Romania Science: H5N1 virus binds only to deep lung cells and not to those in the respiratory tract, reports a new study. This explains why human to human infection is very rare. Normal influenza spreads through coughs and sneezes which eject viruses from the nose and windpipe. It is irritation in the upper airways that causes coughing, seemingly absent in bird flu. H5N1 Bird flu is adapted to infect bird\u2019s intestinal system. The fear is that if enough people become effected the virus could mutate to this more easily transmissible form. However, other mutations are needed as well to trigger a pandemic and this would be a complex series of events not just one. Two papers from US/Japanese and Dutch groups discussing this will be published in Nature and Science shortly. Information Source: EMM news monitoring 69 ",

The woman, a migrant worker was hospitalised on 15 March with fever and died this week. Shanghai is China\u2019s most populous city with 20 million inhabitants including 3 million migrant workers. Health officials are reinforcing precautions. No outbreaks in poultry have been reported in Shanghai since 2004. China has the world\u2019s largest domestic poultry flocks numbering about 5.2 billion at any given time. Officially there have been 10 deaths from bird flu in China. Afghanistan: A total of 23 cases of the H5 strain of avian influenza have been found in five provinces since early March \u2013 six of these samples later tested positive for the H5N1 virus. Culling of birds in infected sites in Kabul has finally started on Wednesday.

Albania: A second case of the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain of bird flu has been found among dead poultry in Peze-Helmes, 10km east of Tirana. Albania and Greece are cooperating and have formed a joint Vet team to fend off possible outbreaks in border areas. Greece :A dead swan discovered in Epanomi, near Greece's second most populous city, Salonika. Has been confirmed an H5N1 victim in Weybridge. It is the 33 rd case in wild birds in Greece. Sweden: Three more cases of H5 strain in wild birds found in central Stockholm were confirmed on Thursday. The two swans and a goose were found in the same area as two other wild swans which died from H5. A total of 41 cases of H5 strain in wild birds have been confirmed in Sweden. So far only two ducks have been confirmed as H5N1. Cameroon: There are reports of dozens of fowl dying in the North west of the country notably around Bali. Carcasses have been taken to MINEPIA, the government livestock body. Russia: Mass vaccination of domestic poultry is about to start in Krasnoyarsk territory. 265,000 doses of vaccine have been delivered to this part of Siberia New Zealand: New Zealand\u2019s unique flightless birds the kiwi and the near-extinct kakapo will be vaccinated against bird flu at the first hint of infection in the country. Science: CDC confirms that the flu season is only peaking now much later than normal. It should be waning at this time of the year, perhaps unusually cold conditions are to blame. Flu viruses survive only short periods outside a host when the temperature is above 20 degrees. Information Source: EMM news monitoring 70 ",

She had been in contact with sick birds, confirmed the health ministry on Saturday. This brings to 23 the number of fatal human cases in Indonesia. China confirms that the woman who died in Shanghai tested positive for H5N1 making the 11 th fatal case in the country. Reports this morning said she bought chickens from an unlicensed trader at Tangjiawan market in the city. The city has a ban on live bird markets. Cambodia : 3 more people were hospitalised on Saturday in Phnom Penh with suspected bird flu. They are two children and an adult, and are from the same village in the district of Kampong Speu as the 1-year old toddler who died. It is 60 km from the capitol. The two children had also played with dead poultry while the adult took some of the dead birds home to cook. Seven other sick people from the same village tested negative last week . Egypt: An 18 year old girl is the fifth suspected case of bird flu, the health ministry announced on Sunday. She is now in good condition after treatment with Tamiflu. She had been handling dead birds, and began to feel unwell 4 days ago, checking into hospital on Saturday. Two other Egyptian bird flu cases left hospital on Sunday, and another is still being treated. Israel: 1.2 million birds have now been culled as the outbreaks are being brought under control. Veterinary services are now preparing for another possible outbreak of the disease in the Gaza Strip, where Palestinians are not destroying the infected birds out of fear of losing a key source of income without receiving compensation, Jerusalem officials believe. The World Bank has on Sunday pledged $2M to PA farmers, to avoid this problem. Meanwhile Jordanian Health Minister Said Darwazeh confirmed that at least three dead turkeys at a domestic farm in Ajloun had tested positive for H5N1. Romania: The outbreak of avian flu in Constanta region is not yet under control. The Sanitary Veterinary Department set up disinfecting filters Saturday morning in Constanta harbor, in order to prevent the spread of bird flu virus. The isolation zone includes the nuclear plant at Cernovada. Serbia: The first case in a domestic chicken found 10 days ago at Bajina Basta area, southwest of Belgrade near Bosnia was confirmed H5N1 after tests in Weybridge. Vets are monitoring all poultry in a 10km zone. Malaysia: A 3-year old from Penang and a 26 year old man from Perak are in isolation with suspected bird flu in Kuala Lampur. There have been 5 outbreaks of H5N1 in poultry 4 in Perak and 1 in Penang in the last 10 days.

She is the second death in Egypt. She was from Khanka village in the Qaliubiya governorate and died at Cairo's Abbassiya hospital. In Jordan no further outbreaks detected but 5000 birds have been culled in Ajloun governate. Gaza: Palestinian agriculture officials have begun poisoning 15,000 chickens in the Gaza Strip after the World Bank pledged $2m compensation to farmers. Sweden: A mink has been found with H5 infection in the Blekinge region of south Sweden, an area where several bird flu cases have been found. The animal probably got infected after eating dead wild birds in the area. Switzerland: Three new cases in wild birds are reported. They are a wild duck and a grebe at Neuhausen and a wild duck at B\u00fcsingen. A total of 29 cases of H5 in wild birds have now been found in Switzerland, but none in domestic birds. Czech Republic: The countries first case of H5 has been reported in a swan on the Vltava River near Hluboka nad Vltavou, south Bohemia. If H5N1 is confirmed a control zone will be set up and poultry kept inside. Romania: A new outbreak in domestic fowl is reported in a Deleni village in Constanta County. Over 50 outbreaks have been reported in Romania since October. Iraq: Iraqi medical authorities ordered tests for the H5N1 bird flu virus on samples from a man who died in Baghdad. Pakistan: 700 chickens have died on a poultry farm in Abbottabad, North West Frontier Region. Many dead crows have been found in the same area, causing much concern in Peshwar. India: Fear of another outbreak have risen after 1,500 chickens were found dead at 2 separate poultry farms in Bhojpur district of Bihar on Sunday. Hopes that the summer heat will kill the virus are only valid when the virus is outside a host and infection from one bird directly to another is still possible. Science: Dr. Jeremy Farrar works at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Ho Chi Minh City and has treated two dozen people with avian flu over the last 3 years. He and his Vietnamese colleagues have more clinical experience than anyone else in the world, yet he still thinks it unlikely the virus is poised to jump species. \u201cBillions of chickens in Asia have been infected and millions of people lived with them,\" he said. Yet, \"less than 200 people have gotten infected\u201d. That shows just how hard it is to catch. He thinks a pandemic on the 1918 scale, although frightening is very unlikely. It is an epidemic in birds and not in people. It has a profound economic impact on agriculture. Migratory Birds: Are they victims or vectors? In 2004 several storks tested positive for H5N1 in Thailand triggering accusations that migratory birds were to blame. However ornithologists pointed out the birds had migrated from India and Bangladesh which were free of the disease. The evidence was that the birds had been infected by local poultry. Poultry infection even at lake Qinghai cannot be ruled out, according to Bird Life International as it occurred outside the main migratory period. The consequent spread east eventually to Europe is also difficult to blame on a single species as none migrate eastward. Instead Bird Life International blame poultry shipments along road and rail links followed by cross infection with wild birds. Effected wild birds so far are scavengers and waterfowl both of which are known to mix with poultry. What is undisputed is that the same viral strain linked back to China has moved eastward.

Seven are in Maharashtra's Jalgaon district, the source of the second outbreak. The eighth is the previously suspected case in Burhanpur district of Madhya Pradesh (reported on the 17 th March) This is the third state to be affected. 250,000 birds will be culled spread over 200 villages in Maharashtra's Jalgaon district. Suspicions are that all these are related to illegal transport of infected birds from the first outbreak in Navapur (see 16 th March). Afghanistan: Three new cases have been announced. The first case was detected in a chicken from in Kandahar province, and the other two were from chickens found in the Baraki Barak district of Logar province. To date 26 cases of the H5 strain of avian influenza have been found in seven provinces. March 25: Number of outbreaks in Poultry (OMI) \u2013 Note the LOG Scale Poland: The ministry of agriculture announced that 5 new cases of suspected H5N1 in swans are confirmed at Bydgoszcz in the north of the country. The dead swans were found last Thursday and Friday and tested at the Veterinary lab at Pulawy. Denmark: Official confirmation of H5N1 of the first dead buzzard found in mid March has been given. There have been 12 suspected cases of avian flu in wild birds found in the country to date. Czech Republic: Czech agriculture minister Jan Mladek confirmed that the swan found in the river Vltava near Hluboka nad Vltavou, died of H5N1, although final confirmation from Weybridge will take another 15 days. He said special measures are being taken to prevent further spread. Myanmar: Official reports say chicken deaths from bird flu have been detected in Shwebo, Kanbalu and Khin Oo townships in Sagaing Division and Pyigyidagun township in Mandalay between the first week of February and early March. 3600 birds died on 37 poultry farms and another 5000 were slaughtered. Kaliningrad: All vehicles moving across the Russian border into the Kaliningrad enclave region will be disinfected starting from April 3. These measures are to stop the spread of bird flu. Lebanon: There are concerns of a bird flu outbreak centred on 3 areas east and south of the souyther port town of Tyre and specifically in the Rashidieh Palestinian refugee camp.

        "Avian Flu Situation Reports Avian Flu \u2013 Key Developments 30-Mar-06 09:00 SES Unit, IPSC, Joint Research Centre Europe: Bernard Vallet, director of OIE says poultry confinement in Europe had been a success. French authorities have ruled out wild birds as causing the infection at the Turkey farm in L\u2019Ain. Instead they believe either a pet or humans or farm equipment brought the virus inside. Another possible case on a farm in Sweden is currently being tested (20 March). All H5N1 cases found in wild birds in Europe are believed to have originated in the Black Sea area, where there are also large outbreaks in poultry. The mainly swans and ducks then migrated west due to especially harsh winter conditions there. He warns that other birds will now be returning from Africa and the Middle East. Ornithologists estimate the number of birds moving between Africa and Europe at this time of the year runs into the billions and is expected to reach its height in April. However they also point out that the virus in Nigeria has been confined to poultry and there is no evidence it has spread to wild birds. The outbreak in Nigeria was actually caused by illicit imports of poultry products probably from China, and not by migratory birds. A Commission proposal for co-financial support to the poultry sector will be discussed by the European Parliament and Agriculture ministers in April. The Czech Republic yesterday became the 13 th European state with confirmed H5N1 cases. Lebanon: Palestinian popular committees in the Rashidieh camp used mosque loudspeakers and distributed pamphlets to urge the refugees not to rear chickens in the camp and to get rid of any wild fowl. Iraq: Bird flu has been found in poultry in Baghdad, confirmed Ibtissam Aziz, a government spokeswoman. Earlier this week medical authorities ordered tests for the virus on samples from a man who died in Baghdad. Israel: H5N1 has been confirmed on a Kibbutz near Jerusalem after a large number of deaths on Tuesday. Veterinary services are culling 30,000 poultry. It is the 14 th location of outbreaks in the country and 1.2 million birds have been slaughtered. Russia: Over 1.3 million birds have either died of bird flu or been culled since the beginning of the year. There have been no human cases. The outbreaks are mainly in Southern Russia between the Black Sea and Caspian Sea. India: 23 villages have been sealed off in Burhanpur district and 6,500 chickens killed in the first day following yesterday\u2019s confirmation of Avian flu at the third location in Burhanpur. Nigeria: The World Bank is providing $50M credit to help Nigeria fight avian flu outbreaks and to prevent its spread to further parts of the country. Cambodia: Tests have confirmed H5N1 infection in ducks found in an isolated village near the Vietnamese border two weeks ago. Chickens and ducks within 3km were culled, bad communications and poor health infrastructure is causing concern the virus could have spread elsewhere. A 3-year old girl died of the virus last week in the central province of Kampong Speu. Science: 1) John Oxford, the professor of virology at Queen Mary's medical school in London suggests exhuming victims from the 1918 pandemic. Researchers only have five tissue samples from victims of the 1918 pandemic located in the UK and the US. These samples have been able to give scientists the complete genetic sequence of the virus. He suggests going further and taking 100 samples from victims between 1916 and 1917 to understand how the virus evolved and from 1919 to understand why it then died out. Scientists are now thinking they could actually stop an outbreak right at the start, with the right anti-viral drugs and careful planning. 2) Human tests of a new H5N1 vaccine derived from a Vietnamese sample at University of Rochester Medical Centre in New York, have proven that just half the 471 volunteers receiving also a booster jab at the highest doses developed enough antibodies to protect them from infection. Nevertheless this half successful result with no associated side effects is encouraging. Although the vaccine is unlikely to be so effective on a mutated virus capable of triggering a pandemic, they recommend stock piling it as a first defence.

This has raised fears of possible human to human infection. She has tested positive for H5 in a Baku laboratory. France: Lab tests confirm that five swans found last week in ponds in the Dombes region of L\u2019Ain died of H5N1 infection. Hungary: A government spokesman said that 5,600 birds in 13 zoos in the country will be vaccinated against H5N1 using the Dutch vaccine Nobilis Influenza. 59 cases in wild birds have been found to date, but none in poultry. Czech Republic: Two more swans have died from the same proximity as the first in Hluboka nad Vltavou, southern Bohemia and have tested positive for H5. Portugal: Portuguese TV reports that a seagull and 12 ducks have been found infected with bird flu viruses, but not with the lethal H5 virus. The birds are still alive. Cambodia: The source of the infection of the 3-year old toddler who died, has been identified as a neighbours poultry flock some of whom have been found to be infected with H5N1. It\u2019s thought the toddler may have been infected after playing near droppings of infected poultry said Kao Phal, director of the animal health department at the Agriculture Ministry. Cameroon: H5N1 has been confirmed in Italy form tests on a wild duck from Lake Malape, situated 40 kilometres west of Garoua near the border with Nigeria. 240 chickens were recently reported dead in the southwest provincial town of Limbe on the Atlantic coast, but results from tests are not available yet. Russia: An outbreak of bird flu in the Vesyoly settlement in Volgograd was reported Thursday. 100 chickens died on the settlement which has been isolated. 2.3 million vaccination doses have been delivered to the region. Some 10 million domestic birds are kept in the region. Vietnam: Vietnam has moved from being the worst effected country with the highest number of human deaths to being apparently disease free. It has spent $18.9M on vaccinating 120 million birds and plans to vaccinate 160 million more. Hans Troedsson the WHO representative in Vietnam says \"We're probably not virus-free, but what the mass vaccination has done is reduce the virus load in the environment -- we have less virus circulating.\" The mass vaccination programme however is not a simple solution for wiping out H5N1 virus. Widespread immunisation is expensive and labour intensive. Each bird needs up to 3 injections over 4 months if their lifespan is that long, requiring 2-3 visits. It takes 3 people one hour to vaccinate 900 birds in one farm, and of course the whole process needs repeating for each new rearing. China claims to have vaccinated its entire domestic flock of 14 billion birds, but continues to see sporadic outbreaks. Thailand has a policy of no mass vaccination, but rapid intervention and also has disease free status. Science: 1) GlaxoSmithKline are beginning clinical trials of two separate vaccines against human bird flu. 800 healthy volunteers in Germany and Belgium are involved. The German trial is of a vaccine made with a classic additive to improve human immunity response. The Belgian trial is uses a novel additive which Glaxo hope could stretch supplies by reducing the amount of antigen per dose. 2) A European wide simulation exercise of response to an influenza pandemic showed that countries were reasonably well prepared but also exposed some flaws in the system used for reporting national health crises. Certainly Europe is better prepared now than it was 18 months ago, confirmed John Simpson of UK\u2019s Health Protection Agency.

Yes, they are,\u201d said Julie Hall, a WHO coordinator in China. \u201cThe reality is people are poor. Chickens are incredibly valuable sources of income and source of protein. Chickens don\u2019t like being cold,\u201d Hall said. \u201cThe only source of heat is the kitchen.\u201d 1918 Pandemic: The Spanish Flu probably originated in Canton province of China, as first human cases occurred there in February 1918 before spreading round the world in three waves over the next year. Spain was particularly badly hit which explains the origin of the name. The first wave occurred spring and early summer, before the main wave in the autumn. A third wave occurred in early 1919 before essentially disappearing, but exact timings depended on location. The figure shows recorded flu cases in Switzerland, and demonstrates the intensity of the second wave. Mass troop movements at the end of the First World War helped the spread around the world and every continent was consequently affected. Source: Swiss Data - C.E.

Virologist Albert Osterhaus and colleagues at the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam know from lab tests have shown that carnivores who eat raw infected birds are likely to contract the disease. Cats can contract the disease also through the respiratory tract and can even infect other cats. Not enough is known about H5N1 to gauge the risk of onward infection to people, but they advise keeping cats in doors in areas where known outbreaks occur. Another fear is that the virus could use a feline host to mutate to a more dangerous form. Information Source: EMM news monitoring 79 ",

Burkino Faso: Burkina Faso has started to cull poultry in the area where birds have died from H5N1 bird flu. However, there was still a delay of one month to get test results at the farm in question. As a result it is feared the disease is anyway spreading without control. Nigeria: H5N1 has been found in backyard poultry and at a commercial farm in the Nigerian city of Lagos, home to about 13 million people, health officials said on Thursday. This is potentially a dangerous situation in this densely populated city where most families keep backyard poultry. A grant of $0.5M from the African Development bank to support the Nigerian government\u2019s effort to combat spread of the disease. Russia: A significant number of dead wild ducks have been found in the River Ikortes in the Voronezh region south west of Moscow, according to the regions chief sanitary officer. Samples have been taken for tests. Science: (main source Nature) 1) Indonesia is currently the worst effected country in the world. Controlling the disease is very difficult in a country of 240 million people, 1.3 billion chickens spread over 600 inhabited islands. The virus is endemic in many of the millions of backyard farms, not helped by the belated response of the government. Now it is reporting cases promptly but has an extremely high mortality rate of 92%, perhaps implying unreported cases. Things are improving now a national surveillance program is underway. 2) Africa: There is a worse problem of weak surveillance and lack of testing laboratories in Africa which could lead to the virus becoming endemic. Expert opinion is that the virus cannot be contained in Africa without vaccination as small farmers will avoid culling as poultry is their only livelihood. 2) China: The recent human cases in Shanghai and Guangzhou with no apparent connection to poultry were studied by a Hong Kong virologist. Tests in southern China show that despite massive vaccination only 20-50% of birds in markets carry antibodies to H5N1 and the virus itself could actually be isolated in 1% of apparently healthy birds. The two victims both frequented live poultry markets and it seems likely they contracted bird flu there. It is now clear from studies of the last 5 years, that domestic ducks and geese are far more susceptible to H5N1 than are chickens. Therefore the key to controlling the disease is in aquatic poultry. Flu itself is an indigenous disease to waterfowl and probably passed only to humans with the development of poultry farming. Information Source: EMM news monitoring 80 ",

He is a poultry farmer who reported to health authorities following the death of some of his 600 chickens. More than 50,000 birds have been culled in two districts of south Gujarat, which borders Navapur district in Maharashtra state. No human cases have been confirmed in India to date. UK: Scotland\u2019s chief Vet said Saturday that the dead swan had a similar H5N1 strain to the birds on Ruegen Island Germany. So far all of the 14 collected dead birds have tested negative for H5 infection. The infected swan may have contracted the disease over a month ago as it had been dead for at least 3 weeks when found. There is the possibility it died on route from Ruegen and was washed ashore. Otherwise it was part of a community of swans that live in the Bay of Montrose. Ornithologists know that about 10-30 birds arrive from mainland Europe each year. Austria: Austria is testing commercial poultry for bird flu at a farm in southern Austria after a suspicious rise in mortality among the birds, the country's Health Ministry said in a statement late on Saturday. Czech Republic: A 10 th swan has died of bird flu from the same region in South Bohemia. Protective measures are also having an impact in Austria. Josef Duben, of the Veterinary Administration said joint EU regulations are helping fight the disease in border areas. Egypt: Two young sisters aged 18 months and 6 years have gone home seemingly cured from bird flu announced the Health Ministry in Kafr Al-Sheik. The girl\u2019s home had several chickens die recently and they were admitted to hospital on Aril 1 st . As if the country didn\u2019t have enough problems with bird flu, an outbreak of Foot and Mouth in cattle in eight governates has been announced. These are Cairo, Alexandria, Ismailiya, the Fayoum, el-Menoufiya, Damietta, el- Beheira and el-Daqahliya. About 18 million cattle are threatened. Myanmar: The situation is more serious than originally thought, FAO\u2019s representative He Changchui told a news conference in Bangkok. 100 outbreaks have been detected up to now mainly in the provinces Mandalay and Sagaing where the first outbreaks were announced March 13 th . Since then 500,000 birds have been slaughtered in 400 farms. The country lacks diagnostic equipment and protective clothing. FAO and WHO teams are arriving to help but the government is suspicious of international interference and general public awareness is poor. Vietnam: Bird flu has been detected on three farms in Cao Bang province near the Chinese border. 30 birds died of the disease and the rest culled. This follows interception of infected smuggled poultry from across the border last week. Birds are 10 times cheaper across the border. Niger: Culling of poultry began on Sunday nearly one month after the first outbreak. 46 villages around Magaria were sealed off and officials in protective suits entered. 1918 Pandemic (source: Taubenberger & CDC): There was no precursor outbreak of avian flu in birds prior to the human outbreak. The pandemic came in three distinct waves. The first wave in the spring seems to have originated in Kansas US and spread via US army camps to France and then to civilian populations by July. The first wave was relatively mild. Somewhere in the late summer, perhaps in the overcrowded troop encampments in France the virus mutated and became much more deadly. A second wave appeared almost simultaneously across the world, being reintroduced back into the USA via Boston, killing up to 50 million people worldwide from October to December. The H1N1 virus responsible was an avian-like virus, which was new to the human population. However all influenza pandemics since then have been caused by descendants of it and direct descendants still circulate in the pig population.

        "Avian Flu Situation Reports Avian Flu \u2013 Key Developments 11-Apr-06 09:00 SES Unit, IPSC, Joint Research Centre Egypt: Authorities have announced another human case of H5N1. She is an 18 year old girl from the northern governorate of Menufiya. She had recently been handled infected poultry before being hospitalised. Her condition is stable. So far there have been 12 reported cases in Egypt. Netherlands: The Dutch Agriculture Ministry plans to lift an order on May 1 on keeping poultry and backyard birds indoors as the main migratory season is ending and in previous years the virus becomes less contagious in the summer. Czech Republic : Experts are hopeful that the infected swans are from a single flock in South Bohemia. 3 swans have now tested positive for H5N1 at the EU lab in Weybridge. China: A 41 year old woman from Guangzhou, is being tested for bird flu after falling ill with pneumonia like symptoms. She is runs a vegetable stall close to the live chicken market in the city which is the capitol of Guangdong province. WHO were informed of the case on March 30. Meanwhile the China\u2019s chief Vet reports that there have been no reported outbreaks of bird flu for 44 days. A total of 35 outbreaks since 2005 infecting some 200,000 birds have occurred, he said. Another 22.4 million birds have been culled in containment efforts. A policy of mass vaccination of poultry has also been followed. Indonesia: WHO tests at CDC in America have confirmed H5N1 infection in the 23 year old poultry worker being treated at M. Djamil hospital in Padang. He becomes the country\u2019s 33 official case. rd Africa: \u201cThere are no confirmed human cases of avian flu virus infection in West Africa but this is not a reason to say there are human case,\" says Honore Meda, a WHO medical officer at a seminar in Nairobi. Weak health care and poor reporting may be hiding human cases she says. UK: Evidence of disagreement between the country\u2019s top experts emerged after chief Scientist Sir David King told national TV \u201cIt is a question of if, not when. It is not inevitable we will have a human pandemic.\" This contradicts a much reported earlier statement from UK\u2019s chief Medical Officer Sir Liam Donaldson who said \u201cit was a question of \"when, not if\" a pandemic will strike. 1918 - Where did it start? : There have been 3 proposals over the years. 1) China where outbreaks of flu and pulmonary disease early in 1918 were reported, but there is no evidence they spread further and may have been misdiagnosed with pneumonic plague. Earlier pandemics and those since can be traced to origins in Asia, but 1918 was different. 2) An outbreak of purulent bronchitis in 1916/17 at UK troop encampments at Etaples in France proposed by J.S. Oxford (see report: 14/03). However, there is no direct evidence it spread beyond the camp at the time. 3) Haskell County, Kansas a small farming community of 1,720 persons in US. In late January an influenza outbreak started hitting the young and healthy and people started dying. The outbreak in Haskell stopped abruptly in late March but by then young men had probably passed the infection to the local army base at Funston. By March 24, 1100 men were hospitalised and thousands more sick. Other bases in US reported outbreaks, and mortality rates increased in 30 major cities by April \u2013 the first wave. By then this first outbreak had moved to France and the millions of soldiers based there peaking and then fading. The second deadly wave seems to have originated in France in late summer. It returned to the US through ports (Boston and New York) and through the rail network. Simultaneously, it exploded all around the world perhaps due to regular troop movements. India was particularly badly affected with many millions dying. The three pandemic waves in one year remain unprecedented and still leaves many questions unanswered.

Any opinions to the contrary are of course welcomed. Azerbaijan: Tests conducted at a WHO collaborating laboratory in the United Kingdom have retrospectively identified an additional human case of H5N1 infection. The case is a 17-year-old girl who developed symptoms on 11 March. Her 15 year old cousin fell ill the same day and also recovered from the same Daikyand settlement in Salyan, where 7 of the now 8 official cases occurred. Sweden: A wild duck in \u00c5hus in Sk\u00e5ne has been found to be contaminated with H5 bird flu. The area is close to S\u00f6lvesborg, where the virus has been found previously. An EU protective zone has been imposed. UK: Fears of bird flu outbreaks are subsiding after DNA tests reveal the swan positive for H5N1 was a migratory \u201cwhooper\u201d from northern Europe. Experts believe it probably came from Germany and died near the Scottish coast as it struggled to reach land. Unless other birds emerge, they are hoping that this is a one-off case. A Swedish scientist Dr Olsen has claimed that DEFRA tests on birds may be flawed as so few (0.06%) of tested UK birds carry common forms of flu. Other countries normally find about 6%, he claims. Czech Republic: Agriculture Minister Ml\u00e1dek threatened to ban imports of poultry from EU member states after an influx of cheap poultry from Italy has affected local farmers and dropped the price by 50%. Poultry consumption by Czech consumers is largely unaffected. Gaza: WHO reports that there have been outbreaks at eight poultry farms, and 340,000 birds have been culled. The situation in Israel is stable and Jordan seems to have eliminated the disease after culling 20,000 birds at the single outbreak at a farm in Ajloon. Nigeria: The Government plans to close 76 poultry farms in Kaduna State due to poor sanitary procedures. The surveillance team in the area have discovered and culled 45,000 chickens infected with bird flu and will fumigate registered chicken markets. They plan to pay compensation to victims by the end of April. 1918 Pandemic - How did it start ? : Wild waterfowl which were collected by the Smithsonian Museum and preserved in Formaldehyde between 1916 and 1918 have been recently been studied (see: Journal of Virology, August 2002, p. 7860-7862). A bird from 1917 was found to be infected with a virus of the same haemagglutinin (ie. the \u201cH\u201d in H1 or H5) subtype as that of the 1918 pandemic virus. However researchers found that it was closer to the modern avian flu viruses than it was to the 1918 strain. This implies little drift (natural mutation) in avian sequences over the past 85 years and that the 1918 pandemic virus therefore did not acquire its HA directly from a bird. But the farming community in Kansas (assuming it was the original source), raised many pigs, and pigs can be infected by both bird and human flu at the same time. Some experts believe that genetically stable flu viruses reside harmlessly in birds, but that occasionally one of these bird viruses consequently can infects pigs. The swine immune system attacks the virus, forcing it to evolve genetically to survive. If it then spreads to humans, the result could be devastating. Pigs can also be infected by both human and bird viruses simultaneously and it has also been proposed that a process called Viral Shift (interchange of one of the 8 RNA segments) between two separate viruses in a single cell could be the trigger. The host for this process could also be a person instead of a pig. Although much of this is still just speculation it does imply that birds are not the only threat. Two interesting facts are that a) only during the second (and not the first) wave did pigs become sick, and b) people infected in the first spring wave were reportedly immune to the second. Flu virus is 50-120 nm in diameter Information Source: EMM news monitoring 83 ",

IPSC has provided Commission Services, Council SitCen, ECDC and FAO with a daily situation report on the spread of Avian Flu from January to April 2006. This covered the critical period when the disease spread to Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The situation reports were written based on media reports automatically filtered by the JRC Europe Media Monitor. These reports were backed up by rapid mapping and geocoding services of IPSC and the MediSys automated intelligence gathering. In August 2005 JRC were asked to prepare a briefing note on Avian Flu. This earlier report exploited EMM long term archive of News and covers the period from first detection in 1997 until August 2005. It has now been extended to cover the period until the daily reports begin. An update to this report covers the period until the daily reports begin. An update to this report covers the period from August to the outbreaks in Turkey. seriousness of the situation in Turkey triggered the daily reports. All these reports are included in this overview document. At the time of writing a weekly report is being produced as there is a noticeable downturn in reported cases. Flu veracity normally falls in summer. This work also led to a study of available literature study concerning the 1918 influenza pandemic, whose devastating effects underlies current concern about the spread of H5N1 Avian Flu.
