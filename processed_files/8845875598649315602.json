Condemns the campaigns carried out via the \u2018patriotic education\u2019 approach, including measures to stage-manage Tibetan Buddhist monasteries; is concerned that China\u2019s criminal law is being abused to persecute Tibetans and Buddhists, whose religious activities are equated with \u2018separatism\u2019; deplores the fact that the environment for practising Buddhism in Tibet has worsened significantly after the Tibetan protests of March 2008, with the Chinese Government adopting a more pervasive approach to \u2018patriotic education\u2019; C 158/4 EN Official Journal of the European Union 30.4.2021 Thursday 18 April 2019 ",

Underlines that while in their joint statement issued after the 21st EU-China Summit, the EU and China reaffirmed that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated, the EU should urge China to act accordingly; deplores the fact that at the EU-China Summit of 9 April 2019 urgent human rights concerns once again played a marginal role; takes the view that if and when EU-China summit language is weak on human rights, the Council, the European External Action Service (EEAS) and the Commission should decline to include it at all and issue a separate communication on the topic with a meaningful assessment both of the situation and why stronger language could not be agreed; 13. Calls on EU Member States to prevent any activities undertaken by the Chinese authorities in the EU\u2019s territory to harass members of Turkic communities, Tibetans and other religious or ethnic groups in order to compel them to act as informants, to force their return to China or silence them; 14.
