        "Key figures on enlargement countries \u2014 2019 edition 3 Abstract Key figures on enlargement countries \u2014 2019 edition The 2019 edition of Key figures on enlargement countries presents up-to-date series of key statistical data for five candidate countries and two potential candidates. The candidate countries, at the time of writing, were: Montenegro, North Macedonia, Albania, Serbia and Turkey, while the potential candidates were Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo (this designation is without prejudice to positions on status, and is in line with UNSCR 1244/1999 and the ICJ Opinion on the Kosovo Declaration of Independence). The tables, figures and associated commentary and methodological notes concern key social, economic and environmental themes for which data are collected annually from the enlargement countries through a series of harmonised questionnaires or as part of Eurostat\u2019s regular collection of data on demography, national accounts, international trade and energy statistics. Most tables and figures in the publication are followed by data codes, which link directly to the associated tables within Eurostat\u2019s free dissemination database (Eurobase): the codes generally contain data for the European Union (EU), the individual EU Member States, EFTA countries and in some cases for some or all of the enlargement countries.

        "Introduction Key figures on enlargement countries \u2014 2019 edition 8 Policy background The European Union\u2019s (EU\u2019s) enlargement policy concerns the EU\u2019s relations with countries which aspire to become EU Member States. There are strict conditions for membership of the EU, whereby new members are only admitted when they have clearly demonstrated they are capable of assuming all of the obligations that are linked to membership. Indeed, there are 35 different policy chapters, which together define all of the standards and rules (the so-called \u2018acquis\u2019) that are associated with EU membership. Some of the most important policies relate to the rule of law, freedom of expression and media, civil society, regional cooperation and economic governance. The Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA) is the means by which the EU supports reforms in the enlargement countries. IPA funds may be seen as an investment in the future of both the enlargement countries and the EU itself. They help the beneficiaries make political and economic reforms, which should provide their citizens with better opportunities. The second IPA framework for pre-accession assistance covers the period from 2014\u20132020 and has a dedicated budget of EUR 11.7 billion.

The ESS is based on the harmonisation of statistical concepts, methodologies, definitions and methods which enable the collection of reliable, robust and comparable statistics among EU Member States, EFTA and enlargement countries. Eurostat shares its expertise with non-member countries within the framework of international statistical cooperation activities \u2014 supporting, upgrading and enhancing the statistical systems of these non-member countries. The beneficiaries of this support include: \u2022 EU enlargement countries (candidate countries and potential candidates); \u2022 European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) countries \u2022 in the ENP-East area; \u2022 and in the ENP-South area; \u2022 African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries; \u2022 Latin American countries; \u2022 Asian countries.

        "Introduction Key figures on enlargement countries \u2014 2019 edition 9 For more information, see: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/ Statistical_cooperation_-_introduction STATISTICAL COOPERATION WITH THE ENLARGEMENT COUNTRIES Reliable and comparable statistics are a precondition for a successful accession process. The EU acquis in the field of statistics requires the existence of a statistical infrastructure based on principles such as professional independence, objectivity, impartiality, commitment to quality, reliability, transparency, confidentiality of individual data and equal access of official statistical data for all users. The EU acquis also covers methodology, classifications and procedures for data collection. Little transposition into national legislation is needed as the majority of the EU acquis takes the form of regulations which are directly applicable in EU Member States. Official statistics play a triple role in the enlargement process: \u2022 the EU acquis (Chapter 18) defines the harmonisation of statistics with EU standards and rules which have to be achieved in the pre- accession period; \u2022 they serve other EU policy areas by providing data for monitoring changes and assessing the impact of policies chosen; \u2022 they provide statistical indicators for monitoring the implementation of the IPA programmes. Eurostat monitors the compliance of national statistical systems with the EU acquis in the field of statistics. Eurostat also provides technical assistance and support to national statistical authorities and other producers of official statistics. Some instruments \u2014 statistical training courses, traineeships, study visits, management training, and participation in meetings within the ESS \u2014 aim to reinforce human skills in enlargement countries. In addition, Eurostat conducts peer reviews and adapted global assessments of the statistical systems in the enlargement countries. While basic principles and institutional frameworks for producing statistics are already in place, the enlargement countries are expected to increase the volume and quality of their data progressively and to transmit these data to Eurostat in the context of the EU\u2019s enlargement process. The final objective of the EU in relation to official statistics is to obtain harmonised, high-quality data that conform to both European and international standards. Eurostat collects data on an annual basis and this exercise also provides an opportunity to offer methodological recommendations to enlargement countries. Eurostat plays a key role in improving transparency for the enlargement countries by publishing data, both in publications such as this one and through its free dissemination database (Eurobase). ",
        "Introduction Key figures on enlargement countries \u2014 2019 edition 10 Reading guide PUBLICATION STRUCTURE The main body of Key figures on enlargement countries \u2014 2019 edition contains tables, figures, commentary and explanations structured into 13 chapters covering statistics on a variety of topics: population; living conditions; health; education and training; the labour market; economy and finance; international trade in goods; agriculture, forestry and fishing; business; science, technology and digital society; transport; energy; and the environment. SPATIAL COVERAGE Table 1 provides an overview of a number of key indicators for each enlargement country: the number of inhabitants, the size of each economy (as measured by GDP) and the average standard of living (as measured by GDP per capita). TIMELINESS The data presented in this publication were collected from the enlargement countries during winter 2018/19 or extracted from Eurobase in March 2019. As Eurobase is updated regularly, some data in this publication may have been revised already. The accompanying text was drafted in March 2019.

The publication of these data does not constitute the expression of an opinion by the European Commission on the legal status of a country or territory or on the delimitation of its borders. Data for enlargement countries are collected for a wide range of indicators each year through a questionnaire that is sent by Eurostat to the enlargement countries. A network of contacts in each enlargement country has been established for updating these questionnaires, generally within the national statistical offices, but potentially including representatives of other data-producing organisations (for example, central banks, finance and other government ministries). The vast majority of the statistics on enlargement countries that are included in this publication are freely available through the following link: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/ web/enlargement-countries/data/database. In several areas the regular collection by Eurostat of data has been expanded beyond EU Member States and EFTA countries to also include enlargement countries. Consequently, in 2016 it was decided to stop collecting ",
        "Introduction Key figures on enlargement countries \u2014 2019 edition 11 demography statistics, national accounts and energy statistics through the aforementioned questionnaires and instead to use data from these regular subject-specific data collection exercises, as was already the case for statistics on international trade in goods. As such, the data presented in this publication for these subject areas \u2014 demography, national accounts, international trade in goods and energy \u2014 are generally sourced from the same data tables as those containing information for the EU and its Member States. These statistics are also freely available on-line through the following link: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database. EUROSTAT DATA CODE Data codes have been inserted after most tables and figures to help readers access the most recent data on the Eurostat website: the data codes link directly to the associated tables within Eurobase. The codes generally contain the data for the EU as well as data for individual EU Member States and EFTA countries in most cases and in some cases for some or all of the enlargement countries. In the PDF version of this publication, data codes under the tables and figures are presented as internet hyperlinks. The data on Eurostat\u2019s website are frequently updated and may therefore differ from those presented in this publication and often contain more detailed data. Exchange rates For some indicators, monetary values were provided by the enlargement countries in national currency terms. In these cases, Eurostat converted the series using exchange rates (annual averages for the reference year in question) so that data for all indicators are denominated in the same currency. While the conversion to a common currency unit facilitates comparisons of data between countries, it is important to understand that changes in exchange rates are partially responsible for movements identified when looking at the development of a time series for an indicator that is denominated in euro. Table 2 provides information on the annual average exchange rates between the euro and the enlargement currencies for the period 2008-2018. Note that Montenegro and Kosovo both employ the euro as their de facto domestic currency.

Source: Eurostat (online data code: demo_gind) Population size Eurostat collects data from EU Member States and other countries participating in its demography data collection exercise in relation to the population as of 1 January each year (or, in some cases, on 31 December of the previous year). The recommended definition is the \u2018usual resident population\u2019 and represents the number of inhabitants of a given area. Statistics on population change and the structure of population are increasingly used to support policymaking and provide an opportunity to monitor demographic behaviour within an economic, social and cultural context. The combined population of the enlargement countries was estimated to be just below 99 million inhabitants in 2018 (see Table 1.1), which was equivalent to slightly less than one fifth (19.3 %) of the EU-28 total (512 million persons). Turkey was by far the largest enlargement country, with a population of 81 million inhabitants in 2018, just lower than the population of Germany (83 million), but higher than in any other EU Member State. By contrast, Montenegro was the smallest enlargement country in population terms, with a population of 622 thousand inhabitants, somewhat smaller than the population of Cyprus (864 thousand), but larger than those of Luxembourg (602 thousand) or Malta (476 thousand). The development of the number of inhabitants within the enlargement countries followed a varied pattern during the period 2008-2018. The population of Turkey increased at a relatively rapid pace, growing by 14.5 % overall during the period under consideration, while the number of inhabitants in North Macedonia and Montenegro grew at a modest pace, increasing by 1.5 % and 1.1 % respectively; this was slower than the corresponding rate of change in the EU-28, where the population grew overall by 2.4 %. There were relatively small contractions in the level of population in Albania (down 3.0 %) and Serbia (down 4.9 %; note that there is a break in series), while the number of inhabitants contracted by 8.9 % in Bosnia and Herzegovina and by 16.5 % in Kosovo; note there were two breaks in series as regards population data for Kosovo, with annual growth in almost every year before and after these breaks.

Source: Eurostat (online data code: tps00003) Population density provides information on the average number of inhabitants per square kilometre (km\u00b2). Among the enlargement countries, the highest ratio in 2017 was recorded in Kosovo, 164.9 inhabitants per km\u00b2. Kosovo was the only enlargement country with a population density ratio that was higher than the EU-28 average, which stood at 117.7 inhabitants per km\u00b2 (see Figure 1.1). By contrast, the lowest population density among the enlargement countries was recorded in Montenegro (which also had the lowest number of inhabitants), with a ratio of 45.1 inhabitants per km\u00b2 in 2017. There were more women than men living in the EU-28 in 2018 (see Table 1.2): the difference between the sexes was relatively small, as there were 1 045 women for every 1 000 men. Among the enlargement countries, the ratio of women to 1 000 men peaked at 1 053 in Serbia, while Kosovo (2017 data) and Montenegro also reported that women accounted for the majority of their population; no recent data are available for Bosnia and Herzegovina, but older data indicate that women were also in the majority in this country. The male population was slightly larger than the female population in Turkey, Albania and North Macedonia, where ratios of 994-997 women per 1 000 men were recorded.

( 1 ) 2017. Source: Eurostat (online data code: demo_pjangroup) Population age structure The EU-28 population is ageing as consistently low birth rates and higher life expectancy transform the shape of its age pyramid. As a result, the proportion of young people (aged less than 15 years) and the proportion of working age people (aged 15-64 years) is shrinking, while the relative share of those aged 65 years and over is expanding. In 2018, the working-age population accounted for less than two thirds (64.7 %) of the total population of the EU-28 and a similar \u2014 but slightly larger \u2014 share in each of the enlargement countries (see Figure 1.2): the lowest share was 65.7 % in Serbia and the highest share was 69.9 % in North Macedonia. By contrast, the relative importance of those age groups who are often referred to as dependents varied considerably. For example, in the EU-28, North Macedonia, Albania and Montenegro, people aged less than 15 years accounted for 16-18 % of the total population in 2018, while in Serbia their share was lower, at 14.4 %. The share of younger persons was closer to one quarter of the total population in Turkey (23.6 %) and Kosovo (25.0 %; 2017 data). Conversely, less than one tenth of the population in Kosovo (2017 data) and Turkey were aged 65 years and over, while this share averaged 19.7 % in the EU-28 and peaked among the remaining enlargement countries at 19.9 % in Serbia.

        "1 Population Key figures on enlargement countries \u2014 2019 edition 17 Age dependency ratios Age dependency ratios compare the size of the age groups that are generally economically inactive \u2014 children and older people \u2014 with the size of the working-age population. In 2018, the total dependency ratio (the sum of children and older people compared with the number of working age people) was 54.6 % in the EU-28; in other words, there were slightly less than two people of working age to maintain the upbringing and social expenditure required by each economically dependent person. Total dependency ratios in the enlargement countries ranged from a high of 52.1 % in Serbia down to 43.1 % in North Macedonia. Serbia was the only enlargement country to record a total dependency ratio that was above 50.0 % (as in the EU-28). There are considerable differences in age structures between enlargement countries which impact upon the analysis of total dependency ratios. For example, in Kosovo there is a relatively young population structure, whereas in Serbia the population structure is more similar to that of the EU-28, with a considerably lower young-age dependency ratio and a considerably higher old-age dependency ratio. In 2018, the old-age dependency ratio ranged across the enlargement countries from 12.1 % in Kosovo (2017 data) to 22.0 % in Montenegro, with the ratio in Serbia well above this range at 30.3 %. As such, none of the enlargement countries recorded an old-age dependency ratio that was as high as the EU-28 average, which stood at 30.5 % (see Figure 1.3). By contrast, young-age dependency ratios ranged from a high of 37.5 % in Kosovo (2017 data) down to 21.8 % in Serbia, with Serbia and North Macedonia the only enlargement countries to record young-age dependency ratios that were lower than the EU-28 average of 24.1 %. These differences in age structures may result in pressures on various public services, for example, national educational systems in those countries with a relatively high proportion of young persons and care (including healthcare) and pension systems in those countries characterised as having relatively high proportions of older persons.

Source: Eurostat (online data code: demo_gind) Birth and death rates The crude birth rate (or crude death rate) is the ratio of the number of births (deaths) during the year to the average population in that year; the value is expressed per 1 000 inhabitants. If the crude birth rate exceeds the crude death rate then there is natural population growth. The crude birth rate in the enlargement countries peaked in Kosovo at 16.8 per 1 000 inhabitants in 2017, which was roughly 70 % higher than in the EU-28 (see Table 1.3). Turkey (16.1 births per 1 000 inhabitants) also recorded a relatively high crude birth rate, while Montenegro, Albania and North Macedonia each recorded rates that were slightly above the EU-28 average. Crude birth rates in Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina were below the EU-28 average, particularly so in the latter, where an average of 8.3 births were recorded for every 1 000 inhabitants. Serbia recorded the highest crude death rate among the enlargement countries, at 14.8 per 1 000 inhabitants in 2017; this appears not to have been an exceptional value as it was in keeping with the rates registered in 2007 (13.9 per 1 000 inhabitants) and 2012 (14.2 per 1 000 inhabitants). Along with Serbia, Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina recorded crude death rates that were higher than the EU-28 average (10.3 per 1 000 inhabitants), although in Montenegro and in Bosnia and Herzegovina the latest rates were very close to the EU-28 average. By contrast, the lowest crude death rates in 2017 \u2014 about half the EU-28 average \u2014 were recorded in Turkey (5.3 per 1 000 inhabitants) and Kosovo (5.4 per 1 000 inhabitants). ",
        "1 Population Key figures on enlargement countries \u2014 2019 edition 19 Fertility rates Fertility is the ability to conceive (become pregnant) and give birth to children. The total fertility rate is defined as the mean number of children who would be born to a woman during her lifetime, if she were to spend her childbearing years conforming to the age- specific fertility rates that have been measured in a given year. Turkey was the only enlargement country to record a total fertility rate around the replacement rate (developed countries are thought to need a fertility rate of around 2.1 children per woman in order to maintain their population levels). In 2017, the total fertility rate in Turkey stood at 2.07 (see Table 1.4). The fertility rate in Turkey remained relatively stable, fluctuating between 2.03 and 2.17 children per woman throughout the period 2007-2017, with the most recent low recorded in 2011 and the most recent peak in 2014. Aside from Turkey, fertility rates in Montenegro and Kosovo (2016 data) were also above the average for the EU-28 (1.59 children per woman) in 2017, reaching 1.78 and 1.66 respectively. By contrast, the lowest fertility rate among the enlargement countries (no data available for Bosnia and Herzegovina) was observed in North Macedonia (1.43 children per woman).

Life expectancy at birth rose rapidly during the last century due to a number of factors, including: reductions in infant mortality; rising living standards; improved lifestyles; better education; advances in healthcare and medicine. In 2017, life expectancy in the enlargement countries ranged from a low of 75.6 years in Serbia to values in the range of 78.5-78.6 years in Turkey, Albania and Kosovo (2016 data), compared with 80.9 years in the EU-28.

Source: Eurostat (online data code: demo_minfind) Infant mortality rates The infant mortality rate is defined as the ratio of the number of deaths of children under one year of age to the number of live births in the reference year; the value is expressed per 1 000 live births. Most women in the developed world give birth in hospital, where a range of technologies are available to help monitor and assist with childbirth; there has been a relatively rapid decline in infant mortality rates in recent years. This pattern was most apparent among the enlargement countries in Turkey, Kosovo and Montenegro (see Figure 1.6). Between 2006 and 2016, infant mortality rates in Montenegro and Turkey more than halved: in Montenegro the rate fell by 7.6 deaths per 1 000 live births (down 69 %) while in Turkey it fell by 14.5 deaths per 1 000 live births (down 59 %). Infant mortality rates fell by just over a quarter in Kosovo and Serbia. North Macedonia and Albania recorded higher infant mortality rates in 2016 than in 2006. For comparison, the infant mortality rate in the EU-28 fell by 22 % overall during the period under consideration. The infant mortality rate in the EU-28 was 3.6 deaths per 1 000 live births in 2016. Montenegro was the only enlargement country which recorded an infant mortality rate (3.4 deaths per 1 000 live births) that was below the average for the EU-28. Infant mortality rates in North Macedonia (11.9 births per 1 000 live births) were more than three times as high as in the EU-28, while in Turkey, Albania and Kosovo they were more than twice as high.

        "1 Population Key figures on enlargement countries \u2014 2019 edition 22 Population change Total population change may be decomposed into two primary components: the crude rate of natural population change and the crude rate of net migration. As noted above, the former may be calculated by subtracting the crude death rate from the crude birth rate with a positive result implying that the natural rate of population change is increasing. In recent years, the EU-28 crude birth rate was generally slightly higher than the crude death rate, resulting in a modest level of natural population increase. However, in 2017 the EU-28 crude birth rate was 0.4 per 1 000 inhabitants lower than its crude death rate; as such, the natural rate of population change was negative. Among the enlargement countries, differences between these two rates tended to be wider (see Figure 1.7); this was particularly the case in Kosovo and Turkey, where crude birth rates were considerably higher than crude death rates, with the natural rate of population change reaching 11.4 per 1 000 inhabitants in Kosovo and 10.8 per 1 000 inhabitants in Turkey. By contrast, crude death rates in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia exceeded crude birth rates (as in the EU-28), and as a result the natural rate of population change fell by 2.0 per 1 000 inhabitants in Bosnia and Herzegovina and by 5.5 per 1 000 inhabitants in Serbia.

In the face of relatively low crude birth rates, natural decreases in population numbers, and a gradually ageing society with an increasing share of elderly persons, some countries have maintained their (working-age) populations through migratory flows. In 2017, the EU-28\u2019s crude rate of net migration was 2.3 per 1 000 inhabitants, slightly lower than it had been in 2007 (when it was 3.1 per 1 000 inhabitants). The pattern in the enlargement countries was less clear, with three recording negative rates as higher numbers of people left their territories (compared with the numbers arriving). In 2017, the crude rate of net migration was positive in Turkey (1.6 per 1 000 inhabitants), while there was no (or almost no) change in population as a result of migratory flows in North Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina or Serbia. The three remaining enlargement countries reported a negative rate of net migration, with a relatively high ratio of emigrants from Albania (net migration of \u2212 5.2 per 1 000 inhabitants) and, to a lesser extent, Montenegro and Kosovo. Acquisition of citizenship and asylum Two other issues related to migration are presented in Figures 1.8 and 1.9, namely the acquisition of citizenship and asylum. A residence permit represents an authorisation issued by the competent authorities of a country allowing nationals of non-member (non-EU) countries (also known as third country nationals) to stay for at least three months on its territory. Figure 1.8 indicates how many first residence permits were issued each year between 2008 and 2017 by EU Member States to citizens of enlargement countries. For citizens of all enlargement countries combined, the total number of such permits fell at the beginning of this period, down from 257 thousand in 2008 to 153 thousand in 2011. Thereafter, there was a steady increase in the number of first permits issued to citizens of enlargement countries, to reach 240 thousand by 2017. While a similar pattern can be seen in most of the individual enlargement countries, the total (for all countries combined) was dominated by the number of permits issued to citizens of two countries, namely Turkey and Albania, and for the latter the ",

Focusing on the latest information available, 28 % of the first residence permits issued in 2017 to citizens of enlargement countries were for Turkish citizens and 22 % for Albanians. Between 11 % and 17 % were for citizens of Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Kosovo, while 7 % were for Macedonians and 1 % for Montenegrins. Asylum applications in the EU from citizens of the seven enlargement countries increased from 42 thousand in 2011 to a peak of 204 thousand in 2015, before declining to 63 thousand by 2018 (see Figure 1.9). With the exception of Turkish citizens, this increase and subsequent decline was observed for citizens of all enlargement countries, with particularly large peaks in 2015 among citizens of Kosovo and Albania. The development for Turkish citizens was quite different, with a stable, relatively small (particularly given the overall population of Turkey) number of asylum applications from Turkish citizens between 2011 and 2015, with this number more than doubling between 2015 and 2016 and again between 2016 and 2018. Whereas Turkish citizens accounted for 15 % of all asylum applications in the EU from citizens of enlargement countries in 2011 this share had risen to 36 % by 2018. In 2018, Albanians made up the second largest group of asylum applicants from enlargement countries, with a 35 % share of the total, followed at some distance by Serbians, Kosovars and Macedonians with shares between 7 % and 10 %.

Source: Eurostat (online data code: ilc_di11) Income distribution The income quintile share ratio, also known as the S80/S20 ratio, is a measure of the inequality of income distribution. It is calculated as the ratio of total income received by the 20 % of the population with the highest income (the top quintile) to that received by the 20 % of the population with the lowest income (the bottom quintile); incomes are equivalised to take account of the varying composition of households. Figure 2.1 shows that the income of the top population quintile in the EU-28 was 5.1 times the size of the income of the bottom population quintile in 2017. All four candidate countries for which recent data are available reported a higher degree of income inequality than that observed in the EU-28: the ratio stood at 6.4 in North Macedonia, and reached 9.4 in Serbia. During the five-year period shown in Figure 2.1, the income quintile share ratio rose slightly in the EU-28 from 5.0 to 5.1 (2012-2017). There was a far more rapid increase in income inequality in Serbia, where this ratio rose from 8.6 to 9.4 (2013-2017). By contrast, the distribution of income in Turkey (2012-2016) and Montenegro became somewhat more equitable, as the income quintile share ratio fell by 0.7 and 0.9 respectively.

It shows the extent to which all incomes within the population differ from the average income: the closer the coefficient is to 100 the less equal are the incomes, while the closer it is to 0 the more equal are the incomes. In the EU-28, the Gini coefficient in 2017 was 30.7 (see Figure 2.2). As already observed for the income quintile share ratio, Gini coefficients for North Macedonia (32.5), Montenegro (36.7), Serbia (37.8) and Turkey (42.6; 2016 data) were also higher than the ratio observed for the EU-28. Recent data are also available for Bosnia and Herzegovina which reported a Gini coefficient (31.2; 2015 data) that was the lowest among the enlargement countries, but still slightly above the value in the EU-28. Note that there was a lower ratio in Albania (27.1), although this ratio relates to 2012 and there is no more recent information available. Serbia (2013-2017), Turkey (2012-2016) and the EU-28 reported little change in their Gini coefficients between the two years shown in Figure 2.2 (as the coefficient changed by \u00b1 0.2). Elsewhere, the Gini coefficient fell, most notably in North Macedonia (down 6.3). Poverty and social exclusion The risk of poverty or social exclusion is not dependent strictly on a household\u2019s level of income, but may also reflect joblessness, low work intensity, working status, or a range of socio- economic issues. The number or share of people who are at risk of poverty or social exclusion combines three separate measures and covers persons who are in at least one of three situations: persons who are at risk of poverty; persons who suffer from severe material deprivation; persons living in a household with very low work intensity. In 2017, 22.4 % of the population in the EU-28 were at risk of poverty or social exclusion (see Figure 2.3). Four of the enlargement countries have data for this indicator, with values ranging from 33.6 % in Montenegro to 45.0 % in Turkey (2016 data); the proportion in Montenegro was therefore approximately 50 % above that in the EU-28 while the proportion in Turkey was double the EU-28 average.

Figure 2.4 and Table 2.1 focus on the risk of poverty. To calculate the total net income of each household the income received by all the members of the household from all sources is added together. For each person, the equivalised total net income is calculated as the household\u2019s total net income divided by the equivalised household size, the latter generally based on the modified OECD scale: a weight of 1.0 for the first adult, 0.5 for other persons aged 14 years or over who are living in the household and 0.3 for each child aged less than 14 years. Poverty thresholds are set at 60 % of national median equivalised disposable income (after social transfers). These thresholds are set independently for each country: as such, the indicator reflects low income in comparison with other residents of the same country, which does not necessarily imply a low standard of living. The at-risk-of-poverty rate is the proportion of the population with an equivalised disposable income below the at-risk-of-poverty threshold; it can be calculated either before or after social transfers, reflecting the share of the population that is moved above the threshold as a result of receiving social transfers. In the EU-28, more than two fifths (43.8 %) of the population were at risk of poverty before social transfers in 2017, with this share dropping to one sixth (16.9 %) of the population once the impact of social transfers was taken into account. At-risk- of-poverty rates before and after social transfers are available for three candidate countries, all of which reported rates before transfers that were below that of the EU-28 and rates after transfers that were above that of the EU-28 \u2014 see ",

In Montenegro and North Macedonia the proportion of people aged 0-17 years living in households with very low work intensity was higher than the equivalent proportion for people aged 18-59 years, while the reverse was true in Serbia and Turkey (2016 data). In Turkey (2016 data), the proportions were broadly similar to those observed in the EU-28, albeit with somewhat higher rates for people of working age and lower rates for those aged 0-17 years. Elsewhere the proportions were considerably higher than in the EU-28: in North Macedonia close to one in five (19.4 %) people aged 0-17 years were living in households with very low work intensity as were nearly one in six (16.0 %) people of working age; in Serbia both proportions were close to one fifth.

Source: Eurostat (online data code: spr_exp_sum) Social protection Social protection systems are generally well- developed in the EU: they are designed to protect people (to some degree) against the risks and needs associated with unemployment, parental responsibilities, sickness/healthcare and invalidity/disability, old-age, housing, the loss of a spouse or parent, and other forms of social exclusion. Social protection expenditure comprises social protection benefits, administration costs and other expenditure: the data shown in Table 2.3 only concern the benefits, which consist of transfers, in cash or in kind, by social protection schemes to households and individuals to relieve them of the burden of a defined set of risks or needs. In 2016, EU-28 expenditure on social protection benefits was equivalent to more than one quarter (27.1 %) of gross domestic product (GDP). This level was higher than in any of the three enlargement countries for which data are available: in Serbia the ratio was 21.0 % (2016 data), while in Turkey (12.6 %; 2016 data) it was about half the level recorded in the EU-28 and in Kosovo (7.0 %; 2014 data) it was around one quarter of the EU-28 level. Between 2007 and 2016, the ratio of expenditure on social protection benefits to GDP increased in the EU from 24.2 % (data for the EU-25) to 27.1 % (data for the EU-28). Only for Turkey are data are available for both reference years shown in Table 2.3 and it also reported an increase in its relative share of social protection benefits, with their share rising by 1.7 percentage points between 2007 and 2016. One factor which may explain (part of) the increase in expenditure on social protection benefits is an increase in the relative importance of pensions, which may be linked (at least in part) to ageing populations. Expenditure on pensions accounted for just under half (46 %) of the total expenditure on social protection benefits in the EU-28 in 2016; in contrast, their share was over half in Serbia (56 %) and three fifths in Turkey (61 %). Between 2007 and 2016 the ratio of expenditure on pensions to GDP rose from 11.0 % (data for the EU-25) to 12.4 % (data for the EU-28), an increase of 1.4 percentage points. This ratio rose at a slower pace in percentage point terms in Turkey \u2014 the only enlargement country for which a comparison is available \u2014 as expenditure on pensions rose from 6.6 % of GDP to 7.7 % of GDP between 2007 and 2016.

Total expenditure on health concerns total current expenditure and investment on health, regardless of the source of funds (and therefore includes private as well as public expenditure). The level of health expenditure relative to gross domestic product (GDP) ranged greatly between the four enlargement countries for which recent data are available (see Table 3.1), from 1.8 % of GDP in Kosovo to 9.2 % in Bosnia and Herzegovina (2016 data). In 2016, public expenditure on health in the EU-28 was 7.9 % relative to GDP. The relative weight of public health expenditure was lower in each of the four enlargement countries for which data are available (see Table 3.1 and Figure 3.1), peaking in 2017 at 5.1 % of GDP in Serbia, with lower ratios in Turkey (3.5 %), Albania (2.9 %) and Kosovo (1.6 %; 2016 data).

Note these developments reflect changes in both health expenditure and GDP and that falling health expenditure relative to GDP does not necessarily imply a lower absolute level of health expenditure. Healthcare resources Table 3.2 provides information on specialist healthcare personnel. In 2016, there were an estimated 360 physicians per 100 000 inhabitants in the EU-28. Among the five enlargement countries for which data are available (see Table 3.1), the number of physicians relative to population size was consistently lower than in the EU-28. The highest ratios were recorded in Serbia (295 physicians per 100 000 inhabitants; 2016 data) and in Montenegro (265 physicians per 100 000 inhabitants; 2017 data). A similar analysis for dentists reveals that the EU-28 had, on average, 71 dentists per 100 000 inhabitants in 2016. This was also higher than the latest ratios recorded in any of the enlargement countries for which data are available, with Turkey recording the highest number of dentists per 100 000 inhabitants, 35 in 2017, approximately half the ratio recorded in the EU-28. Among the enlargement countries, the number of pharmacists relative to population size ranged from 13 per 100 000 inhabitants in Bosnia and Herzegovina (2016 data) to 35 per 100 000 inhabitants in Turkey, all less than half the average in the EU-28. In 2016, there was an average of 722 nursing professionals per 100 000 inhabitants in the EU-28. This figure was greater than the ratios recorded in any of the enlargement countries in 2017, with Bosnia and Herzegovina (2016 data), Montenegro and Kosovo each recording 500-600 nursing professionals per 100 000 inhabitants; much lower ratios were recorded in Turkey (206) and Serbia (82; 2016 data). Concerning midwives, the ratio in the EU-28 (38 per 100 000 inhabitants; 2016 data) was lower than that in Turkey (67 per 100 000 inhabitants) in 2017, but similar to the ratios in Montenegro, Serbia (2016 data) and Bosnia and Herzegovina (all in the range 31-37 per 100 000 inhabitants) and notably higher than in Kosovo (4 per 100 000 inhabitants).

        "3 Health Key figures on enlargement countries \u2014 2019 edition 37 Hospital discharges Figure 3.3 provides information relating to hospital discharges of in-patients; this may be used as an indicator of the level of healthcare activity in hospitals. A hospital discharge occurs when a patient is formally released after an episode of care: discharge may result from the end of their treatment, a decision by the patient to sign-out against medical advice, the patient\u2019s transfer to another healthcare institution, or because of death. In 2016, there were estimated to be 17 100 hospital discharges per 100 000 inhabitants across the EU (excluding Greece). Turkey and Kosovo had similar ratios to that recorded for the EU, with 16 965 and 16 497 hospital discharges per 100 000 inhabitants in 2017. At the other end of the range, Albania was the only enlargement country \u2014 among those for which data are available \u2014 to record a ratio below 10 000 in-patient discharges per 100 000 inhabitants. Between 2007 and 2016 (data for the latter excluding Greece) the number of in-patient hospital discharges relative to population size rose overall by an estimated 5 % in the EU-28; this may be linked, among other things, to increased longevity and a broader range of medical treatments being made available. There was also an increase in the number of hospital discharges relative to population size in the three enlargement countries for which data are available: faster rates of change than for the EU were recorded in Turkey (up overall by 37.3 % between 2007 and 2017; note however there is a break in series) and Montenegro (20.2 %), while there was a modest increase in the number of hospital discharges per 100 000 inhabitants in Serbia (1.8 %; break in series).

In 2015, the EU-28 crude death rate from suicide and intentional self-harm was 15.0 per 100 000 male inhabitants aged less than 65 years, which was approximately 3.5 times as high as the corresponding rate for women aged less than 65 years (4.3 deaths per 100 000 female inhabitants). An analysis by age reveals that EU-28 crude death rates from suicide and intentional self-harm were considerably higher for men aged 65 years and over, 28.9 deaths per 100 000 male inhabitants; this was 3.8 times as high as the corresponding rate among women aged 65 years and over (7.7 deaths per 100 000 female inhabitants). Information is available for four of the enlargement countries for 2017: this reveals that crude death rates from suicide and intentional self-harm were consistently higher in Serbia (than in the EU) for both sexes and both age groups identified in Figure 3.4; the difference was most notable for people aged 65 years and over. Crude death rates from suicide and intentional self-harm in North Macedonia were broadly in line with those recorded for the EU-28 among people aged 65 years and over, while much lower death rates were recorded for both men and women aged less than 65 years. The lowest crude death rates from suicide and intentional self-harm were recorded in Turkey and Kosovo (no information available for the latter in relation to people aged less than 65 years). ",

In 2016, there were 106 million pupils and students in the EU-28 across all levels of education. In the enlargement countries, there were approximately 29 million pupils and students enrolled in 2017 (see Table 4.1 for the latest period available for each country); this was equivalent to just over one quarter of the total number of pupils and students in the EU-28.

Within the EU-28, some 18.5 % of the overall number of pupils and students in 2016 were attending tertiary education establishments (as covered by ISCED levels 5 to 8). Across the enlargement countries the share of tertiary students was generally close to the EU-28 average, as all but two countries lay within the range of 16.7 % (North Macedonia) to 21.1 % (Serbia) in 2017; Kosovo (26.4 %) and Turkey (29.7 %) both recorded higher shares.

        "4 Education Key figures on enlargement countries \u2014 2019 edition 46 NEETs \u2014 young people not in employment, education or training The indicator on young people neither in employment nor in education or training (NEET) provides information on the transition from education to work and focuses on the number of young people who find themselves disengaged from both education and the labour market. Given that many young people continue to participate in some form of education or training into their twenties, the analysis focuses on the population aged 15-24 years. Traditionally, most young people only started work once they had completed their highest level of education or training and rarely combined education with employment. The transition into work has, in recent years, become more prolonged and increasingly unpredictable, with young people taking longer to become established in the labour market, either by choice or necessity. It has also become increasingly common to find students taking part-time or seasonal work or for young people already in employment to seek a return to education and training in order to improve their qualifications. As a result, a growing share of students work and a growing share of people in employment study. The vast majority of young people aged 15-24 years in the EU-28 remained within education and training in 2017 and consequently only one tenth (10.9 %) were NEETs (see Figure 4.5). The NEET rate was marginally higher for young women (11.2 %) than for young men (10.7 %). In all of the enlargement countries the NEET rate was clearly higher than in the EU-28, ranging from 16.7 % in Montenegro to 25.9 % in Albania and 27.4 % in Kosovo. Furthermore, with the exception of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the NEET rate was higher for women than for men in all enlargement countries (no analysis by sex available for Kosovo). By far the largest gender gap was observed in Turkey, where the NEET rate for young men was 14.6 % while for young women it was as high as 34.0 % (above the rate recorded in any of the other enlargement countries).

Source: Eurostat (online data code: trng_lfse_01) Participation in education and training Data collected through a labour force survey (LFS) provide information on the incidence of adult learning (also known as lifelong learning), defined here as the participation of adults aged 25-64 years in education and training during the four-week period preceding the survey. In general, lifelong learning encompasses all purposeful learning activities undertaken on an on-going basis with the aim of improving knowledge, skills and competences. The strategic framework for European cooperation in education and training adopted in May 2009 sets a number of benchmarks to be achieved by 2020, including one for adult participation in learning, namely that an average of at least 15 % of adults aged 25-64 years should participate in lifelong learning. In 2017, the proportion of persons aged 25-64 years in the EU-28 who had participated in education or training was 10.9 % (see Figure 4.6). The proportion of the population who had participated in adult learning was higher among women (11.8 %) than among men (10.0 %). All of the enlargement countries reported considerably lower proportions of their respective adult populations participating in lifelong learning, ranging from 0.9 % in Albania to 5.8 % in Turkey (no data available for Kosovo). Serbia as well as Bosnia and Herzegovina reported slightly higher rates for women than for men, while the reverse was true elsewhere. The gender gap among the enlargement countries was smaller (in percentage point terms) than observed in the EU-28, peaking at 0.6 percentage points in Montenegro (with a higher rate for men). ",

Source: Eurostat (online data code: lfsa_argan) Activity rates The activity rate is defined, for any given age group, as the proportion of active persons in relation to the total population of the same age. The economically active population, often referred to as the labour force, comprises employed and unemployed persons, but not the economically inactive, for example, children, students and pensioners, as well as people caring for family members; some of these may be of working-age. The labour force includes people who were not at work but had a job or business from which they were temporarily absent, for example, because of illness, holidays, industrial disputes, education or training. The EU-28 activity rate for persons aged 20-64 years was 78.0 % in 2017 (see Table 5.1), in other words just over three quarters of people aged 20-64 years were in employment or unemployed (and looking for work), with the remainder considered to be economically inactive. Activity rates in the enlargement countries were generally much lower than in the EU-28 although this was largely due to relatively low activity rates for women (see below for more details relating to gender gaps). In 2017, the overall activity rate among the enlargement countries for persons aged 20-64 years ranged from a high of 73.9 % in Albania down to 49.0 % in Kosovo. A comparison between 2007 and 2017 shows that the activity rate in the EU-28 increased by 3.1 percentage points. There was much faster growth in Turkey, where the activity rate rose by 9.2 percentage points, while the increase was slightly more than the EU-28 average in Serbia (3.3 points) although it should be noted that there are breaks in the time series. Increases between 2007 and 2017 in the activity rate were reported elsewhere (no data available for Kosovo), ranging from 1.3 points in Bosnia and Herzegovina to 2.3 points in Montenegro. ",

Female activity rates in each of the enlargement countries were much lower than in the EU-28: the data available for 2017 reveal that activity rates for women peaked at 63.6 % and 63.5 % in Serbia and Albania, while Montenegro and North Macedonia also reported that more than half of all women aged 20-64 years were either in work or available for work. At the other end of the range, the activity rate for women was less than half in Bosnia and Herzegovina (45.6 %), two fifths in Turkey (40.0 %) and between one fifth and one quarter in Kosovo (22.6 %). By contrast, activity rates for men in some of the enlargement countries were at similar levels to that recorded in the EU-28. In North Macedonia and Albania the latest activity rates for men were 84.4 % and 84.3 % in 2017, fractionally above the EU-28 average, while in Turkey the activity rate for men was 83.7 %, just 0.4 percentage points lower than the EU-28 average. Among the enlargement countries, activity rates for men were lowest in Bosnia and Herzegovina, at 71.3 %. These gender inequalities may reflect, among other factors, patriarchal family structures, the degree of female empowerment, religious beliefs, other cultural factors, lower pay for women, and difficulties in relation to access to jobs and career development for women. A comparison between activity rates for men and women in 2017 across the enlargement countries shows that the widest gender gaps were recorded in Kosovo and Turkey, where activity rates for women were 52.5 and 43.7 percentage points lower than the corresponding rates for men. Two of the enlargement countries reported gender gaps of less than 20 percentage points: Montenegro (15.3 points) and Serbia (15.2 points). ",

Source: Eurostat (online data code: lfsi_emp_a) Employment rates The EU\u2019s labour force survey defines persons in employment as those aged 15 years and over, who, during the reference week, performed some work, even for just one hour per week, for pay, profit or family gain. Employment statistics are frequently reported as employment rates to discount the changing size of countries\u2019 populations over time and to facilitate comparisons between countries of different sizes. The employment rate is defined, for any given age group, as the percentage of employed persons in relation to the total population of that same age group. These rates are typically published for the working-age population, which is generally considered to be those aged between 15 and 64 years, or those aged between 20 and 64 years (the latter ratio takes account of the generally increasing proportion of young people who remain in education beyond the period of compulsory education). One of the headline targets for the Europe 2020 strategy is to raise the EU-28 employment rate for people aged 20-64 years to 75 % by 2020. In 2017, the EU-28\u2019s employment rate was 72.2 % (see Table 5.2), some 2.8 percentage points below this headline target. Employment rates for people aged 20-64 years ranged among the enlargement countries from a high of 63.9 % in Albania down to 34.4 % in Kosovo; as such the employment rate in all of the enlargement countries was below the EU-28 average. The EU-28\u2019s employment rate was 2.4 percentage points higher in 2017 than in 2007. Subject to data availability (incomplete time series for Kosovo), employment rates in all enlargement countries except for Albania increased more between these years than in the EU. The largest increase in the employment rate (in percentage point terms) was in North Macedonia, as the latest rate of 54.8 % in 2017 was 9.8 points higher than it had been in 2007. By contrast, the employment rate in Albania was 1.2 percentage points higher in 2017 than in 2007. Despite this relatively small increase, Albania continued to record the highest employment rate among the enlargement countries in 2017. ",

Industry had the second largest workforce, with 17.2 % of the workforce, while the shares of total employment in construction (6.7 %) and in agriculture, forestry and fishing (4.2 %) were much lower. The distribution of employment between the different economic activities shows that the relative weight of services in the enlargement countries was generally lower than in the EU-28. Montenegro was the only exception, as three quarters (75.0 %) of those employed were working in services in 2017; this figure may be explained, at least in part, by a considerable increase in tourism and real estate developments in recent years. Services accounted for more than half of the workforce in the remaining enlargement countries, except for Albania, where their share of total employment was 42.4 %. By contrast, the relative share of employment in agriculture, forestry and fishing was often considerably higher in the enlargement countries than in the EU-28. This was particularly notable in Albania, as nearly two fifths (38.2 %) of the workforce was employed in these activities in 2017.

The relative share of the self-employed and family workers in total employment in the EU-28 was relatively stable, tending to fall gradually during periods of economic growth and rise marginally during periods of more testing economic conditions (for example, at the height of the global financial and economic crisis in 2009 and 2010). The structure of employment by working status was quite different in most of the enlargement countries. Indeed, self-employed and family workers accounted for more than half (55.9 %) of those working in Albania in 2017, while this share was close to one third of the total in Turkey, Kosovo and Serbia, and between one quarter and one fifth of the total in Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia and Montenegro.

By contrast, the situation in the enlargement countries was more varied. At the onset of the global financial and economic crisis (between 2008 and 2009) unemployment rates increased in nearly all enlargement countries; in fact, North Macedonia recorded a fall in its unemployment rate every year between 2007 and 2017. In Montenegro, the unemployment rate stabilised between 2010 and 2012 and subsequently fell, although it increased slightly in 2017. In Serbia, the unemployment rate peaked in 2012 and then fell. In Bosnia and Herzegovina a similar development was observed, with a peak for the unemployment rate in 2012, followed by a decline (interrupted in 2015 by a small increase). In Turkey and Albania, developments were more complex: in Turkey, after rising in 2009, the unemployment rate fell to a low in 2012 before increasing again through to 2017; in Albania, the increase in 2009 was followed by a small rise and stability in 2010 and 2011, a fall in 2012, a rapid increase to a peak in 2014 and a similarly paced decrease through until 2017, such that the unemployment rate in 2017 was similar to that in 2012.

Source: Eurostat (online data code: une_rt_a) Historically, women in the EU have been more affected by unemployment than men. However, unemployment rates for the two sexes started to converge with the onset of the global financial and economic crisis and by 2009 the unemployment rate for men was slightly higher than the rate for women; this pattern was repeated in 2010. From a low of 6.6 % in 2008, the EU-28 unemployment rate for men rose in successive years to peak at 10.8 % in 2013. The unemployment rate for women rose for five successive years from a low of 7.5 % in 2008 to peak at 10.9 % in 2013. From the end of 2013, the rates for men and for women began to decline; by 2017, they stood at 7.4 % and 7.9 % respectively. Among the enlargement countries, unemployment rates for men were lower than the rates for women in 2012, except in Albania and North Macedonia (see Table 5.4). This situation changed over the following years: in these two countries the rates for the two sexes converged and then diverged again, with the rate for women actually passing that for men in 2014 in North Macedonia; in Montenegro the rate for men passed that for women in 2014 before returning below it again. Despite these changes, the situation in 2017 was similar to that in 2012, with Albania and North Macedonia the only enlargement countries with higher unemployment rates for men than for women. Between these years the gender gap for unemployment rates in Kosovo narrowed greatly (down 4.0 percentage points) while in Turkey it expanded by 2.8 percentage points. ",

These accounts record how economic activity is distributed among businesses, consumers, government and foreign countries, detailing key items such as production, consumption, savings and investment. Economic and financial statistics have become one of the cornerstones of global, regional and national governance. Gross domestic product (GDP) Gross domestic product (GDP) is the most commonly used economic indicator and the central measure of national accounts, which summarises the economic position of a country (or region). GDP provides information on the total market value of all goods and services produced during a given period and can be calculated in three different ways, based on output, expenditure or income. GDP at current prices in the EU-28 stood at EUR 15 382 billion in 2017. The economic output of the enlargement countries was considerably lower, as together they generated an estimated EUR 841 billion of GDP in 2017 (2016 data for Bosnia and Herzegovina); as such, the GDP of the EU-28 was 18.3 times as high as that of the enlargement countries (see Table 6.1). The Turkish economy was by far the largest among the enlargement countries, as its GDP was valued at EUR 754 billion in 2017, which was almost nine tenths of the total output across all of the enlargement countries.

The data presented in Table 6.2 are presented in euro terms. While this also facilitates comparisons between countries, it is important to remember that changes in exchange rates are partially responsible for some of the developments that may be identified. GDP per capita in current price euro terms stood at EUR 30 000 in the EU-28 in 2017. As such, GDP per capita in the EU-28 was 3.2 times as high as in Turkey (which had the highest ratio of GDP per capita among the enlargement countries). At the other end of the range, GDP per capita in the EU-28 was 7.5 times as high as in Albania and peaked at 8.3 times as high as in Kosovo. GDP per capita rose in the EU-28 from EUR 26 100 to EUR 30 000 between 2007 and 2017, equivalent to an overall increase of 15 %. Among the enlargement countries, Turkey recorded the highest GDP per capita in both 2007 and 2017. By this measure, GDP per capita rose overall by 34 % in Turkey over the period 2007-2017 to reach EUR 9 400. During the same period, GDP per capita in euro terms increased by 89 % in Kosovo (2009-2017), 60 % in North Macedonia, 57 % in Montenegro, 54 % in Albania, and by 47 % in Bosnia and Herzegovina (2007-2016); in Serbia, the increase of 30 % was slightly smaller than the increase in Turkey, but still double that recorded in the EU-28.

A purchasing power standard (PPS) is an artificial currency unit; theoretically, after taking account of price level differences between countries, one PPS should buy the same amount of goods and services in each country. GDP per capita in PPS terms was 50 % higher in the EU-28 than the level recorded in Turkey, which posted the highest GDP per capita among the enlargement countries, at 19 900 PPS. There was a relatively low degree of variation across the remaining enlargement countries, as GDP per capita lay within the range of 9 000 PPS (Bosnia and Herzegovina) to 13 700 PPS (Montenegro). Note there are no data available for Kosovo in PPS terms but that its GDP per capita was EUR 3 600 in 2017; this was below the range for the other enlargement countries, as the next lowest level was recorded in Albania (EUR 4 000 per capita). Price levels tend to be higher in the EU-28 than they are in the enlargement countries. In 2007 and based on information in PPS terms, GDP per capita in the EU-28 was between 2.2 times as high as in Turkey and 4.4 times as high as in Albania. By 2017 these differences had narrowed, as GDP per capita in the EU-28 ranged between 1.5 times as high as in Turkey and 3.3 times as high as in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Albania.

The global financial and economic crisis gathered pace during the second half of 2008. It affected the EU-28 and most of the enlargement countries (see Table 6.3). GDP decreased (in real terms) by 4.3 % in the EU-28 in 2009, with a rebound in activity in 2010 and 2011. Despite a mixed picture, the effects of the crisis were still being felt in several of the EU Member States in 2012 and 2013 and this was apparent as there was a small fall in the EU-28\u2019s GDP in 2012, followed by a modest increase in 2013. There were signs of an upturn in economic activity from 2014 to 2017, with real GDP growth in the EU-28 close to or above 2.0 % for all years. The impact of the crisis on the enlargement countries varied depending on each country\u2019s economic structure and the nature of its financial and international trade relations with the rest of the world. Those countries most integrated into the global economy tended to be most affected: for example, there was a relatively large contraction in economic activity in Turkey in 2009 (\u2212 4.7 % when adjusted for price changes). On the other hand, in some of the smaller economies that were less exposed to the global economy \u2014 for example, Albania or Kosovo \u2014 real GDP growth continued to follow a positive development in 2009.

Source: Eurostat (online data code: nama_10_gdp) Expenditure components of GDP Within the expenditure approach for national accounts statistics, only governments and households plus non-profit institutions serving households (NPISH) have final consumption; businesses/corporations are considered to have intermediate consumption. Private consumption expenditure of households is defined as expenditure on goods and services for the direct satisfaction of individual needs, whereas government consumption expenditure includes goods and services produced by government, as well as purchases of goods and services by government, that are supplied to households as social transfers in kind. Gross capital formation is the sum of gross fixed capital formation, the change in inventories (stocks) and the net acquisition of valuables. The external trade balance is the difference between exports and imports of goods and services; it can be positive (a surplus) or negative (a deficit). Table 6.4 provides an analysis of the GDP components from the expenditure side. Final consumption expenditure contributed 75.7 % of the EU-28\u2019s GDP in 2017, while the share of gross capital formation was 20.6 % and there was a trade surplus in goods and services that contributed 3.7 % of GDP (as exports were valued at 45.7 % of GDP, while imports accounted for 42.0 %). In nearly all of the enlargement countries, the relative share of final consumption expenditure was higher than in the EU-28, largely as a result of higher private consumption by households, while the consumption of general government was usually lower; the one exception was Turkey, where final consumption expenditure accounted for 73.5 % of GDP in 2017, 2.2 percentage points below the share in the EU-28. Elsewhere, final consumption expenditure in the enlargement countries contributed between 80.8 % of GDP in North Macedonia to just over 100 % in Bosnia and Herzegovina (100.9 %; 2016 data). Two of the enlargement countries \u2014 Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina (2016 data) \u2014 reported that investment accounted for a similar share of their GDP as it did in the EU-28, while the remaining countries (no data available for Turkey) reported notably higher shares for gross capital formation. The enlargement countries had negative trade balances: whereas the EU-28\u2019s trade surplus was equivalent to 3.7 % of GDP in 2017, among the enlargement countries trade deficits ranged from 4.5 % of GDP in Turkey to 25.8 % of GDP in Kosovo.

In 2017, agriculture, forestry and fishing contributed 1.7 % of the EU-28\u2019s total value added, while its share among the enlargement countries ranged from 6.9 % in Turkey to 11.4 % in Kosovo and 21.7 % in Albania. In a majority of the enlargement countries, industry accounted for a similar proportion of total value added in 2017 as it did in the EU-28 (19.6 %). There were three exceptions, two where the share of industry was relatively low \u2014 Albania (13.2 %) and Montenegro (11.2 %) \u2014 and one where it was relatively high \u2014 Serbia (26.5 %). Apart from in Turkey, the construction sector was the smallest of the four economic activities that are shown in Figure 6.3. In 2017, the relative weight of construction in total value added was below the EU-28 average of 5.4 % in Bosnia and Herzegovina (4.6 %; 2016 data) and Serbia (5.0 %). The share of construction was above the EU-28 average in the remaining enlargement countries; this was particularly clear in Albania, where the construction sector accounted for more than one tenth (10.7 %) of total value added.

Source: Eurostat (online data code: gov_10dd_edpt1) General government deficit/ surplus The global financial and economic crisis resulted in serious challenges being posed to many European governments. The main concerns were linked to the ability of national administrations to be able to service their debt repayments, take the necessary action to ensure that their public spending was brought under control, while at the same time trying to promote economic growth. Within the EU, multilateral economic surveillance was introduced through the stability and growth pact (SGP) which provides for the coordination of fiscal policies. Under the terms of the SGP, Member States pledged that their government deficit would not exceed 3 % of GDP, while their debt would not exceed 60 % of GDP. EU Member States are required to provide the European Commission with their general government deficit and general government debt statistics before 1 April and 1 October of each year. From October 2014 onwards, candidate countries (but not potential candidates) were also asked to report EDP- related data to Eurostat with the same frequency. The general government deficit/surplus refers to net borrowing/net lending over the course of a single year by central, state and local government as well as social security funds. In 2017, the average general government deficit across the EU-28 stood at \u2212 1.0 % of GDP. There were four enlargement countries (no information for Kosovo) that had public deficits that were more pronounced than the average recorded for the EU-28, the largest being 5.6 % of GDP in Montenegro (see Figure 6.4). By contrast, two enlargement countries reported a general government surplus in 2017, the highest of these, relative to GDP, was recorded in Bosnia and Herzegovina (2.6 %). ",

Source: Eurostat (online data code: gov_10dd_edpt1) The global financial and economic crisis triggered a sharp downturn in public finances across Europe and some countries continue to struggle to reduce their deficits. The average general government deficit of the EU-28 was 6.6 % of GDP at the height of the crisis in 2009, but thereafter the deficit narrowed during eight consecutive years. Prior to the crisis, in 2007, two of the enlargement countries \u2014 Albania and Serbia \u2014 ran a government deficit (no information for Turkey or Kosovo), North Macedonia as well as Bosnia and Herzegovina posted relatively small surpluses (0.6 % and 1.1 % of GDP), while Montenegro reported a notably larger surplus (6.8 % of GDP) \u2014 see Table 6.5. This situation changed abruptly with the onset of the financial and economic crisis, as all of the enlargement countries recorded deficits in 2008 through to 2012. In 2013 and 2014, the situation changed slightly as Turkey reported government surpluses. In 2015, Turkey again reported a surplus, as did Bosnia and Herzegovina, the latter posting surpluses also in 2016 and 2017; Serbia also recorded a government surplus in 2017. General government debt General government debt is the gross debt outstanding at the end of the year of the general government sector measured at nominal (face) value; in other words, it is the accumulated total debt (over the years). In 2017, the government debt-to-GDP ratio for the EU-28 was 81.6 %. This indicator was consistently lower \u2014 sometimes considerably so \u2014 across the enlargement countries: Kosovo had the lowest debt-to-GDP ratio (16.6 %); Turkey, Bosnia and Herzegovina and North Macedonia had ratios ranging from just under 30 % to 40 %; debt ratios were over 50 % in the other enlargement countries, peaking at 66.8 % in Albania (see Figure 6.5).

Source: Eurostat (online data code: gov_10dd_edpt1) General government debt across the EU-28 stood at 57.5 % in 2007 and rose each year to a peak of 86.8 % in 2014, before falling to 81.6 % in 2017 (see Table 6.6). In 2007, prior to the onset of the financial and economic crisis, the ratio of general government debt-to-GDP in the enlargement countries ranged from 18.1 % in Bosnia and Herzegovina to 50.7 % in Albania; note that Kosovo reported no debt prior to 2009 and data for 2007 are not available for Turkey. Following the onset of the crisis in 2008, government debt relative to GDP increased in three of the enlargement countries and in 2009 this pattern spread as the ratio increased in each of the enlargement countries. A comparison between the levels of government debt in 2007 and 2017 reveals that the share of debt to GDP was 24.1 percentage points higher in 2017 in the EU-28; a similar pattern was recorded in Serbia (up 28.6 points), while smaller increases were observed in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Albania and North Macedonia and an even larger one in Montenegro (up 36.8 points).

Source: Eurostat (online data code: prc_hicp_aind) Consumer prices The all-items harmonised index of consumer prices remained at relatively low levels across the EU during the period 2008-2018. The rate of annual price increases peaked at 3.7 % in 2008, although the effects of the global financial and economic crisis caused a rapid slowdown in price increases in 2009 when a relative low of 1.0 % was recorded. Thereafter, prices in the EU-28 rose by 2.1 % in 2010 and by 3.1 % in 2011, before the pace of price increases slowed and almost came to a halt in 2015 and 2016 when consumer prices increased by 0.1 % and 0.2 % (see Figure 6.6). In 2017 and 2018, relatively low inflation returned, with prices rising 1.7 % and 1.9 %. Consumer price increases in the enlargement countries over the period 2008-2018 were generally higher than those recorded across the EU-28; this could, at least in part, be attributed to the deregulation of prices which formed part of the liberalisation process undertaken in several enlargement economies. Following a relative peak in 2008, prices fell or rose at a relatively slow pace in 2009 in most of the enlargement countries before accelerating somewhat in 2010 and 2011 and then returning to more modest increases or price falls in 2013-2016. As in the EU-28, price increases were somewhat higher again in 2017 and 2018, most notably in Turkey where they exceeded 10 %. In 2018, Turkey (16.3 %) continued to record price increases that were higher than those for the other enlargement countries. Elsewhere, price increases peaked at 2.9 % in Montenegro. By contrast, the 0.5 % average price increase in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2018 was the lowest level of inflation observed among the enlargement countries. ",

The current account balance is made up of four parts, concerning trade in goods and services, as well as different types of income. A positive balance indicates net lending to the rest of the world, while a negative balance indicates net borrowing from the rest of the world. In 2017, the EU-28 recorded a positive balance for both goods and services, whereas all of the enlargement countries reported a negative balance for goods and a positive balance for services (see Table 6.7). The size of the current account deficit for goods was relatively large in most of the enlargement countries, reaching 38.4 % of GDP in Kosovo and 43.3 % of GDP in Montenegro. By contrast, Montenegro recorded the highest current account surplus for services (19.8 % of GDP), largely as a result of receipts from international tourism. The EU-28 reported a small negative balance for primary and for secondary income, relative to its GDP (\u2212 0.2 % and \u2212 0.6 % respectively). By contrast, there was a positive balance for secondary income in each of the enlargement countries; these include, for example, worker\u2019s remittances, donations, development aid and most tax payments.

Source: Eurostat (online data codes: bop_fdi_flow_r2 and bop_fdi6_flow) Foreign direct investment Flows of foreign direct investment (FDI) result from investors building up or reducing their assets abroad by investing in or disinvesting from foreign companies. Such flows are notoriously erratic, with big changes from one year to the next as investment decisions are often lumpy. Outward investment from the EU-28 (into non-member countries) stood at EUR 219 billion in 2017, while inward investment from non- member countries was valued at EUR 146 billion. The EU has traditionally been a net outward investor of foreign direct investment and in 2017 this was again the case, as outward investment exceeded inward investment by EUR 73 billion (see Table 6.8). Each of the enlargement countries recorded a higher level of FDI inflows than outflows in 2017 as they had done in 2007. Together the enlargement countries had a combined level of inward FDI valued at EUR 14.5 billion in 2017. Turkey was by far the largest beneficiary, accounting for two thirds (66.2 %) of this inward FDI among the enlargement countries. The level of outward FDI from the enlargement countries was considerably lower. In absolute terms, the only substantial outward flow of FDI from an enlargement country was in relation to FDI from Turkey, which was valued at EUR 2.3 billion in 2017. There was rapid growth between 2007 and 2017 in the value of inward FDI in Albania, more than doubling. Elsewhere, the other enlargement countries reported lower inward FDI in 2017 than in 2007. ",

        "7 International trade in goods Key figures on enlargement countries \u2014 2019 edition 78 The EU has a common international trade policy, often referred to as the common commercial policy. In other words, the EU acts as a single entity on trade issues, including issues related to the World Trade Organisation (WTO). In these cases, the European Commission negotiates trade agreements and represents Europe\u2019s interests on behalf of the EU Member States. Trade relations between the EU and the enlargement countries are designed to remove or reduce customs tariffs in bilateral trade and for this purpose specific stabilisation and association agreements have been reached with six enlargement countries; North Macedonia (2004), Albania (2006), Montenegro (2010), Serbia (2013), Bosnia and Herzegovina (2015) and Kosovo (2016). The EU\u2019s trade relationship with Turkey is somewhat different as Turkey has, since the end of 1995, been a member of the customs union, which eliminates all customs duties for bilateral trade and establishes joint customs tariffs as regards foreign imports. Trade flows In 2018, the total value of the goods exported from the EU-28 to the rest of the world (non- member countries) was 49 % higher than its level in 2008 (see Table 7.1). There was an even faster development to international trade flows for most of the enlargement countries over the same period, as some countries made reforms to develop market-based economic systems, while others continued to see trading patterns re-established following the end of the Balkans conflicts. The value of exports from North Macedonia and Serbia more than doubled, while those from Albania more than trebled. By contrast, the value of exports from Montenegro was slightly lower in 2018 than they had been in 2008. In 2018, exports of goods from the EU-28 were valued at EUR 1 956 billion, while the combined value of exports from the seven enlargement countries was EUR 173 billion, equivalent to 8.9 % of the EU-28 total. Exports from Turkey in 2018 were valued at EUR 142 billion. As such, Turkey accounted for more than four fifths (82.2 %) of the total value of exports from the enlargement countries. Serbia had the second highest share (9.0 %), while the third and fourth highest shares were recorded in Bosnia and Herzegovina (3.5 %) and North Macedonia (3.4 %). The total value of EU-28 imports of goods rose at a somewhat slower pace when compared with the pace of growth for exports. There was an overall increase of 25 % in the value of EU-28 imports between 2008 and 2018. All of the enlargement countries except for Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina recorded a faster expansion of imports than did the EU, with imports increasing by at least half in Kosovo and North Macedonia. In 2018, imports of goods into the EU-28 were valued at EUR 1 980 billion, while the combined value of imports into the seven enlargement countries was EUR 237 billion, equivalent to 12.0 % of the EU-28 total. Turkey imported goods that were valued at EUR 188 billion in 2018, which equated to 79.5 % of the total value of imports from the seven enlargement countries. ",

The trade balance is the difference between the monetary value of exports and imports. A positive trade balance is known as a trade surplus and a negative trade balance is known as a trade deficit. The EU-28 recorded a trade deficit for goods in 2008 that was valued at EUR 276 billion. However, as exports grew at a faster pace than imports, the EU\u2019s trade balance turned positive in 2013 and a positive balance was repeated for the next four years, before a deficit was again recorded in 2018, this time valued at EUR 25 billion. Equally, none of the enlargement countries registered a trade surplus for goods in either 2008 or 2018. Together these seven countries recorded a trade deficit of EUR 69 billion in 2008, which had fallen to EUR 64 billion by 2018. The size of the Turkish trade deficit in 2018 was similar to what it had been in 2008, narrowing by 1.9 %. This pattern of a narrowing trade deficit was repeated in most of the enlargement countries, as Montenegro and most notably Kosovo were the only ones to report that their trade deficit was greater in 2018 than in 2008.

Note that the export and import values used in this calculation are based on national accounts data, rather than statistics for the international trade of goods, and these may differ for methodological reasons. EU-28 exports of goods in 2017 corresponded to 32.6 % of GDP, while imports were equivalent to 30.9 % of GDP; note that these data include trade between EU Member States. The ratio of exports of goods relative to GDP was somewhat above the EU-28 average in Serbia (37.1 %) and higher still in North Macedonia (40.6 %), but considerably lower in Montenegro, Kosovo and Albania, where the value of exports was less than 10 % of GDP. Subject to data availability (no information available for Turkey), all of the enlargement countries were more open to imports than the EU-28; this was most notably the case in North Macedonia, where imports were valued at the equivalent of 58.6 % of GDP in 2017. By contrast, the value of imports of goods into Albania was the equivalent of 31.3 % of GDP in 2017, the lowest ratio among the enlargement countries.

        "7 International trade in goods Key figures on enlargement countries \u2014 2019 edition 82 Structure of trade analysed by broad product groups Several classifications are used for collecting and analysing international trade statistics, including the standard international trade classification (SITC). The SITC includes 10 headings at its highest level, some of which have been aggregated further for the purposes of this publication. An analysis of exports by selected product groups (based on the SITC) is shown in Table 7.2. Machinery and vehicles accounted for the highest proportion of goods exported from the EU-28 in 2018, with a 41.3 % share of the total. This was considerably higher than the shares recorded for other manufactured goods (22.5 %; SITC Sections 6 and 8) and chemicals (18.2 %), while each of the remaining goods categories accounted for less than 10 % of total EU-28 exports. Other manufactured goods accounted for the highest share of total exports in nearly all of the enlargement countries in 2018; the one exception was North Macedonia. These goods accounted for approximately two thirds of all the goods exported from Albania, and half of all the goods exported from Bosnia and Herzegovina, a share that was more than two fifths in Turkey and Kosovo and closer to one third in the remaining enlargement countries. The share of other manufactured goods in total exports was consistently higher among the enlargement countries than their corresponding share of EU-28 exports. In North Macedonia, the share of machinery and vehicles (31.7 %) in total exports was somewhat higher than that of other manufactured goods (27.9 %). North Macedonia was the only enlargement country to report that chemicals accounted for in excess of 10 % of its total exports of goods, their share in fact reaching 24.2 % (and therefore above the 18.2 % share recorded in the EU-28). Montenegro recorded a relatively high share (20.5 %) of its total exports in 2018 from mineral fuels, lubricants and related goods, close to four times the equivalent share in the EU-28 (5.8 %) and was one of only two enlargement countries \u2014 the other being Albania (13.3 %) \u2014 to record a double-digit share. Bosnia and Herzegovina reported the lowest share of total exports from food, drinks and tobacco among the enlargement countries in 2018, but its 5.9 % share was nevertheless only slightly below the EU-28 average (6.2 %); note the EU-28 figure excludes intra-EU trade, which may be relatively important, especially for perishables. For Kosovo (23.2 %) and Montenegro (20.5 %), the share of exports coming from raw materials was considerably higher in 2018 than in the other enlargement countries and also at least seven times as high as the equivalent share in the EU-28 (2.6 %).

In the EU-28, the highest trade surplus was recorded for machinery and vehicles (EUR 190 billion), while a surplus was also reported for chemicals (EUR 152 billion), other goods (EUR 10 billion) and food, drinks and tobacco (EUR 9 billion). By contrast, deficits were recorded for raw materials (EUR 31 billion), other manufactured goods (EUR 56 billion) and mineral fuels, lubricants and related goods (EUR 299 billion). Among the enlargement countries it was commonplace to find that only one or two of the product groups had a trade surplus in 2018. This was the case for raw materials in Montenegro (which also had a small trade surplus for other goods), Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo. Serbia and Turkey recorded trade surpluses for food, drinks and tobacco, as well as for other goods in the case of Serbia and for other manufactured goods in the case of Turkey. North Macedonia was the only enlargement country with a trade surplus in three product groups: raw materials; chemicals; and machinery and vehicles.

Source: Eurostat (online data codes: nama_10_a10 and lfsa_egan2) Agriculture was one of the first sectors of the economy (following coal and steel) to receive the attention of EU policymakers, and statistics on agriculture were initially designed to monitor the main objectives of the common agricultural policy (CAP). While the CAP remains one of the EU\u2019s most important policies there have been wide ranging reforms, which has led to a range of new objectives designed to correct imbalances and overproduction. In December 2013, the latest reform of the CAP was formally adopted by the European Parliament and the Council. In June 2018, the European Commission presented proposals for the CAP beyond 2020, aiming to make the CAP more responsive to current and future challenges (such as climate change) while continuing to support farmers within a sustainable and competitive agricultural sector. Gross value added and employment The share of agriculture, forestry and fishing (as defined by NACE Rev. 2 Section A) in total gross value added was considerably higher in the enlargement countries than it was in the EU-28. In 2017, the relative weight of agriculture, forestry and fishing was 1.7 % of total value added in the EU-28 (see Figure 8.1), while among enlargement countries, the lowest share was recorded for Turkey, at 6.9 %. Agriculture, forestry and fishing contributed close to one tenth of total value added in North Macedonia and Kosovo, with this share peaking at 21.7 % in Albania. A somewhat different picture emerged when analysing the share of agriculture, forestry and fishing in total employment. For example, employment within agriculture, forestry and fishing in the EU-28 accounted for 3.9 % of the total number of persons employed in 2017, some 2.3 times the contribution of these activities to total value added. These differences indicate that agriculture, forestry and fishing are relatively labour-intensive activities with a low level of labour productivity. Among the enlargement countries, Kosovo (4.4 %) recorded the lowest employment share for agriculture, forestry and fishing, while Montenegro (7.9 %) was the only other enlargement country to report a share that was below 10.0 %. By contrast, between one sixth and one fifth of the workforce was employed in agriculture, forestry and fishing activities in 2017 in most of the other enlargement countries, although in Albania this share was as high as 38.2 %.

Source: Eurostat (online data codes: apro_cpnh1 and reg_area3) Land use The utilised agricultural area refers to the land area that is actually used for agricultural purposes. This land used for farming includes arable land, permanent grassland, permanent crops (such as orchards, olive trees and vineyards) and other agricultural land such as kitchen gardens; it does not include wooded areas, ponds or other areas not used for agriculture. The area within each country that is used for farming varies according to climate, terrain and soil type, while the level of economic development and population density may also play a role in determining land use. Within the EU-28, roughly equal proportions of the total area (land area and the area covered by water bodies) are used for farming and for forestry, with the remainder being mainly built-up areas (villages, towns and cities), infrastructure (such as roads or railways), scrub, wetlands or waste land. Although these absolute values are not shown, the utilised agricultural area of the EU-28 was around 179 million hectares in 2017. For comparison, the combined utilised agricultural area of the seven enlargement countries was approximately 46 million hectares, which was equivalent to just over one quarter of the EU-28 total. Among the enlargement countries, Turkey had by far the largest utilised agricultural area, some 38 million hectares. The utilised agricultural area in the EU-28 accounted for 40.0 % of its total area in 2017. Figure 8.2 shows that among the enlargement countries, the share of the utilised agricultural area in 2017 was quite close to the EU-28 average in Kosovo and Albania, while agriculture accounted for a higher share of the total area in Serbia (44.4 %), Turkey (48.7 %) and North Macedonia (49.2 %). By contrast, the utilised agricultural area accounted for a somewhat lower share of the total area in Bosnia and Herzegovina (34.4 %), while the share in Montenegro was considerably lower (18.6 %). The share of total area used for agricultural purposes in the EU-28 fell between 2007 and 2017 by 0.9 percentage points from 40.9 %. Between the years shown in Figure 8.2, there were also reductions in the relative share of the utilised agricultural area in Serbia and Turkey.

These areas may be on farms that exclusively have such land or that combine organic and conventional (non-organic) methods; in the case of the latter only the organic area (certified or under conversion) is considered. Organic farming covered 12.6 million hectares of agricultural land in the EU-28 in 2017, equivalent to 7.0 % of the total utilised agricultural area. As such, the share increased 1.4 percentage points between 2012 and 2017, an increase of about one quarter. Data for four enlargement countries show a lower and more stable level of organic farming. In 2017, the share of organic farming within the utilised agricultural area ranged from 0.2 % in Serbia to 1.5 % in Turkey. Between the years for which data are presented in Figure 8.3 the share of organic farming rose by about one tenth in Serbia (2012-2017) and Turkey (2014-2017), while it fell by a similar amount in North Macedonia (2013-2016). Agricultural production For the purpose of this publication, cereals include wheat (common wheat and spelt and durum wheat), rye, maslin, barley, oats, mixed grain other than maslin, grain maize, sorghum, triticale, other cereal crops (such as buckwheat, millet, canary seed), as well as rice. The statistics presented in Table 8.1 on crop production relate to harvested production. The production of cereals in the EU-28 stood at around 311 million tonnes in 2017.

Source: Eurostat (online data codes: apro_mt_lscatl, apro_mt_lspig, apro_mt_lssheep and apro_mt_lsgoat) In 2017, the livestock population in the EU-28 was composed of 150.3 million pigs, an estimated 99.6 million sheep and goats, and 88.8 million cattle. Cultural/religious particularities in the enlargement countries may explain many of the differences observed in their structure of livestock rearing and meat production (see Tables 8.2 and 8.3). For example, Turkey is a largely Muslim country and as such many of its citizens abstain from eating pork; the same is true in some of the Balkan countries, for example, in parts of Kosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania. The livestock population of pigs in the EU-28 was approximately 1.7 times as high as the population of cattle in 2017. By contrast, there were 4.7 times as many cattle as pigs in the enlargement countries. Sheep and goats were, by far, the most common type of livestock in the enlargement countries, with 13.2 times as many sheep and goats as pigs in 2017, and 2.8 times as many sheep and goats as cattle. An alternative way of analysing these figures is to look at the relative share of livestock populations in the enlargement countries compared with the EU-28. The number of sheep and goats in the seven enlargement countries was equivalent to just over half (52 %) of the total being reared in the EU-28. Turkey alone reported 44.3 million sheep and goats in 2017 and the combined total for all seven of the enlargement countries was 51.4 million. The combined livestock population of cattle in the enlargement countries equated to 20.7 % of the EU-28 total in 2017. As noted above, many of the enlargement countries had very few pigs in their livestock populations. Indeed, the total number of pigs in the seven enlargement countries was 3.9 million in 2017, which equated to just 2.6 % of the total number recorded in the EU-28. ",

The quantity of pig meat produced in the EU-28 stood at 23.4 million tonnes in 2017, which was approximately three times as high as the level of meat production from cattle (7.8 million tonnes). Among the enlargement countries a higher ratio was observed for Serbia where the ratio of pig meat production to meat production from cattle was 5.2 : 1. Pig meat production was 2.8 times as high as that from cattle in North Macedonia, which was a similar ratio to that recorded in the EU-28. By contrast, the level of pig meat production was lower than the level of meat production from cattle in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Albania, Montenegro and Kosovo, as well as in Turkey (where pig meat production was negligible). Among the four types of meat production shown in Table 8.3, the biggest quantity of meat produced was from pigs in Serbia (63.9 % of the national total) and North Macedonia (57.5 %), from cattle in Kosovo (90.2 %), Montenegro (63.6 %) and Albania (42.9 %), and from poultry meat in Bosnia and Herzegovina (70.9 %) and Turkey (66.1 %).

Apart from the production of wood and other forest-based goods, forests are increasingly valued for their environmental and recreational roles. Forest ownership varies greatly, including \u2014 among other forms \u2014 small family holdings, state-owned forests and large estates owned by businesses. In 2017, the forest area of the enlargement countries (excluding Serbia) was 28.7 million hectares, up from 28.0 million hectares in 2012, an increase of 2.5 %. By far the largest forest area was in Turkey, where forests covered 22.3 million hectares in 2017 (see Table 8.4). Forests made up 29.1 % of the overall land area of Turkey in 2017, the smallest share among the enlargement countries. Elsewhere the share ranged from 38.4 % in Albania to 55.2 % in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with the share in Montenegro (70.8 %) above this range. Between 2012 and 2017 the share of forests within the total area remained stable in Montenegro and grew elsewhere (no data available for Serbia), most notably in Turkey where it increased by 1.0 percentage points.

As such, fish stocks continue to be regarded as a common resource which needs to be managed collectively. In 2015, the total fish catch registered in the EU-28 was 5.1 million tonnes. From Figure 8.5 it can be seen that this was 4.8 % higher than the catch in 2007. Over the period shown, the catch grew strongly in Albania, with 2.5 times as many fish caught in 2017 as in 2007, with much of the increase taking place between 2012 and 2013. Montenegro also recorded a higher catch in 2017 than 10 years earlier, up 35 % (note there is a break in series). Although Turkey\u2019s fish catch was high in 2009 and 2010, in subsequent years it was notably lower; in 2017, the catch was approximately half what it had been in 2007. ",

        "9 Business Key figures on enlargement countries \u2014 2019 edition 98 Short-term business statistics (STS) show developments over time, and so may be used to calculate rates of change: the data presented here are annual indices that allow the most rapid assessment of the economic climate within industry, construction and services. The information presented relates to several business cycle indicators, including: the industrial production index, the industrial domestic output price index, the construction production index, and the volume of sales index for retail trade. Industrial production index At the onset of the global financial and economic crisis, there was a sharp contraction in industrial activity in the EU-28. In 2009, the EU-28\u2019s industrial production index fell by 13.7 %, while a partial rebound in 2010 (+6.8 %) and 2011 (+3.0 %) was followed by further reductions in output in 2012 (down 2.2 %) and 2013 (down 0.6 %). Thereafter, growth in EU-28 industrial output was recorded for five consecutive years, ranging between 1.2 % in 2014 and 3.1 % in 2017, with the latest information for 2018 showing a slowdown in activity as output rose by 1.3 % \u2014 see Figure 9.1. The enlargement countries for which data are available for 2008 and 2009 (no data for Kosovo) recorded falls in output at the beginning of the financial and economic crisis that were smaller than that recorded in the EU-28. There was one exception to this pattern, as the largest contraction in industrial activity in 2009 among the enlargement countries was recorded in Montenegro, where the production index fell by almost one third. By contrast, Albania recorded an expansion in its industrial output in 2009, as the production index rose by 4.3 %. It is possible to evaluate the effects of the crisis by comparing pre-crisis levels of output in 2008 with the most recent data available for industrial production indices, either 2017 or 2018 depending on the country; note that no comparison is available for Kosovo. Serbia reported that in 2017 its level of industrial output surpassed its 2008 level for the first time, whereas North Macedonia achieved this by 2015, Bosnia and Herzegovina by 2011, and Turkey already in 2010. For comparison, industrial production in the EU-28, like in Serbia, only returned to its 2008 level by 2017. As noted above, Albania\u2019s industrial production did not fall in 2009 and in fact grew every year from 2008 to 2014, since when it has declined (no data for 2018), while industrial production remained below its 2008 level in Montenegro throughout the period from 2009 to 2017.

In North Macedonia it was 12.0 % higher, with growth every year except one between 2010 and 2018. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, overall growth between 2008 and 2018 was 14.6 %, with growth every year except one from 2010. The initial impact of the crisis was quite pronounced in Turkey, as industrial output fell by just over 10 % in 2009. However, there was an immediate rebound in 2010 and 2011 when growth of 13.7 % and 14.8 % was recorded. Thereafter, single-digit growth rates were recorded such that by 2018 the industrial production index in Turkey was 66.8 % higher than it had been in 2008. As noted above, Albania was an exception to the general pattern of declining output in 2009, as its industrial production index appeared to be relatively immune to the crisis, with output rising each and every year from 2007 to 2014. However, this period of sustained growth came to an end, with falls of 2.1 %, 18.0 % and 0.6 % recorded in 2015, 2016 and 2017. Nevertheless, industrial output in Albania was more than twice as high in 2017 as it had been at the onset of the crisis. ",
        "9 Business Key figures on enlargement countries \u2014 2019 edition 100 Domestic output price indices The development of domestic output price indices \u2014 also known as domestic producer price indices (PPIs) \u2014 for industry reflects price changes in goods that are sold by manufacturers; they provide an early indication of inflation. One of the key drivers in the development of output price indices is global demand for energy resources, in particular, crude oil. Indeed, in recent years the price of oil has fluctuated far more than the price of many other goods and this has had a direct impact on costs faced by manufacturers in a range of industrial activities, with oil price fluctuations often being passed down the production line between interlinked activities. A fall in global demand following the onset of the global financial and economic crisis, coupled with falling oil prices, led to EU-28 output prices falling by 4.0 % in 2009. In 2010, EU-28 industrial output prices rose by 3.1 % and price rises subsequently accelerated in 2011 (up 6.1 %). Thereafter, price increases slowed in 2012 and in 2013 there was no change in prices, followed by price falls each year between 2014 and 2016. In 2017 and 2018 domestic EU-28 industrial output prices increased again, up 3.6 % in both years, the fastest price increases recorded since 2011 (see Figure 9.2). Among the enlargement countries (no data available for Bosnia and Herzegovina or Kosovo), the overall change of domestic industrial output prices between 2008 and 2018 was positive except in Albania where there was an overall fall of 0.8 % (data for 2008-2017). Montenegro recorded an increase of 2.9 %, which was below the average for the EU-28 (up 8.3 %). An increase of 13.3 % was reported for North Macedonia while much larger increases were reported for Serbia (up 58.9 %) and Turkey (up 140.2 %).

Source: Eurostat (online data code: sts_copr_a) Construction production index The effects of the global financial and economic crisis on construction in the EU-28 were even greater than on the industrial economy. Indeed, the production index for construction in the EU-28 fell each and every year during the period 2008-2013, returning to annual growth only in 2014 (see Figure 9.3). From 2008 (by when it had already entered into the crisis) through to 2013, the EU-28 index of production for construction fell by one sixth (16.5 %) overall. Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia had a similar development, with considerably lower levels of construction output after the crisis: the 2007 level of production was surpassed in 2017 in Serbia, while in Bosnia and Herzegovina the level of construction output in 2018 was still below that recorded prior to the crisis. Elsewhere, the index of production for construction grew in recent years (a long time series is not available for Kosovo). In Turkey, the index in 2016 (no data for 2017 or 2018) was 29 % above what it was in 2008, with stronger growth between 2008 and 2018 in Albania (158 %), North Macedonia (146 %) and Montenegro (154 %); in Montenegro output more than doubled between 2015 and 2018.

        "9 Business Key figures on enlargement countries \u2014 2019 edition 102 Volume of sales index for retail trade Retail trade indices have particular importance because of the role of retail trade as an interface between producers and final customers, allowing retail sales turnover and volume of sales indices to be used as short-term indicators for final domestic demand by households. The volume of sales index is a measure of turnover in the retail trade sector, adjusted to remove price changes (inflation). Figure 9.4 provides data for this indicator over the period 2008-2018 and shows that the volume of sales index in the EU-28 fell by a relatively small margin during most of the years from 2008 through to 2013, with an overall reduction of 3.9 % during this period. In 2014, growth of 1.9 % was recorded, with this strengthening in 2015 to 3.4 % and stabilising between 2.0 % and 3.0 % in 2016, 2017 and 2018. Among the enlargement countries, data for the volume of sales index are generally available for the period 2008-2018, with 2010 the first year for North Macedonia and Turkey (no data available for Kosovo). During this period there were generally much greater fluctuations in the enlargement countries\u2019 volume of sales indices than the developments seen in the EU-28. North Macedonia and Serbia were characterised by their relatively low volume of sales index in 2018 compared with their levels in 2010 or 2008, up 6.0 % (2010-2018) and down 22.4 % (2008-2018) respectively; in both cases they were outperformed by the EU-28. By contrast, the volume of sales indices in the remaining enlargement countries for which data are available showed uninterrupted growth after 2010 and a much faster expansion in the volume of sales index than that recorded in the EU-28. Such growth was strongest in Montenegro, where the volume of sales index for retail trade grew by an annual average of 6.0 % between 2010 and 2018, while corresponding rates for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Turkey and Albania were within the range of 4.4-5.5 % per year. For comparison, the volume of sales grew on average by 1.3 % per year in the EU-28 during the same period.

The indicator provides a more nuanced guide to the economic significance of tourism pressures and may be used to analyse the sustainability of tourism. In 2016, there were 581 non-resident arrivals in EU-28 hotels and similar establishments per 1 000 inhabitants; this latest figure was 17.9 % higher than in 2012. By far the highest degree of tourism intensity, using this measure, was recorded in Montenegro, where there were more non-resident arrivals in hotels and similar establishments than inhabitants in 2017 (1 277 per 1 000 inhabitants). The number of non-resident arrivals in hotels and similar establishments was below 300 per 1 000 inhabitants in all of the other enlargement countries. According to this measure, tourism intensity in most of the enlargement countries rose at a faster pace than in the EU-28 between 2012 and 2017, the only exception being Turkey which recorded a lower degree of tourism intensity at the end of this period than at the beginning.

Mobile phone subscriptions In the EU-28 there were, on average, 1 367 mobile phone subscriptions per 1 000 inhabitants in 2016; in other words, there was an average of 1.4 mobile subscriptions per person (see Figure 10.1). Since the late 1980s/ early 1990s the number of subscriptions has increased rapidly as mobile phones have become commonplace. Figure 10.1 shows that subscriptions per inhabitant continued to increase even though there was an apparent market saturation, with an overall rise in EU-28 mobile subscriptions of close to one fifth (17.4 %) between 2007 and 2016. There was also a rapid take-up of mobile telephony services in the enlargement countries. During the period 2007-2017, the rate of growth of mobile subscriptions was faster in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro (note that there is a break in series) and Kosovo (2008-2017) than in the EU-28. In 2017, the number of mobile phone subscriptions was higher than the number of inhabitants in three enlargement countries, indicating that some people had more than one mobile subscription: this could result from some subscriptions remaining active even when they were no longer in use, or may be linked to some people having subscriptions for work and private use, or could be linked to some people owning several connected devices. Among the enlargement countries, Albania recorded the highest ratio of mobile phone subscriptions to population size in 2017, an average of 1 875 subscriptions per 1 000 inhabitants. Montenegro was the only other enlargement country to record a ratio of mobile phone subscriptions per inhabitant that was above the EU-28 average, although the ratio in Serbia was only marginally below that of the EU-28.

The proportion of households with access to a personal computer (PC) in the six enlargement countries for which data are available (no information for Albania) was consistently lower than in the EU-28. Two thirds or more of all households in Serbia (72 % in 2018) and North Macedonia (67 % in 2017) had access to a PC, while the corresponding ratio in Bosnia and Herzegovina (64 % in 2018) and Kosovo (61 % in 2017) was slightly lower. In Montenegro, this ratio was stood at a little over one third (36 %) in 2018, while it was just under one fifth (19 %) in Turkey; note that the figure for Turkey covers only desktop PCs and that this particular market has been relatively stagnant in recent years as an increasing share of people have chosen to buy more portable formats, such as laptops, netbooks or tablets.

The proportion of households in the EU-28 with access to the internet was 89 % in 2018, somewhat more than the proportion of households with access to a PC (84 % in 2017), reflecting the use of a range of devices to connect to the internet. The proportion of households in the EU-28 having access to the internet rose by 10 percentage points between 2013 and 2018 (see Figure 10.4); as such it outstripped the growth in households having access to a PC. As with household access to PCs, a lower proportion of households in most enlargement countries had access to the internet when compared with households in the EU-28, the exception being Kosovo which reported that 93 % of households had internet access at home in 2018. In most of the enlargement countries this share ranged from 69 % to 84 %, with the share in Albania well below this range (30 % in 2017). For all six enlargement countries for which data are shown for both reference years in Figure 10.4, the increase in the proportion of households having access to the internet was higher than the increase recorded in the EU-28: the most rapid expansions were in Bosnia and Herzegovina (2011-2018; break in series) and Turkey, where there were increases of 39 and 35 percentage points respectively.

Source: Eurostat (online data code: rd_e_gerdtot) Research and development expenditure Eurostat data on research and development (R & D) provide a comprehensive picture covering indicators related to expenditure and personnel. R & D comprises creative work undertaken on a systematic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of man, culture and society and the use of this stock of knowledge to develop new applications. R & D is a driver of innovation, with the level of gross domestic expenditure on R & D (GERD) (which includes expenditure on R & D performed by business enterprises, higher education institutions, as well as government and private non-profit organisations) and the ratio of R & D intensity (R & D expenditure relative to GDP) being two of the key indicators used to monitor resources devoted to science and technology. The Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth was adopted in 2010. One of its five targets is to see an increase in the level of R & D intensity such that it averages 3 % of the EU\u2019s GDP by 2020. In 2017, gross expenditure on R & D was valued at EUR 317 billion in the EU-28, which was 17.4 % higher than five years earlier (in current price terms). R & D intensity in the EU-28 was 2.06 % in 2017; as such, it lagged behind South Korea, Japan, the United States and China, primarily due to relatively low levels of business expenditure on R & D. R & D expenditure in Turkey was valued at EUR 7.2 billion, which was equivalent to 2.3 % of the level of expenditure recorded in the EU-28 for 2017. Turkish R & D expenditure was far higher than in any of the other enlargement countries, as the next highest level was EUR 342 million in Serbia, approximately one thousandth of the expenditure in the EU-28. The relatively high level of R & D expenditure in Turkey (compared with the other enlargement countries) was not simply because of its larger size, as witnessed from an analysis of the level of R & D expenditure relative to the size of each economy that is shown in Figure 10.7. The R & D intensities among the enlargement countries ranged from 0.96 % and 0.87 % in Turkey and Serbia in 2017 to 0.24 % in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2016. ",

An analysis of R & D expenditure by source of funds for 2016 shows that more than half (56.6 %) of the total expenditure within the EU-28 was funded by business enterprises, while less than one third (30.9 %) was funded by government, and a further tenth (10.0 %) from abroad (foreign funds); the \u2018other\u2019 sources (2.5 %) include higher education and non-profit organisations. In Turkey, the business enterprise sector was also the largest source of funding for R & D expenditure, providing half the total (49.4 %) in 2017. By contrast, in Montenegro (2016 data), Serbia and North Macedonia, the government sector was the main source of R & D funding in 2017; in Montenegro, it provided more than two thirds (70.0 %) of all R & D finance.

The EU\u2019s transport policy aims to foster clean, safe and efficient travel throughout Europe, underpinning the internal market for goods (transferring them between their place of production and consumption) and the right of citizens to travel freely throughout the EU (for both work and pleasure). Motorisation rate The principal mode of passenger transport in the EU is the passenger car, providing both flexibility and mobility. In the EU-28, there were an estimated 507 passenger cars per 1 000 inhabitants in 2016. This marked an increase of 10 % in car ownership (or 46 additional cars per 1 000 inhabitants) when compared with 2007 (see Figure 11.1). Motorisation rates for the enlargement countries were considerably lower than in the EU-28. There were, on average, 310 passenger cars per 1 000 inhabitants in Montenegro, 280 per 1 000 inhabitants in Serbia and 252 per 1 000 inhabitants in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2017; these were the highest rates among the enlargement countries. By contrast, motorisation rates elsewhere were below 200 passenger cars per 1 000 inhabitants, with the lowest rate (147 per 1 000 inhabitants) in Albania.

The split is calculated based on the quantity and distance of freight movements, in other words based on data expressed in tonne-kilometres (tkm). There was generally a high propensity to make use of roads for inland freight transport in both the EU and the majority of the enlargement countries (see Figure 11.3). While the share of road transport in total inland freight transport was 76.4 % across the EU-28 in 2016, there was an even greater reliance on using roads to transport freight in North Macedonia, Turkey and to a lesser extent in Bosnia and Herzegovina (note that inland waterways are excluded from the calculation), where 96.4 %, 95.4 % and 78.9 % of inland freight was moved by road in 2017. There was a relatively high use made of rail and inland waterways for freight transport in Serbia and as a consequence in Serbia the share of road freight transport was lower, at 51.5 %. The lowest share among the enlargement countries was however registered in Montenegro, where roads accounted for 39.0 % of inland freight transport in 2017. The road share of inland freight transport was higher in 2017 than in 2007 in all three enlargement countries for which data are available.

        "12 Energy Key figures on enlargement countries \u2014 2019 edition 124 The energy community was established as an international organisation in 2006 and currently includes, among others, the EU-28, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia; Turkey has observer status. The aim of the energy community is to extend the internal market concerning energy to south-east Europe and beyond. Basic data on energy quantities are in fuel specific units, such as liquid or solid fuels in thousand tonnes and electricity in kilowatt- hours; these units are converted to common energy units (such as tonnes of oil equivalent (toe)) to allow the addition or comparison of data for different energy sources. Primary production and net imports Primary energy production takes place when energy sources are harnessed, for example, in crude oil or natural gas fields, in nuclear reactors, hydro-electric power plants or wind turbines. The level of primary energy production may fluctuate considerably from one year to the next as a result of changes in energy demand (reflecting economic fortunes), the development of energy prices (which is affected by the level of market supply and demand) and environmental conditions (particularly for some renewable sources). In 2017, the EU-28\u2019s primary energy production amounted to 758 million toe, which was 12.3 % lower than in 2007 (see Figure 12.1). The general downward movement of EU-28 production was quite regular, except for 2009 when it fell considerably, in part due to the effects of the global financial and economic crisis. Lower levels of production in the EU-28 may, at least in part, be attributed to resources becoming exhausted and/or uneconomical. Primary energy production in Turkey was 36.5 million toe in 2017, by far the largest value recorded amongst the enlargement countries, ahead of the 10.5 million toe of energy production in Serbia. In contrast to the situation in the EU-28, primary energy production increased between 2007 and 2017 in most enlargement countries, most notably in Albania (up 59.1 %), in Turkey (32.9 %) and in Kosovo (25.7 %) and to a lesser extent in Montenegro (18.9 %). In Serbia the level of primary production of energy changed little over the years shown in Figure 12.1, finishing in 2017 at almost exactly the same level as in 2007. North Macedonia was the only enlargement country (no data available for Bosnia and Herzegovina) where primary production of energy was lower in 2017 than in 2007, with output down 25.2 % overall during this whole period. Natural endowments of fossil fuels largely determine the structure of primary energy production. Energy production in the EU-28 is quite varied, reflecting the availability of different fossil fuel deposits and the potential for hydro power, as well as different policies in relation to the production of energy from nuclear fuels and renewables. In 2017, nuclear and renewable energy sources (under \u2018Others\u2019 in Figure 12.2) made up nearly three fifths (59.5 %) of the EU-28\u2019s energy production. By contrast, many of the enlargement countries have an energy mix that is dominated by just one source of energy. For example, close to four fifths (78.7 %) of Kosovo\u2019s energy production was from solid fuels in 2017, while this source accounted for nearly three quarters of all primary production in Bosnia and Herzegovina (74.2 %) as well as in North Macedonia (73.4 %), more than two thirds in Serbia and more than half in Montenegro. Although solid fuels also contributed more than two fifths of primary energy production in Turkey this was less than the share of other sources. Albania was also an exception, as crude oil was its main source of primary energy production, with a 57.4 % share. ",

Source: Eurostat (online data code: nrg_bal_s) Gross inland energy consumption Gross inland energy consumption is the energy that a country requires to meet its internal (national) demand. The main difference between levels of primary energy production and gross inland energy consumption is international trade: a shortfall of production needs to be met by net imports, while a production surplus is generally accompanied by net exports. As well as primary production and international trade, gross inland consumption takes into account changes in stocks and the supply of energy to bunkers (for international transport). In 2017, the EU-28\u2019s gross inland energy consumption was 1.67 billion toe, having fallen from a peak of 1.85 billion toe in 2006. There was generally a downward path to the development of gross inland consumption in the EU-28 over the last decade, with a notable fall in 2009 and a rebound in 2010, both related to the global financial and economic crisis (see Figure 12.3). Based on a comparison between 2007 and 2017, gross inland energy consumption in the EU-28 was 7.9 % lower at the end of the period. There were greater fluctuations in the development of gross inland energy consumption among the enlargement countries. Energy consumption in North Macedonia and Montenegro fell overall by approximately one tenth (10.9 % and 9.3 % lower respectively) between 2007 and 2017, the largest decreases among the enlargement countries and the only enlargement countries to record bigger reductions than that for the EU-28. Serbia also recorded an overall fall, with consumption 5.1 % lower in 2017 than in 2007. By contrast, gross inland consumption of energy rose in the other three enlargement countries (no data available for Bosnia and Herzegovina), with overall growth ranging from 16.9 % in Albania, through 25.4 % in Kosovo to 48.4 % in Turkey.

The EU-28\u2019s energy dependency was 55.1 % in 2017 (see Figure 12.4). Turkey had the highest energy dependency ratio in 2017 among the enlargement countries, as net imports accounted for 77.1 % of gross inland energy consumption. North Macedonia was the only other enlargement country to report that net imports supplied more than half (56.1 %) of gross inland energy consumption; across the remaining enlargement countries this ratio was within the range of 30-40 % (data for Bosnia and Herzegovina refer to 2016). Between 2007 and 2017, the EU-28\u2019s energy dependency rose by 2.3 percentage points. There were also increases in the dependency ratios of North Macedonia (up 9.0 points), Turkey (up 3.0 points) and Kosovo (up 0.9 points).

Source: Eurostat (online data codes: nrg_bal_s and demo_gind) Final energy consumption Final energy consumption is lower than gross inland energy consumption, as some energy is lost during the process of converting fossil fuels into electricity or crude oil into petroleum products, and some is used for non-energy purposes, such as feedstock for the petrochemical industry. Final energy consumption may be analysed by end use, with information on consumption within the industrial sector, the transport sector, households and a residual category of others (largely composed of services). Consumption by households was 563 kilogrammes of oil equivalent (kgoe) per inhabitant in the EU-28 in 2017, slightly down from the level of 578 kgoe per inhabitant in 2007, but nevertheless higher than in any of the enlargement countries (see Figure 12.5). In 2017, Montenegro recorded household energy consumption at a level of 423 kgoe per inhabitant, followed relatively closely by Serbia with a level of 406 kgoe per inhabitant. Most of the remaining enlargement countries reported household energy consumption in the range of 255 kgoe (North Macedonia) to 324 kgoe per inhabitant (Bosnia and Herzegovina; 2016 data), with Albania (173 kgoe per inhabitant) below this level. Reflecting developments in the EU-28, household energy consumption per inhabitant was lower in 2017 than in 2007 in Serbia, Turkey and North Macedonia, while it was higher in Montenegro, Albania and most notably Kosovo (where it more than doubled).

Source: Eurostat (online data code: sdg_07_40) Renewable energy sources The use of renewable energy sources, whether for electricity generation, transport, or heating/cooling, is seen as a key element of the EU\u2019s energy policy: it should help to reduce dependence on fuel from non-member countries; reduce emissions from carbon-based energy sources; and decouple energy costs from oil prices. The EU-28 has gradually moved closer to its 2020 target of a 20 % contribution from renewable energy sources to gross final energy consumption; a further target of 32 % by 2030 has been set. In 2012, the share of renewable energy was 14.7 % and this subsequently rose to 17.5 % by 2017 (see Figure 12.6). Of the six enlargement countries for which data are available (no data for Bosnia and Herzegovina), Turkey was the only one where this share was below the EU-28 average: 13.2 % of gross final energy consumption in Turkey came from renewable energy sources, while elsewhere the share ranged from 19.7 % in North Macedonia to 40.0 % in Montenegro. In most enlargement countries there was generally little change in the share of renewable energy in final energy consumption between 2012 and 2017, with Kosovo and to a lesser extent North Macedonia the only countries to report a notable increase, while Montenegro reported the largest decrease.

        "13 Environment statistics Key figures on enlargement countries \u2014 2019 edition 132 The Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth was adopted in 2010: one of its flagship initiatives concerns resource- efficient Europe, while there are three specific targets related to the environment and climate change to be achieved by 2020, namely: \u2022 greenhouse gas emissions should fall to 20 % lower than in 1990; \u2022 20 % of the energy used in the EU should be from renewables; and \u2022 there should be a 20 % increase in energy efficiency. Eurostat, in close partnership with the European Environment Agency (EEA), provides environmental statistics, accounts and indicators supporting the development, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the EU\u2019s environmental policies, strategies and initiatives. Data on greenhouse gas emissions, as reported under the United Nations framework convention on climate change (UNFCCC), are collected by the EEA. Eurostat organises and collects environmental statistics in relation to a broad range of data, for example, waste, water, material flows and environmental protection expenditure. Greenhouse gas and carbon dioxide emissions The Kyoto Protocol is an international agreement linked to the UNFCCC which was agreed in 1997 and has the objective of curbing global warming. With the exception of Kosovo, all of the enlargement countries ratified the Kyoto Protocol and it entered into force across the region during the period 2005-2009. Under the Kyoto Protocol a number of industrialised and transition economies (including the EU) \u2014 referred to as Annex I parties \u2014 committed to targets for the reduction of six greenhouse gases or groups of gases, namely: carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), nitrous oxide (N 2 O), methane (CH 4 ), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6 ). Among other environmental commitments, the EU-28 has committed to a 20 % reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020. A new agreement on greenhouse gas emissions was reached in Paris in late 2015; this provides the basis for emissions mitigation and adaptation from 2020 onwards. The indicator presented in Figure 13.1 shows the combined development of emissions for these six greenhouse gases, based on carbon dioxide equivalents; the latter make it possible to compare the overall contributions of the different gases to global warming. The index for total greenhouse gas emissions in the EU-28 reflects progressively larger reductions in emissions in 2007, 2008 and 2009, in part related to the global financial and economic crisis and associated reductions in levels of industrial activity. In 2010, greenhouse gas emissions picked up again, reflecting a rebound in economic activity, but in the next four years the quantity of greenhouse gas emissions followed a downward trend and between 2014 and 2016 was relatively stable; by 2016, the EU-28 index was 17.6 % lower than it had been in 2006. The time series for Turkey reflects an almost unbroken increase in greenhouse gas emissions during the period shown \u2014 therefore also during the crisis \u2014 with the only falls recorded in 2008 and 2013; the overall increase in emissions in Turkey between 2006 and 2016 was 39.0 %. A rapid increase in greenhouse gas emissions was reported for Bosnia and Herzegovina between 2006 and 2011, followed by a sharp fall in 2012 and then further increases in 2013 and 2014 such that between 2006 and 2014 the overall increase was 39.2 %. The time series for North Macedonia and Albania are shorter, running until 2012 and 2009 respectively. These both show a rather inconsistent development, with neither increases nor decreases dominating. Like the EU-28, Serbia and Montenegro recorded an overall decline in greenhouse gas emissions after 2006 (time series available until 2016 for Serbia and 2015 for Montenegro), with a particularly strong fall in 2009 in Montenegro, reflecting a large fall in industrial output observed there during the crisis.

Municipal waste is that which is collected by, or on behalf of, municipal authorities and disposed of through a waste management system. Municipal waste is mainly produced by households, though similar wastes from sources such as distributive trades, offices and public institutions are included; waste from agriculture and from industry is excluded. For areas not covered by a municipal waste collection scheme the reporting countries estimate the amount of waste generated. Municipal waste includes the following categories of waste: organic, paper and cardboard, textiles, plastics, glass, metals and other waste. In 2017, the average amount of municipal waste generated per inhabitant in the EU-28 was 486 kilograms (kg), in other words, just less than half a tonne. This was the same amount as generated per inhabitant some five years earlier in 2012. Among the enlargement countries, the average quantity of municipal waste generated in 2017 ranged from 223 kg per inhabitant in Kosovo (2016 data) to 436 kg per inhabitant in Albania, with Montenegro (518 kg per inhabitant; 2016 data) above this range and also above the EU-28 average (see Figure 13.3). The quantity of municipal waste generated per inhabitant increased in Albania, Montenegro, Turkey and Bosnia and Herzegovina between the years shown in Figure 13.3, while it fell considerably in Kosovo (note that there was a break in series) and Serbia, and slightly in North Macedonia.

Source: Eurostat (online data code: env_ww_con) Wastewater The enlargement countries are not immune to many of the environmental issues the world is facing, and issues such as the quality and scarcity of water or soil erosion are particularly important. Indeed, water is essential for life and an indispensable resource for the economy (especially within the agricultural sector). Water is supplied by economic units engaged in the collection, purification and distribution of water, while water suppliers are often also responsible for collecting wastewater. The proportion of the population connected to wastewater treatment plants covers those connected to any kind of sewage treatment facility; it excludes those connected to wastewater systems that simply discharge wastewater (without any treatment) into the environment. Indeed, when wastewater is released untreated back onto the land, or into the sea or rivers, it can become a significant health risk. In four of the five enlargement countries shown in Figure 13.5 the proportion of the population connected to urban wastewater treatment systems (with at least secondary treatment) was relatively low in 2017, ranging from 1 % in Kosovo to 22 % in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The one exception was Turkey, where the proportion was 71 % (2016 data). The share of the population connected to urban wastewater treatment systems increased between the years shown in Figure 13.5 in the four enlargement countries for which a comparison is available: the increase was marginal in Kosovo while it was most notable in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
