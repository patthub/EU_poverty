        "Targeted Surveys on application of core labour standards, Honduras 5 Targeted Surveys on application of core labour standards, Honduras This report has been developed to provide a picture of the application of core labour standards in Honduras. The report is based on a combination of desk research and stakeholder interviews. The assessments of the issues covered in the report are based on the views of credible international organisations, national governments, employer organisations, trade unions, experts and other stakeholders. Key context Honduras has been in a state of political, humanitarian and economic crisis since the 2009 change in government, which many observers, including the EU, characterised as a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat. According to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, widespread corruption and structural impunity have eroded public confidence in public bodies (IACHR, 2018). Poverty affects 62% of the population, with extreme poverty being a particular concern in rural areas (World Bank, 2019). International observers also report extensive violence, insecurity and influence of organised crime. Concerns have also been raised over the reported lack of government control over the armed forces and private security. The presidential election in 2017 led to violent clashes between security forces and protesters. In 2019, violent anti-government protests have persisted, with calls for the resignation of President Hern\u00e1ndez. Unrest was initially sparked by an alleged government attempt to privatise healthcare and education. Honduras\u2019 principal source of revenue are remittances and exports, of which around 50% are derived from agribusiness. The country\u2019s dependence on agricultural exports makes it highly vulnerable to external impacts, such as natural disasters, fluctuation in prices or changes in trade relations. A new Labour Inspection Law was passed in 2017, introducing higher fines for violations of labour laws and specific provisions to support labour inspector access to establishments. The law was initially welcomed by national stakeholders and international observers, which were concerned that previous fines were merely symbolic and insufficiently dissuasive. The Economic and Social Council (CES), the national tripartite committee, reportedly finally reached agreement on the implementing regulations in July 2019. However, the regulations are yet to be officially published. Owing to this delay, since its passing in 2017, the new law has reportedly not been implemented in practice, Progress \u2022 Labour Inspection Law (2017) and its regulation (2019) \u2022 Tripartite agreement to improve freedom of association, in law and practice \u2022 Increased efforts in trafficking prevention and victim rehabilitation \u2022 Finalisation of investigation protocol for child labour Challenges \u2022 Limited capacity of the inspectorate and the successful implementation of the Labour Inspection Law \u2022 Increasing anti-union violence, discrimination, blacklisting and impunity \u2022 Child labour in practice, particularly rurally \u2022 Widespread labour informality, poverty, insecurity and weak institutional capacity ",
        "Targeted Surveys on application of core labour standards, Honduras 6 and this delay has been cited as a significant constraint to improving the application of labour standards. While positive about the LIT\u2019s provisions, trade unions and civil society remain doubtful that the LIT will be effectively implemented, owing to the lack of resources that hinders the inspectorate. Freedom of association and collective bargaining The legal framework is considered broadly consistent with international standards on freedom of association and collective bargaining, despite some issues being repeatedly highlighted by the ILO CEACR. Trade unions and international observers report low levels of unionisation due to discrimination and retaliation against unionised workers, including increasing violence, deaths, and widespread impunity for such. The US Department of State, trade unions and civil society also highlight the existence of employer-controlled unions in the agricultural and export-processing sectors (USDoS, 2019). They also report that certain employers refuse to engage in collective bargaining and attempt to block trade union registration. Similar issues have also been reported in the public sector. In 2019, the ILO Committee on the Application of Standards found serious failures in relation to the implementation of C87 by the Government of Honduras, particularly relating to anti-union violence and related impunity. Honduras is reportedly working to amend legislative gaps and tackle anti-union violence in order to better align with C87. This process will be guided by a tripartite agreement established in May 2019 and with the oversight of the Sectoral Committee for the Handling of Disputes (MEPCOIT), a body within the CES. MEPCOIT, established in September 2018, will oversee the resolution of disputes and will provide a platform for improved information exchange between unions and relevant authorities on cases of violence. Honduras has announced that it requests ILO technical assistance to support the above, and this process is hoped to bring about further progress soon. Forced labour The legal framework on forced labour is considered broadly in line with international standards. In practice, concerns often centre around the large number of Honduran migrant workers who may fall victim to forced labour abroad, rather than focusing on internal forced labour risks. However, trade unions and international observers, including the UN Human Rights Committee, have expressed concerns regarding practices that could amount to forced labour in export-oriented factories, agriculture, and domestic work across the country, as well as the deep-sea fishing sector in the indigenous Miskito region. There are concerns that the limited understanding of forced labour within institutions, as well as among the general population, may serve to mask cases in practice. The ILO CEACR and US authorities have acknowledged Honduras\u2019 anti-trafficking efforts. These include awareness raising activities among vulnerable groups; improvements to victim rehabilitation; and Honduran authorities\u2019 international collaboration, including with regional neighbours and international organisations. Such progress has not been witnessed in relation forced labour. Indeed, it has been highlighted that relevant authorities do not have systematic procedures to identify forced labour victims. ",
        "Targeted Surveys on application of core labour standards, Honduras 7 Child labour Child labour, including in its worst forms is considered a prevalent issue, particularly in rural areas and in agriculture and street work. International observers report that criminal organisations recruit children into the worst forms of child labour, including to commit violent crimes. ILO CEACR repeatedly points out inconsistencies between the Labour Code and other relevant legislation: while the minimum age for work is set to 14, minors under 14 are permitted to work with government authorisation. Stakeholders from the national government, trade union and employer sectors report that the majority of minors who work do not have such authorisation. The Labour Code also does not cover agricultural undertakings with less than ten workers, where most child labour is reported to occur and inspections remain limited, particularly in high-risk rural areas. Despite social partners\u2019 assertions to the contrary, government reports to having made efforts during recent years to address child labour through improving access to education. In 2018, an online whistle blowing mechanism for public reporting of child labour was also launched. Highly regarded initiatives, funded by international donors, are also in place, for example in the coffee supply chain. These programmes are benefitting from participation and collaboration with national stakeholders, such as government, employers and civil society. A protocol to guide inspections in relation to child labour has recently been finalised through one such project. Discrimination National legislation generally aligns with international standards on discrimination. However, there are some gaps. For example, the Labour Code limits the work women can perform. In practice, international observers, including the ILO CEACR and UN agencies, report difficulties for minorities and women to obtain and keep jobs, a disparity in wages with the rest of the workforce, and pregnancy related discrimination. Women in rural areas and indigenous women are particularly affected. Indigenous peoples, Afro- Hondurans, persons with disabilities and HIV-Aids, and LGBTI persons also experience discrimination in employment, particularly in the private sector. There has been some institutional progress in combating discrimination, including plans on gender equality, against racial discrimination and for the inclusion of people living with HIV/Aids. In particular, the work of the National Institute for Women (INAM) has been recognised by international observers. Honduras also increased fines for sexual harassment and wage discrimination in the 2017 Labour Inspection Law. Social partners, including employers and unions, have also established their own initiatives Other working conditions There are significant challenges regarding broader working conditions in Honduras. The labour market is shaped by high rates of informality, reportedly as high as 80%, as well as poor conditions of employment across the economy. Underemployment is also high, affecting roughly half of economically active Hondurans. Young people, women and indigenous people face the greatest obstacles in accessing decent work. Generally, poor working conditions are most often reported in agriculture and other export-oriented sectors. Domestic work is also a serious concern, as workers are not covered by protections outlined in the Labour Code. ",
        "Targeted Surveys on application of core labour standards, Honduras 8 In May 2019, the budget support programme, EUROEMPLEO, was signed between the EU and Honduras to support the implementation of the National Plan for Employment, which aims to improve competitivity of the economy, generate employment and develop human capital, or skills, particularly among young people and women. Occupational health and safety. Trade unions and international observers share concerns regarding health and safety in construction, export-oriented factories, agriculture (where the use of chemicals without adequate protective measures is common), and deep-sea fishing. In the latter, there are reports of employers selling drugs to indigenous workers, and there are several reported deaths each year. Working time. Workers\u2019 organisations, international observers and local media report regular violations of maximum working hours in agriculture, particularly on sugarcane and palm oil plantations. Workers in these sectors are paid at a piece rate, which encourages them to work excessive hours, without compensation for overtime. Excessive working hours, without overtime, remain commonplace in export-oriented factories in order to reach production targets, according to unions and civil society. Nevertheless, government and employers report that conditions have improved in recent years. Wages. Statistics vary significantly, however, non-compliance with minimum wage is reportedly widespread. Local media reports that as many 71% of workers in Honduras do not receive a minimum wage (Mej\u00eda, 2017). Even if workers do receive minimum wage, the rates do not provide a decent standard of living, according to civil society. Workers in agriculture \u2013 particularly in melon, sugarcane, coffee and palm oil \u2013 are reportedly most affected by below minimum wage pay. The minimum wage in Employment and Economic Development Zones, where most garment factories are located, is set to a lower rate than most national minimum wages applicable to other sectors. Social security coverage. International observers report that both private and public employers regularly fail to make social security contributions on behalf of workers. Subsequently, a significant proportion of the working population lacks access to social security. National stakeholders report that owing to high contributions, low wages and poor-quality public services, some workers prefer to remain outside the system and in informal employment. Strengthening and simplifying the social security system is essential to increasing formal employment. Status of ratification and reporting Honduras has ratified all eight ILO fundamental (core) labour conventions. Honduras has also ratified three of the four ILO governance (priority) conventions, the exception being C129 on labour inspection (agriculture). Honduras is up to date with all of its reporting obligations to the monitoring bodies of the ILO in relation to these conventions. Application issues - latest ILO CEACR observations and direct requests on core conventions Freedom of association & collective bargaining C87 (2019): Noted several legislative issues, including that the Labour Code does not apply to agricultural enterprises with less than 10 permanent employees; government officials can end disputes in the oil industry; there are excessive requirements for union leaders and union formation; and a 2/3 majority requirement and other procedural requirements deemed excessive to call a strike. Noted that ",
