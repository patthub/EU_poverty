Stresses that while infringement proceedings should be more readily used to draw attention to Member States\u2019 responsibilities and their failure to adhere to the existing asylum acquis, they should be accompanied by preventive measures, operational plans and oversight mechanisms in order to yield results; underlines the importance of regular evaluations, constructive dialogue, and exchange of best practice, as crucial elements that are more likely to produce positive developments in asylum systems where deficiencies are identified; different forms of financial and practical assistance can thus be provided in order to achieve the full and correct implementation of European asylum legislation; 59. Notes that the Dublin system is based on mutual trust and that its implementation amounts to a mutual recognition of rejection decisions among Member States, given that an asylum claim can only be considered in the EU once; calls on the Commission to submit a communication on a framework for the transfer of protection of beneficiaries of international protection and mutual recognition of asylum decisions by 2014, in line with the Action Plan Implementing the Stockholm Programme; 60. Underlines that migration management can increase mutual trust and solidarity measures only if coupled with a protection-sensitive approach under which border measures are carried out without prejudice to the rights of refugees and persons requesting international protection; 61. Stresses that visa regimes govern a multitude of entry and exit authorisations and that those entry and exit rules do not place any restrictions on the legal obligation to provide access to asylum; 62. Recalls the Commission\u2019s commitment to facilitate the orderly arrival in the EU of persons in need of protection, and calls on it to explore new approaches to access to asylum procedures; welcomes, in this respect, the Commission\u2019s commitment to adopt a \u2018Communication on new approaches concerning access to asylum procedures targeting main transit countries\u2019 by 2013; * * * 63.

Calls on the Commission to be more systematic in assessing the impact of its proposals on SMEs, on which Europe relies for many new jobs; urges the Commission, in this regard, actively to discourage the \u2018gold-plating\u2019 of EU law at national level, which distorts the level playing field in the internal market; calls for the bureaucratic burden to be further reduced; EN 3.12.2013 Official Journal of the European Union C 353 E/27 Tuesday 11 September 2012 ",
