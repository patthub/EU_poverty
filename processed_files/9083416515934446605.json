        "Executive Summary ",
        "Guidelines on the inteGration of environment and Climate ChanGe in development Cooperation \u2013 executive summary II These guidelines define a comprehensive reference framework for integrating the environment and cli- mate change into the different stages of the cycle of operations for EC development cooperation cov- ering the three aid delivery approaches. They are intended for EC staff and their partners and replace the Environmental Integration Handbook for EC Development Cooperation (2007 edition). The guidelines are presented in 6 chapters: Chapters 1-2 provide an introduction and the rationale and main concepts along with the policy framework. Chapters 3-6 focus on programming and aid delivery modali- ties and illustrate the use of the tools, methods and environmental integration entry points. The Annexes contain sector fiches, screening questionnaires and model terms of reference for Country Environmental Profiles and environmental assessments including Environ-mental Impact Assessments and Strategic Environmental Assessments. Chapter 1 \u2013 Introduction This chapter outlines why the guidelines are an impor- tant instrument in support of the EC\u2019s obligation to mainstream the environment into development coop- eration, and defines key terms. In the EC context, mainstreaming is defined as \u2018the process of systematically integrating a selected value/ theme/idea into all domains of development coopera- tion\u2026\u2019 and requires changes both in ideas and prac- tices. The integration of the environment and climate change serves four main objectives: \u00ce \u00ce identifying and avoiding harmful direct and indi- rect environmental impacts of programmes and projects in the different co-operation sectors, which can undermine sustainability. \u00ce \u00ce recognising and realising opportunities for enhancing environmental conditions, thereby bringing additional benefits to development and economic activities and advancing environmental issues that are a priority for the eC. \u00ce \u00ce Promoting improved environmental dialogue with partner countries, based on the technical, economic and social arguments in favour of a more environ- mental approach to policies and programmes. \u00ce \u00ce identifying potential risks of a project or programme by assessing its exposure and sensitivity as well as response capacities in place to deal with existing or anticipated climate variability and change. \u2018The environment\u2019 is considered to include those bio- physical resources and conditions on which human lives and activities depend. Climate is a critical com- ponent of the environment, and human-induced cli- mate change represents an additional development challenge which needs to be addressed. Chapter 2 \u2013 Why mainstream the environment, including climate change? The rationale for mainstreaming the environment including climate variability and change is based on a number of arguments. These include the concept of environmental services and the increasing realisa- tion of external environmental costs. The concept of sustainable development based on approaches that not only address economic objectives but also social and environmental ones is established and emphasised in EU development cooperation objectives, however achieving sustainable develop- ment remains both a local and global challenge. Climate change represents an additional and formi- dable challenge to sustainable development, inter- acting with existing environmental trends and inten- sifying pressures. It also represents extraordinary opportunities to stimulate new thinking and promote sustainable development trajectories. More needs to be learnt about the precise effects and location of the challenges, and during this learning process responses based on a \u2018robust\u2019 approach are advo- cated. Notions of climate change mitigation ( reducing green-house gas emissions) and adaptation (reduc- ing sensitivity to the consequences) are introduced in this chapter, and examples of actions that address these concerns are provided. Increasingly, environmental conditions are also linked to security and potential conflict in particular regarding access to and the management of natural resources. Climate change is already considered one driver in the creation of \u2018environmental refugees\u2019 with the related social and political challenges. The eradication of poverty in the context of sustain- able development is the fundamental objective of EU development policy, and as environmental goods and services play a key role in the livelihoods of the poorest, effective environmental integration is crucial. Gender needs to be considered in the context of environmental integration as different gender roles may result in different needs, activities and practices that produce different pressures on the environment, and gender-based roles may be affected in different ways by environmental change. The arguments providing the basis for the integration of environment and climate change considerations in development cooperation are strongly underpinned by the high-level commitment of the EU to environ- mental sustainability. This commitment is expressed in the Treaties that provide the legal basis for Community policies and activities. It is reflected in the EU development policy set out in the European Consensus on Development. ",
        "Guidelines on the inteGration of environment and Climate ChanGe in development Cooperation \u2013 executive summary III Building on the Consensus, the 2007 Instrument for Development Cooperation includes environmental protection and sustainable management of natural resources among its objectives and general principles, and considers environment both as a cross-cutting issue and a specific area of cooperation. The Cotonou Agreement (and subsequent revisions) addressing the EU\u2019s partnership with Africa, the Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) includes the principle of mainstream- ing environmental sustainability into its objectives. Globally, the commitment is demonstrated by the EC\u2019s active participation in and support for the imple- mentation of Multilateral Environ-mental Agreements such as the Rio conventions, and in its support for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals \u2013 including MDG7 on environmental sustainability. Chapter 3 \u2013 Environment, including climate, in programming Integration in multi-annual programming is consid- ered particularly critical as it sets the parameters for subsequent phases in the cycle of operations. During programming, key steps are taken to identify and avoid any harmful impacts of cooperation; to realise opportunities for enhancing environmental conditions; and to address risks, constraints and opportunities including those resulting from climate variability and change. The main environmental integration tool during pro- gramming is the Country Environmental Profile (CEP). The CEP provides the necessary information to inte- grate environmental concerns into the country anal- ysis and response strategy and, if required, inform policy dialogue on environment and natural resource management. The profile contains information on the state of the environment, including environmental trends and pressures; on environmental policy, the legislative and institutional framework and on efforts to integrate environmental concerns in other sectors and policies; it provides an overview of past and ongoing develop- ment cooperation from an environmental perspective. A dedicated section in the CEP provides an overall estimation of vulnerability and capacity to respond to the consequences of climate variability and change. Importantly, based on the above, the CEP provides conclusions and recommendations for programming. The CEP can also be used as a reference for envi- ronmental integration in programmes and projects by EC staff and cooperation partners. A summary of the CEP is annexed to the Country Strategy Paper. Regional Environmental Profiles focus on environ- mental issues that are best addressed via a regional approach and should be prepared to inform regional cooperation strategies (Regional Strategy Papers). In line with the Paris Declaration and the Accra Agenda , efforts towards increased harmonisation for country- level environmental analytical work are underway. As an essential part of the CEP preparation process, coordination with national and international devel- opment partners should be sought, leading to joint analytical work and where possible alignment on nationally-led exercises, such as in the framework of joint assistance strategies. In the definition of a response strategy and multi-annual programming, the environment should be considered as a cross-cutting issue influencing the specific inter- ventions for different focal and non-focal sectors, and may also be considered as a possible sector of intervention which merits consideration in itself. Taking into account the relationships between the main sectors and the environment in designing the strategy does not mean that only sectors with less negative environmental impacts should be supported. It means that cooperation objectives, approaches and strategies should be adapted, as relevant, to mitigate possible negative impacts and enhance positive impacts, thereby ensuring the sustainability of sup- port. Effective integration of environmental aspects may also translate into the adaptation of work sched- ules to accommodate the necessary environmental assessments; the allocation of financial resources for the implementation of environ-mental measures; and the choice of an adequate set of performance indicators, reflecting environmental and sustainability concerns, in the proposed intervention framework. Chapter 4 \u2013 Environment, including climate, in sector policy support programmes Although the impact of sector programmes on the environment and also the influence of the environment on sectors may not be as immediate and apparent as for some projects, they can be very significant. Sector approaches are encouraged as an aid deliv- ery method wherever possible and, as the delivery is different from the project approach, the entry points are different too. During identification , sector policies or programmes are screened for environmental and climate implica- tions. Screening supports the identification of those policies and programmes that have the potential to cause significant environmental impacts and/or are significantly dependent upon environmental and cli- matic constraints. Importantly, screening can identify opportunities for the sector policy or programme to make positive contributions to environmental sustain- ability. The screening considers the overall context ",
        "Guidelines on the inteGration of environment and Climate ChanGe in development Cooperation \u2013 executive summary IV and process, including for example questions on existing analytic work and the policy and the institu- tional setting with regard to environmental and natural resource management. One outcome of screening could be a decision to proceed with a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA). An SEA is a systematic process for evaluating the environmental consequences of proposed poli- cies, plans or programmes in order to ensure they are fully included and appropriately addressed at the earliest stage of decision making. Understanding the links between environmental, social, economic and cultural factors is essential. The engagement of stakeholders and the inclusion of their concerns into the process in order to identify appropriate responses is another key element. Lastly, it should be stressed that SEA approaches are particularly appropriate for assessing the influence of climate change on policies and programmes, as well as possible mitigation and adaptation measures Where a decision is made to undertake an SEA, guid- ance is provided in the form of model terms of refer- ence. Where an SEA is not undertaken, guidance is provided on how to integrate environmental consid- erations in formulation studies. The outcome of the screening process is summarised in an annex to the SPSP identification fiche. During SPSP formulation , the environmental aspects associated with the \u2018seven key assessment areas\u2019 should be considered; entry points may exist in par- ticular in relation to the sector policy/programme; the sector budget; sector and donor coordination mecha- nisms; institutional and capacity-related aspects; and performance monitoring. During SPSP implementation , any environ-mental indicators associated with the sup-ported sector pol- icy or programme must be regularly monitored and negative results addressed. Policy dialogue, central to sector approaches, provides a platform to discuss outstanding environmental concerns. The evaluation of SPSPs should focus on deter- mining if the efforts to integrate environment and climate change concerns in the supported policy or programme were adequate and successful, and what lessons can be learnt for the future. Chapter 5 \u2013 Environment, including climate, in General Budget Support Chapter 5 follows a similar format to Chapter 4, pro- viding guidance on environ-mental integration for General Budget Support (GBS) programmes, from identification to evaluation. A major distinction being that although an SEA of national development poli- cies may be considered useful and encouraged in policy dialogue, there is no screening undertaken during identification. For GBS, much of the environmental integration effort is during the initial phases, focussing on assessments and analysis of linkages and institutional capacities. These legislative and institutional aspects are particularly rel- evant for environmental integration in GBS and specific supporting measures may be required in some cases. Entry points for environmental integration during iden- tification include: the analysis of consistency with EC policy; the analysis of the national development policy or poverty reduction strategy in relation to the associ- ated environmental stakes; the analysis of the budget and expenditure frameworks in the light of the govern- ment\u2019s declared priorities with regard to environmental governance, natural resource management and the response to climate change; the choice of performance measurement indicators from an environmental per- spective; and any environ-mental and climate-related risks and assumptions that could critically influence national development or poverty reduction efforts. Donor coordination is particularly important for GBS, and partners\u2019 environmental requirements should be considered focusing on how environmental and cli- mate-related concerns are addressed within a work- ing group context. It may be necessary to strengthen coordination mechanisms in some cases. During formulation , a comprehensive evaluation of the \u2018seven assessment areas\u2019 is under-taken, and guidance is provided on where environmental con- siderations may be particularly relevant, including: performance monitoring indicators; donor coordina- tion on the environment; and the institutional setting and capacity analysis in relation to environment and climate change. At the implementation stage, performance monitoring and policy dialogue from an environmental perspec- tive are the main activities. Enhanced policy dialogue is central to this aid delivery method and the CEP, as well as specific assessments and studies, can prove useful in supporting this. As GBS is still a relatively new aid delivery method and experience is limited, the evaluation of GBS from an environmental perspective is of considerable interest in designing future support. ",
        "Guidelines on the inteGration of environment and Climate ChanGe in development Cooperation \u2013 executive summary V Chapter 6 \u2013 Environment, including climate, in Projects This final chapter gives guidance on opportunities to integrate climate change and environmental issues during the identification, formulation, implementa- tion and evaluation of projects. Projects may differ from the other aid delivery methods in that there are typically a larger number of environmental integration entry points in (donor supported) project procedures. The first opportunity for integration at the identifi- cation stage is in the logical framework approach, in particular to ensure that environ-mental problems are included in the problem tree analysis. When the critical parameters of a project have been identified, the project should be screened from an environmen- tal perspective to identify both possible impacts and climate risks. Screening for environmental impact is accomplished using a list of project types and selec- tively by answering targeted questions which in some cases highlight links between negative environmental effects and increased vulnerability to climate change. Screening for climate risks is firstly based on a pre- liminary assessment of project exposure with respect to location and type of activity. Depending on the answer to these first questions, subsequent questions on project design, and activities are posed, that aim to identify possible obstacles to climate change adaptation efforts or risks of increased vulnerability as a result of project activities. Partner awareness and capacities , as well as any ongoing plans or programmes that might support the project\u2019s climate risk mitigation objectives are taken into account in estimating the actual level of risk and type of possi- ble follow-up action required. The screening process informs decisions during the subsequent stages, and the outcome is recorded in an annex to the project identification fiche. Key outcomes include whether the project is considered at risk from climate change and if an environmental impact assessment (EIA) is required. An EIA being a systematic assessment of the potential environmental impacts of a project and its alternatives, carried out to identify and mitigate negative impacts and opti- mise positive effects. During formulation , for projects not requiring an EIA any significant environmental issue identified during screening should be addressed in the formulation study as appropriate. For projects requiring an EIA, guidance on preparing terms of reference is provided. In circumstances where an EIA and further climate change assessment are required, guidance on com- bining these is given. In cases where climate change is deemed to represent a significant concern to the achievement of project objectives, follow-up action should be considered during formulation. In recognition of some degree of uncertainly, the emphasis should be on \u2018robust\u2019 measures that address the underlying causes and drivers of vulnerability and strengthen project partners\u2019 capacities to deal with climate risks. In project implementation , if an environ-mental management plan had been prepared, this should be implemented, as should any other recommendations on environmental sustainability developed during formulation. Environmental indicators included in the project design should be monitored, triggering adjust- ments in project management in case of need. It is also possible to undertake an environmental review of an ongoing project to identify areas where envi- ronmental performance can be improved, although the scope for doing so is less than where integration starts at identification. Projects can be evaluated from an environ-mental perspective by applying an environ-mental and cli- mate change \u2018lenses\u2019 to the five standard evaluation criteria. It will be particularly important to conduct comprehensive evaluations in relation to the inte- gration of climate aspects, as methods and under- standing in this area are still under development. Ex post evaluations of projects subjected to an ex ante EIA may also be undertaken to provide insights for future EIAs. Evaluations in general will contribute to building the knowledge base and practical experience required to enhance the quality of future environmen- tal assessments, and the relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, impact and sustainability of environmental integration measures in future response strategies and interventions.

        "Guidelines on the inteGration of environment and Climate ChanGe in development Cooperation \u2013 Chapter 1 4 1.1 Why these guidelines? human impact on the environment has increased rapidly over the past century in response to population growth, rapid technological development, industrialisation and agricultural expansion. Unless we change our relationship with the environment, these increasing pressures will limit the planet\u2019s capacity to supply the world\u2019s economies with sufficient water, energy and other basic resources, and bring about substantial change that will create uncer- tainty and instability. We are being made increasingly aware of our impact on the environment notably by the chal- lenge of climate change, considered the ultimate political test for our generation. The undesirable environmental consequences of our activities can no longer be compensated for by the benefits of growth. instead of increasing wealth, economic activities now risk creating a progressively less habitable planet, with diminishing natural resources, rising environmental management costs and climatic instability. These threats are global, but the impacts are most severe in the developing world. any development model which ignores these consequences will fail to ensure continuing prosperity, particularly for the poorest communities. This is especially relevant for the european Union\u2019s external policies and assistance programmes as the eU is the most important donor worldwide 1 . For these reasons, the eC has long undertaken an obligation to mainstream the environment into its development cooperation activities. These guidelines 2 are intended to facilitate the implementation of this obligation, by providing those in charge of planning and delivering external aid with a coherent operational framework and a set of tools to be applied in the different phases of the cycle of operations and in relation to the three main aid delivery methods. Chapter 2 contains an introduction to environmental integration concepts and rationale, policy and legal back- ground and linkages with main development issues. Chapter 3 focuses on environmental integration in the multian- nual programming phase, Chapter 4-6 on the three main aid delivery methods: sector Policy support Programmes (sPsP), General Budget support (GBs) and projects respectively, building on the most recent guidelines for these methods. annexes provide a set of model Terms of reference (Tor) for environmental assessments, screening guides and checklists to address environmental aspects as relevant at the identification and formulation stages. While opportunities to incorporate environmental concerns exist throughout the various phases of the cycle of operations, emphasis is put on the upstream stages of identification and formulation, which is where key deci- sions are made. 1.2 What is environmental mainstreaming? in the eC, mainstreaming is \u2018 the process of systematically integrating a selected value/idea/theme into all domains of the EC development cooperation to promote specific (transposing ideas, influencing policies) as well as general development outcomes 3 \u2019. in these guidelines, the environment is considered to include those bio-physical resources and conditions on which human lives and activities depend, and which in turn they influence. mainstreaming involves an iterative process of change in the culture and practices of institutions. The result of a successful process of mainstreaming the environment in eC development cooperation is the integration of environmental approaches and tools in the cycle of operations in order to bring about a more appropriate balance of environmental, economic and social concerns. Further environmental integration will be essential to address the increasingly recognised challenges to development posed by climate change. 1.3 Environmental mainstreaming and climate change Climate constitutes a critical aspect of \u2018the environment\u2019, which must be taken into account alongside other issues. some degree of year-on-year climate variability has always existed, and must be taken into account in \u2018normal\u2019 development planning. Climate change, a change in average climatic parameters measured over decades rather than years, has the potential to interact with and potentially magnify other environmental phenomena of concern, such as desertification, biodiversity loss, air pollution, or the increasing scarcity of freshwater. 1 including member states responsible for some 55% of global development assistance. 2 These guidelines replace the environmental integration handbook for eC development Cooperation (2007 edition). 3 european Commission \u2013 iQsG (2004) Putting Mainstreaming into Practice .

        "Guidelines on the inteGration of environment and Climate ChanGe in development Cooperation \u2013 Chapter 1 5 responding effectively to human-induced climate change does represent a new development challenge, but it also means that most existing environmental issues take on a new urgency. dealing with climate variability and climate change separately from other environmental integration aspects makes little sense from a theoretical or practical perspective. in these guidelines, a proposal is made to address climate-related issues building on the approach developed for environment mainstreaming. Where approaches specific to a climate change context are necessary, these are identified. in situations where an overarching environmental integration approach is advocated then climate-related issues are included as appro- priate. additional information and new skills and approaches are necessary to respond to these challenges, many of which we are only beginning to deal with but must now urgently develop. Climate-related concepts and termi- nology are covered in more detail in Chapter 2. ",

        "Guidelines on the inteGration of environment and Climate ChanGe in development Cooperation \u2013 Chapter 2 8 2.1 The environment and sustainable development 2.1.1 Environmental services and external costs Policies for development have generally concentrated on production and economic growth, without taking heed of the environment and the hidden functional services it provides. The result has been severe environmental damage, with some of the poorest countries being worst affected. amongst the poorest communities, natural resources such as fuelwood and water are essential to life. The irony is that these common-property resources can be depleted, annexed, or subject to over-exploitation, even while a country\u2019s economy appears to be growing vigor- ously. This helps explain the resilience of poverty in the face of demonstrable economic growth 4 . The millennium ecosystem assessment 5 highlights, for the first time on a global scale, that the environment \u2013 through the goods and services it provides to society and the economy \u2013 plays a critical role in our livelihoods. The natural environment provides four categories of services: provisioning (e.g. food, water, and fibre), regulating (e.g. climate, water and disease), cultural (e.g. spiritual, aesthetic, recreation and education) and supporting (e.g. primary production and soil formation). Changes to these services as part of a development process appear as \u2018invisible transactions\u2019 or \u2018externalities\u2019 in economic jargon, because they generate benefits or (more often) costs without financial compensation, and thus fail to be reflected in the market prices of goods and services. in the development process, an externality is an unintentional effect of an aid intervention that is external to the intervention logic, as defined by the logical frame- work approach. in other words, it is a consequence of activities other than the expected results or the objec- tives (see annex 6). Undesirable external environmental effects such as pollution or a diminished stock of natural resources have adverse social and economic effects on third parties or on future generations. They tend to be the rule rather than the exception. The rio declaration signed at the earth summit in 1992 states that: \u2018 National authorities should endeavour to promote the internalization of environmental costs and the use of economic instruments, taking into account the approach that the polluter should, in principle, bear the cost of pollution... \u2019 The principle of internalisation should encourage macroeconomic and institutional reforms in developing countries, such as environmental fiscal reform 6 . it influences the way cooperation is conducted by explicitly focusing attention on development-induced environ- mental impacts. it also leads to the idea that environmental concerns should be integrated with economic and social concerns, as defined in the concept of sustainable development. 2.1.2 Sustainable development The principles of sustainable development, one of the eU development cooperation objectives 7 , have arisen from a growing recognition that the needs of current generations must be reconciled with those of the future 8 , and that this requires dealing with economic, environmental and social policies in a mutually reinforcing way 9 . respect for future needs means safeguarding the natural resource base (or \u2018natural capital\u2019) likely to be required to sustain them. in this sense, the environment plays a central role since the question of sustainability arises as a direct response to concerns about issues of pollution, irreversible changes to ecosystems and climate, and the degrada- tion of forests, fisheries, water supplies, biodiversity and other natural resources. sustaining these resources into the future is also necessary to underpin social reforms that respect the rights of women, children and indigenous peoples, and provide a more equitable distribution of wealth. 4 dasgupta, P.

        "Guidelines on the inteGration of environment and Climate ChanGe in development Cooperation \u2013 Chapter 2 9 The three dimensions of sustainable development (environmental, economic and social) (see Fig. 1) are referred to as the \u2018pillars\u2019 of sustainable development. The pillars are distinct but closely interdependent. This means that the environmental pillar has links with the economic and social pillars, as explained hereafter. Figure\b1:\bThe\bthree\bdimensions\bof\bsustainable\bdevelopment Social development Sustainable development Environmental quality Economic development Environment and the economic pillar environmental services and economic goods can be interchanged to a certain degree, which can justify limited environmental losses in exchange for economic growth. But it is important to remember that these substitu- tions have their limits; neither aspect should outweigh the other. environmental services are not less valuable than economic goods. Breathing clean air, finding firewood for cooking, drinking clean water and being safe from floods\u2026 all provide for essential human needs. so, despite the fact that the environment has suffered from unbal- anced economic growth, the economic and environmental pillars play a complementary role in satisfying human needs. They are also interrelated. For instance, economic development can reduce our direct dependence on nature, and yet depends on the environment in several ways: \u00ce \u00ce raw materials used in the production of goods come from nature, as does the energy needed for produc- tion and transport. \u00ce \u00ce The cost of extracting raw materials tends to increase when natural resources become scarce or degraded. \u00ce \u00ce environmental services have a crucial importance but are not included in national accounts because they are difficult to value in monetary terms. \u00ce \u00ce adverse environmental effects (e.g. pollution, floods or fires) can damage or destroy economic goods and equipment. \u00ce \u00ce labour productivity is linked to the nutrition and health of workers, two variables which are directly influ- enced by the environment. \u00ce \u00ce sound environmental management and mainstreaming can reduce costs, through increased efficiency or through prevention, with an important potential for further development in this field. \u00ce \u00ce a high-quality environment is an important asset for tourism (as shown e.g. by the growth in ecotourism); it is also the basis for some indigenous peoples\u2019 livelihoods, and for an important share of pharmaceutical production.

        "Guidelines on the inteGration of environment and Climate ChanGe in development Cooperation \u2013 Chapter 2 10 Environment and the social pillar The environment affects people and especially the poor, who are particularly vulnerable to natural disasters (including the \u2018semi-natural\u2019 disasters made more frequent by climate change), and to reduced availability of resources such as clean water, fertile soils, fuelwood, wild foods, medicinal plants and other natural products. People are also vulnerable to unhealthy or unsafe environmental conditions. For example, people exposed to indoor air pollution in rural areas and to atmospheric air pollution in urban areas suffer chronic respiratory diseases; people can also be affected by diseases resulting from the consumption of contaminated water, and by poisoning due to the consumption of contaminated fish and shellfish (e.g. bioaccumulation of heavy metals). The impact can also be indirect. For example, soil erosion may lead to reduced land productivity, and thus to a decrease in nutrient intake by the population which weakens their immune systems; similar effects may be derived from the depletion of sources of protein (e.g. fish stocks, game) or medicinal plants. Just as a degraded environment will impact nega- tively on health, safety and livelihoods, opportunities to enhance the environment will result in a positive impact. Because social groups (e.g. women, minorities) may be affected differently by the environment, environmental changes may also have an impact on social relationships. For instance, mercury used in gold washing pollutes rivers and may generate conflicts with fishermen. moreover the depletion of shared resources, and the disruptions brought about by significant changes in climatic conditions, may exacerbate conflicts, as mentioned in section 2.3. on the other hand, successful transboundary environmental programmes can provide opportunities to contribute to peace and security. sound environmental management is strongly dependent on institutional and social factors, such as legislation, decentralisation, good governance, land tenure, property rights, participation, conflicts, gender equity and empowerment of traditionally less represented groups. Because of their particular importance in respect with eC cooperation, poverty, security issues, human rights and gender-related issues are further developed in sections 2.2, 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5. of these guidelines. Culture can be considered as a particular, but important, component of the social pillar. human cultures are often deeply rooted in a relationship with their environment, built on a particular vision of nature. sacred sites and emblematic or totemic species often have strong cultural importance, providing the local communities with vital social continuity. This is especially true for indigenous peoples, who have a long history of co-adaptation with their local environment and participation in the functioning of the ecosystem. These peoples have usually achieved a sustainable use of their natural resources, based on a deep and specialised knowledge of their environment and its biodiversity. They are particularly vulnerable in all aspects of their economic, cultural and social life to external pressures on their environment, including the stresses generated by climate change. development cooperation should be aware of the exceptional value that indigenous peoples have invested in their environment, and recog- nise their rights regarding land use, natural resources use, and intellectual property. EU Sustainable Development Strategy and development cooperation in June 2006, the european Council adopted a renewed eU sustainable development strategy 10 (sds) that calls, among other key objectives, for the eU to actively promote sustainable development worldwide, and ensure that the eU\u2019s internal and external policies are consistent with global sustainable development. The strategy\u2019s policy- guiding principles include the promotion and protection of fundamental rights; intra- and intergenerational equity; an open and democratic society; the involvement of citizens; the involvement of business and social partners; policy coherence and governance; policy integration (i.e. the integration of economic, social and environmental considerations so that they are coherent and mutually reinforce each other); the use of best available knowledge; the precautionary principle 11 ; and the \u2018polluter pays principle\u2019. The new sds identifies seven key challenges to be addressed by the eU, including \u2018 global poverty and sustainable development challenges \u2019. in this regard, the first progress report on the implementation of the new strategy notes that \u2018 pressures on environmental sustainability remain high \u2019, and access to key natural resources such as water, wood and arable land is problematic in many regions of the world \u2013 with impacts on poverty and the potential to cause conflicts. among a series of outstanding issues to be addressed, the Commission\u2019s report identifies the need to tackle the growing challenge of environmental migrants (both within and across borders) caused by envi- ronmental degradation, to ensure that the environmental component of sustainable development is given sufficient consideration in the allocation of aid, and to design trade policies so that they effectively contribute to sustainable 10 Review of the EU Sustainable Development Strategy (EU SDS) \u2013 Renewed Strategy , Council of the european Union, note no. 10917/06 of 26 June 2006. 11 Principle contained in the rio declaration but debated in europe following a series of food crises: refer to the Communication from the Commission on the precautionary principle , Com(2000) 1 final (02.02.2000); see: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/lexUriserv/site/en/com/2000/ com2000_0001en01.pdf.

        "Guidelines on the inteGration of environment and Climate ChanGe in development Cooperation \u2013 Chapter 2 11 development 12 . These priorities stem in particular from the scale of the problem posed by global warming for devel- oping countries, from the tensions that exist between developmental goals 13 , and from the emergence of complex new challenges such as the social and environmental impacts of the growing demand for biofuels 14 . The new eU sds, as well as the findings of the first progress report, clearly call for better integration of environ- mental considerations into the planning, implementation and evaluation of development interventions. in so doing, several important lessons on sustainability that have emerged from experience in development cooperation should be considered, as follows. Prevention and upstream decision making Prevention is usually better than cure, and reducing future damage is an inherent objective of sustainable devel- opment. With regard to climate change, for instance, it has been shown that the benefits of early global action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions significantly outweigh the costs; the earlier effective measures are imple- mented, the lower the ultimate cost to society 15 . With respect to development cooperation, this principle implies a duty to take action in the face of unfavourable trends, and to integrate environmental considerations (including those related to climate change) at an early stage of decision making, i.e. at the policy making and programming stage and in the first phases of the cycle of operations. of course, monitoring, strategy refinement and, if needed, the adoption of corrective measures remain necessary in the subsequent phases. Local resource ownership The management and harvest of natural resources implies some mixture of traditional, private or government involve- ment. a key lesson from studies of natural resource use is that sustainability requires long-term secure control and ownership of the resource 16 . a user only has the incentive to conserve a resource if they feel that they or their descendants will reap the benefits of this moderation in the future 17 . an example of this may be provided by commu- nity forestry, where forest land previously managed by state services is allocated to communities or decentralised institutions, creating incentives for sustainable management practices. similarly studies suggest that secure prop- erty rights over land can be considered a pre-condition for pro-poor and sustainable economic growth 18 . Participation sustainable development also advocates clear principles relating to transparency, participation and accounta- bility in decision making. Participation of stakeholders is recognised as a key sustainability factor in development cooperation. This should involve not only target beneficiaries (men and women), but also stakeholders potentially affected by environmental impacts, including traditionally less represented groups. The eC has also particular obli- gations under the aarhus Convention 19 , which requires it to allow the public and stakeholders to have a say in the decision-making process with respect to environmental issues, including in development cooperation. An ecosystem perspective The ecosystem perspective takes a broader view of natural resources to look at the effects of their use on the complex functional relationships within ecosystems, on broader supporting processes (e.g. nutrient and hydrolog- ical cycles and soil formation) and downstream on non-target species or neighbouring ecosystems. For instance, accidental harvesting of non-target species can be sufficiently great to cause concern over their conservation; this is particularly true of the by-catch in fisheries. or land-based activities, such as agriculture and the resulting ferti- liser run-off or sewage disposal, can impact on neighbouring bodies of water, with adverse consequences on local and downstream natural systems and production activities; frequently the whole watershed and river system is the appropriate ecological unit for assessment. an \u2018ecosystem approach\u2019 to natural resource management calls for the involvement of stakeholders from many sectors because different sector policies and activities impact on the 12 Progress Report on the Sustainable Development Strategy 2007 , Com(2007)642 final (22.10.2007). 13 The level of economic development needed to alleviate poverty notably requires an increase in industrial production, in food and raw materials consumption and in mobility. 14 ecorys (2008) Progress on EU Sustainable Development Strategy \u2013 Final Report , Brussels/rotterdam; see: http://ec.europa.eu/ sustainable/docs/sds_progress_report.pdf. 15 stern, n.

By interacting with other environmental trends and the intensification of the existing pressures (from industrialisation, globalisa- tion, rapid urbanisation and demographic growth) on natural resources, it poses a significant and increasingly well- documented threat, not only to the environment, but also to the economic and social pillars of sustainable devel- opment. Climate change should be taken into account in development interventions because it has the poten- tial to slow down or even halt and reverse progress towards sustainable development and the achievement of the millennium development Goals (mdGs). Box 1 provides working definitions of climate variability and climate change, two related but different concepts that will be used further in these guidelines. it also explains which of these concepts is most relevant to a development intervention, given its lifetime and nature. Box 1: Climate change and climate variability Climate change refers to shifts in average climatic parameters and/or in the magnitude of climate variability that are observed and persist over extended periods of time (typically decades or longer). like climate variability, it can be induced by both natural and anthropogenic factors. in these guidelines, \u2018climate change\u2019 is used to refer to the long-term changes in climate directly and indirectly caused by human activities combined with those originating from natural climate evolution and variability. This is in line with the definition provided by the intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (iPCC) 21 . Climate variability refers to short-term variations in the mean state and other statistics of the climate (e.g. ampli- tude of variations, extreme values, frequency of occurrence of extremes). Climate variability is an inherent feature of climate. it is generated by natural processes within climatic systems \u2013 but can also be enhanced by anthropo- genic factors such as the accumulation of greenhouse gases (GhGs) in the atmosphere. it can be measured on various time scales beyond the scale of individual weather events. in these guidelines, \u2018climate variability\u2019 is used primarily to refer to variations in climate observed over relatively short periods (typically less than a decade), and \u2018increasing climate variability\u2019 is taken to be one of the consequences of the ongoing climate change process. \u2018Climate-related\u2019 aspects, issues, concerns, risks etc. as used in these guidelines include climate change and climate variability, separately or together. When assessing the climate exposure and sensitivity of development projects with a lifetime or significant conse- quences not exceeding ten years, the focus should be on climate variability, based on statistics available for the past decade or longer. Climatic trends based on the recent past are likely to provide sufficient information to build scenarios for the coming decade, and devise climate risk management strategies accordingly. When assessing the climate exposure and sensitivity of development projects with a longer lifetime (e.g. infra- structure projects), as well as the exposure and sensitivity of supported policies, programmes and strategic plans, both climate variability (short- and medium-term perspective) and climate change (longer-term perspec- tive) should in principle be taken into account. Taking a long view is more complicated however. For many areas of the globe, climatic models still produce significantly different and sometimes contradictory long-term forecasts on the direction and amplitude of climate change. There is a general agreement that temperatures will globally increase and that sea levels will rise (although by how much is still disputed), but for many regions of the world, models still disagree on the direction as well as the amplitude of long-term changes in rainfall. Furthermore, currently climatic models produce average forecasts of climate evolution for territorial \u2018cells\u2019 of 200 x 200 km that may in fact encompass very different climatic zones (e.g. low-lying coastal zones and mountainous areas). These forecasts cannot be \u2018downscaled\u2019 to a useful level of resolution (e.g. the area covered by a given project) without further ad hoc processing, using local climatic data to complement the inputs of global models. 20 Biodiversity in development Project (2001) Guiding Principles for Biodiversity in Development , lessons from field projects , eC/dFid/iUCn. see also: the ecosystem approach page on the website of the Convention on Biological diversity: http://www.cbd.int/ecosystem; and the website of the millennium ecosystem assessment, from which various reports can be downloaded: http://www.millenniumassessment.org/ en/index.aspx. 21 iPCC (2007) Climate Change 2007: synthesis report, intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Fourth assessment report; see: www.ipcc.ch. note however that the UnFCCC makes a distinction between climate change attributable to human activities altering the atmospheric composition and climate variability attributable to natural causes.

        "Guidelines on the inteGration of environment and Climate ChanGe in development Cooperation \u2013 Chapter 2 13 according to climatologists, higher concentrations of GhGs in the atmosphere are already causing and will increas- ingly contribute to changes in wind, temperature and rainfall patterns, a higher frequency of extreme weather events, widespread melting of snow and ice, a rise in sea levels, the acidification of oceans, changes in ocean circulation and seasonal patterns, and generally greater climate variability. These changes will in turn have signif- icant effects on ecosystems as well as human activities. For example, the increasing scarcity of freshwater, the expected reduction in crop yields, livestock and forest productivity in many regions of the world, as well as the possible collapse of fish stocks as a result of ocean acidification, are likely to have adverse impacts on food secu- rity and severely threaten rural but also urban livelihoods. The destruction of infrastructure (transport, energy, industry, human settlements etc.) by extreme weather events, the rise in sea levels, coastal erosion etc. can lead to severe disruptions of economic activity as well as major social and humanitarian catastrophes. health impacts resulting from the changed distribution of disease vectors, malnutrition, heat stress, floods, droughts, declining water and air quality, and large-scale displacement of populations, may place a substantial additional burden on already over-stretched health services 22 . at the same time, sustainable development is the key to reducing vulnerability and, ultimately, exposure to climate change. The capacity of human societies both to adapt to and to mitigate the effects of climate change depends as much on socio-economic factors as on geographical ones. The chosen development pathways can contribute to climate change mitigation or, on the contrary, make it more difficult. Box 2 introduces the concepts of climate change adaptation and mitigation. 22 iPCC (2007) op. cit. ",
        "Guidelines on the inteGration of environment and Climate ChanGe in development Cooperation \u2013 Chapter 2 14 Box 2: Responding to climate change Vulnerability to climate change in developed and developing countries is a function of both exposure (the extent to which one is exposed to the effects of climate change, considering that these effects will vary in nature and inten- sity across regions of the world) and sensitivity (how severely one is actually affected, considering capacity to adapt through the adoption of risk prevention and mitigation measures) 23 . responding to climate change should encompasses these two dimensions: \u00ce \u00ce adaptation to climate change aims to reduce sensitivity to its effects, both in the short and in the long term; it involves adjustments in practices, processes and infrastructure but also changes in social and institutional structures and decision-making processes; it is widely accepted that developed countries, which have been historically responsible for the bulk of anthropogenic GhG emissions and are still a major contributor, have a duty to help developing countries cope with effects that can no longer be avoided. \u00ce \u00ce Climate change mitigation, i.e. efforts to reduce GhG emissions and ultimately stabilise their atmospheric concentration, aims to reduce exposure to climate change; although most developed countries, which have the largest GhG emissions per capita, accept that they should contribute most to the mitigation effort, the stabilisation of GhG levels can only be achieved with the support of all countries and sectors; it is therefore important that development cooperation interventions, as well as other initiatives such as the Kyoto Protocol\u2019s Clean development mechanism, help partner countries opt for climate-neutral devel- opment paths\u2014and provide access to the technical and financial resources required for this purpose. adaptation to increasing climate variability and climate change should ideally rest on a combination of \u2018top-down\u2019 and \u2018bottom-up\u2019 approaches to develop appropriate solutions: \u00ce \u00ce The top-down approach is model- and scenario-driven; it uses the information provided by climatic models, downscaled (to the extent possible) to the appropriate territory, to determine expected physical impacts and \u2018bio-physical vulnerability\u2019. \u00ce \u00ce The bottom-up approach is based on an assessment of \u2018social vulnerability\u2019 to climate change exposure; it uses a stakeholder approach, and information on prevailing socio-economic and environmental condi- tions (e.g. income and livelihoods, consumption, health, education, inequalities in access to infrastruc- ture, services and resources, including environmental services and natural resources, \u2026), on existing infrastructure, available technologies, institutions, etc. to assess the main vulnerabilities and the adaptive capacity of the society or group(s) concerned by a given policy or development intervention. adaptation is typically the primary concern in developing countries; mitigation is also relevant as these responses are not mutually exclusive and there are synergies to be realised between them. By focusing both on the envi- ronmental impacts generated by development activities, and on the environmental risks and constraints to which development programmes and projects are subject, the tools and methods proposed in these guidelines address both dimensions of the response to the climate change challenge. it is important to note that an analysis of envi- ronmental risks and constraints also highlights development opportunities to be considered in the formulation of policies, programmes and projects (see Box 3). 23 iPCC (2007) op. cit.

        "Guidelines on the inteGration of environment and Climate ChanGe in development Cooperation \u2013 Chapter 2 15 2.2\bThe\benvironment\band\bpoverty\breduction The eradication of poverty in the context of sustainable development is the fundamental objective of eU develop- ment policy, as stipulated in european Consensus on development 24 . Because the environment plays a key role in the livelihoods of the poorest communities, it should be managed in such a way that it contributes to this overall objective of poverty alleviation. Poverty can be described as the condition when basic human needs are unsatisfied. The poor lack capital and are usually not covered by wealth redistribution mechanisms; consequently their livelihoods are closely dependent on the productivity of natural resources and their own labour. This makes them vulnerable to any decline in the productivity of natural resources and to any unhealthy conditions (including unclean water, indoor air pollution, and toxic chemicals) that affect their capacity to work. Thus degraded environmental conditions, including those exacerbated by climate change, have a direct and important relationship with poverty. The poor are also the most vulnerable to natural disasters such as storms, floods, droughts, crop pests and environmentally-related conflicts. The poor in developing countries are widely considered to be the human group that will suffer earliest and most from climate change 25 , as they tend to live in the geographically most exposed regions of the planet, often remain directly dependent on agriculture (the sector likely to suffer most), and are made more vulnerable by the other stresses that characterise poverty, such as inadequate housing conditions, lack of adequate social services, fragile health and the incapacity to afford insurance or risk management expenditures. Poor people lack the financial capital needed to invest and often use any available natural capital to survive. For populations that depend on natural resources, this process of consuming them often depletes the natural capital base and thus results in increasing poverty. managing the environment to deliver pro-poor benefits (such as improved water supply and sanitation, improved management of local fisheries, or interventions in forestry and protected areas that involve local people) should be part of poverty alleviation strategies. This does not mean that what is done in the name of the environment is necessarily and by definition good for the poor but it does mean considering the effects of environmental changes on the poor and the factors affecting environment\u2013poverty relationships. These include land tenure, access rights to natural resources, participation in land and resource management, and the share of work between men and women with respect to the collection of basic resources like firewood and water. a paper by major development partners (including the eC) comprehensively addresses the links between poverty reduction and environmental management 26 . a more recent publication of the World Bank addresses poverty\u2013environment linkages at the household level 27 . in certain cases however the question arises of whether safeguarding environmental services of global signifi- cance is compatible with poverty alleviation concerns. For example, choosing solar energy technology over coal or diesel fuel reduces GhG emissions, but may be more costly, at least in the short run, and if one ignores other \u2018positive externalities\u2019 such as reduced air pollution or reduced dependence on imported energy sources. similarly, protecting natural habitats for the conservation of biodiversity may require regulating access of local communities to natural resources 28 while providing financial support for the poor. as far as possible, conflict should be reduced or avoided, for example by promoting controlled eco-tourism or sustainable harvesting so as to provide revenue and local employment. some mechanisms, such as the Global environmental Facility (GeF) grants 29 , cover the incremental costs associated with transforming a project with national benefits that may have global environmental costs to one with both national and global benefits. 2.3\bThe\benvironment\band\bsecurity mainstreaming environment including climate-related aspects in development cooperation activities may also contribute to stability and peace. There is a clear link between environment and security, and more precisely between the management of scarce or abundant natural resources and conflict. 24 Joint statement by the Council and the representatives of the governments of the member states meeting within the Council, the european Parliament and the Commission on european Union development Policy: \u201cThe european Consensus\u201d, Official Journal of the European Union , 2006/C46/01. 25 iPCC (2007) op. cit. ; stern, n.

        "Guidelines on the inteGration of environment and Climate ChanGe in development Cooperation \u2013 Chapter 2 16 stress and competing demands on scarce environmental resources (e.g. drinking water, fertile soil \u2013 essential for food production and basic livelihood for large segments of the population), and the fight for access to and control over abundant and financially valuable environmental resources (e.g. timber, gum arabic) may lead to tensions, instability, and violent conflict. stress on such resources (brought about for instance by pasture and soil degra- dation, drought, or population growth and migration) can exacerbate tensions over access and lead to violent conflicts (e.g. second civil war 1983\u20132004 in sudan which was fuelled by the dispute between the south and the north over oil and water; tension on water issues between india and Bangladesh). migration is a natural consequence of environmental stress: people are forced to leave their homelands because of the degradation or lack of environmental resources needed for their survival. in 2005, it was estimated that up to 50 million people would be displaced by 2010 due to environmental degradation and the effects of global warming (floods, droughts and expansion of desertification) 30 ; by 2050, this figure could rise to 250 million people permanently displaced as a result of climate change, as they try to escape extreme weather events or simply the slow but inexorable destruction of their livelihoods by gradual climate change 31 . environmental refugees can have an important impact on security and on the environment in the host areas. refugee camps often create environ- mental problems and disputes between the refugees and the local population related to access to, control over and management of resources, which can lead to civil disorder, insecurity and violent conflict. it is crucial that envi- ronmental considerations are taken into account during post-conflict reconstruction processes, both to ensure that these efforts do not adversely impact the environment and that environmental pressures do not fuel renewed conflict. Conversely, migration and security considerations should be taken into account when weighing the costs and benefits of investing in climate change adaptation and mitigations measures. mass migration from the worst affected areas, even if it remains primarily internal, may indeed have destabilising consequences for the countries concerned, as well as cross-border implications and effects on more affluent regions of the world 32 . on the other hand, it is important to note that environmental cooperation can be an extraordinary element of stability and peace and even of reconciliation. it is therefore essential to promote sustainable development and sustainable shared management of natural resources with the objective to protect the environment and at the same time to contribute to poverty reduction and stability. an interesting example comes from confidence-building activities where two or more parties seek cooperative solutions to manage shared natural resources (e.g. water) that could otherwise become sources of conflict. another instrument is the establishment of cross-border conser- vation areas, sometimes known as \u2018peace parks\u2019, which promote regional cooperation and biodiversity conserva- tion. These usually extend far beyond designated protected areas and can incorporate a wide range of commu- nity-based natural resource management programmes. 2.4\bHuman\brights,\bgovernance\band\bthe\benvironment The eU is founded on the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law. These principles should also underlie the objectives for eC cooperation. human rights are a precondition for sustainable development and proper environmental protection. rights to life and security, as established by the Universal declaration of human rights, and the right to health, as established by the Convention on the rights of the Child, cannot be fulfilled or are violated when people become exposed to life-threatening envi- ronmental hazards such as toxic wastes, pollutants or hazardous radiations. The rights to have access to a means of subsistence and be free from hunger are also violated when land, water, or other natural resources become highly polluted or degraded. a violation of a fundamental human right, such as the right to participate in the conduct of public affairs, can also lead to environmental degradation. in a well-functioning democracy where good governance prevails, any plans or programmes that may have adverse environmental impacts will be shared openly with citizens, public govern- ment bodies and civil society. By allowing for transparency and participatory processes, citizens can voice their concerns and alternative solutions or remedial actions can be pursued to safeguard the environment and the public interest. it is therefore not surprising that human rights violations, including suppressing information, free media and the participation of people in decision-making processes, are associated with many environmental catastrophes 33 . 30 myers, n.

        "Guidelines on the inteGration of environment and Climate ChanGe in development Cooperation \u2013 Chapter 2 17 as a consequence of the broad acceptance of the interdependence between the enjoyment of human rights and a healthy environment 34 , the more recent human rights instruments 35 define the right to a healthy environment as a human right in itself. similarly environmental instruments, such as the aforementioned aarhus Convention 36 , attach importance to essential civil and political human rights principles such as access to information, participation and effective remedies. These normative developments are also confirmed in the eC communication on Governance in the european Consensus on development 37 , which identifies the \u2018 sustainable management of natural and energy resources and of the environment \u2019 as one of the multiple facets of governance and promotes a \u2018holistic\u2019 (political, economic, social, cultural, environmental, etc.) approach to democratic governance, in recognition of the fact that these aspects are \u2018 often very tightly interwoven \u2019. 2.5\bGender\band\bthe\benvironment There are two major reasons why gender should be considered in the context of environmental integration. Firstly, the \u2018socially constructed\u2019 gender roles of women and men are often reflected by different needs, activities and practices. as a result, they may both produce different pressures on the environment, and be affected differently by environmental change. The second reason is derived from the principle of human equality, which asserts that all groups which, in a given context, find themselves at a disadvantage deserve special attention, including in rela- tion to their environmental conditions. any project or programme addressing environmental issues should clearly identify its target groups according to their particular linkages with the environment. in situations where men are the community \u2018leaders\u2019, women may be the key stakeholders concerned with activities such as food crop production, adopting fuel-saving stoves, sorting and properly disposing of domestic waste etc., while men may be more involved in hunting or timber harvesting, for example. These kinds of distinctions may be of particular importance when identifying alternatives to the use of natural resources, for example small animal husbandry as a substitute for poaching as a source of meat. if animal husbandry is practiced by women and hunting by men the substitution may fail, especially if hunting is associated with social and cultural status and thus strongly gender role-related. even in projects with less direct linkages to the environment and without any environmental objective, gender- differentiated effects may result in important indirect environmental consequences. For example, job creation, which is usually not gender-neutral, and changes in reproductive behaviour, an issue closely related to sex and gender, affect migrations and population growth and thus have considerable indirect impacts on the environment and sustainable development. men and women are also affected differently by changes in their environment, thus by the environmental impacts of projects and programmes as well as the prevailing environmental risks and constraints. Wood and clean water scarcity, for example, may increase the time spent by women and girls in collecting fuel and water, which may have long-term consequences if as a result girls are prevented from attending school. similarly, a decrease in fish stocks may result in more time being spent away from the home by fishermen, with indirect consequences on family life, food security and income. The conflicts and migrations potentially triggered or amplified by the effects of climate change may have particularly negative impacts on the security, health and livelihoods of women, who in many soci- eties are more vulnerable than men to the consequences of social disruption. Generally speaking, natural disasters and rapid changes in environmental conditions amplify existing inequalities, including gender inequalities. When designing a project that will change the environment, or be subject to environmental and climate-related risks or constraints, these kinds of gender-differentiated environmental impacts should be taken into account, in addition to direct impacts. another example is indoor pollution from cooking fires which disproportionately affects women and young children. in practical terms it is important to incorporate gender considerations and more generally the social dimension into the scope and design of environmental and climate-related assessments; to ensure that the results of assess- 34 For more information on the interrelatedness and interdependence between human rights and the environment, see: www.unhcr.org/environment/. 35 These instruments are the Convention on the rights of the Child (1989), ilo Convention no. 169 on indigenous and Tribal Peoples in independent Countries (1989), and the following regional instruments: the african Charter on human and Peoples\u2019 rights (1981) and the Protocol of san salvador to the american Convention on human rights (1988). 36 The Convention on Biological diversity (1993) is another such example. 37 Governance in the European Consensus on Development: Towards a harmonised approach within the European Union , Com(2006) 421 final (30.08.2006).

Key steps include the 1972 United nations Conference on the human environment held in stockholm 38 , the 1987 Brundtland report 39 (\u2018 Our Common Future \u2019), and the United nations Conference on environment and development, held in rio 40 in 1992, which reaffirmed and built on the stockholm conference with the goal of establishing an equitable global partnership through the creation of new levels of cooperation by working towards international agreements that respect the interests of all and protect the integrity of the global environmental and developmental system. This led in 1996 to the definition by the oeCd of international development objectives of \u2018environmental sustainability and regeneration\u2019 41 , and in 2000 to a global commitment to the millennium development Goals 42 , the seventh of which (mdG 7) is \u2018 to ensure environmental sustainability \u2019 through four specific targets: \u00ce \u00ce Target 7.a: integrate the principles of sustainable development into country policies and programmes and reverse the loss of environmental resources. \u00ce \u00ce Target 7.B: reduce biodiversity loss, achieving, by 2010, a significant reduction in the rate of loss. \u00ce \u00ce Target 7.C: halve, by 2015, the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation. \u00ce \u00ce Target 7.d: By 2020, to have achieved a significant improvement in the lives of at least 100 million slum dwellers. in addition, the achievement of other mdGs is also related to environmental aspects. 2.6.2 The policy and legal basis The european Community has a long-standing commitment to address environmental concerns in its develop- ment programmes and projects, as part of a wider commitment to sustainable development. article 6 of the amsterdam Treaty stipulates that \u2018 environmental protection requirements must be integrated into the definition and implementation of the Community policies and activities (\u2026) with a view to promoting sustainable development \u2019, as enshrined in the spirit of agenda 21 of the 1992 rio earth summit 43 . The systematic considera- tion of environmental aspects into eC development cooperation, as in other policies, is part of the Cardiff process, launched in 1998 by the european Council 44 . Consequently the eC\u2019s development policy 45 of 24 april 2000 iden- tified the environment as a key cross-cutting issue to be mainstreamed into all priority themes, and on 31 may 2001 the Council endorsed the eC proposed a Strategy on Integrating the Environment into EC Economic and Development Cooperation 46 . more recently, at its meeting of 25 June 2009, the Council of the european Union adopted the conclusions on the Commission staff Working Paper on environmental integration in development Cooperation 47 . in its conclusions, the Council noted that the european Commission and member states face similar challenges to address environment in their development assistance, increased by the additional threats posed by climate change. The Council invited the Commission to prepare an ambitious eU-wide environment inte- gration strategy by late 2011, in close collaboration with member states. 38 report of the Un Conference on the human environment, stockholm, 1972; see: www.unep.org/documents.multilingual/default. asp?documentid=97&articleid. 39 World Commission on environment and development (1987) op. cit. 40 rio declaration on environment and development, 1992; see: http://www.unep.org/documents.multilingual/default.asp?documentid=78& articleid=1163. 41 oeCd (1996) Shaping the 21 st Century: The contribution of development cooperation , organisation for economic Cooperation and development: Paris; see: http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/23/35/2508761.pdf. 42 The mdGs were endorsed by world leaders in september 2000 at the Un millennium summit; see: www.un.org/millenniumgoals. 43 see: http://www.un.org/geninfo/bp/enviro.html. 44 Integrating environmental considerations into other policy areas \u2013 a stocktaking of the Cardiff Process, Com(2004) 394 final (01.06.2004), and Report of the Cardiff process ; see: http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/environment/sustainable_development/l28075_en.htm. 45 The European Community\u2019s Development Policy , Com(2000) 212 final (26.04.2000). 46 Integrating the Environment into EC Economic and Development Cooperation, a global strategy , seC(2001) 609 (10.04.2001). 47 Improving environmental integration in development cooperation , seC(2009) 555 (21.04.2009); and Council Conclusions on integrating environment in development cooperation , 2953rd environment Council meeting, luxembourg, 29 June 2009.

        "Guidelines on the inteGration of environment and Climate ChanGe in development Cooperation \u2013 Chapter 2 19 The 2005 European Consensus on Development explicitly recognises the links between development and environment, and highlights the need for a \u2018 strengthened approach to mainstreaming of cross-cutting issues \u2018 , by making \u2018 systematic and strategic use of all resources \u2018 available to this effect 48 . This is in line with the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness , in which donors commit to work towards harmonised approaches on envi- ronmental assessments at the sector and national level. Furthermore, the 2005 development policy identifies envi- ronment and sustainable management of natural resources (including management and protection of forests, water, marine resources and biodiversity, access to sustainable energies, climatic change, desertification and soil degradation, management of chemical products and waste, sustainable production and consumption methods) as one of the nine areas for community action. in this context, the communication on Policy Coherence for Development 49 , prepared for the 2005 Un summit building on earlier results from the World summit on sustainable development of 2002, contains a number of specific commitments with respect to environment and efforts needed to achieve the mdGs, including mdG 7. The renewed EU Sustainable Development Strategy , already mentioned (see section 2.1.2), emphasizes the importance of the external dimensions of the three pillars of sustainable development, including the environment, in eU policies. The 2005 EU strategy for Africa 50 also identifies a \u2018 healthy environment \u2019 as \u2018 one of the most valu- able assets for the development of Africa\u2019 . it mentions various types of actions to be supported by eU assistance, including actions to counter the effects of climate change. accordingly, the First action Plan of the Joint africa-eU strategy devised at the lisbon summit (2007) includes climate change as one of eight topics around which to develop africa-eU strategic partnerships. Building on the European Consensus , the new instrument for development cooperation (dCi, adopted in 2007) makes provisions for environment and natural resources to be addressed both under the geographic programme and under a dedicated thematic programme. in addition to supporting dedicated actions, the latter aims to enhance environmental integration efforts, including through global actions in support of partner coun- tries 51 . Finally but very importantly, the dCi requires environmental screening and impact assessments to be under- taken as appropriate for project- and sector-level interventions. 2.6.3 Multilateral Environmental Agreements most developing countries are parties to multilateral environmental agreements (meas) and therefore also have obligations to fulfil under these frameworks. The eC is determined to help them meet these obligations. The eC is a strong advocate for the mainstreaming of mea national action Plans of developing countries in their national development strategies. often referred to as the \u2018 Rio Conventions\u2019 , the three main meas are the Un Framework Convention on Climate Change 52 (UnFCCC), the Un Convention to Combat desertification 53 (UnCCd) and the Un Convention on Biological diversity 54 (UnCBd). The UnFCCC and its Kyoto Protocol as well as the agreement that is due to succeed the Kyoto Protocol from 2013 are key issues under negotiation at the international level. several developing countries (i.e. non-annex i countries that do not have binding GhG reduction targets under the Kyoto Protocol) are now middle-income countries. Their rising economic activity is progressively becoming an important source of GhG emissions. This is especially the case for a few large countries such as China, india and Brazil. in 2003, the eC put forward an EU Climate Change Strategy for support to partner countries 55 and, more recently, proposed a Global Alliance on Climate Change 56 . Both initiatives aim on one hand to support the efforts of developing countries to adapt to the effects induced by climate change (adaptation measures) and on the other hand to support efforts to mitigate the effects of climate change by limiting GhG emissions through, for instance, cleaner energy, transportation and production processes (mitigation measures). in the context of and beyond these initiatives, it is also essential that eC devel- opment strategies and specific interventions take climate change into account in order to design and implement strategies, programmes and projects that are resilient to the effects of climate change and contribute to global mitigation efforts. 48 \u00a7 102. The Consensus also includes a reference to carrying out strategic environmental assessments (sea) on a systematic basis, including in relation to budget and sector aid. 49 Policy Coherence for Development: accelerating progress towards attaining the Millennium Development Goals , Com(2005) 134 final (12.04.2005). 50 EU Strategy for Africa: Towards a Euro-African pact to accelerate Africa\u2019s development , Com(2005) 489 final (12.10.2005). 51 External Action: Thematic Programme for environment and sustainable management of natural resources including energy , Com(2006) 20 final (25.01.2006). 52 see: http://unfccc.int. 53 see: www.unccd.int. 54 see: www.biodiv.org. 55 included in the communication on Climate Change in the Context of Development Cooperation , Com(2003) 85 final (11.03.2003). 56 Building the Global Climate Change Alliance between the European Union and poor developing countries most vulnerable to climate change , Com(2007) 540 final (18.09.2007).

        "Guidelines on the inteGration of environment and Climate ChanGe in development Cooperation \u2013 Chapter 2 20 The UnCCd addresses an issue which is affecting mainly developing countries and is most directly related to development. most of the african continent is affected by desertification and land degradation, as are important parts of latin america and Central asia. developing countries parties to the Convention have to develop a national action Plan (naP); an important effort in this direction has been made recently and most affected parties now have designed their naP, but little progress has been made so far towards implementation. a central problem lies in the fact that these naPs have been drafted as stand-alone strategies, while most of the countries\u2019 efforts are geared towards the implementation of national development strategies 57 . a key issue is thus to link and integrate the UnCCd naP and other mea strategic documents into the national development strategies, in order to secure adequate funding to address the desertification problem. The Commission is supporting initiatives in this direction and is calling affected parties to mainstream these issues into their national strategies. loss of biodiversity has increased exponentially during the last decades and it is becoming increasingly urgent to take decisive action in order to halt this loss. The UnCBd has been adopted to address this issue and includes texts on related problems (e.g. Cartagena protocol on bio-safety). There is often a perception that biodiversity loss is not of great importance to development, however increasing scientific evidence that biodiversity is the basis of several economic and social sectors should help revert this thinking. The eC has adopted a Biodiversity Action Plan for Economic and Development Cooperation 58 with the strategic aim of mainstreaming biodiversity objectives into cooperation strategies, plans and programmes as well as in policy dialogue with developing coun- tries. it also aims to support sustainable use of natural resources, particularly in relation to forests, grasslands and marine/coastal ecosystems, to strengthen the capacity of relevant agencies involved in conservation and sustain- able use of biodiversity, and to co-ordinate implementation with third countries\u2019, other donors\u2019 and international institutions\u2019 own biodiversity strategies. other meas address other important international environmental issues. amongst these are the stockholm Convention on Persistent organic Pollutants 59 , the rotterdam Convention on prior informed consent for inter- national movements of hazardous chemicals 60 , and the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary movements of hazardous Wastes and their disposal 61 . 2.7\b\bAll\bsectors\bare\bconcerned:\benvironmental\bopportunities,\bconstraints\band\b impacts Because the environment plays a key role in human well-being and activities, several sectors are particularly and directly dependent on the environment. These include for example health (as many diseases are caused by pollu- tion or other degraded environmental conditions), and areas directly involved in the use of natural resources, such as fisheries, agriculture and forestry. however, because sectors are interdependent, all are influenced in some way by the environment. in these guidelines, environmental conditions (including climate) are referred to as environ- mental opportunities if they are expected to have a positive influence on a sector (or a sector policy), and risks and constraints if the influence is expected to be negative. in turn, human activities in all sectors produce effects or consequences on the environment (e.g. deforestation, biodiversity loss, soil erosion, air pollution, water contamination), which are usually referred to as environmental impacts . impacts may be positive or negative, direct or indirect, visible or not. For example, sectors such as trans- port, energy, agriculture and industry directly pollute and consume natural resources. other sectors, such as educa- tion, governance or macroeconomic reforms have more indirect impacts, through changing behaviour and practices affecting the environment (both positively and negatively). depending on their intensity, duration, frequency, revers- ibility, cumulative or synergic nature and socio-economic consequences, potential impacts can (or not) be consid- ered to be significant , i.e. important enough to justify mitigation or enhancement measures. addressing issues related to these significant impacts may be part of eC support to sector programmes and policies. some sectors are more vulnerable to environmental changes (including those resulting from climate change), others produce higher impacts, and all sectors have the potential for environmental integration. Using govern- ance and institutions as an example, potential environmental integration entry points include: environmental insti- tutions and capacities; land use planning institutions and capacities; legislative capacity; environmental law; envi- 57 The same problem arises with the national adaptation Programmes of action that the least developed countries have prepared in the context of the UnFCCC. 58 Biodiversity action plan for economic and development cooperation , Com(2001) 162 final (27.03.2001). 59 see: http://chm.pops.int/. 60 see: www.pic.int. 61 see: www.basel.int.

Sector guidance \u00ce Annex 1 When a decision is made to work in a particular focal sector, the specific linkages of this sector with the envi- ronment (including climate-related aspects) should thus be identified. These linkages between the environment, climate change and all sectors are the reason why the environment is considered a \u2018cross-cutting\u2019 issue, in addi- tion to being a \u2018sector\u2019 in itself. 2.8\bThe\badded\bvalue\bof\benvironmental\bmainstreaming as a conclusion to this chapter, environmental mainstreaming (including the mainstreaming of the response to climate change) is not considered as a goal in itself but as a means of bringing added value in the following ways: \u00ce \u00ce addressing environmental and climate-related aspects across all sectors will improve the relevance, effi- ciency, effectiveness, sustainability and impact of poverty reduction efforts. \u00ce \u00ce Because co-management of the environment by all involved stakeholders means peaceful cooperation, peace and security will be strengthened too. \u00ce \u00ce The risk of environmental disasters and social crises caused by environmental degradation and climate change will be mitigated. \u00ce \u00ce The need for emergency aid will be reduced, as well as the social, economic and financial costs saved by preventive action. \u00ce \u00ce Balanced and win-win solutions can be found to accommodate different concerns, including global and local, economic, social and environmental, material and cultural ones. For instance, synergies exist between climate change adaptation and mitigation measures (e.g. avoided deforestation can strengthen ecosystem resilience to the effects of climate variability and change), and some of these measures can make an immediate and positive contribution to other environmental, economic and social objectives (see Box 3). \u00ce \u00ce addressing \u2018externalities\u2019, even in cases where this entails a negative impact on financial performance, will increase the economic and social benefits of cooperation programmes and projects \u2013 which should be the ultimate objective of development interventions by public sector organisations. \u00ce \u00ce environmental awareness and capacity building for environmental management, including the design of appropriate responses to climate-related challenges, can have a tremendous empowerment potential for the poor, for women, for indigenous peoples and for all citizens in general in that they foster a culture of shared democracy, participation and rights-awareness. \u00ce \u00ce The interest of future generations will be respected resulting in increasingly sustainable development. These expected benefits should be kept in mind and guide environmental and climate change integration in devel- opment cooperation. in order to help achieve them, practical guidance is provided in the following chapters on programming and aid modalities.

        "Guidelines on the inteGration of environment and Climate ChanGe in development Cooperation \u2013 Chapter 2 22 Box 3: Opportunities linked to climate change adaptation and mitigation The need to adopt specific measures to adapt to increasing climate variability and climate change, or contribute to the emissions reduction effort, is often perceived as a constraint and an additional financial and economic burden on the implementation of development programmes and projects. Yet, a closer look indicates that it needs not necessarily be so. While tradeoffs are unavoidable in some instances, there are many cases in which the adoption of adaptation and mitigation measures may actually make a positive contribution to development objectives \u2013 and thus generate a net economic benefit, or even short-term net financial gains. For instance: \u00ce \u00ce energy savings and energy efficiency measures at all levels usually pay for themselves: depending on local circumstances, they may reduce energy bills, contribute to a reduction in air pollution and thus improve health, reduce a country\u2019s imports of fossil fuels and thus improve its current account balance, or make the adoption of renewable energy sources a more viable option. \u00ce \u00ce investments in renewable energy sources may initially be more costly than investments in fossil fuel- based infrastructure, but in view of very volatile and on the whole increasing energy prices, they are getting more and more financially attractive for countries that are net importers of fossil fuels; they bring macroeconomic benefits in terms of balance of payments and foreign exchange reserves and are strate- gically attractive to the extent that they reduce a country\u2019s dependence on imported fuels; and there are also health benefits to be gained from improved air quality. \u00ce \u00ce avoiding deforestation or promoting reforestation whenever possible involves opportunity costs (in the form of foregone profits from timber exploitation and/or foregone agricultural income, either for the local population or for large corporations), but helps sustain biodiversity (for which developed countries may be willing to pay), protects soils against erosion and maintains other essential environmental services (such as water flow regulation); furthermore, the sustainable exploitation of timber and non-timber products, or even non-consumptive uses of the forest, may generate very tangible and possibly substantial monetary and non-monetary benefits for the local population. \u00ce \u00ce Water efficiency measures are generally a \u2018safe bet\u2019, as increasing water scarcity is an established trend in many parts of the world regardless of climate change \u2013 and water prices, with or without subsidies, can only increase in the coming decades; furthermore, they may contribute to the preservation of impor- tant ecosystems, or simply alleviate the water stress on other segments of society. \u00ce \u00ce measures (in particular non-capital-intensive ones) aimed at improving crop yields and land productivity, in addition to reducing vulnerability to climate-induced food shortages, generally have positive effects on rural incomes and nutrition (and thus also on health); whether they help stem the flow of migration to urban areas depends on whether they are labour- or capital-intensive; whether they also have positive environmental effects depends on the choice of productivity-enhancing measures. \u00ce \u00ce more stringent engineering standards and building norms are likely to make upfront investment in public infrastructure and housing more costly \u2013 but will usually make such investments more durable, less demanding in terms of maintenance, and more resilient to the weather conditions and natural disasters that already prevail (regardless of their potential aggravation in future). \u00ce \u00ce more responsible land planning practices, that take account of well-known risks (e.g. no settlements in areas prone to floods or landslides), would also go a long way towards reducing the vulnerability of popu- lations to existing hazards, not just potential future ones. The more systematic use of financial and economic analysis, combined as appropriate with elements of risk analysis and stakeholder analysis, would enable planners to inform decision makers about the true net costs (or benefits) to society and specific social groups of adopting envisaged adaptation and mitigation measures. This information can guide decision on how far to go with adaptation or mitigation measures, and also provide a rational basis for negotiations between stakeholders. Further information on climate change adaptation and mitigation can be found in the \u2018climate change sector scripts\u2019 available on europeaid\u2019s intranet: http://www.cc.cec/dgintranet/europeaid/activities/thematic/e6/index_en.htm.

        "Guidelines on the inteGration of environment and Climate ChanGe in development Cooperation \u2013 Chapter 3 24 The programming phase is crucial for environmental integration because key decisions concerning the overall cooperation process are made that might be difficult to adjust in later phases. Under geographical cooperation instruments, multi-annual programming generally culminates in the production of Country strategy Papers (CsPs) and national indicative Programmes (niPs). The main environmental integration tool that helps inform the strategy process at this stage is the Country Environmental Profile (CEP) . environmental integration during this phase contributes to the following objectives 62 : \u00ce \u00ce \u2018To identify and avoid any harmful direct and indirect environmental impacts of the cooperation programme which can undermine sustainability and counteract achieving the development cooperation objectives of poverty reduction.\u2019 \u00ce \u00ce \u2018To recognise and realise opportunities for enhancing environmental conditions , thereby bringing additional benefits to development and economic activities and advancing environmental issues which are a priority for the eC\u2019. \u00ce \u00ce it also aims to identify and adequately address the environment-related risks, constraints and opportunities (including those potentially resulting from increasing climate variability and climate change) that may promote or jeopardise the achievement of the stated objectives of cooperation. 3.1\bThe\bCountry\bEnvironmental\bProfile a comprehensive country analysis is an initial step in programming. This analysis focuses on the national situation and policies and includes an overview of past and ongoing cooperation with the eC as well as with other donors. integrating the environment in this analysis provides opportunities to undertake policy dialogue and programming on a better understanding of the challenges posed by sustainable development, which is the long-term objec- tive of eC cooperation. The CeP provides the necessary information to integrate environmental concerns in the country analysis (see typical contents in Table 1). more specifically, it provides a foundation for the analysis of the country\u2019s environmental situation, and supports the identification of links between the economic, social and envi- ronmental situations. it is of great importance that the findings and recommendations of the CeP are communicated to the full eU delegation staff and other stakeholders, and discussed within the team involved in developing the country strategy. in addition to supporting the eC country strategy preparation, the CeP can be used as a tool for strengthening the capacities of cooperation partners on environment and climate change. The CeP should notably provide key infor- mation on climate-related issues for individual countries and regions 63 , and also identify more detailed sources of information, where they exist. an understanding of the risks and challenges faced by different sectors is essential to ensure that the development investments considered during programming are adapted to current and future conditions (to the extent that forecasts are possible), and generally that identified vulnerabilities are addressed and adaptive capacity is strengthened. The CeP is based on a compilation of available environmental information, the validity and consistency of which should be determined. it is not expected that \u2018raw\u2019 data should be collected during the preparation of a CeP, but where key data is not available this should be reported. The cost and amount of work involved in preparing a CeP will depend on the existence and the quality of any previous versions or of other (non-eC) profiles such as national State of the Environment reports, the Country Environmental Analysis of the World Bank 64 and asian development Bank 65 (which focus on institutional and governance aspects), and the Environmental Profiles of the United nations environment Programme 66 , the Food and agriculture organisation 67 and the World resources institute 68 . information on the environment is also provided in national sustainable development strategies 69 , or national environmental strategies. 62 source: iQsG (2005) Programming Guide for Country Strategy Papers (update 07/04/05). see also: Increasing the Impact of EU Aid: A Common Framework for Drafting Country Strategy Papers and Joint Multi annual Programming , Com(2006) 88 final, 02.03.2006. 63 regional environmental Profiles should be available for regions. 64 For the World Bank approach, see the Country Environmental Analysis (CEA) Concept Note (april 2008) and Pillai (2008) Strengthening Policy Dialogue on Environment, Learning from five years of Country Environmental Analysis , World Bank: Washington, dC, both available on www.worldbank.org/reference. 65 see: www.adb.org/environment/cea.asp. 66 see: http://gridnairobi.unep.org/chm/roa/Country%20Profiles/. 67 see: www.fao.org/countryprofiles/default.asp?lang=en. 68 see: www.earthtrends.wri.org. 69 see: www.un.org/esa/dsd/dsd_aofw_nsds/nsds_index.shtm.

This section should include a review of the legislation and procedures regarding impact assessments, and a review of the international obligations in the area of environmental protection. Climate change implications a review of any existing analysis of climate change implications including climatic trends, increasing climate variability and strategic responses to them. The review should include the identification of key factors of vulnerability with regard to climate variability and climate change, and an assessment of the capacity to respond. Environment in the main policies and sectors an identification of links between the main government policies (overall devel- opment and reform policies and strategy, such as a poverty reduction strategy, and sector policies) and environmental sustainability issues, providing indi- cations on the extent of existing environmental mainstreaming, with a special attention paid to the \u2018focal sectors\u2019 of eC intervention. Cooperation from an environmental perspective a description of past and ongoing aid from the eC and other donors particularly from the point of view of environmental integration, incorporating lessons learned from major evaluations. assessment of donor coordination mechanisms. Conclusions and recommendations recommendations on how environmental and climate-related issues can be most effectively addressed in eC cooperation, their relative priority and the imple- mentation challenges. These must particularly relate to potential focal sectors and may include measures such as capacity building and institutional strengthening, further analysis and impact assessment, or potential indicators to be used in the niP. These environmental integration measures may go along with recommen- dations concerning specific actions targeting the environment as a cooperation sector, i.e. having environmental improvements as the main objective. in line with the Paris Declaration, followed by the Accra Agenda , efforts towards greater harmonisation in the area of country-level environmental analytical work are underway. increased coordination and cooperation with national and international development partners should be sought locally, leading to joint analytical work and alignment on nationally-led exercises where possible, such as in the framework of joint assistance strategies.

What needs to be done by EC staff? To undertake or contract consultants to carry out the study involving either the preparation of a new CeP or the revision/update of an existing CeP. if consult- ants are commissioned, the delegation/desk officers prepare Tor. Under what conditions? a CeP is in principle required for all beneficiary countries. When is it needed? Typically during the preparation or mid-term review of a Country strategy Paper (CsP). however, the CeP can also provide useful information to underpin the inte- gration of environmental considerations during the implementation of the CsP. How long does it take? The duration and cost of preparing a CeP varies considerably as a function of the data availability, the size of the country and the complexity of the environ- mental issues. Using consultants from inception to final report typically takes +/- 4 months. Where is it used? The CeP is used to inform the preparation of the CsP/niP. The CeP also informs policy dialogue and can be used as reference for environmental integration in programmes and projects by eC staff and cooperation partners. a summary of the CeP must be annexed to the CsP. ToR for a Country Environmental Profile \u00ce Annex 2 The Regional Environmental Profile (REP) regional environmental Profiles should be prepared to inform regional cooperation strategies (regional strategy Papers). The reP focuses on environmental issues common to a group of neighbouring countries (including trans- boundary issues) such as those linked to the shared management of ecosystems or water basins, which can be more effectively addressed at the regional level. The reP should also consider issues linked to regional coopera- tion areas such as regional integration and trade. an existing reP does not mean that individual CePs for the coun- tries concerned will not be required. individual CePs should still be prepared for CsP purposes, using country- specific data required to address environmental issues at the national level. 3.2\bIntegrating\bthe\benvironment,\bincluding\bclimate,\bin\bthe\bCSP\band\bNIP The CeP provides the necessary environmental information to prepare a balanced eC country strategy, incor- porating social, economic and environmental considerations. The CsP in turn informs the national indicative Programme. The response strategy of the CsP and the niP will include \u2018environmental integration outcomes\u2019 (i.e. elements that testify to the fact that environmental issues were taken into account, and will receive further atten- tion as appropriate) for the subsequent phases of the cycle of operations (see Fig. 1). The environment should be considered in the response strategy as a cross-cutting issue influencing the specific interventions for different focal and non-focal sectors and may also be considered as a possible sector of intervention which merits consideration in itself. 70 To aid the preparation of Tors for a CeP and management of the process, a guide is available citing examples of CePs that are considered to demonstrate good practice for a number of criteria.

Taking into account the relationships between the main sectors and the environment in designing the strategy does not mean that only sectors with less negative environmental impacts should be supported by the eC. it means that where possible negative impacts should be mitigated and positive impacts enhanced, thereby ensuring the sustainability of eC support. Possible impacts may be identified as part of the analysis of the risks associated with the strategy and by using annex 1 for additional guidance 71 . Sector guidance \u00ce Annex 1 Where appropriate, the intention to carry out a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) 72 will be foreseen in the CsP. if the CsP foresees sector support, the decision to promote an sea should be based on the likely envi- ronmental impacts of the sector policy and programme considered for support, as established by sea screening (see Chapter 4). if the CsP includes GBs, the decision to promote an sea should be based on the extent to which environmental issues are identified as a key concern under national policies/strategies. in this context, an sea may be particularly useful where these national policies/strategies rely on the promotion of economic growth that is overly dependent on the use of natural resources or potentially polluting activities, as well as those which include macroeconomic or fiscal reforms, or which include important components in environmentally sensitive sectors 73 . The decision and commitment to prepare an sea should also take into account government capacities, the legal and regulatory framework and local interest in sea, as well as other mechanisms already in place to integrate the environment in an appropriate manner into the supported policy/strategy. 71 sector-specific guidance in the context of climate change has also been developed for key sectors. \u2018Climate change sector scripts\u2019 are intended to provide inputs for strengthening climate change integration in ongoing and future cooperation programmes and projects; they may also be used to support political dialogue on climate change implications between the eC, partner governments and other national partners; see europeaid\u2019s intranet: www.cc.cec/dgintranet/europeaid/activities/thematic/e6/index_en.htm. 72 The european Consensus on development establishes a commitment, which builds on the 2001 environmental integration strategy and Council Conclusions, to prepare seas for budget and sectoral aid. Use of sea is foreseen under the dCi regulation (1905/2006 of 18.12.2006) in connection with the implementation of sector programmes (art 22.4). it is also foreseen by the Common Format for Country strategy Papers (Com(2006) 88 final). For aCP countries see also the note to delegations of 23.02.2006 and the Programming Guidelines for the 10th edF. Under the Paris declaration on aid effectiveness, donors have committed to applying common approaches for sea at the sector and national levels. as a follow-up to the Paris declaration, Good Practice Guidance on applying SEA in Development Co- operation has been finalised by oeCd-daC enVironeT in 2006; see: www.seataskteam.net. 73 environmentally-sensitive sectors include: infrastructure, communications and transport; water and energy; natural resources management (including forestry and fisheries); waste management; agriculture, rural development, territorial planning and food security.

Analysis of the (economic, political, social and environ- mental) situation Based on the CeP, the analysis of the overall situation of the country should identify the main environmental challenges and articulate their links with social and economic issues. Particular attention should be paid to the poverty\u2013envi- ronment linkages. This section could include for example: \u00ce \u00ce vulnerability to natural disasters and expected consequences of increasing climate variability and climate change; \u00ce \u00ce environmental resources (e.g. biodiversity, forests) providing opportu- nities for sustainable development; \u00ce \u00ce environmental constraints and problems, for instance resource degra- dation (deforestation, desertification, soil erosion, depletion of fish stocks), air, water and land pollution, contributing to social, economic and political problems (e.g. in relation to food security, health, conflicts, employment, migration, exports, incomes); \u00ce \u00ce the dependency of the country\u2019s economy on local natural resources such as forests, water or fisheries, and the sustainability of patterns of natural resource exploitation; \u00ce \u00ce major pressures and impacts on the national, regional and global environment, resulting from social, economic and political trends (e.g. GhG emissions associated with growth; deforestation resulting from population growth or land reform policies).

Outline of EC and other donors\u2019 cooperation incorporate the results of the CeP regarding the \u2018analysis of aid\u2019, including lessons on environmental integration learned from evaluations of past actions. Response strategy The response strategy should identify measures for addressing identified environmental and climate-related issues, challenges, risks and constraints \u2013 and for optimising the positive effects of the eC intervention on the environ- ment. These measures may concern: 1. the selection of focal sectors; 2. objectives, approaches and strategies for focal sectors; 3. the selection of non-focal sectors and types of actions to be supported; 4. the work programme and budget; 5. policy dialogue; 6. indicators. examples of possible environmental outcomes are provided in Table 4.

        "Guidelines on the inteGration of environment and Climate ChanGe in development Cooperation \u2013 Chapter 3 29 The preparation of an sea (or provision of support to that end) can be complemented by actions to strengthen national capacities (institutional, regulatory) to carry out impact assessments, implement mitigation measures and manage environmental impacts including remediation action, which will allow the government to pursue a higher degree of environmental integration into sector policies in the most effective manner 75 , i.e. based on principles of ownership and participation. Table 4 provides more guidance on possible environmental integration outcomes. Table 4: environmenTal inTegraTion ouTComes as anTiCiPaTed in The eC resPonse sTraTegy and The indiCaTive Programme Selection of focal sectors Because environmental concerns should receive the same attention as social and economic concerns, the country analysis and CeP recommendations should influence the selection of focal sectors, resulting in some circum- stances in the selection of \u2018environment and sustainable management of natural resources\u2019 as a specific focal area of intervention 76 . The selection of other focal sectors will still provide opportunities to integrate the environ- ment as a cross-cutting issue. Considerations with regard to adaptation to increasing climate variability and climate change should also be included in the selection of focal sectors. Objectives, ap- proaches, strategies for focal sectors opportunities to integrate the environment, including climate-related aspects, into focal sectors should be developed. annex 1 provides examples of entry points for each of the main areas of community action under the european Consensus for development. measures may include, for instance, a commitment in principle to under- take eia, sea or other environmental assessments as part of the formula- tion of planned interventions in sensitive geographical areas and/or sectors; or complementary actions to build capacities of relevant national institutions with regard to environmental and natural resource management. Non-focal areas specific support to environmental institutions and the building of environ- mental capacities within non-environmental institutions or civil society organ- isations may be envisaged here, along with support for the improvement of regulatory frameworks. Work programme and budget adequate flexibility, budget and schedule should be provided for the iden- tification and formulation phases to accommodate further environmental integration steps, including additional environmental assessments and their results (e.g. implementation of environmental mitigation measures). Policy dialogue environment and climate-related issues may be identified in the CeP as a topic for a \u2018sectoral policy dialogue\u2019. sometimes, where social or economic dialogue is difficult, environment may provide an opportunity for more constructive dialogue. Indicators a key aspect is the selection of an appropriate set of indicators, reflecting the main environmental and sustainability concerns which can be influenced by eC support, especially in the focal areas. The mdG 77 indicators and any indi- cators that may have been identified by the CeP may be appropriate. annex 10 provides further information with regard to the selection of appropriate indicators. 75 Guidance on capacity development for sea can be found in Chapter 7 of the oeCd daC sea guidance: oeCd-daC (2006) op. cit.

        "Guidelines on the inteGration of environment and Climate ChanGe in development Cooperation \u2013 Chapter 4 32 although the consequences of sector programmes on the environment may be less immediately visible than the environmental impacts of an individual project, their influence can nevertheless be very significant. For example, a sector policy on agriculture may include tax incentives that promote the use of more polluting pesticides, or provide subsidies based on production output that may result in incentives to use environmentally degrading prac- tices which provide higher yields in the short term. a sector policy on transport may trigger higher levels of atmos- pheric pollution in urban centres from increased traffic if incentives make private transport more attractive than public transport, or unintentionally promote deforestation and poaching from road programmes crossing previ- ously inaccessible areas. support to the health sector is often enhanced by considering links with the environment and ensuring cross-sector coordination. it is thus important that the eC promotes the environmental sustainability of the sector programmes it supports through sector Policy support Programmes (sPsPs) 79 . When reviewing/assessing sector policies, attention should be paid to identifying the linkages with the environment and climate-related concerns, and whether policies and measures are in place or are required to address potential vulnerabilities and negative effects. in doing so, use should be made of the information contained in the Country environmental Profile (see Chapter 3 above), and in key studies and analytical work supported by partner govern- ments, the eC and/or other development agencies, possibly including a strategic environmental assessment. Strategic Environmental Assessment (see Box 4 and Table 5) is a key tool to assess the environmental impli- cations of sector policies and programmes, as well as environment-related opportunities, risks and constraints bearing on the implementation of the sector policy and the achievement of its objectives. This analysis provides feedback to the government to enhance the environmental dimension of the sector policy and programme formu- lation process. it also enables improved integration of the environment, resource- and climate-related considera- tions into the eC sPsP. in many cases , the decision and commitment to prepare an SEA have been taken at the programming stage . Where no such decision or commitment was made, the relevance of undertaking sea should be considered using the sea screening procedure highlighted in annex 3. 4.1\bIdentification more specifically, undertaking sea should be considered at the identification stage for sector policies and programmes in environmentally sensitive sectors (i.e. those that have the potential to bring about significant impacts 80 and/or are significantly dependent on environmental and climatic constraints, e.g. infrastructure and transport, water and energy, natural resource management, rural development, land management, agriculture, food security). in order to determine if a sector policy or programme would require an sea, a screening question- naire is provided in annex 3 81 . The outcome of the screening process should be summarised in an annex to the sPsP identification Fiche. Screening for SEA \u00ce Annex 3 79 This chapter is based on the sPsP process as described in eC (2007) \u2013 Support to Sector Programmes \u2013 Covering the three financing modalities: Sector Budget Support, Pool Funding and EC project procedures , Tools and methods series, Guidelines no. 2 (long version), european Commission (europeaid). 80 For the concept of \u2018significant impact\u2019, see section 2.7, \u00a72. 81 in circumstances where a sector sea or equivalent assessment already exists, its quality should be assessed using the guidance provided in section 4.2.2 and, if its quality is acceptable, it should be used to formulate or improve the sPsP. To determine if a sector sea exists, a useful source of information can be oeCd-daC network on environment and development Cooperation \u2018 Survey of agencies\u2019 country level activities related to environment and development\u2019 ; see: www.oecd.org/dac/environment.

        "Guidelines on the inteGration of environment and Climate ChanGe in development Cooperation \u2013 Chapter 4 33 Box 4: Strategic Environmental Assessment \u2013 General concept a strategic environmental assessment is a \u2018systematic process for evaluating the environmental consequences of proposed policy, plan or programme (PPP) initiatives in order to ensure they are fully included and appropriately addressed at the earliest stage of decision making, on a par with economic and social considerations\u201d 82 . The sea seeks to enhance learning and support the design of more sustainable development strategies. it is an inte- gral part of the planning process to optimise environmental impacts (i.e. minimise negative effects and enhance positive ones) and adequately address the environment-related risks, constraints and opportunities under which the PPP will operate. Compared with the better known environmental impact assessment (eia), sea provides for impacts to be taken into consideration at an earlier stage and allows a better control over interactions or cumu- lative effects. however it is less precise as many of the details of specific actions and locations are possibly not defined. For sea to be most effective, it should be integrated into the PPP preparation process from the first stages, and this process should take into consideration its recommendations. The sea process typically includes the following stages 83 : SEA screening screening refers to the decision to undertake an sea. in principle, seas should be carried out for all PPPs that are likely to produce significant negative impacts on the environment during implementation. SEA scoping scoping refers to the identification and clarification of issues to be addressed by the sea. scoping should identify and take into consideration the concerns and values of stakeholders, in order to ensure that these are addressed in the sea study. SEA study The sea study comprises several aspects. The environmental baseline provides information for a general under- standing of the state of the environment and trends in order to be in a position to assess the potential envi- ronmental effects of a PPP. The sea should then identify and assess environment-related risks, constraints and opportunities of the proposed PPP and possible alternatives, including the effects of climate variability and climate change. a consistency analysis identifies any elements of the PPP that may be in conflict with or hinder the achievement of environmental policy objectives. The sea should produce recommendations for the formu- lation and implementation of the preferred and improved alternative, as well as monitoring indicators. The results of the sea should be presented in the form of a concise sea report. Public participation The involvement of stakeholders in the sea process is a key success factor. environmental impacts, as well as constraints and opportunities, cannot be dissociated from their relationship to social, economic and cultural factors. engaging stakeholders in an sea, including women and other traditionally less represented groups, is important in order to adequately integrate their knowledge and concerns in assessing the impacts\u2019 significance and the acceptability of proposed actions and response measures. Furthermore, environmental considerations should be addressed as relevant in the preliminary review of the seven key assessment areas 84 initiated in the identification phase of an sPsP, as shown below: Sector policy and strategy evidence should be provided that a well-defined sector policy and strategy is in place or under implementation (or will be by the end of formulation). in this context, the quality of the policy and strategy is to be assessed from an environmental and climate point of view, among other aspects.

Budget and Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) attention should be paid to \u2018 giving confidence that the budget and MTEF will progressively reflect or continue to reflect declared partner country priorities during programme implementation \u2019. The extent to which the sector budget reflects declared environmental priorities and sustainability concerns (through provisions for environ- mental impact mitigation/optimisation measures, institutional strengthening and capacity development for natural resource management and/or responding to climate change at sector level) should be mentioned. Sector and donor coordination other development partners\u2019 environmental requirements and activities should be checked and the extent to which sector-specific environmental concerns are addressed within a multi-stakeholder working group \u2013 if it exists \u2013 should be assessed. Consider if specific institutional coordination mechanisms with regard to environmental issues should be promoted before proceeding to implementation, or in the context of sector policy dialogue. Institutional setting and capacity issues The capacities of institutions with environmental responsibilities in the sector should be assessed, along with rele- vant environmental legislation, and existing environmental monitoring system covering the sector. The Country environmental Profile may provide useful information in this regard. Performance monitoring systems The existence of environmental indicators, or the \u2018environmental relevance\u2019 of performance indicators in the sector policy/programme\u2019s performance assessment framework, can be mentioned here \u2013 especially if sound environ- mental and natural resource management are essential to the success of the supported strategy or programme. more guidance on indicators is provided in annex 10. This preliminary review, combined with the results of sea screening, may influence decisions with regard to sPsP implementation modalities as well as the \u2018next steps\u2019 to be undertaken at the formulation stage, as shown in Table 5. The last step of identification consists in completing the identification Fiche. This document should reflect the initial findings of the environmental integration effort. Table 5 identifies possible entry points for doing so. 85 The oeCd-daC has recently developed policy guidance with information and advice on how to facilitate the integration of climate change adaptation within development processes: see Strategic Environmental Assessment and Adaptation to Climate Change (2008), available on: www.oecd.org/dataoecd/0/43/42025733.pdf, and Integrating Adaptation to Climate Change into Development Co-operation: Policy Guidance , available on: www.oecd.org/document/5/0,3343,en_2649_34361_42471301_1_1_1_1,00.html. Central to the oeCd policy guidance is the notion of a climate lens , which involves examining: i) the extent to which the policy, plan or project under consideration could be vulnerable to risks arising from climate variability and change; ii) the extent to which climate change risks have already been taken into consideration; iii) the extent to which the policy, plan or project could inadvertently lead to increased vulnerability, leading to maladaptation or, conversely, miss important opportunities arising from climate change; and iv) for pre-existing policies and plans which are being revised, what amendments might be warranted in order to address climate risks and opportunities. While efforts to integrate climate change adaptation will be led by developing country partners, international donors have a critical role to play in supporting such efforts as well as in integrating consideration of adaptation within their own plans and activities. 86 in addition to the above-mentioned oeCd-daC publications, the Country environmental Profile and other available analytical work, including any existing sea of the sector policy/programme, can be used to support this assessment.

Prepare Tor and commission the sea. When is it needed? Typically at the formulation stage of the sPsP, but an sea can also produce useful results if undertaken at a later stage 91 . How long does it take? This will depend on the scope of the sea, but useful results can usually be produced in 6\u20138 months. Where is it used? sea outputs are used to promote the environmental sustainability of a sector policy and programme (in agreement with the partner govern- ment) and to prepare the eC sPsP. Using the SEA report once the report is accepted, its conclusions can be incorporated in the more comprehensive assessment to be carried out in the formulation phase and considered in policy dialogue with the government. Table 7 provides guid- ance on the use of the sea in the seven assessment areas. 91 For instance during sPsP implementation. sea should be scheduled in such a way that its results can be exploited in the national cycle of operations (e.g. at the time of reviewing the current multiannual sector programme or preparing the next one).

When reviewing/assessing national policies/strat- egies, attention should therefore be paid to identifying and understanding the linkages with the environment and climate and whether policies and measures are in place or are required to: \u00ce \u00ce address their potential negative effects; \u00ce \u00ce adapt to environmental and climate change constraints and reduce vulnerability to them. The following sections describe good practice for environmental integration in the GBs cycle of operations. 5.1\bIdentification environmental and climate-related considerations may be addressed in the preliminary review carried out in the identification phase of a GBs programme, which focuses on assessing the fulfilment of the \u2018eligibility criteria\u2019 for receiving budget support, as well as the other \u2018assessment areas\u2019 . To this effect, use should be made of the information contained in the Country environmental Profile (see Chapter 3), any existing strategic environmental assessments 98 , or similar analytical work that might be available from the partner government or from other devel- opment partners. during this preliminary review, environmental issues are to be addressed as follows: National development or reform policy and strategy evidence should be provided that a well-defined national policy and strategy is in place or under implementation (or will be by the end of formulation). in this context, the quality of the policy and strategy is to be assessed from an environmental and climate point of view, among other aspects; the relevance of environmental issues and of the proposed response should be briefly assessed in view of the environmental and climate-related constraints bearing on policy/strategy implementation, as well as the likely environmental impacts of such implementation. Budget and Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) attention should be paid to \u2018 giving confidence that the budget and MTEF will progressively reflect or continue to reflect declared partner country priorities during programme implementation \u2019. if environmental governance, natural resource management and/or responding to climate change constitute declared government priorities, the extent to which they are reflected in the budget/mTeF should be mentioned. Donor coordination other development partners\u2019 environmental requirements and activities should be checked and the extent to which environmental and climate-related concerns are addressed within a multi-donor or multi-stakeholder working group \u2013 if it exists \u2013 should be assessed.

Institutional setting and capacity analysis The capacities of institutions with environmental responsibilities (including those with responsibilities for designing and managing the response to climate change) should be assessed, along with relevant environmental legislation and the existing national environmental monitoring system. The Country environmental Profile may provide useful information in this regard. ideally a dialogue with the government on environmental sustainability should have taken place already at the time of preparation or revision of the poverty reduction strategy or national development plan. an SEA of the national policy, strategy or plan may have been undertaken in this context. as a second-best option, such an assess- ment can be undertaken at a later stage. a government-driven sea, with the involvement of stakeholders and in close coordination with other donors, may be promoted to this end if it is considered that environmental issues (including climate-related ones) are a key concern for the programme of support to the national policy/strategy. This commitment would normally be made at the programming phase, but may also be agreed at a later date. This type of sea, focusing on a forward-looking assessment of the broad national development policy/reform strategy rather than individual sector policies (see Table 9), could be seen as a learning process (with strong stake- holder involvement) and seek to answer the following questions: \u00ce \u00ce is the assessed strategy consistent with the national environmental and sustainable development objec- tives and principles? What are the linkages between the proposed strategy and the environment? \u00ce \u00ce What is the best alternative (mix of actions) in environmental terms to achieve the development objectives? \u00ce \u00ce how sensitive is the proposed strategy to climate-related risks and constraints?

The use of experts from countries from the same region with experience of environmental mainstreaming, and the development and dissemination of positive case studies from the country itself or from neighbouring countries, may be particularly effective. a key part of implementation will be the monitoring of disbursement conditions that may include performance criteria and indicators related to the environment. 5.4\bEvaluation during evaluation, an assessment should be made of whether GBs and the supported policy/strategy effec- tively contributed to sustainable development. To the extent possible, evaluators should check whether the causal links between the GBs inputs and development outcomes (including environmental impacts) have performed as expected, in order to learn lessons for the future. The impact of the GBs and related policy dialogue on the national policy should thus be assessed. The evaluation should also assess whether the process of integrating the environ- ment, and the implementation of the resulting recommendations, have been successful. These requirements should be included in the Tor of the evaluation study, which should ideally foresee adequate expertise in the field of environmental economics or environment\u2013development linkages.

        "Guidelines on the inteGration of environment and Climate ChanGe in development Cooperation \u2013 Chapter 6 52 This chapter 108 provides guidance on integrating the environment (including climate-related aspects) under the \u2018project approach\u2019. While opportunities exist to address environmental aspects in all the main stages of the cycle of operations, particular emphasis is put on the initial phases of identification and formulation, as this is where key decisions are made on project design, activities, and implementation arrangements. This guidance has been drafted for the identification and formulation of projects in which the eC plays a direct role. nonetheless, the approach and the tools illustrated in this chapter (and related annexes) may apply to other actions supported by the eC, such as those under call for proposals procedures, where identification and formulation are the main responsibility of applicant organisations. 6.1\bIdentification\b 6.1.1 Environmental integration in the logical framework approach it is considered good practice to integrate the environmental dimension in the logical framework (or logframe) approach, particularly during problem and strategy analysis. in the strategy analysis, the identification of objectives and expected results should take into account environment-related opportunities, risks and constraints as well as possible impacts. Environment-related opportunities, risks and constraints are defined here as factors or conditions that affect (positively or negatively) the feasibility of the project, and environmental impacts are posi- tive or negative effects on the environment brought about by the project (and usually going beyond the objectives). more detailed guidance on how to integrate the environment in the logframe approach is provided in annex 6. Environment in the logframe approach \u00ce Annex 6 6.1.2 Environmental integration in the identification study in cases where a pre-feasibility or identification study is undertaken, the design of the study offers a key oppor- tunity for the ensuring the environmental relevance of the project. identification is indeed the main stage where project alternatives are discussed and selected 109 . The environmental and climate-related impacts, opportunities and constraints that differentiate the project alternatives should be subject to a preliminary assessment, taking into account the different characteristics and sensitivity of potential project sites, for instance (where location alterna- tives are considered). Project identification studies should use the approach proposed in annex 6, and notably the building of a problem tree that integrates environmental aspects as the foundation for developing the project\u2019s logical framework. in addition, the approach proposed in annex 9, which addresses the integration of environ- mental and climate-related aspects in project formulation studies, can also be applied in the context of identifica- tion studies. 6.1.3 Project environmental screening When the critical parameters of a project have been identified, the project should be screened from an environ- mental perspective. This is particularly important where the environmental dimension has not been adequately considered in the problem/logframe analysis or in the identification study, but each project should be screened with respect to environment-related impacts, risks and constraints. This screening process will inform decisions on appropriate environmental integration during subsequent phases. in principle, the more the environmental dimension is taken on board at the initial logframe analysis level or during the identification study (particularly in the assessment of project alternatives), the less the need for specific measures to deal with this dimension during subsequent phases. 108 Based on the process described in eC (2004) Project Cycle Management Guidelines, Aid Delivery Methods Vol. 1 . 109 in general terms \u2018alternatives\u2019 refers to different ways of achieving the same ends. alternatives will necessarily be of a broader (or more strategic) nature at the pre-feasibility than at the feasibility stage. For example, in the case of an agriculture project the \u2018alternatives\u2019 studied at the pre-feasibility stage may include enhancing paddy production through irrigation and securing of agrochemical inputs, or the introduction of new crops and techniques to enhance production on the hills. if the pre-feasibility study selects the rice production project, then the \u2018alternatives\u2019 studied during formulation are likely to be narrower and could bear, for example, on the irrigation system to be used, the specific agrochemicals (inputs) to be used, or the rice varieties to be grown. note however that the range of alternatives considered in an eia (where one is undertaken) should not be too restricted or narrow.

        "Guidelines on the inteGration of environment and Climate ChanGe in development Cooperation \u2013 Chapter 6 53 Project environmental screening \u00ce Annex 7 Screening for Environmental Impact Assessment Projects should be screened for their potential impacts on the environment, in order to decide whether an Environmental Impact Assessment (eia) should be carried out or, when an eia is not required, to identify those environmental aspects that should still be addressed during project formulation. eia is an ex ante assessment of a project resulting in recommendations concerning measures to mitigate potential negative impacts (that is effects or consequences) and optimise positive ones. eia screening of projects supported by the eC should be based on relevant national legislation and procedures and on eC criteria 110 . Box 5 summarises the conditions under which an eia is required. Under eC criteria (see annex 7, Part 1), individual projects are classified into three categories: \u00ce \u00ce Category A projects, which have potentially significant negative environmental impacts, always require an eia. \u00ce \u00ce Category B projects, considered \u2018intermediate\u2019 projects because they have potentially \u2018non-negligible\u2019 impacts which may however not be significant enough in some circumstances to automatically justify a full-scale eia 111 , require further information to decide if an eia is required or not. Part 1 of annex 7 provides detailed guidance on how to assess Category B projects. \u00ce \u00ce Category C projects, which have minor or no negative environmental impacts and are therefore deemed \u2018non-threatening\u2019, do not require an eia. Box 5: When is an EIA required? an eia is required for projects that are likely to have significant impacts on the environment. it should be prepared if: \u00ce \u00ce it is required for this type of project under national legislation; \u00ce \u00ce the project is classified as Category a (see annex 7); \u00ce \u00ce the project is initially classified as Category B but, considering the vulnerability of the affected communi- ties and environment, the screening process in annex 7 assimilates it to a Category a project and recom- mends an eia. Climate risk screening it is also required that projects are screened for exposure and sensitivity to changing climatic conditions over the expected project time span 112 . This screening process aims to provide an initial assessment of the climate risks faced by the project that may affect its relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability or developmental impact. The screening process will help decide the degree of climate-related risk the project is subject to and provide guidance on how to respond to these risks during formulation. Further assessment (more or less detailed) of identified risks, vulnerability factors and response capacities is required if the project is found to be \u2018at risk\u2019. in such a case, further assessment during the formulation phase will help identify, as relevant, specific climate risk reduction measures and/or measures aimed at strengthening overall resilience and adaptive capacity. Given the uncertainties still involved in forecasting directions of future change, particularly at a local scale, emphasis should be put on \u2018no regret\u2019 or \u2018low regret\u2019 measures, i.e. measures that already bring benefits under present climate conditions, and are expected to produce net benefits even if climate change effects fail to materialise, or are less severe than predicted: no resources are wasted by implementing them. 110 should the national legislation be more \u2018demanding\u2019 that the eC criteria, national legislation should prevail. in the opposite case, eC criteria should prevail. 111 This category includes projects that are not clearly classified, either because of uncertainties with regard to the magnitude or significance of their impacts or because they do not easily \u2018fit\u2019 into one of the identified categories. 112 The project time span or lifetime is defined as the period extending from the start of implementation until the time when it stops delivering benefits \u2013 or the time when \u2018significant new investment\u2019 is required if the project is to continue delivering benefits. This time span may well exceed (by several years and even by decades, in the case of large infrastructure projects) the project implementation timeframe. ",
        "Guidelines on the inteGration of environment and Climate ChanGe in development Cooperation \u2013 Chapter 6 54 Part 2 of annex 7 provides guidance on climate risk screening and on how to classify projects into a risk category. in short: \u00ce \u00ce Projects at risk are those directly and potentially significantly exposed, in whole or in part, to the effects of climate variability and climate change, with risk possibly compounded by inappropriate project design, low awareness and/or low capacities, so that the achievement of their results and objectives may be more or less significantly threatened. \u00ce \u00ce Low- or no-risk projects have little or no exposure to the effects of climate variability and climate change. Summary of the possible outcomes of the screening process Figure\b3:\bOutcomes\bof\benvironmental\bimpact\band\bclimate\brisk\bscreening Outcomes of environmental impact screening Outcomes of climate risk screening The same screening criteria should be used for single projects included in programmes or in large projects 113 . nevertheless, the process should be adapted as follows: \u00ce \u00ce in programmes or large projects that include or may include Category B or a projects to be identified after the adoption of a financing decision, eia screening and implementation in relation to such projects should be carried out in the implementation phase 114 . \u00ce \u00ce in programmes that include already identified projects which require an eia, these eias should be carried out in the programme formulation phase 115 . Based on the environmental screening there are two options for the formulation phase: \u00ce \u00ce projects not requiring an eia: environmental and climate-related aspects addressed as relevant in the formulation study; \u00ce \u00ce projects requiring an eia: impacts on the environment addressed in the eia; climate-related risks, constraints and opportunities addressed as relevant in the general formulation study (or possibly in an extension to the eia study). 6.1.4. Environmental integration in the Identification Fiche Based on the preceding steps, the project identification Fiche (iF) can now be completed. The fiche includes explicit references to environment in the sections dedicated to cross-cutting issues, sustainability and next steps, 113 some interventions categorised as \u2018projects\u2019 cover a wide geographical area and consist of a combination of various types of interventions, often not clearly identified until implementation. 114 This may more likely be the case in the frame of \u2018decentralised\u2019, \u2018indirect centralised\u2019 and \u2018joint management\u2019 implementation modalities. a provision to this effect should be inserted in relevant contractual documents. 115 nevertheless, if the same area or ecosystem is expected to be affected by more than one of the projects, the final impact cannot be adequately assessed through individual eias. in this case, an sea of this set of projects is recommended. The Tor for this sea should be carefully drafted in order to focus on assessing the cumulative impacts of the individual projects and assessing whether that mix of projects is the best option, from an environmental point of view, to achieve the programme objectives. depending on the level of detail at which the individual projects have been defined, the environmental assessment may integrate elements of the eia methodology (annex 8).

This particularly applies to problem/strategy analysis and risks and assumptions . Possible entry points for environ- mental integration are shown in Table 14. 6.2\bFormulation 6.2.1 Projects not requiring an EIA When no eia is required (i.e. in the majority of cases), those environmental and climate-related aspects identified as relevant during the screening process should be addressed in the formulation study. The scope and depth of this assessment will depend on the significance of potential environmental impacts, as well as the extent to which environment-related risks, constraints and opportunities are important for the achievement of project objectives. The Tor for the formulation study of these projects should include specific provisions for environmental and climate-related assessment, to ensure that: \u00ce \u00ce any potential effects of the project on the environment as pre-identified during the eia screening are assessed. \u00ce \u00ce appropriate measures are outlined and the project design is adjusted as needed to minimise negative envi- ronmental effects and enhance positive ones.

        "Guidelines on the inteGration of environment and Climate ChanGe in development Cooperation \u2013 Chapter 6 56 \u00ce \u00ce The project vulnerability to climate risks and constraints (including natural disasters as highlighted during the climate screening) is investigated further \u2013 bearing in mind that some of the above mentioned effects (impacts) of the project on the environment can increase vulnerability to climate risks. \u00ce \u00ce The project design or implementation modalities are adjusted to address those conditions as needed \u2013 including for exploiting possible opportunities stemming from changing climate conditions. annex 9 provides guidance for selective incorporation of relevant climate-related and environmental issues into the Tor of formulation studies. Box 15 provides some insights into the topic of identifying climate risk adaptation measures in the formulation of a project. Guidance for project formulation \u00ce Annex 9 Box 6: Climate risk adaptation measures in project formulation at the project level, adaptation refers to measures that if implemented should ensure that increasing climate variability and the expected effects of climate change do not jeopardise the sustained achievement of project objectives and expected results. For example, a new road and its associated drainage systems may need to be designed taking into account current trends (e.g. more frequent episodes of heavy rainfall) as well as future expected changes in climate. more intense rainfall events will require larger capacity drainage systems to remove the increased volumes of runoff generated; if the capacity is not sufficient then flooding and disruption will occur. if the road was designed without taking future changes into account, the transportation objectives may not be sustained; this may also be called maladaptation or \u2018business-as-usual\u2019 development which overlooks climate change. Climate change adaptation measures can aim to offset negative impacts but also to take advantage of posi- tive ones, where they exist. adaptation should not be seen just as a constraint and an additional financial and economic burden. in almost every sector, climate change intensifies already existing problems. Climate-related concerns may provide the impetus needed to implement many of the environmental and developmental \u2018best practices\u2019 previously neglected and in this way make programmes and projects both more effective and more sustainable. There are many instances in which \u2018climate change adaptation measures\u2019 may alleviate factors that contribute to chronic vulnerability today, enhance equity, reduce poverty, improve management, and generally make a positive contribution to development objectives \u2013 regardless of the extent to which the potential effects of climate change ultimately materialise. in the presence of significant uncertainties, \u2018adaptive management\u2019 based on the adoption of \u2018no regret\u2019 or \u2018robust\u2019 117 measures is a good starting point. For projects where significant climate-related risks have been identified, risk reduction measures should be included in the design and implementation arrangements wherever possible, including measures to strengthen resilience and increase adaptive capacity of project stakeholders. strengthening adaptive capacity is equally rele- vant at the project, sector, national and regional levels. adaptive capacity in the context of climate change may be defined as the ability to anticipate, respond to and learn from disturbance and change. examples of relevant measures at the project level include: \u00ce \u00ce avoiding barriers to adaptation in the project design and implementation strategies. \u00ce \u00ce Facilitating access to accurate and appropriate information on climate change and promoting discussion on climate risk management and adaptation options with stakeholders. \u00ce \u00ce ensuring that the project maximizes its potential for positive environmental impacts. \u00ce \u00ce improving flexibility and efficiency in the management of climate-sensitive resources, natural resources in the first place. \u00ce \u00ce strengthening capacities of the institutions concerned, making them more responsive and accountable. examples of adaptation measures drawn from eC projects are given in annex 7, appendix iii. 117 robust measures are those that produce net benefits across various possible climate change scenarios; they are particularly valuable in the presence of uncertainty about future climate evolution.

        "Guidelines on the inteGration of environment and Climate ChanGe in development Cooperation \u2013 Chapter 6 57 6.2.2 Projects requiring an EIA When an eia (see Box 7) is required, it is important in practical terms to define how the eia and other studies will be incorporated in the different steps of the formulation phase. There are four issues to consider: \u00ce \u00ce a clear definition of the scope of studies to be carried out at formulation is necessary to ensure comple- mentarities and to avoid overlap between the eia and other studies (e.g. \u2018general\u2019 formulation study, finan- cial and economic analysis). Close coordination is therefore required in the preparation of the different Tor for these studies if they are not prepared by the same persons. \u00ce \u00ce Consistency should be maintained during formulation; this means that the same alternatives 118 are consid- ered in the different assessments (e.g. technical, environmental and economic). \u00ce \u00ce it should be ensured that the studies are based on sufficient technical information and assess realistic options, and that they can have an influence on the selection of project alternatives and on final project design. \u00ce \u00ce ideally the eia should precede the economic analysis, which has to incorporate the costs of impact mitiga- tion measures and possibly also value some residual environmental externalities. Box 7: Environmental Impact Assessment - General concept eia 119 is an ex ante environmental assessment of projects 120 . The eia of a proposed project is a systematic assessment of the potential environmental impacts of this project and its alternatives, in order to propose appro- priate measures to mitigate negative environmental impacts and optimise positive effects, and support the deci- sion-making process. The main stages can be distinguished as follows: EIA screening screening refers to the decision to carry out the eia, based on legislation, the nature of the project and the sensi- tivity of the environment. EIA scoping scoping is the operation used to define the aspects that need to be covered in the eia study: the geographical area to study; the time frame; the level of detail required; the proposed methodology for impact identification and evaluation; the identification of stakeholders and their concerns; the identification of alternatives to be studied. EIA study a baseline study describes the initial state of the environment within the selected boundaries of the study area. it also includes the description of the \u2018no project\u2019 scenario, based on assumptions regarding future changes. another important step is the identification and evaluation of environmental impacts. The impacts are the differences between the situation with , and the situation without the project. The identification and evaluation of impacts are necessary for all alternatives 121 under study, in order to compare them and provide recommendations on the selection of the most environmentally sound alternative. it may be decided to undertake a more detailed assessment of a preferred alternative. The last part of the study provides recommendations , primarily in the form of mitigation/optimisation measures . measures should be proposed to mitigate negative impacts (miti- gation measures), as well as to optimise positive effects (enhancement measures). The eia recommendations must be organised in an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) , specifying the way the proposed meas- ures should be implemented, and a monitoring plan. Decision Based on the eia the project, or the preferred alternative, can be approved without changes or conditions; approved with minor changes; subjected to major changes that justify new studies; or judged unacceptable, even with corrective measures, and therefore refused. Public participation Participation and consultation of stakeholders must be integrated in this process within the local institutional framework; it is a key success factor. Particular care should be taken to (a) make full use of the experience and know-how of the population living in the environment being studied; (b) adequately integrate the needs, values and interests of the population concerned, including women and marginalised social groups. Public participation should be ensured from the earliest stages of the process. 118 see footnote 109. 119 For measures in force in the eU refer to directive 85/337/eeC as amended by directives eC/97/11and 2003/35/eC. 120 ex post environmental assessment will be referred to as ex post eia.

The implication of this is that while environmental impacts are addressed in the eia, the risks, constraints and opportunities arising from the availability of natural resources, and those arising from increasing climate variability and climate change, are typically not covered and should therefore be addressed in the general formulation study. however, in cases where the eC supports the eia process, a team of environmental specialists will be mobilised. in such cases it is suggested to combine the eia with the assessment of climate risks and oppor- tunities.

The logical framework should be finalised taking into account the results of the screening process, the results of the eia (if any), and otherwise the results of environmental integration in the formulation study.

The model Tor should be adapted taking into account the specific issues identified in the screening as well as available project information (e.g. from the identification or pre-feasibility studies) and previous relevant environmental assess- ments (e.g. the CeP and any available seas in the sector). The study should be commissioned to independent environmental experts or eia specialists. experts should be provided with all relevant documents, and receive adequate explanations on the links with other formulation studies and with the decision-making process. 2) EIA scoping The scoping report should be submitted to the eU delegation and government. The scoping study allows defining in more detail the calendar and activities for the main eia study. 3) The EIA study after approval of the scoping study the main eia study is carried out. The duration of the study is very vari- able and, depending on its scope (also linked to the project size and intervention sector), may have a duration comprised between 4 and 18 months. The eia conclusions and recommendations should be incorporated in the project\u2019s design (as described in the action Fiche and Technical and administrative Provisions of the financing agreement).

        "Guidelines on the inteGration of environment and Climate ChanGe in development Cooperation \u2013 Chapter 6 60 6.3\bImplementation although these guidelines are targeted at eC staff, it is important at this stage to describe the respective roles during implementation of the key stakeholders: the eC, the national partners and the project management/imple- mentation team. Role of EC staff eC staff in delegations has a role to play in checking that the requirements resulting from environmental integra- tion in the previous steps are complied with and that environmental aspects are addressed during implementa- tion as foreseen in the project documents. They will be supported in this task by the eC result-oriented monitoring programme (see below). For infrastructure projects, it is important to see that the provisions to ensure sound envi- ronmental management stemming from the eia are adequately reflected in the tender specifications and project\u2019s contractual documents. The eC may also promote the idea of an \u2018environmental performance review\u2019 . such a review examines an ongoing project with the aim of identifying areas where environmental performance can be improved, independ- ently from the degree and quality of environmental integration in the previous steps. The review can be based on the checklist of good practice provided in Table 6.3. it is relevant to note here that (although not in the context of a project) the concept of environmental performance review is being applied increasingly in delegations and Brussels headquarters. This \u2018greening\u2019 process is often motivated by individuals taking responsibility for environ- mental performance in their work space. For existing projects that were identified and designed without screening for climate risks and vulnerability, it is also possible to conduct a climate risk review , applying the climate risk screening and assessment steps described above retrospectively. such a review may not be required on a routine basis and could be carried out by initially focusing on projects in sectors particularly sensitive and/or related to increasing climate variability and the antic- ipated effects of climate change. These sectors include health, water, agriculture and rural development, envi- ronment, energy and mining, urban development and the transport sector. Projects in these sectors could be reviewed particularly in those countries or parts of countries where high climate-related risks have been identified. however, it is recognised that the scope for adjusting key elements of a project such as its location will be limited. Climate risk reviews may identify some adaptation measures that can be added to the project work plan provided they are practically feasible and finance is made available. Role of national partners The national government has a major role to play in project monitoring and management, particularly under the european development Fund. environmental authorities and civil society representatives may also be involved in environmental monitoring and control, especially when an eia has been carried out.

Effectiveness did the project comply with its environmental requirements and objec- tives? did the environmental protection/risk management measures produce the expected results? What capacities exist to deal with environment and climate risks that could affect project effectiveness and the sustained achievement of objectives? Efficiency have sound environmental practices been followed in project imple- mentation? has the project made efficient use of environmentally damaging means? has the amount of resources invested in adaptation and/or mitigating measures been proportionate to the obtained results? Sustainability are project outcomes threatened by environmental degradation (or resource impoverishment) or disasters, including those caused by increasing climate variability and climate change? has project contrib- uted to some of that degradation, e.g. by increasing pressures on fragile ecosystems and scarce natural resources or generating negative envi- ronmental impacts? Impact What are the project\u2019s contributions to sustainable development? Could these have been improved? What are the social and environmental effects external to project objectives? has the project contributed to an increase or decrease in vulnerability to climate change? has it improved adaptive capacity? adequate environmental expertise may have to be incorporated in the evaluation team, particularly for environmen- tally sensitive projects. as usual, results of mid-term evaluations should feed back into the project so as to enhance its quality, and lessons learned from final and ex post evaluations should be used to inform the design and formulation of future inter- ventions. They should also contribute to building the knowledge base and the practical experience required to enhance, on a larger scale, the quality of environmental assessments and response strategies. ",

The guid- ance relating to each cooperation area is broken down into: 1. Possible environmental pressures and impacts 125 stemming from activities in the area (can also be used for the scoping of seas). 2. environmental factors affecting the effectiveness, efficiency or sustainability of activities in the area. 3. entry points for environmental integration, i.e. opportunities to include environmental conside-rations within activities in the area. 4. examples of indicators. 5. additional sources of information. 1. governanCe, demoCraCy, human righTs and suPPorT for eConomiC and insTiTuTional reforms 1.1. Environmental pressures and impacts from the area (to be mitigate or enhanced) 126 Cooperation aimed at improving governance, democracy, human rights and support for economic and institu- tional reforms, especially if managed to balance the three pillars of sustainable development, would normally be positive for the environment. on the other hand, poor performance in these areas may have important indirect consequences on human activities affecting the environment, for example: \u00ce \u00ce Pressures on natural resources (including mining, land clearing, illegal logging and poaching) and associ- ated impacts (e.g. pollution from mining, soil erosion, resource depletion, biodiversity losses). \u00ce \u00ce energy consumption and GhG emissions (impact on climate change). \u00ce \u00ce Changes in land use, urbanisation, and poorly managed agricultural intensification. \u00ce \u00ce Pollution and wastes. 1.2. Environmental factors affecting the area availability, exploitation costs and sustainability of natural resources that are important for the national economy, including soils, water, forests, tourism assets (e.g. landscape, recreational water, scenic features, national parks). environmental factors affecting migration, health, labour productivity, gender division of labour (e.g. depletion of natural resources generating competition for their access, water and atmospheric pollution affecting health and labour productivity, water scarcity obliging women to fetch water from distant places). natural disasters, effects of increasing climate variability and climate change, environmental damage causing economic costs and affecting human life. 1.3. Entry points for the area Consideration of environmental concerns in PrsPs, development policies, macro-economic reforms. strengthening of environmental institutions and capacities (centralised, decentralised). decentralisation and community participation (including usually less-represented groups) in natural resource management and land use planning; adequacy of the allocation of environmental competences across govern- ment levels with the size and geographical extent of the environmental assets to be managed. Consistency in sector policies and environmental mainstreaming as a cross-cutting issue in different sectors. Promotion of environmental fiscal reform (eFr) and market-based mechanisms of environmental management (e.g. removal of environmentally damaging subsidies, introduction or adaptation of environmental taxes). strengthening of environmental monitoring and information systems. adoption of green accounting (i.e. using environmental and sustainability indicators in the overall macro-economic accounting framework). legislative reform and law enforcement: environmental legislation, eia and sea procedures; FleGT (Forest law enforcement, Governance and Trade) initiative; multilateral environmental agreements (ratification, implementation). support for access rights to natural resources and environmental rights for men and women (especially for vulnerable groups, including ethnic minorities and indigenous peoples); development of land tenure systems. 125 Environmental pressures are human actions affecting the environment (e.g. logging); impacts are the result of pressures (e.g. deforestation). 126 negative pressures and impacts should be mitigated, positive ones enhanced.

Competing uses: managing a resource for a particular purpose (e.g. water for human or agricultural uses) may compete with other uses (e.g. wetlands and biodiversity conservation). 8.2. Environmental factors affecting the area By definition, environmental problems are addressed, but external environmental factors should be taken into account: e.g. impacts from other sectors, impacts from abroad (including climate change and transboundary pollution). deforestation, re-forestation, land clearance for agriculture. Pollution. Fires. overgrazing, overfishing, overhunting, excessive timber or wood harvesting. Biodiversity decline, introduction of alien species or Gmos. ",

Background ( Give a brief overview of the country, its current socio-political situation, EC cooperation experience on the major environmental concerns and responses by the government and/or other donors, the interest of the EC in integrating the environment in the CSP and the current timetable with respect to the multi-annual programming process. ) 2. objective The main objective of the Country environmental Profile (CeP) is to identify and assess environmental issues to be considered during the preparation of a Country strategy Paper, which will directly or indirectly influence eC cooper- ation with the country for several years to come (please adapt if the CEP is prepared at another stage). The Country environmental Profile will provide decision makers in the partner country and in the european Commission with clear information on the key environmental challenges (including those resulting from increasing climate variability and climate change), the current policy, legislative and institutional framework and the strategies and programmes (including those of the eC and other donors) designed to address them. This information will ensure that the eC cooperation strategies systematically integrate environmental considerations into the selection of focal sectors and cooperation objectives/strategies, and also establish the necessary environment safeguards for all cooperation activities undertaken in the country. The Profile will describe the key linkages between the environment, including climate change, and poverty reduction. it will constitute an important source of baseline information and contribute to focusing political dialogue and cooperation with the country on key areas of concern including sustainable development as well as raising awareness among policy makers. 3. results The profile will deliver the following results: \u00ce \u00ce an assessment of the state of the environment and key environmental factors and trends, including those related to climate, influencing the country\u2019s sustainable development and stability; \u00ce \u00ce an assessment of the main links between the environment and human development in its multiple dimen- sions (income, consumption, health, security, vulnerability, \u2026); \u00ce \u00ce an assessment of national environmental policy and legislation, institutional structures and capacity, and the involvement of civil society in environmental issues; \u00ce \u00ce an assessment of available analysis on the impact of increasing climate variability and climate change on different sectors and the strategies and processes in place or under development to respond to them; \u00ce \u00ce an assessment of the integration of environmental concerns in development policy and sectors with key linkages with environmental issues; \u00ce \u00ce an overview of past and ongoing international (including eC) cooperation in environment as an area for cooperation and environmental integration; \u00ce \u00ce recommendations and, as far as possible, guidelines or criteria for mainstreaming environmental concerns including those concerning adaptation to increasing climate variability and climate change in cooperation areas. These recommendations should support the preparation of the Country strategy Paper/national indicative Programme and include guidelines or criteria to be used for environmental mainstreaming in subsequent phases of the cycle of operations. 4. issues to be assessed The following issues should be assessed using existing sources of information and key stakeholder perspectives. it is not expected that the preparation of the Profile will involve the collection of original environmental data.

Implications of climate change The CeP report should include an overall estimation of both vulnerability (identification of vulnerability factors) and capacity to respond to the consequences of climate variability and change. Policies should be reviewed (e.g. climate-resilient development strategies, national adaptation programmes, low carbon development strategies), together with their institutional components. sources of information may include national Communications under the United nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UnFCCC), and for the least developed countries national adaptation Programmes of action (naPas). existing national or sub- regional studies on the expected effects of climate change should be considered including proposed responses, which may include technical, policy and institutional components. This section of the report will highlight the effects of climate change in exacerbating existing pressures or impacts and the linkages between environmental degradation (ecosystem services) and vulnerability, with a focus on the poorest and most exposed social groups. The overall implications of climate change for focal areas of coopera- tion should be assessed, including any safeguards or need for additional analyses to ensure that investments are adapted to increasing climate variability and predicted climate change effects. 4.4. Integration of environmental and climate change concerns into the main policies and sectors The assessment should examine the integration of environment and climate change in the overall development policy and in sector policies, particularly those that might be identified for eC support, taking into account the focal areas of the current Country strategy Paper as well as and any pre-identified options for future cooperation. This section should examine whether strategic environmental assessments (or similar assessments) are avail- able for the national development strategy or poverty reduction strategy and for the sectors of interest. if such seas exist, they should be briefly described including the main recommendations. The main legislation and insti- tutional arrangements and measures of the sector which address environmental issues, especially those identified in section 4.1 above, should be examined. 4.5. EC cooperation with the country from an environmental perspective This section should briefly review the past and current experience with development cooperation interventions related to environmental and natural resource management including climate change, as well as the steps taken to integrate the environment into other cooperation areas (e.g. sea or eia studies conducted in the context of eC-funded programmes/projects). Where information is available, the environmental impacts or potential risks of past or ongoing cooperation should be identified for the benefit of future programmes. The findings and conclu- sions of existing evaluations/reviews should be summarised. 4.6. Cooperation funded by other donors from an environmental perspective This section should review the past and current involvement of other donors (in particular eU member states, but other significant donors should also be included) and their experience in the country, and include a list of recent and planned projects/programmes with an environmental and/or climate-related focus or anticipated impact. Coordination mechanisms between donors and the eC with respect to the environment should be assessed. 5. Conclusions and recommendations The key aspects of the state and trends of the environment in the country, including policy, regulatory and institu- tional constraints and challenges, should be identified as clearly as possible. The implications of climate variability and climate change on vulnerability and adaptation strategies should also be included. These key aspects may be presented in a matrix, comparing environmental concerns and the main sectors or policies. Based on a comprehensive assessment of available information and on consultations with stakeholders, conclu- sions and recommendations should be formulated on how the Commission and the partner government can best address identified environmental challenges (including climate-related ones) in the Country strategy Paper, taking into account current cooperation and any pre-identified options for future cooperation.

Joint seas should be supported whenever possible.

Interpreting the answers if the answer to one or more of the questions under Part i of the screening questionnaire is YES , an sea is in prin- ciple recommended. local context and processes should be taken into account to identify whether action might already be underway or planned to address environmental sustainability concerns. should a decision be made not to carry out an sea, this should be justified in the summary of SEA screening outcomes (see below). in this case, issues identified under Part i and ii of the screening questionnaire should be considered in the context of the formulation study. The support of the environmental services (in-house or in the country) may be requested to this effect. ",

These requirements may be specified, for instance, in the \u2018cross-cutting issues\u2019 section of the Tor \u2013 or in any other place deemed appropriate. Note that in many cases, adequate integration of environmental and climate-related aspects in formulation work requires the participation of an environmental expert in the formulation team 142 . The checklist below can be used support the identification of issues to be specifically addressed in the formulation study: CheCklisT for The idenTifiCaTion of environmenTal and ClimaTe-relaTed issues 143 1. Key environmental issues affecting sector performance a) Do the problems in the sector have environmental causes, and which are they? some weaknesses in sector development or problems to be solved by the sector policy/programme may result from \u2013 or be exacerbated by \u2013 environmental causes. e.g. Unhealthy living conditions may affect the productivity of the working force or, in the health sector, the achieve- ment of the overall objectives of the sector programme/policy; climate variability and climate change may exacerbate unemployment problems in rural areas, where many jobs are related to agriculture and food processing . b) Are sector activities or infrastructure particularly vulnerable to natural disasters or to the effects of increasing climate variability and climate change? Note that sector-specific guidance in the context of climate change has been developed for key sectors. \u2018Climate change sector scripts\u2019 144 identify key potential effects of climate change on sector activities, and propose a range of possible adaptation and mitigation options (the relevance of which to a specific programme must of course be assessed on a case-by-case basis). c) Do sector activities depend significantly on the availability of natural resources? if the sector or the sector programme activities depend on environmental resources (such as water, land, minerals, biodiversity components), it is recommended that the formulation study assesses whether the resources will be sustainably available at a reasonable cost, with the required quality standards. annex 1 (section 2 of the boxes) can be used to support this analysis. 2. Does the sector policy/programme address the environmental issues identified above? The formulation study should briefly assess whether the sector policy/programme includes adequate responses to the sector\u2013environment linkages identified under Question 1 above and, more specifically, whether: \u00ce \u00ce it addresses the environmental problems affecting the sector; e.g. A programme in the health sector that aims to reduce the incidence of diarrhoea may include actions for increased water quality \u00ce \u00ce it is adapted to the identified opportunities and constraints, or risks such as environmental disasters and the effects of increasing climate variability and climate change; e.g. Infrastructure or human settlements should not be located in flooding areas; disaster risk reduction and emer- gency response mechanisms may be increasingly necessary \u00ce \u00ce it includes measures or strategies in order to ensure or enhance resource sustainability. e.g. Promotion of improved stoves in order to save wood resources; promotion of water-efficient irrigation schemes This analysis may suggest recommendations for actions to be included in the sPsP or to be addressed in the policy dialogue with the government. 142 To be specified in the section of the Tor on \u2018expertise required\u2019. 143 [When preparing the Tor, some elements may be deleted or specified into more detail, depending on the nature of the programme to be supported, the relevance of the questions to the specific context, and the interest of the national authorities and the eC to investigate some specific issues more thoroughly.] ",

CheCklisT for The idenTifiCaTion of environmenTal and ClimaTe-relaTed issues 143 3. Key environmental pressures or impacts associated with or influenced by the sector The main environmental pressures or impacts (including greenhouse gas emissions, if they are significant relative to the current level of national emissions) associated with activities in the sector or directly influenced by the sector should be identified. annex 1 (section 3 of the boxes), as well as the CeP and the results of the screening process undertaken in the identification phase, can be used to support this analysis. 4. Potential environmental effects of sector policy/programme implementation a) What environmental consequences are expected from sector policy/programme imple-mentation? environmental effects may be direct or indirect. indirect effects may result from changes in consumptive behaviour, from new incentives to action or inaction, from awareness raising, from the application of new legislation etc. e.g. A good governance programme may have an impact on illegal logging and timber trade, which will affect the forest environment and, by extension, the country\u2019s contribution to greenhouse gas emissions This analysis is done using the guiding questions \u2018What changes in behaviours and practices will result from implementing the sector policy/programme?\u2019 and \u2018What effects is this likely to cause on the environ- ment or on environmental pressures?\u2019 The sea screening questionnaire (annex 3) and the checklists in annex 1 can be used to support this analysis. For each potential impact associated with an action or programme component, it is important to identify the condi- tions under which the impact will be produced or will be significant (e.g. due to its duration, irreversibility, etc.). This approach allows the identification of mitigation and/or optimisation measures. b) How desirable or problematic are these changes? a brief assessment of these changes should be made taking into account the following criteria: \u00ce \u00ce effects on the poor and vulnerable groups; \u00ce \u00ce sustainability and conservation of natural \u2018capital\u2019 or resources; \u00ce \u00ce consistency with stakeholder concerns; \u00ce \u00ce consistency with government and eC environmental policies and objectives, including those of the major meas; e.g. A sector policy/programme that promotes polycentric regional development is likely to promote increased travel through commuting, which may conflict with objectives related to the emission of greenhouse gases or the curbing of air pollution from vehicles \u00ce \u00ce differentiated impact on men and women. This assessment should lead to the identification of the components and actions in the sector programme that could be enhanced or corrected. c) Could sector policy/programme implementation directly or indirectly increase vulnerability to climate variability and climate change? in some cases, measures adopted in the context of a sector policy/programme may lead to increased vulnerability of the population to climate variability and the expected effects of climate change. e.g. The building of roads and other infrastructure in a coastal area may result in significant migration to this area, and thus end up exposing a larger proportion of the population to sea level rise and coastal storms 5. Opportunities to enhance the environmental performance of the sector The sector may provide opportunities to enhance the environment, as shown by the examples in annex 1 (section 3 in each cooperation area). e.g. The human development sector (which includes education) may achieve significant positive environmental outcomes by integrating environmental education in school programmes; in productive sectors, different strategic options may lead to significant differences in outcomes in terms of greenhouse gas emissions or carbon fixing The formulation study may identify opportunities that allow increasing the environmental performance of the sector policy/programme at low cost.

What measures are being considered to avoid or mitigate negative consequences and optimise positive effects? Are the institutional capacities and legal framework adequate to address the linkages between the environment and the sector? The analysis should include a brief assessment of the capacity of the legal and institutional framework to deal with the identified environmental issues and with climate-related vulnerabilities and challenges, as well as the implemen- tation of any measures identified to mitigate negative impacts and optimise positive environmental effects. The anal- ysis will build on the information contained in the CeP and use the following checklist as guidance: \u00ce \u00ce legal framework (e.g. regarding environmental standards and assessments) ; \u00ce \u00ce environmental law enforcement; \u00ce \u00ce institutional arrangements regarding the response to climate change and environmental integration in the sector: existence of particular programmes or plans, structures, links with other agencies/institutions, level of decentralisation; \u00ce \u00ce capacities of these institutions to collect and process environmental and climate-related information, and to assess and manage environmental and climate-related risks; \u00ce \u00ce public participation and role of civil society in environmental decision making and management. 7. Environmental relevance of sector programme performance indicators do the sector programme performance indicators reflect adequately the environmental concerns identified above? The analysis should check that the proposed performance indicators are not negatively correlated with environ- mental performance. examples of indicators that might be taken into account in focal sectors are provided in annex 1 (section 4 of the boxes). Using the checklist above as a guide, the following elements should be included in the report of the formulation study: \u00ce \u00ce an assessment of the main environmental risks, constraints and opportunities that may affect the rele- vance, effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability or developmental impact of the programme. \u00ce \u00ce an assessment of the sector programme\u2019s main potential impacts on the environment (positive and nega- tive ones). \u00ce \u00ce Where significant environmental and/or climate-related opportunities, risks and constraints are identified, recommendations on possible ways of (better) addressing them in the sector policy/programme as well as in the sPsP supporting them 145 . \u00ce \u00ce Where significant potential impacts on the environment (including climate, in the form of greenhouse gas emissions) are identified, recommendations on possible ways of optimising positive impacts and mitigating negative ones. integration of these aspects in the sPsP formulation study should result in concrete recommendations on: \u00ce \u00ce issues to be addressed by the eC in its dialogue with the partner government to enhance the sector programme from an environmental point of view. \u00ce \u00ce elements to be incorporated in the sPsP to enhance its positive impact or address the identified institu- tional and legal shortcomings (e.g. support actions for capacity building, technical assistance). \u00ce \u00ce Possible indicators to be used to monitor the environmental performance of the sector programme and sPsP implementation. 145 note that because of the limited resources dedicated to environmental assessment in the context of a formulation study (compared to a dedicated strategic environmental assessment), it is not expected that the recommendations made here have the same depth as those that might be expected from an sea.

This information should help to ensure that environmental concerns are appropriately integrated in the decision- making and implementation processes. 3. Results The sea is composed of two parts: a scoping study and an sea study. The scoping study will define the issues that need to be addressed in the sea study, considering the specific context in which the sector programme is being developed and is likely to be implemented.

Issues to be studied 4.1. Scoping study 4.1.1 Overview of the sector programme and its institutional and legislative framework The policy-making and/or planning process relating to the sector under assessment should be presented, including alternative options that may be under discussion. if deemed necessary and with adequate justification, additional options should be suggested for consideration in the sea study. Where a sector policy/programme already exists, its main features should be described. The institutional and legislative framework relating to the sector should be described, building on the information already contained in the Country environmental Profile. Particular attention should be paid to institutions and enti- ties responsible for dealing with environmental aspects involved in the implementation of the sector policy and programme, as well as to the relevant environmental policy and legislation and wider policy framework related to the sector policy and programme. The links between the policy-making/planning process (i.e. the preparation of the sector policy/programme and/ or sPsP) and the sea must be described, i.e. which outputs of the policy-making/planning process should feed into the sea process and vice-versa. The specific policy-making/planning decisions and processes that should be influenced by the sea must be identified, especially aspects of sPsP formulation. 4.1.2 Description of key stakeholders and their concerns The involvement of stakeholders in the sea process is a key success factor. Key stakeholders should be identi- fied: key groups and institutions, environmental agencies, non-governmental organisations, representatives of the public and others, including those groups potentially affected by the likely environmental impacts of implementing the sector programme. Particular attention should be paid to involving typically less represented groups such as women, indigenous peoples and minority groups. Consultants must review records of any national public consultation processes that may have taken place as part of the sector programme preparation process. Based on this review and on additional consultations, they should identify key stakeholders\u2019 concerns and values with respect to the sector programme under consideration and propose a stakeholder engagement strategy 146 . This strategy should provide stakeholders an opportunity to influ- ence decisions. if some of the identified stakeholders are not used to being engaged, particularly at the strategic level, and if there are no precedents, it would be important to include an education component in the stakeholder engagement process. due to the large geographical areas that may be covered by the sector programme, stakeholder engagement could focus on key stakeholders, especially targeting directly affected and vulnerable groups as well as key stake- holders that may not have been adequately represented in the sector programme preparation. records must be kept of all consultations and comments received. 146 The stakeholder engagement strategy to be employed should be agreed with the Commission and the partner government before being implemented in order to avoid unnecessary conflicts or raising of expectations.

This will include a proposal of the geographical units that will need to be addressed. all geographical units identified should be justified. (The definition of geographical units will be more relevant for more detailed programmes, and less so for national- level policies. Thus this section should be amended to reflect the nature of the sector programme being assessed.) 4.1.5 Recommendations on specific impact identification and evaluation methodologies to be used in the SEA study Consultants should provide an indication of the impact identification and evaluation methodologies that will be used in the sea study, with regard to both the sector programme\u2019s expected impacts on the environment and the impacts that environmental conditions and natural resource availability may have on the implementation of the programme and achievement of its objectives. special attention should be given to identifying those environmental interactions that will merit quantitative analyses and those for which qualitative analyses should be carried out. 4.1.6 Indication of the time frames needed to carry out the SEA study The consultants must assess the time that needs to be allowed for the completion of the sea study, based on the initial indicative assessment. if at this stage it is considered necessary to integrate other experts with specific skills, this should be proposed for consideration by the eC. (The EC could give an indication of the maximum budget allocated to the SEA study.) 4.2. SEA study The sea study will be based on the results of the scoping stage (following approval of the scoping study report) and include an environmental baseline study, an identification of environmental and constraints and opportuni- ties, an identification and assessment of the potential environmental impacts, an analysis of performance indi- cators, an assessment of the institutional capacities to address environmental challenges, and conclusions and recommendations. 4.2.1 Environmental baseline study a description and appraisal must be made of the current state of the environment, focusing on those key environ- mental components identified by the scoping study. The trends for, and pressures on, the various environmental components must be identified and a projection must be made of the state of the environment on the short-, medium- and long-term under the assumption of no implementation of the sector programme, taking into account the expected effects of climate change (to the extent they can be predicted with some reliability). external factors must be taken into account, including the influence of other sectoral policies. if the \u2018no implementation\u2019 scenario is unrealistic, the most probable \u2018business-as-usual\u2019 scenario should be selected. The geographical (or mapping) units to be addressed should be described, if relevant. 147 in this case, impacts on humans should be disaggregated by gender, age, or other relevant social criteria. ",
        "Guidelines on the inteGration of environment and Climate ChanGe in development Cooperation \u2013 anneX 5 99 4.2.2 Identification and evaluation of environment-related risks, constraints and opportunities The environmental factors that can affect (positively or negatively) the relevance, effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability of the sector programme, including climate 148 - and natural resource-related aspects, should be iden- tified, described and assessed. These factors may include natural resource availability (e.g. water availability for hydropower generation or irrigation), as well as the current and projected effects of climate change. This part of the study should also consider the environmental issues that could potentially be addressed by the assessed programme. The study should assess if the sector programme provides an adequate response to these constraints and opportunities. in particular and as relevant, the study should assess whether the sector programme, in view of identified vulnerabilities, includes an adequate response in terms of adaptation to climate change \u2013 or may, on the contrary, lead to an inadequate response (\u2018maladaptation\u2019). 4.2.3 Identification and evaluation of impacts The potential environmental consequences of implementing the sector programme, including the positive or negative contribution to greenhouse gas emissions (if significant relative to national emission levels), must be identified and described for each alternative being studied; their significance should be determined taking into account the char- acteristics of impacts 149 , the views and concerns of stakeholders and the sensitivity of the environment. The poten- tial cumulative impacts of the envisaged sector activities should be identified, since they may differ from the sum of individual project impacts. Those impacts which are significant should be assessed in detail taking into account: \u00ce \u00ce the views and concerns of stakeholders; \u00ce \u00ce the consistency with international commitments (multilateral environmental agreements); \u00ce \u00ce the socio-economic consequences (especially on vulnerable groups and ethnic minorities); \u00ce \u00ce economic externalities; \u00ce \u00ce compliance with environmental regulations and standards; \u00ce \u00ce consistency with environmental objectives and policies; and \u00ce \u00ce their implications for sustainable development. as far as climate change mitigation is concerned, different strategies may lead to different outcomes in terms of greenhouse gas emissions or carbon fixing. if various alternatives are under consideration and involve significant differences in this regard, these differences should be evaluated in the study. (More information could be provided on how the methodology presented in the scoping study has been used for impact identification and evaluation.) 4.2.4 Identification and evaluation of impacts in terms of vulnerability to climate risks The direct and indirect impacts of sector programme implementation in terms of increased or reduced vulner- ability to climate variability and climate change should be considered as relevant (e.g. the building of new infra- structure in \u2018climate-sensitive\u2019 areas such as coastal zones may lead to population migration to these areas, thus exposing more people to climate risks; on the contrary, sector-wide measures aimed at improving water efficiency may increase the population\u2019s resilience to climate change-induced droughts). 4.2.5 Analysis of performance indicators Performance indicators proposed by the sector programme (or already envisaged by the eC for the sPsP) should be assessed from an environmental perspective, i.e. with regard to their usefulness to identify the environmental effects (positive and negative) of sector programme implementation and to monitor the environmental and climate- related constraints bearing on the programme. Based on this analysis, proposals should be made as appropriate for the improvement of the existing performance assessment framework. Proposals should also be made for the sPsP performance indicators and monitoring system. 148 The daC enVironeT (network on environment and development Cooperation) Advisory Note on SEA and Adaptation to Climate Change (2008) (www.oecd.org/dataoecd/0/43/42025733.pdf) provides guidance on issues to be addressed to address climate change adaptation within sea with emphasis on: (i) the identification of gaps in information or capacity to generate and handle information; (ii) institutional capacities and extent and efficacy of systems for monitoring key climate variables and factors that contribute to the vulnerability of natural and human systems; (iii) the assessment of current and potential impacts on development and distribution of impacts over different population groups; (iv) strategies employed to address climate risks and hazards and possible adaptation measures to enhance resilience and improve development outcomes \u2013 with particular reference to options that are robust to different climate change scenarios (no-regret), climate-resilient policy alternatives and related institutional and regulatory changes. 149 e.g. duration, probability, magnitude, mitigability, reversibility.

They should suggest the selec- tion of an alternative (if more than one alternative is envisaged), potential changes in the sector programme design (e.g. adoption of measures to increase adaptive capacity with regard to climate variability and the expected effects of climate change), implementation and monitoring modalities, or cooperation actions. in view of the preparation of a support programme, recommendations should especially be made to support the overall assessment of the sector programme (referring to the assessment areas described in the eC guidelines for sPsP) as well as for the sPsP formulation. recommendations for sector programme enhancement should be distinguished from those for sPsP formulation. The recommendations for sector programme enhancement should be incorporated in the policy dialogue with the partner government. recommendations to the eC for sPsP formulation may outline complementary measures to address specific weaknesses in the environmental institutional, legal and policy framework. They should also include proposals for indicators. The limitations of the sea and its assumptions should be presented.

        "Guidelines on the inteGration of environment and Climate ChanGe in development Cooperation \u2013 anneX 6 106 The logical framework (or \u2018logframe\u2019) approach includes three major steps where environment should be inte- grated: problem analysis, strategy analysis and the preparation of the logical framework itself. 1. Problem analysis Problem analysis includes the identification of problems (unsatisfactory situations) and their graphic represen- tation in a problem tree that shows the cause\u2013effect relationships between individual problems. existing prob- lems should be identified with stakeholder participation (including those of groups potentially affected by project impacts) for all three dimensions of sustainable development (economic, social and environmental). Though stake- holders often express problems in socio-economic terms from a subjective perspective, equal attention should be paid to environmental problems and to cause\u2013effect relationships. environmental problems may include: \u00ce \u00ce Poor environmental conditions affecting the target population (e.g. dependence on unproductive resources or resources that are difficult to access, diseases, vulnerability linked to environmental disasters). \u00ce \u00ce Current trends which risk compromising the ability to satisfy future needs, or risk creating future difficulties (e.g. increasing climate variability, other undesirable effects of climate change, deforestation, erosion). \u00ce \u00ce local contributions to external or global environmental problems (e.g. biodiversity losses, GhG emissions). Usually the first type of problems described above will appear in the lower part of the problem tree (because they are the causes of local problems) and the other two categories in the upper part (because they are the conse- quences). Considering the environment at this stage is critical to ensure that subsequent steps \u2013 and especially the strategy analysis \u2013 will lead to the identification of projects that contribute to sustainable development. Figure 1 below shows an example of a simple problem tree that integrates environmental problems, including those that have no impact on the main problem. notice that the environment does not constitute a separate tree and that the term \u2018environment\u2019, which is too vague, is avoided. Figure 1 \u2013 Problem tree including environmental problems Frequent floods destroying irrigation infrastructure High pest damage Decreasing soil fertility Low selling prices Low production Forest cleared Poor production on irrigated fields Poor yields on hills Low income Species threatened ",
        "Guidelines on the inteGration of environment and Climate ChanGe in development Cooperation \u2013 anneX 6 107 2. Strategy analysis after the problem tree has been transformed into an objective tree 153 , showing an improved situation for all prob- lems, the strategy analysis involves selecting the objectives and expected results that will be part of the project. This selection is usually based on an assessment of both: \u00ce \u00ce The feasibility of the strategy \u2013 depending on external factors (including increasing climate variability and other perceived or anticipated effects of climate change), positive (opportunities) or negative (constraints). \u00ce \u00ce The desirability of the strategy \u2013 which depends on its contribution to the overall development objective(s) but also on side effects, including environmental impacts and possible changes in the vulnerability of popu- lations/ecosystems to increasing climate variability and other effects of climate change. When a problem tree has incorporated the environmental problems correctly, environmental objectives in the objective tree can be classified in two categories: \u00ce \u00ce some environmental objectives contribute (directly or indirectly) to the overall development objective(s). if this seems possible, these objectives can be selected as the purpose or expected results for the project. if this does not seem feasible, they will be maintained outside of the project and thus will probably remain unachieved, the related problem should then be considered as a constraint to be taken into account in the selection of a strategy. \u00ce \u00ce other environmental objectives that do not contribute to the main development objectives. They constitute an additional outcome of a particular strategy and may justify its selection. as far as possible the strategy analysis should take into consideration the potential environmental \u2018side effects\u2019 (or \u2018externalities\u2019, in economic jargon) of the proposed strategies. These can be either positive (opportunities for improving the environment arising as a \u2018by-product\u2019 of the project) or negative (adverse impacts on the environ- ment), or a mix of both. The assessment of these externalities, and possibly their valuation (if project formulation includes an economic analysis), may influence the choice of the strategy. Figure 2 below shows an objective tree with two strategies to increase production and income: \u00ce \u00ce a strategy aimed at increasing yield on hills, which will also contribute to forest and biodiversity conserva- tion; and \u00ce \u00ce a strategy based on production in irrigated fields, which might suffer from flood damage. Figure 2 \u2013 Objective tree showing two possible strategies 153 The objective tree is based on the problem tree, each problem (unsatisfactory situation) being replaced with the corresponding improved situation. Irrigation infrastructure less damaged by floods Reduced pest damage Increased soil fertility Higher selling prices Higher production Forest maintained Higher production on irrigated fields Higher yields on hills Higher incomes Species preserved ",
        "Guidelines on the inteGration of environment and Climate ChanGe in development Cooperation \u2013 anneX 6 108 in this case, environmental considerations would result in the selection of the first strategy (on the right-hand side of the figure), because of its positive impacts and because of the constraints affecting the alternative. nevertheless, while designing the project it should be taken into account that some inputs, such as chemicals that can be used to increase yield, may result in adverse environmental impacts. 3. Logical framework There is no specific box in the logical framework structure to incorporate consequences that are external to the objectives, such as environmental impacts. ensuring environmental integration in the logical framework is based on the previous steps (problem and strategy analysis) and on using the guidance below for building the logical framework matrix (see also example of logical framework on the last page of this annex). Table 1: sTruCTure of The logiCal frameWork maTrix Intervention logic Objectively verifiable indicators Sources of verification Assumptions Overall objective a e h Purpose b f h k Results c g h k Activities d means: (i) Costs: (j) k a. Overall objective: because sustainable development should always be an overall objective (explicit or not), key environmental impacts should be referred to; such impacts should (as all objectives) be stated positively. in our example, if we want to contribute both to higher incomes and to forest conservation, without increasing chem- ical pollution, these environmental concerns should be stated. b. Purpose (or specific objective): according to project cycle management rules 154 , there should only be one purpose 155 , but this allows for incorporating environmental requirements, standards or conditions that will contribute to the overall objective. in our example, the strategy analysis resulted in the selection of \u2018higher yield on hills\u2019 as the purpose and the objective tree shows that this will lead to increased incomes and reduced defor- estation rate, but not necessarily to limited chemical pollution: we have thus to revise the purpose, in order to include this environmental concern. c. Expected results: results should always be identified in such a way that they produce the purpose, including its environmental concerns; we may thus revise the wording of the expected results to results to integrate envi- ronmental constraints, or add environmental expected results (if they directly contribute to achieving the project purpose). in our example we mention the requirement to limit the use of chemicals, in the form of a constraint bearing on the \u2018reduced pest damage\u2019 expected result. d. Activities: they should be identified in order to reach the stated expected results, without producing negative side effects. e. Objectively verifiable indicators (OVI) for the overall objective: these indicators should usually reflect the state or trends of the environment and are consequently classified as \u2018state\u2019 indicators. They measure the final, usually indirect and delayed impact of the project on the environment as defined in the overall objective. in our example they could include the deforestation rate. f. OVI for the purpose: the environmental concerns incorporated in the statement of this objective should be expressed by the indicators. in our example, the requirement for the absence of chemical pollution results in the selection of a specific indicator: chemical quality standards for drinking water are met in all wells. g. OVI for expected results: the environmental indicators usually reflect \u2018pressures\u2019 on the environment (instead of final \u2018state\u2019), this allows for a rapid response in the case of undesirable results. in our example an indicator of the use of chemicals is introduced. 154 see eC (2004) Project Cycle Management Guidelines . 155 except in complex projects. as a consequence, the purpose does not have to encompass the three dimensions of sustainable development, but it should be selected from an objective tree combining the three dimensions.

Sources of verification: there is no specific comment regarding environmental integration; however the lack of available sources may constitute a particular constraint to the identification of environmental oVis. i. Means: they are based on the activities and expected results, but environmental criteria should be taken into account in the choice of means (e.g. the unnecessary use of 4x4 vehicles should be avoided). j. Costs: they are dependent on the means: no specific comment on environmental integration; note that environ- mental integration may result in additional costs or in reduced costs. k. Assumptions: they should include uncertain environmental factors, among social, economic or political assumptions. in our example an assumption may be introduced on extreme climatic events.

Interpreting the initial answers If the reply to at least one of questions 1-2 is No , please go to the final section of the screening (Part 3). If the replies to both questions 1\u20132 is Yes , the project is considered potentially at risk, depending on the degree of exposure of its individual components. For instance, projects spanning multiple sectors, involving several different activities, or implemented in multiple types of geographical areas, may not be exposed to risk in all their components. Furthermore, the level of risk is not only determined by climatic exposure, but also by project design, factors of vulnerability and the risk management capacity of project partners and targeted beneficiaries, as well as the socio-economic context. Thus questions 3 to 7 below should be answered to allow an initial appreci- ation of existing conditions and capacities for risk management, focusing on project design and activities, project partners and project context. PROJECT DESIGN (1) NO ? YES 3. Can one reasonably consider that the project will not inadvertently result in barriers to climate risk management?

The option of abandoning high-risk projects may also be considered at this stage if the risk management /adaptation options are not deemed feasible. a number of methods and tools are being developed and tested within the development community which may help project managers making more informed project decisions; a sample of them is presented in appendix ii to this annex.

They provide a description of climate change hazards and constitute basic scientific input that can support a rapid screening exercise. 1. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), WMO-UNEP The 2007 Fourth assessment report (ar4) of the iPCC contains a synthesis report and several working groups reports (WG).

National reports Under the UnFCCC, all developing countries are required to submit national Communications that include a climate vulnerability and adaptation section; they are available at: \u00ce \u00ce http://unfccc.int/national_reports/non-annex_i_natcom/submitted_natcom/items/653.php. all least developed Countries are required to produce a national adaptation Programme of action (naPa); the reports are available at: \u00ce \u00ce http://unfccc.int/cooperation_support/least_developed_countries_portal/items/4751.php. 3. More detailed sources of information The information contained in iPCC reports and national documents provides a preliminary orientation about possible regional and national impacts that should be refined with local investigations at project level. a climate change rapid screening should also consider information from sources that are readily available to, and interpret- able by eU delegation staff. For example, reports from national meteorological services, research bodies or key academic papers that can provide good information. in addition, several sources available on line can also provide climate information. For instance: The Climate Change Country Profiles/Adaptation Learning Mechanism platform (UndP) provides summaries of initiatives by countries; it also includes details about other adaption programmes/projects. available on line at: \u00ce \u00ce www.adaptationlearning.net The Climate change data portal for development practitioners and policy makers (World Bank) is intended to provide quick and readily accessible climate and climate-related data; still work in progress, it is already available on line at: \u00ce \u00ce http://sdwebx.worldbank.org/climateportal ",

The Information notes on climate change and development: EC Cooperation: responding to climate change 162 provide further guidance and examples on possible adaptation measures, alongside options for green- house gases emission reductions, that can bring about development benefits. 161 in Weathering the Storm: Options for Framing Adaptation and Development , the World resources institute (2007) for instance classified adaptation along a continuum from activities that address vulnerability \u2013 which overlap almost completely with traditional development practice \u2013 to highly specialized activities exclusively targeting distinct climate change impacts. The UnFCCC, on the other hand, identifies six categories of adaptation options: behavioural change; technological options; risk management and reduction strategies; promotion of adaptive management strategies; financial schemes; and the promotion of ecosystem management practices. 162 The information notes cover the following sectors: agriculture and rural development; education; energy supply; health; infrastructure (including transport); solid waste management; trade and investment; water supply and sanitation; biodiversity and ecosystems.

Background [national legislation and] [T][t]he european Commission require[s] an environmental impact assessment (eia) to be carried out for the formulation of ( state the name/title of the proposed project ). The eia must examine the poten- tial impacts the project may have on the environment, as well as options for mitigating and/or optimising these impacts. [Optional 164 ] simultaneously, recognising that the implementation of the project and the achievement of its objec- tives will also depend on environmental and climate-related risks, constraints and opportunities, it has been decided to also add an assessment of these aspects. The project is described as follows: ( insert a short description, referring to the current logical framework, to be attached; provide key information, such as objective, rationale for the project, location, duration, technologies to be employed, life-cycle of the project, etc. ) The following technically feasible alternatives have been identified: ( provide a description of the alternatives already identified ). existing information on the project and the environment can be found in ( mention already available studies and infor- mation including the results of the identification phase, and indicate where/how these documents may be obtained/ consulted). in addition to this eia, the following studies are also envisaged ( mention any other studies planned in the formulation phase, including feasibility, economic and financial analyses or social impact assessments ). ( Mention other pertinent background information, such as potential or known projects envisaged in the same area, key stakeholders, legal requirements and existing SEA in the sector). 2. Objective The environmental impact assessment will provide decision makers in the european Commission and the partner country with sufficient information to justify, on environmental grounds, the acceptance, modification or rejection of the project for financing and implementation. it will also provide the basis for guiding subsequent actions, which will ensure that the project is carried out taking into account the environmental issues identified. 3. Results The eia is undertaken in two stages: first a scoping study and then the eia study as such. The scoping study will define the issues that need to be addressed in the eia study, considering the specific context in which the project will be implemented. The activities, calendar and budget for the eia study will be determined on the basis of the conclusions of the eia scoping study. The EIA scoping study will deliver the following results: \u00ce \u00ce an overview of the project, the applicable legislative and institutional framework. \u00ce \u00ce an indication of the project alternatives (proposed by the eC or other alternatives) and their variants to be studied. \u00ce \u00ce a description of the key stakeholders and their concerns. \u00ce \u00ce a stakeholder engagement plan (to be implemented while the eia study as such is conducted). \u00ce \u00ce a description of the key environmental aspects and project-environment interactions that should be addressed in the eia. 164 if not included in the scope of the eia, environmental and climate-related risks, constraints and opportunities must be addressed, as relevant, in the project\u2019s general formulation study.

Issues to be studied 4.1. EIA scoping study 4.1.1 Overview of the project and its alternatives The consultants must describe the project and major project alternatives, especially those which are significantly different from an environmental perspective (e.g. location alternatives affecting different ecosystems, production alternatives involving sizable differences in GhG emissions and/or carbon fixing). The consultants will also define the constraints to be taken into account in proposing mitigation measures and other changes to the project. They must assess whether variations to the proposed alternatives, or additional alternatives, are worth studying. 4.1.2 Legislative, institutional and planning framework a description must be made of the institutional and legislative framework relevant to the project and its eia, including an indication of the key applicable legislation, planning processes (e.g. land use planning), standards and norms that will have to be addressed in the eia study. reference should be made to the Country environmental Profile and to any existing strategic environmental assessment (if relevant). 4.1.3 Description of the key stakeholders and their concerns The engagement of stakeholders in the eia process is a key success factor. The consultants should identify key stakeholders (key groups and institutions, environmental agencies, nGos, representatives of the public and others, including those groups potentially affected by the likely significant environmental impacts of the project). Particular attention should be paid to typically less represented groups such as women, indigenous peoples and minorities as appropriate. stakeholders will be engaged in order to identify their concerns and values with respect to the project under consideration. This will contribute to the identification of key project\u2013environment interactions that will need to be addressed in the eia study. The stakeholder engagement strategy to be employed should be explained in the consultants\u2019 proposal and, if necessary, will be revised by the Commission and the partner government before being implemented in order to avoid unnecessary conflicts and raising of expectations. an effort should be made to involve a wide range of possible interest groups (including local authorities, local and regional nGos, women, and indigenous peoples) in defining issues to be addressed in the eia. records must be kept of all consultations and comments received. 4.1.4 Description of the key environmental aspects and project\u2013environment interactions that should be addressed in the EIA Particular attention should be paid to the (direct or indirect) impacts that are likely to be the most significant, considering the sensitivity of the environment, the pressures resulting from the project and the expectations of the stakeholders. Based on these considerations and on background information on the local environment as well on other environmental assessments (including seas), the consultants should identify environmental issues to be specially considered under the following categories: ",

Practical considerations must be taken into account, such as allowing for the obtaining of samples in different seasons if required. a description and estimation of the resources required (in terms of budget, person-days) must be provided, including a break-down of costs. if at this stage it is considered necessary to integrate other experts with specific skills, this should be proposed in the scoping report for consideration by the eC. (The EC could give an indication of the maximum budget allocated to the EIA study .) 4.2. EIA study The scope of the eia study will be agreed with the Commission in coordination with the partner government and other international partners, on the basis of the results of the scoping study. 165 The eia study should assess the extent to which the proposed project may increase or, on the contrary, reduce the population\u2019s vulnerability to the effects of climate change. annex 7 (Part 1) of the guidelines provides examples of this type of indirect impact. 166 in this case, impacts on humans should be disaggregated according to sex, age, or other relevant social criteria.

This \u2018no project\u2019 scenario will be considered as a benchmark for predicting the project\u2019s environmental impacts. nevertheless if the situation without project seems unrealistic, the most probable alternative should be used as a reference. assumptions used to predict the future situation and trends should be discussed. 4.2.2 Impact identification and evaluation The consultants will identify and describe the potential significant environmental impacts of the project alterna- tives, and evaluate them. significant potential environmental impacts (direct and indirect) must be identified, making use of impact identifi- cation methodologies proposed by the scoping study. impact identification should take into consideration factors such as the sensitivity of the environment, the legislative framework, the pressures resulting from the project and the expectations of stakeholders. impact identification must address the environmental aspects listed in section 4.1.4 above and identified by the scoping study. The impact identification should address, but not necessarily be limited to, the following aspects of the project: \u00ce \u00ce project activities (under construction, operation and decommissioning/abandonment); \u00ce \u00ce associated activities and structures (e.g. base camps during construction); \u00ce \u00ce location; \u00ce \u00ce general layout, size; \u00ce \u00ce time span of the project; \u00ce \u00ce means, materials and resources required (e.g. energy and water consumption, hazardous materials); \u00ce \u00ce polluting discharges and emissions; \u00ce \u00ce noise and vibration; \u00ce \u00ce production of odours, luminous emissions; \u00ce \u00ce solid and hazardous waste production; \u00ce \u00ce land-take requirements; \u00ce \u00ce presence of workers; \u00ce \u00ce access and transport; if relevant, effects on the population\u2019s vulnerability to increasing climate variability and the expected effects of climate change. (If the EC, based on the scoping study, has preference for the use of particular methodologies, or would like more attention to be given to specific components, this should be specified and described here . ) The state of the environment resulting in the short, medium and long term from project implementation will be described on the basis of the same indicators or criteria as the baseline study. The impact evaluation must be assessed in comparison with the expected state of the environment under the no-project scenario. ",
        "Guidelines on the inteGration of environment and Climate ChanGe in development Cooperation \u2013 anneX 8 130 The impacts should be described according to their nature and characteristics (e.g. direct and indirect, temporary or permanent, continuous or intermittent, reversible or irreversible, positive or negative, short- medium- or long- term, their magnitude, their mitigability and compensability, their transboundary nature, accumulation and syner- gies with other impacts). impact significance should assigned, taking into account the local context (e.g. sensitivity of the local environment) as well as the views and values of potentially affected groups. impacts on humans should be disaggregated by sex, age and other relevant social criteria. not all impacts need to be quantified. in some circumstances the attempts at quantification may result in meaning- less numbers that are of no value to the decision-making process. it is thus important to recognise when a clear description of the impact characteristics and the reasons behind a certain qualification will be more useful (e.g. to propose mitigation measures and base a decision) than attempts to produce less meaningful quantification. impacts should be identified for the construction, operation and decommissioning phases of the project, and all associated developments should be taken into account (e.g. power lines associated with a hydroelectric dam, management/disposal of ashes generated by an incinerator, extraction of materials for construction activities). 4.2.3 Measures and recommendations in relation to impacts measures must be proposed to enhance positive effects and to eliminate/mitigate/compensate undesired effects. These measures (generally referred to as mitigation measures) must be technically feasible, economically sound and socially acceptable (i.e. they must take into account the views of the main stakeholders). The consultants must seek ways to optimise such measures, such that one mitigation measure does not reduce the effectiveness of another or, worse yet, cause an undesired significant impact itself. The measures can have several distinct aims: \u00ce \u00ce reducing the extent, scale or time-scale of activities that produce negative impacts in favour of less damaging activities or activities producing positive effects. \u00ce \u00ce Changes in the effects of an activity, without changing the activity itself (for example, adding anti-pollution filters). \u00ce \u00ce strengthening the protection of the receiving environment with respect to project impacts or other hazards. \u00ce \u00ce rehabilitating or restoring damaged resources. \u00ce \u00ce Compensating for damage, e.g. by achieving improvements to resources similar to the ones affected. The residual impacts (i.e. the final environmental impact after the application of the proposed mitigation measures) must be identified and assessed. Based on this assessment the alternatives must be compared and recommen- dations made on the best alternative. The comparison of alternatives must be summarised in tabular form. 4.2.4 Environmental Management Plan The environmental management Plan (emP) is a document that identifies the actions needed to implement the eia recommendations, including environmental monitoring required during the implementation phase of a project. The emP should clearly translate the recommendations from the eia into an operational plan. The emP of the project should include: \u00ce \u00ce a table (logical framework type) showing the objectives, expected results, objectively verifiable indicators, activities (mitigation/optimisation measures), and responsibilities for the implementation of those activities. \u00ce \u00ce institutional arrangements for its implementation and for environmental monitoring: responsibilities, role of the environmental authorities, participation of stakeholders. \u00ce \u00ce suggestions for contracts (environmental clauses: standards, potential requirement to prepare an environmental management Plan of the enterprise) and contracting modalities (such as payments linked to results). \u00ce \u00ce a monitoring and supervision plan (including appropriate indicators, frequency of monitoring, means to gather and analyse the data, reporting system). \u00ce \u00ce a response plan in case of accidents or unexpected results from the environmental monitoring. \u00ce \u00ce a proposed schedule for activities (monitoring and mitigation/optimisation measures). \u00ce \u00ce an indication of means (including personnel, vehicles) and costs of implementing the emP.

The consult- ants are required to state any assumptions made in the prediction and assessment of the potential environmental impacts and risks, to highlight areas where information is deficient and to make clear how the assessment of signif- icance has been determined, for example the use of established standards, quality objectives, stakeholder views and professional judgement. 4.2.6 Conclusions on environmental impacts This section will summarise the key results of the eia, the recommendations (referring to the draft emP to be attached) and the assessment of the residual impacts. The consultants are also required to provide any informa- tion relevant for further economic and financial analyses or for the general formulation study. The limitations of the eia and its key assumptions should be articulated. 4.2.7 [Optional] Identification and evaluation of environmental and climate-related risks, constraints and opportunities The consultants will identify and describe the potentially significant risks, constraints and opportunities associated with the environment in which the project will operate, including (but not necessarily limited to) the following aspects: \u00ce \u00ce availability \u2013 or scarcity \u2013 and quality of the natural resources (e.g. water, land, soils, energy, materials, minerals, plant, animal species, ecosystem services) on which project implementation and the achievement of objectives will depend, taking into account existing pressures, current trends and (to the extent they can be predicted) the projected effects of climate change. \u00ce \u00ce exposure to climate-related risks (e.g. resulting from increasing climate variability, expected effects of climate change). This will be done by reviewing relevant national, sub-regional and local studies on the effects of climate variability and climate change, including proposed responses to address those effects by project partners and within the project context as relevant. These responses may include technical, policy and institutional components. \u00ce \u00ce exposure to other environmental risks or constraints (e.g. biological conditions, pests, invasive species, wildfires, pollution originating from other human activities outside the scope of the project). \u00ce \u00ce exposure to natural disasters, semi-natural disasters and technological accidents, including those that may become more severe or more frequent as a result of climate change. although the analysis is likely to point out primarily to risks and constraints, the existence of opportunities asso- ciated with the natural environment (e.g. availability of abundant natural resources which if properly used and managed can improve the project\u2019s effectiveness, efficiency or sustainability; positive trends resulting from the projected effects of climate change) should also be investigated. The main environmental and climate-related risks, constraints and opportunities associated with the project must be identified making use of the methodology proposed by the scoping study. in order to determine which of them are \u2018significant\u2019 and may thus require a change in project design or the adoption of specific adaptation measures, it is suggested to characterise and evaluate risks, constraints and opportunities against the following criteria: \u00ce \u00ce relevance: are the identified risks, constraints and opportunities somehow relevant to the problems the project aims to address and to its objectives? \u00ce \u00ce effectiveness: can the identified risks, constraints and opportunities positively influence the achievement of project results and objectives, or on the contrary jeopardise it? \u00ce \u00ce efficiency (i.e. \u2018value for money\u2019 or \u2018value for resources\u2019): can the identified risks, constraints and opportuni- ties contribute to the production of outputs and results at a \u2018low\u2019 or \u2018reasonable\u2019 cost in terms of resource use, or on the contrary lead to a disappointing \u2018ratio\u2019 between outputs/results produced and resources employed? \u00ce \u00ce sustainability: can the identified risks, constraints and opportunities promote, or on the contrary prevent, the sustainable production of project benefits over the project\u2019s planned lifetime, from a financial, economic, environmental and social point of view? \u00ce \u00ce impact: can the identified risks, constraints and opportunities contribute to the generation of positive, or on the contrary negative, overall developmental impacts of the project on the wider society in which it operates?

They are required to highlight areas where information is deficient and to make clear how the assessment of significance has been determined, for example the use of quality objectives, stakeholder views and professional judgement. 4.2.10 [Optional] Conclusions on environmental and climate-related risks, constraints and opportunities This section will summarise the key results of the second part of the study, the recommendations and a brief description of the residual risks (i.e. those that cannot be controlled or satisfactorily managed within the limited scope of the project).

        "Guidelines on the inteGration of environment and Climate ChanGe in development Cooperation \u2013 anneX 9 138 This annex provides guidance to address environmental and climate-related issues during the formulation of a project. relevant issues should have been identified during the screening process, which may have identified one or a combination of the following: (a) likely significant impacts justifying an environmental impact assessment (eia). (b) strong indication that impacts will occur but not sufficient to justify an eia. (c) Climate-related risks. (d) other related environmental risks and constraints. (e) environment-related opportunities. depending on the characteristics and context of the particular project, the guidance below should be used to address the relevant issues during the formulation study. Unless a comprehensive eia (covering not only the project\u2019s impacts on the environment, but also environmental and climate-related risks, constraints and opportu- nities \u2013 see annex 8) is undertaken separately from the general formulation study, the standard Tor for the formu- lation of projects may have to be enhanced with specific requirements to address identified environment- and climate-related aspects. These requirements may be specified, for instance, in the \u2018cross-cutting issues( section of the Tor \u2013 or in any other place deemed appropriate Note that in many cases, adequate integration of environmental and climate-related aspects in formulation work requires the participation of an environmental expert in the formulation team 167 . (a) If an environmental impact assessment is required: Guidance for preparing the Tors for an eia is given in annex 8. The traditional focus of an eia is the project\u2019s impacts on the environment. its scope may however be extended so that the study also covers the assessment of environmental and climate-related risks, constraints and opportunities. 168 (b) Environmental impacts, but not sufficiently significant to justify an EIA: Where specific potential negative or positive impacts are expected but no eia is undertaken, further investigation should be carried out in the context of the formulation study to identify practical options to modify the project in order to mitigate negative impacts and optimise positive ones. annex 8, particularly sections 4.2.3 Measures and recommendations in relation to impacts and 4.2.4 Environmental Management Plan , can be consulted for guid- ance on responding to impacts. (c) Climate-related risks: Where screening identifies these issues as important (projects considered \u2018at risk\u2019), then the formulation study should include: \u00ce \u00ce a review of relevant national or sub-regional studies on the effects of climate variability and climate change, proposed responses to address those. These responses may include technical, policy and institu- tional components. \u00ce \u00ce a review of available information on expected climate-related effects relevant to the context of the project . \u00ce \u00ce an assessment of efforts to address climate variability and climate change issues, vulnerability and capacity to adapt 169 . This assessment will cover both efforts underway by project partner institutions and stakeholders, and efforts undertaken more generally within the local context relevant to the project. \u00ce \u00ce a socially and technically robust assessment (recognising the constraints imposed by current limita- tions on agreed methodologies and the availability and reliability of information) of the climate-related risks to the sustainable achievement of project objectives . The assessment should address the specific risks and constraints identified during project screening and should either clearly recommend 167 To be specified in the section of the Tor on \u2018expertise required\u2019. 168 if for any reason this extension of the scope is not feasible or desirable, the latter aspects (i.e. risks, constraints and opportunities) can be included in the scope of the general formulation study, while the eia addresses environmental impacts. 169 These are likely to be included in national Communications under the United nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UnFCCC) and, for the least developed countries, national adaptation Programmes of action (naPas).

(d) Other environmental risks and constraints: depending on the outcome of the project screening exercise, a range of issues may have been identified under this heading. depending on the issue, the following points can be used to guide the assessment during the formu- lation study (unless, of course, they are already included in the eia): \u00ce \u00ce If the project depends on the availability of natural resources, then it is recommended that the study assesses whether the resources will be sustainably available at reasonable cost and whether the rate of use will not exceed their levels of regeneration (in case of renewable resources), taking into account other pressures on the resource. The risk of conflict with other users should also be taken into account. \u00ce \u00ce If the environmental resources required for the project need to meet certain quality criteria, then the study should assess whether the required quality of environmental resources is and will remain acceptable, taking into account trends and pressures (including the impacts of the project itself). \u00ce \u00ce If the project is directly exposed to particular environmental influences, then the study should assess whether these conditions will permit appropriate project performance, taking into account potential changes caused by the project or by external factors. \u00ce \u00ce If the project is vulnerable to natural or environmental disasters, then the study should ensure that the project design takes these aspects into account, including the specification of the necessary safeguards and protection elements. in these cases there will often be an overlap with climate-related aspects and it is also recommended that the formulation study includes consideration of opportunities to strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity in relation to climate change, with respect to both the commu- nities and institutions concerned. annex 8, particularly sections 4.2.7 Identification and evaluation of environmental and climate-related risks, constraints and opportunities and 4.2.8 Proposed adaptation and risk management measures , can also be consulted for guidance on evaluating the significance of risks and constraints and developing a response. The project may expose workers and stakeholders to unsafe or unhealthy conditions. These may be from the project itself or from environmental conditions. The following should be assessed: \u00ce \u00ce risks associated with the project (e.g. increased exposure to floods or landslides due to clearing of forested areas). \u00ce \u00ce health hazards associated with the project (e.g. creation of conditions favourable to the breeding of disease vectors, such as increased surface of stagnant water). \u00ce \u00ce exposure to hazardous substances (e.g. certain agrochemicals) introduced by a project. if such hazards are associated with the project, they should be addressed in the formulation study . (e) Environment-related opportunities: Finally, the process of screening, reflection and discussion could have highlighted specific opportunities associated with the environment and natural resources, which if adequately exploited could have a positive influence on the capacity of the project to deliver its objectives. (For instance, a project located in a region with poor connections to the power grid but a sizeable potential for sun power generation could benefit, in terms of effectiveness and impact, from the installa- tion of photovoltaic panels.) in these cases, during formulation further investigation could be made into the possibilities of concretely exploiting such opportunities.

        "Indicators Annex 10 ",
        "Guidelines on the inteGration of environment and Climate ChanGe in development Cooperation \u2013 anneX 10 142 General indicators are variables used to measure the achievement of an objective. in addition to the identification of adequate variables, it is important to define target levels (or states of the variable) in order to assess to what extent the objective has been reached. indicators are also helpful in defining in concrete terms what the objective really means. This is particularly true for the environment where vague terms like \u2018biodiversity\u2019, \u2018natural resources\u2019, \u2018sustainable development\u2019 or \u2018the envi- ronment\u2019 itself are often used in the formulation of an objective, which limits the understanding of what exactly is behind this objective. From an environmental perspective it is important both to select adequate environmental indicators and also to influence the selection of non-environmental indicators , which otherwise can introduce the risk of encour- aging environmentally damaging trends. For instance, if we want to promote transport, traffic (number of vehicles/ day) \u2013 which is a direct source of pollution - will be less appropriate as an indicator than the number of passengers or the reduction of transport costs. mixed indicators can also be incorporated, such as energy efficiency in trans- port. environmental mainstreaming in a table of indicators is thus more than adding environmental indicators. This is particularly important since it is usually recommended to limit the number of monitored indicators. Classification of indicators indicators are usually classified according to their level: input indicators (which measure the resources provided), output indicators (direct results), outcome indicators (benefits for the target group) and impact indicators (long- term consequences). independently from the environmental nature of the indicators, the hierarchy between these levels should always be maintained, especially when the inputs or the outputs are a source of environmental impact. For instance, when roads are built (outputs) to allow farmers to sell more and at a higher price (outcome), we should never measure the outcome in terms of \u2018number of km of road\u2019 because this is reflecting a cost, including an environmental cost. similarly, if we want to protect biodiversity (impact), we should be aware that the area covered by the network of protected areas (mdG 7, target 7.B, indicator 7.6) measures only an institutional input and implies costs that are not necessarily compensated by a positive impact on biodiversity. This is a general rule but it is particularly impor- tant for environmental integration because environmental costs are frequently associated with low-level objectives. environmental indicators can also be classified according to another system: the dPsir 170 (driving forces - Pressure \u2013 state \u2013 impact \u2013 response): \u00ce \u00ce \u2018driving forces\u2019 relates to drivers, such as population growth, markets, education. \u00ce \u00ce \u2018Pressure\u2019 refers to the human activities generating impacts, e.g. fishing, logging, emission of pollutants. \u00ce \u00ce \u2018state\u2019 refers to the situation and trends of environmental resources or parameters, e.g. forest cover or deforestation rate, water quality. \u00ce \u00ce \u2018impacts\u2019 refers to the consequences for human beings 171 , ecosystems and man-made capital. \u00ce \u00ce response refers to the measures taken in order to address environmental issues, e.g. establishing protected areas, preparing new laws. it is important not to mix these classification systems (notably in assessments like the Country environmental Profile). in logical framework approaches (for niPs, GBs, sPsPs or projects) the input\u2013output\u2013outcome\u2013impact system is the most adequate. 170 dPsir is the causal framework for describing the interactions between society and the environment adopted by the european environment agency: driving forces, pressures, states, impacts, responses (extension of the Psr model developed by the oeCd). see: http://themes.eea.europa.eu/indicators. 171 social indicators should be as far as possible gender-differentiated.

        "Guidelines on the inteGration of environment and Climate ChanGe in development Cooperation \u2013 anneX 10 143 SMART indicators indicators should wherever possible be smarT, that is specific, measurable, accurate, realistic and Timely. This requirement to be smarT should be understood as follows: Specific The indicator should have a strong correlation with the objective that we want to achieve; this means for instance that broad, composite indexes such as the ecological Footprint 172 or the environmental sustainability index 173 should not be used to monitor the performance of specific sector policies or programmes; or, to give another example, that if we are concerned with following the evolution of fish stocks, we should not monitor the fish catch only, since high fish catches may reflect a high fishing pressure as well as a recovery of fish stocks. Measurable The measurement unit or, in case of a ratio, both the numerator and the denominator are to be defined; two different persons measuring the same indicator should find the same result (the indicators are \u2018objectively verifi- able\u2019 as specified in project cycle management terminology); the data should be accessible with sources of verifi- cation in the logframe. Because environment is a very complex area, defining measurable environmental indicators requires particular attention; for instance, if we want to improve water quality, we have to identify what the quality criteria are, and how to measure them, which units to use, etc. Accurate The indicator should be calculated on the basis of reasonably reliable data, obtained by means of adequate sampling approaches, avoiding excessive bias or statistical error. Realistic it should be possible to collect the data with available resources, based on the principle of \u2018proportionate anal- ysis\u2019; when we want to conserve forest biodiversity, for instance, we cannot envisage a census of all species living in the area but we have to identify species or \u2018objects\u2019 (like elephant dung) that are easily detectable; relative census methods should usually be preferred, since they are more cost-effective and usually sufficient to track changes in time. Timely To monitor changes it is important to select the indicators according to the time-lag between the action and the expected change; when we monitor environmental impacts, we should be aware that the change should be noticed before it is already too late to adapt the intervention; for this reason it is important not to rely on (a) old data; (b) indicators that, having been developed for comparing countries (such as the esi) or situations, are not suit- able for monitoring changes; (c) variables influenced by long-term impacts; (d) variables that are deeply affected by uncontrolled short term changes hiding the expected long-term changes. For sustainable development, a major challenge is to find timely indicators that indicate current progress towards long-term or future improvements: these indicators include indicators of \u2018capital\u2019 or \u2018stock\u2019 (e.g. of natural resources) and, from an economic perspec- tive, the genuine saving rates (adjusted net saving 174 ). Specific environmental indicators specific environmental indicators are provided and monitored (in europe) by the european environmental agency 175 . helpful guidance is also provided by oeCd 176 . in development cooperation special attention should be paid to the MDG 7 (\u2018ensure environmental sustainability\u2019) indicators, which are presented and commented in the Table below. 177 172 see: Global Footprint network (www.footprintnetwork.org) and WWF (www.wwf.org). 173 see: www.yale.edu/esi/a_methodology.pdf. 174 see: http://go.worldbank.org/ePmTVTZom0. 175 see: http://themes.eea.europa.eu/indicators. 176 oeCd (2004) OECD key Environmental Indicators , oeCd environment directorate: Paris. 177 Based on new official list of mdG indicators after the 2007 revision, United nations, available from http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/mdg/host.aspx?Content=indicators/officiallist.htm.
