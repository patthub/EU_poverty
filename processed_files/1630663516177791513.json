        "18.12.2010 EN Official Journ al of the E uropean Un ion C 347/55 Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee on \u2018Relations between the European Union and Morocco\u2019 (own-initiative opinion) (2010/C 347/08) Rapporteur: Margarita L\u00d3PEZ ALMEND\u00c1RIZ On 16 July 2009, the European Economic and Social Committee, acting under Rule 29(2) of its Rules of Procedure, decided to draw up an own-initiative opinion on Relations between the European Union and Morocco. The Section for External Relations, which was responsible for preparing the Committee\u2019s work on the subject, adopted its opinion on 7 January 2010. At its 460th plenary session, held on 17 and 18 February 2010 (meeting of 17 February), the European Economic and Social Committee adopted the following opinion by 187 votes to two, with eight abstentions. 1. Conclusions and recommendations 1.1 The EESC considers Morocco\u2019s commitment to set up an economic and social council to be of the utmost importance and thus hopes that this initiative can be carried out within the speci\u00ad fied timeframe; its implementation is at an advanced stage, given that last October the Council of Ministers approved a draft organic law on setting up this new institution which will be submitted to the Moroccan parliament for approval. It is hoped that the eco\u00ad nomic and social council will take up its functions in the coming months, being comprised of representatives of the country\u2019s vital and productive interest groups, primarily the relevant socio- economic and business organisations and associations. The EESC offers its knowledge and advice to help meet this objective. 1.2 The EESC recommends that heads of state at the first EU-Morocco summit, due to be held during the Spanish presi\u00ad dency in the first half of 2010, should give a mandate to the EESC and the future Moroccan ESC to establish structured cooperation ensuring the active participation of organised civil society. 1.3 The E ESC recog nises the Moroccan g overnment\u2019s commit\u00ad ment to integrate the Community acquis into its legislation despite Morocco not being an EU Member State. In future this will help Morocco to participate more fully throughout the whole of the single European market. The integration of the acquis should strengthen the effectiveness of consultation and negotiation bod\u00ad ies, which are based on the principles of representativeness and independence. They should b e provided with sufficien t an d adequate means to carry out their work, while recognising their right to have access to the necessary information and administra\u00ad tive documents. 1.4 In the work carried out by the Kingdom of Morocco towards achieving an \u2018advanced status\u2019, which was obtained on the basis of a Association Council decision at a meeting held in Luxemburg on 13 October 2008, the EESC values the efforts that this coun\u00ad try is making to remain one of the EU\u2019s most important partners in the region. Following the example of what has happened with other countries, for example the members of the European Eco\u00ad nomic Area, conferring on Morocco an advanced status could act as an incentive for the authorities of that country as they strengthen their commitment to the EU and their recognition of the Community acquis in all areas including the social domain and human rights. 1.5 Although the changes occurring in Morocco are to be wel\u00ad comed, it is evident that many reforms are still required before Morocco can be considered a developed country with all the nec\u00ad essary guarantees. 1.6 The EESC believes that the full potential of the relationship with Morocco, in all its aspects, has not been sufficiently devel\u00ad oped. Above all, it is important here to consider the benefits for Moroccan society. It therefore considers that reforms must be pushed forward in order to open up new sectors to trade in ser\u00ad vices and in vestment. I t is n ecessary to promote the developmen t of businesses on both sides, facilitating institutional relations, cre\u00ad ating a favourable climate for business activity and promoting forums for dialogue. Bilateral cooperation must be stepped up in external initiatives of common interest, particularly with the other countries in the Mediterranean area with an eye to better regional integration, from both an economic and a social and environmen\u00ad tal poin t of view. ",
        "C 347/56 EN Official Journ al of the E uropean Un ion 18.12.2010 1.7 Furthermore, it is vital to ensure the participation of civil society in the implementation of these tasks. In this connection and as already mentioned, the EESC is firmly in favour of the cre\u00ad ation of an economic and social consultative council in Morocco and, to this end, calls on the Moroccan authorities to carry out public consultations. It should be based on the principles of rep\u00ad resentativeness, independence and legitimacy. The EESC\u2019s experi\u00ad ence has shown that in order to successfully set up this type of institution, there must be a concerted effort by the different civil society sectors involved and the Moroccan administration, and fair criteria in the definition of how the various organisations will be represented. Such organisations should appoint their represen\u00ad tatives freely. Under no circumstances should the creation of an economic and social council in Morocco legitimise the elimina\u00ad tion of other consultative bodies which already exist, and which participate in the consultation of civil society and help it to mature. The competences of this council should not in principle exclude any subject on which the government is due to express its opinion, including financial matters. 1.8 The EU\u2019s ultimate objective should be for Morocco to become a key strategic reference point in all aspects \u2013 present and future \u2013 of its relation s with the E uromed area. 1.9 In this connection, the EESC recommends the creation of a labour market observatory, a vocational training system and a social security system that does not discriminate against women and strengthens efforts to combat child labour. At the same time, the Committee recommends that the Commission support social dialogue stakeholders, i.e. the social partners, in order to strengthen social dialogue and ensure that it is constructive. 1.10 The Committee finds it regrettable that the EU-Morocco Association Agreement was established without the prior consul\u00ad tation of the social partners on both sides, as regards cooperation on employment and social development. 1.11 It is against this backdrop that the EESC is drawing up an opinion specifically on Morocco, so that organised civil society is taken into consideration in bilateral relations, proposing a new structure for dialogue between civil society on both sides. 2. Explanatory statement 2.1 Morocco is a privileged partner of the European Union, which shares the European external policy objectives of promot\u00ad ing democracy and economic and social development. In order to help meet these objectives, the Moroccan government is working to extend the process of democratisation and further consolidate the rule of law, which makes it the most advanced country in the region. 2.2 The EU\u2019s strategy in Morocco is to address the country\u2019s two main concerns which dominate its political, economic and social agenda. The first is to continue economic growth and deal with unemployment, poverty an d emig ration. On the extern al fron t, however, it is about the intention to implement in full the Asso\u00ad ciation Agreement, the European Neighbourhood Policy and the Action Plans. 2.3 The Ad Hoc EU-Morocco Working Group has recom\u00ad mended that closer ties be established between new stakeholders in the EU-Morocco partnership, in particular between the Euro\u00ad pean and Moroccan parliaments ( 1 ) Greater parliamentary cooperation will be achieved, among other things, by setting up a joint parliamentary commission between the European and Moroccan parliaments, with the participation of both the latter\u2019s chambers and not just the Chamber of Representatives. ( 1 ) on the one hand, and the European Economic and Social Committee and the soon-to-be- created Moroccan economic and social council, on the other. 3. Political situation 3.1 Morocco is a constitutional monarchy, with the monarchy holding very important powers in the country\u2019s government. The current constitution, which dates back to 1970 and was reformed in 1991 and 1996, governs a bicameral parliamentary system, prohibiting explicitly the existence of a one-party system and guaranteeing freedom of association. 3.2 In recent years, the Kingdom of Morocco has been moder\u00ad nising its political system and making it more democratic, with the establishment of a new family civil code, the Political Parties Act, improvements to local democracy, justice and prison reform and a draft of a new electoral law. Despite the achievements made, however, the EESC believes that the social challenges continue to be enormous and require ongoing and coherent action over the long term with an eye to social redistribution, thus facilitating a readjustment in terms of human development indicators. 4. Economic situation 4.1 Morocco\u2019s macroeconomic framework has become stron\u00ad ger despite rather unfavourable conditions. In recent years, how\u00ad ever, the tourism sector has been expanding rapidly, with major investments, primarily in the north of the country. An important ag ricultural reform has b een laun ched with a view to improvin g productivity and strengthening the role of this sector in tackling poverty. 4.2 Despite the fact that competitiveness and efforts to attract investment could still be improved significantly, foreign direct investment has increased substantially, amounting to USD 29 250 m in 2006 ( 2 ) Source: UNCTAD \u2013 FDI/INC Database. ( 2 ), chiefly as a result of privatisations. Since 2006, foreign investment flows have become increasingly disassociated from the privatisation process and important opera\u00ad tion s are being carried out in sectors such as tourism, real estate, telecommunications, insurance, banking, industry and transport.

        "18.12.2010 EN Official Journ al of the E uropean Un ion C 347/57 4.3 The Moroccan economy is relatively diversified, with the services sector making an important and growing contribution to GDP ( 3 ) Approximately two thirds. ( 3 ). The manufacturing sector comes second in terms of its contribution to GDP, followed by the agricultural sector ( 4 ) Including cattle raising, forestry and fishing. ( 4 ), whose share of GDP has been on a downward trend. The contri\u00ad bution of the mining and energy sector to GDP remains modest. 4.4 For its part, tourism represents the main source of Moroc\u00ad can foreign currency, followed by financial remittances from Moroccans living abroad and phosphate exports. Revenue from the export of services ( 5 ) It doubled between 2002 and 2006. ( 5 ) is equivalent to more than 80 % of rev\u00ad enue from goods. A growing number of Europeans choose Morocco as a holiday destination, or even as their place of residence. 4.5 The macroeconomic and structural reforms carried out in recent years have con tributed to the g rowin g diversification of the country\u2019s economy and its successful global performance. The consolidation over the medium and long term of such reforms will be achieved by means of better governance, applying trans\u00ad parent competition rules and implementing an effective policy for protecting consumers and users. In the 2002-2007 period, the average annual rate of real GDP growth in Morocco was 4,5 % ( 6 ) Source: International Monetary Fund (IMF). ( 6 ), sustained by a dynamic domestic demand and a significant increase in the rate of investment. In 2008, the Moroccan economy grew by 5,8 % despite a slowdown due to weaker exter\u00ad nal demand, which in turn was prompted by the international economic and financial crisis as well as the increase in prices, especially of oil. 4.6 The agricultural sector plays a key role in the economic and social development of Morocco, greater than its real value in terms of GDP ( 7 ) Represented 13 % of GDP in 2008. Source: FAO. ( 7 ). It provides work for 44 % ( 8 ) 13 734 506 persons (including agriculture, forestry and fishing). Source: FAO. ( 8 ) of the active popu\u00ad lation, a percentage which rises to 80 % if we take account of the active rural population, owing to the lack of economic diversifi\u00ad cation in the countryside. Agriculture continues to be a sector that is very dependent on the weather, owing to the insufficient development of water infra\u00ad structure. It has scarcely been modernised, maintaining an archaic structure comprising mainly small farms (75 % belong to small\u00ad holders), with limited equipment, antiquated production methods and a low-skilled workforce. Despite this, in part owing to the efforts of the government and foreign investors, there has been a change over recent years. Currently the remaining 25 % of busi\u00ad nesses are large, modern irrigated farms that are clearly export- oriented, producing 80 % of citrus fruits, 35 % of vegetables and 15 % of cereals. There are essentially 400-500 large produc\u00ad ers: major producer-exporters, the Moroccan government and a number of cooperatives. Training, technological support and research are basic compo\u00ad nents that must be included in any future agricultural policies in Morocco. In order to make Moroccan farming more competitive, a more dynamic marketing strategy is needed. At the same time, new structural policies and incentives are needed that will give value to women\u2019s work and foster the creation of community associations as a means of boosting entrepreneurship, which is also needed in the agricultural sphere. 4.7 One part of the new strategy could be cooperatives and other producer organisations, which would serve as instruments that producers could use to group supply and improve their mar\u00ad k et positioning. Moroccan dairy cooperative COPAG is one example of how bringing producers together in cooperatives can generate added value and encourage entrepreneurship in the pro\u00ad duction sector, the weakest link in the chain. 4.8 At the same time, the Green Plan put forward by Morocco in April 2008 seeks to develop the country\u2019s agriculture with the support of private foreign investment, which shows an interest\u00ad ing new agricultural strategy in the Maghreb, and is an example of a change of mentality. The plan aims to turn agriculture into the main driver of the national economy within 10 to 15 years, through strong public investment, in order to achieve two key goals: a modern, high added-value agricultural sector and increased earnings for small farmers. The plan provides for the privatisation of 700 000 hectares, currently used for cereals, with a view to converting them into land for more intensive vegetable and fruit growing, acting as an incentive for irrigation. Over the next ten years, Morocco will channel around MAD 150 m through the Agricultural Development Agency in order to imple\u00ad ment the measures contained in the Green Plan. To this end, 700- 900 projects will be proposed with a cost of between MAD 10 and 15 million annually. 4.9 Morocco is a medium-income country. In 2008, GDP per capita reached USD 2 580 ( 9 ) Source: World Bank - World Development Indicators. ( 9 ), having almost doubled since 2002. 4.10 The Moroccan population increased to more than 31 650 000 in November 2009, growing at an average annual rate of 1,2 % ( 9 ) Source: World Bank - World Development Indicators. ( 9 ). The urban population continues to grow, repre\u00ad senting 56,4 % of the total population. In 2008, the active popu\u00ad lation was 11,5 million ( 10 ) Source: ILO-LABORSTA (database of labour statistics) based on a study of the workforce. ( 10 ) \u2013 0,7 % higher than the previous year, while the labour participation rate fell slightly, to 36,8 %, as com\u00ad pared with 36,9 % in 2007. ",
        "C 347/58 EN Official Journ al of the E uropean Un ion 18.12.2010 4.11 Unemployment continues to be one of the country\u2019s main concerns. In urban areas, the unemployment rate amounts to 14,1 %, whereas it is 4,7 % in rural areas. Overall, the rate of unemployment was 9,4 % in 2008 ( 11 ) Source: ILO-LABORSTA (database of labour statistics). ( 11 ), equivalent to a total of 1 077 800 workers aged 15 and over. Average pay in the Moroc\u00ad can rural sector is between EUR 0,55-0,65/per hour for 9 hours work ( 12 ) Source: Moroccan National Federation for the Agricultural Sector (UMT). ( 12 ), seasonal workers have no labour rights whatsoever and child labour is widespread in Moroccan greenhouses. 4.12 Until now, the international financial crisis has not affected the Moroccan economy significantly, mainly due to the fact that the country\u2019s financial sector was not particularly integrated into the international financial sector. There is no doubt, however, that the international economic crisis is already having an impact on some of the country\u2019s key economic sectors, such as real estate, tourism, textiles, motor vehicles and exports. Foreign investment flows and remittances from abroad have also been affected, and are arriving in Morocco in smaller quantities than before. This could mean that the crisis will affect the country for some time to come. 4.13 Morocco has been classified as the third best destination for foreign direct investment in Africa for 2009-2010, behind South Africa and Egypt ( 13 ) According to a study published by FDI Intelligence, a subsidiary of the British press group \u2018The Financial Times\u2019. ( 13 ). A study points out that Morocco has achieved good results in a variety of categories, such as infrastruc\u00ad ture, strategy for foreign direct investment and economic poten\u00ad tial. However, although the trend in investment flows is positive, the business climate calls for critical analysis. Despite this, last year a general code on business governance and a specific code for SMEs were approved, and implementing decrees were adopted for various amendments to the Limited Company Law. In Octo\u00ad ber 2008, a draft law was adopted on setting up a Moroccan Investment Development Agency (AMDI). 4.14 The Moroccan authorities have put a lot of effort into launching the Euro-Mediterranean Charter for Enterprise, which calls for consultation, consensus and quality. There are various institutions which promote investment by private enterprises, especially by SMEs, and access to credit is promoted through the Central Guaran tees Fun d (CCG). 4.15 Despite everything, the outlook ( 14 ) According to data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). ( 14 ) for the Moroccan economy continues to be encouraging. At present, Morocco is in a sense shielded from the global financial turbulence thanks to its relatively low and long-term external debt, as well as the improve\u00ad ments to its macroeconomic policies. Economic growth should continue to be relatively strong in the medium term with a posi\u00ad tive external current account balance, although there could be a small deficit over the medium term. For its part, the Moroccan government ( 15 ) Forecasts of the Moroccan Economy and Treasury Department. ( 15 ) foresees real GDP growing by 5,8 % in 2009, with the agricultural sector ( 16 ) Including fishing and forestry. ( 16 ) growing by 15 % and the non- agricultural sector by 4,1 %. The country\u2019s economic authorities are determined to push ahead with the budgetary consolidation efforts of recent years and meet the objective of maintaining the primary budget deficit below 3 % of GDP in the medium term. 5. Social situation 5.1 The unemployment rate in 2008 ( 11 ) Source: ILO-LABORSTA (database of labour statistics). ( 11 ) was 9,4 % despite 310 000 jobs having been created in the previous year, mainly in the construction and services sectors. In the first three months of 2009, there was a net creation of 40 000 jobs, the result of 76 000 new jobs being created in urban areas, with a loss of 36 000 jobs in rural areas. The new jobs were limited to the ser\u00ad vices and public works sectors, which recorded increases of 5,9 % respectively, while the other sectors recorded losses ranging from 4,5 % in the industrial sector to 1,4 % in the agricultural and fish\u00ad ing sectors. 5.2 The most serious problem in this area is youth unemploy\u00ad ment ( 17 ) According to figures from the International Labour Organization (ILO), youth unemployment is seven points higher than the average unemployment rate of the active population. 39 % of the unem\u00ad ployed are young people. ( 17 ), including that of university graduates, which is leading to a brain drain. Another issue is that the labour market is domi\u00ad nated by the agricultural sector, which also makes up a significant proportion of informal employment. At the same time, part of the black economy is based on irregular employment. Furthermore, the previous population explosion means that Morocco is faced with growing difficulties in absorbing labour into its labour market. 5.3 These unemployment figures have a direct impact on pri\u00ad vate households as a result of the shortcomings that still exist in social protection systems (unemployment and health insurance, pensions, etc.). 5.4 Migratory flows are diminishing as a result of the economic crisis, with the EU being the main destination for emigrating Moroccan workers. It is important to point out the differences that exist between legal and illegal emigration. Those who endure the latter find themselves in much more difficult reception con\u00ad ditions. There has also been a steady increase in professional exchan ges b etween the two g eographic areas. 5.5 Female participation in the workforce remains low. While male employment rates are around 80 %, female employment is 21 % in urban areas and 33 % in rural areas ( 18 ) Source: Morocco progress report \u2013 SEC (2009) 520/2 of 23 April 2009. ( 18 ). With the excep\u00ad tion of life expectancy, the social development indicators for women are lower than those for men in all other areas, including type of activity, professional status, level of responsibility, wage in the private sector, unemployment rate and level of social protection. ",
        "18.12.2010 EN Official Journ al of the E uropean Un ion C 347/59 5.6 The subject of employment and social affairs should be explored in more depth with a view to creating an institutional framework that makes it possible to develop active measures and public employment services, monitor the labour market in order to tackle the black economy, informal work and undeclared unemployment, improve investment in human capital and employability, increase social protection and inclusion, and employ mechanisms that prevent discrimination in recruitment. 5.7 Social security cover for a large majority of Moroccan work\u00ad ers is inadequate. This situation represents a serious problem for many families. The Moroccan government is aware of this and has the political will to seek a solution. The Moroccan authorities have undertaken to step up monitoring so that the situation of all employed workers is regularised under the social security system. To this end, the labour inspectorate and national social security office are stepping up their efforts to improve workers\u2019 cover. However, the Moroccan government will have to step up invest\u00ad ment in health and medical cover in order to facilitate access by Moroccan citizens to the public health system. 5.8 A tripartite \u2018social compliance\u2019 plan is being drawn up to determine the extent to which Moroccan businesses satisfy and comply with the country\u2019s labour legislation. Furthermore, within the framework Morocco\u2019s new social legislation, progress is being made towards the certification of businesses which comply with labour rules. 5.9 Some time ago, initial steps were taken to establish a cen\u00ad tralised civil society forum, although it was not genuinely repre\u00ad sentative. The Moroccan government has now committed itself to setting up an economic and social council by the end of 2009 but the council has yet to be established officially, despite being included in the Moroccan constitution since 1997. The EESC hopes that the diversity of civil society associations is reflected in the membership of the Moroccan ESC, since the representative\u00ad ness of economic and social councils, guaranteed by clear and fair criteria, is a prerequisite for their effectiveness, their capacity to operate independently and the allocation of the resources they require. The existence of an economic and social council is not at odds with the role of the other consultative bodies that currently exist in Morocco. On the contrary, it complements them. 5.10 Within the business world, the most representative busi\u00ad ness organisation is the General Confederation of Moroccan Busi\u00ad n esses (CGEM). The Chamber of Trade and Industry also plays an important role in supporting businesses, education, training, busi\u00ad ness services and internationalisation. The Association of Moroc\u00ad can Business Women (AFEM), which has more than 350 members at national level, is seeking to promote the role of women in busi\u00ad ness and has regional organisations. The association Maroc Entre\u00ad preneurs promotes learning and business start-ups among young people. 5.11 The main trade union organisations are the Moroccan Workers\u2019 Union (UMT), the Democratic Labour Confederation (CDT), the General Union of Moroccan Workers (UGTM), the Democratic Labour Federation (FDT) and the National Moroccan Workers Union (UNTM). The National Union of Moroccan Agri\u00ad cultural Cooperatives (UNCAM) is also prominent. 5.12 Although the Moroccan government has carried out reforms in the area of labour law, it must continue to take steps to improve observance of labour rights, and ratify the relevant ILO conventions, especially Convention 87 on freedom of association. 5.13 Improving the education system and promoting literacy continues to be one of the most important challenges for the country\u2019s development. In September 2008, the Moroccan min\u00ad istry of education presented an emergency plan designed to pro\u00ad mote the schooling of girls in rural areas, as well as the equal and effective access of children to compulsory education. The lack of a skilled workforce is one of the main obstacles to setting up a business in Morocco, with semi-skilled technical posts the most difficult to fill. 5.14 Efforts are being made to forge closer ties between the Moroccan systems of higher education, research and vocational training and the European area for higher education, scientific research and vocational training. This objective will help improve the qualifications of Moroccan students and their vocational skills so that they can enter the labour market. There is a need for a bet\u00ad ter match between vocational skills and the recruitment needs of businesses. It would be a good idea to facilitate the implementa\u00ad tion of practices in businesses on the basis of agreements between universities and business organisations, such as CGEM and the chambers of commerce. 5.15 The EESC advocates systems to facilitate mutual recogni\u00ad tion of qualifications between the EU and Morocco, taking into account Morocco\u2019s advanced status. One of the main problems facing the country is the high number of unemployed graduates. 5.16 In cooperation with the EU, a working group ( 19 ) Joint EU-Morocco document on strengthening bilateral relations/Advanced status \u2013 DG E V Doc. 13653/08, page 6. ( 19 ) is due to be set up comprising representatives of European and Moroccan business organisations and businesspeople. The objective is to provide the Association Council with regular information on bar\u00ad riers to trade and investment. Trade union representatives may also participate in this group. ",
        "C 347/60 EN Official Journ al of the E uropean Un ion 18.12.2010 5.17 Reforms to extend democracy have achieved advances such as the adoption of a new electoral law boosting female par\u00ad ticipation, anti-corruption measures, and the adoption of a stra\u00ad tegic action plan to provide gender equality with an institutional framework. Although the Moroccan government has withdrawn its reservations concerning the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, it has yet to deposit the relevant instruments at the United Nations ( 20 ) According to the Morocco progress report \u2013 Document SEC (2009) 520/2 of 23 April 2009. ( 20 ). 5.18 In November 2008, the Ministry for Social Development, the Family and Solidarity launched its sixth campaign against gender-based violence, which has helped to increase the number of acts of violence against women being reported via the tele\u00ad phone hotline set up for this purpose. However, there is still a need for more reception centres for victims. Equally, a draft law criminalising gender-based violence ( 21 ) In preparation since 2006. ( 21 ) has yet to be passed, with problems persisting in the application of the family civil code. 5.19 The poverty rate has fallen to 9 % ( 22 ) Source: International Monetary Fund (IMF). ( 22 ), meaning that there are more than 2 million poor people. This con tinues to b e a wor\u00ad rying social situation, making tackling poverty one of the most significant challenges facing the country. The above-mentioned increase in GDP per head is still not enough to tackle poverty. The fact that it is distributed unevenly means that it has not produced the hoped-for increase in living standards. The main tool for reducing poverty successfully has to be increasing economic growth and improving productivity, in parallel with inseparable human rights: economic, social, cultural and environmental rights, without which a better distribution of wealth cannot be guaranteed. There is a need for better coordination among the various poverty-reduction programmes being carried out in Morocco by international institutions such as the United Nations and the World Bank. 5.20 Illegal emigration to the EU is another of the main con\u00ad cerns. Together with the two million Moroccans who reside legally in EU countries, it is estimated that a further million live there illegally. In addition, Morocco is one of the transit countries through which illegal emigrants from sub-Saharan countries travel to the EU. A readmission agreement is being negotiated between the EU and Morocco. 6. Relations between the European Union and Morocco 6.1 The first agreements signed between the European Union and Morocco date back to 1969 and 1976. The EU-Morocco Association Agreement was later signed as part of the Barcelona process which b egan in 1995, en tering in to force in 2000. More recently, in July 2005 the EU-Morocco Action Plan was adopted for a period of five years ( 23 ) To date, three progress reports have been drawn up, in December 2006, April 2008 and April 2009. ( 23 ) within the framework of the Euro\u00ad pean Neighbourhood Policy (ENP). Current relations with Morocco come under the framework of the Union for the Mediterranean. 6.2 The Association Agreement establishes the legal framework for relations between the European Union and Morocco and seeks to create a free trade area, in addition to establishing privileged cooperation in other areas, including the political, economic, social, scientific and cultural spheres. 6.3 The Country Strategy Paper (CSP) establishes the strategic framework for EU assistance to Morocco in the 2007-2013 period, recognising the following priority areas of cooperation: \u2014 development of social policies; \u2014 economic modernisation; \u2014 institutional assistan ce; \u2014 good governance and promotion of human rights and fun\u00ad damental freedoms; \u2014 environmental protection. 6.4 Within the framework of strategic cooperation between Africa and the EU, Morocco plays an active role in political dia\u00ad logue between the EU and Africa as it is the main party respon\u00ad sible for initiating cooperation on climate change. 6.5 In October 2008, a joint document was signed between the EU and Morocco within the framework of the Association Agree\u00ad ment, seeking to strengthen bilateral ties with a view to obtaining the advanced status, which is designed to further political rela\u00ad tions, the integration of the internal market, sectoral cooperation and the human dimension. 6.6 The EU continues to be Morocco\u2019s main trading partner, sin ce more than half of its foreign purchases ( 24 ) 51,4 % of Moroccan imports originate from the EU. ( 24 ) originate from European countries and almost three quarters of its sales ( 25 ) 71,9 % of Moroccan exports are destined for the EU. ( 25 ) are destined for the EU. In terms of a country-by-country breakdown, France is the main supplier, followed by Spain, the United King\u00ad dom, Italy and Germany. There is a similar breakdown for import\u00ad ers of Moroccan goods. 6.7 In terms of the breakdown of trade between the EU and Morocco by products, there has been a gradual diversification of Moroccan imports. Throughout this decade, the number of dif\u00ad ferent European products bought by Morocco has increased con\u00ad siderably. The main products that Morocco imports from the EU are fabrics, petroleum gas and other hydrocarbons, machinery and equipment and chemical products. ",
