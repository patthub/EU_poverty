        "Max Weber PrograMMe, annual rePort 2007-2008 1 Max Weber Programme 2007-2008 Foreword At the start of an academic career one faces many demands. Some are explicit: securing an aca- demic job or preparing the courses that a new academic job may entail; publishing the results of the PhD and work in the years following; presenting these results at international conferences and seminars; meeting the first deadlines, etc. Others are implicit: finding and improving one\u2019s style in academic writing; presenting and teaching; developing a personal research agenda; learning within the specialization, while opening up to new ideas and approaches, etc. These demands, signs of a professional transition, often come at times of a personal transition, together defining the post-doctoral years as unique and challenging times. At the start of an academic career one may also find great opportunities. Some are explicit: a good place and time to work; a positive referee report that may lead to an international publication; an invitation to present one\u2019s work at a conference; recognition of teaching well done, etc. Others are implicit: new possibilities to learn from others; finding time to think and improve beyond im- mediate deadlines; colleagues that may become lasting friends, etc. These opportunities, signs of deserved recognition and, perhaps, luck, often come at times of personal recognition that, while uncertainties are high, there is nothing better than to face the challenges\u2026 The Max Weber Programme is a unique opportunity for post-doctoral Fellows to confront mul- tiple and complex demands, to find new opportunities, to face their uncertainties and challenges. This second year of the Programme testifies to this, and the present 2007-2008 Academic Year Report summarizes the accomplishments of the Programme and, in particular, of the forty Max Weber Fellows. Villa La Fonte has provided an excellent working environment, and in this second year we have learned more about its Tuscan history. This multidisciplinary environment has been complemented by an active involvement of the Fel- lows in their EUI departmental research activities. The immediate results of this research activity can be seen in their articles, books and presentations, listed in this Report. The long-term results will probably be even wider. Fellows in the job market have been supported in their job-seeking activities and we have had a second very successful year of international academic placements. Those Fellows interested have gained teaching experience, either within the EUI or within the network of universities collaborat- ing with the Max Weber Programme. To the people who have made these collaborations possible I want to extend my gratitude. The list is long but I would like to explicitly thank Nick Byrne and Neil McLean of the London School of Economics for making \u2018teaching abroad with meaningful feedback\u2019 possible. In this second year, the Academic Practice and Multidisciplinary Research Activities have gained from the first year\u2019s experience and are starting to define a new model for post-doctoral pro- grammes in the Social Sciences and Humanities. The monthly Max Weber Lecture series is now an intellectual landmark at the EUI, and the Multidisciplinary Research Workshops have been a source of intellectual debate among Fellows. The merit and thanks for these go to the leading scholars who have delivered these lectures and workshops, or participated in the different MWP conferences in the academic year 2007\u20132008. The Academic Practice Workshops have benefited from the presence and follow-up of many professionals, most of them part of an informal network called the \u2018Fiesole Group\u2019. Academic Practice is, to a large extent, a continuous \u2018learning by doing\u2019 process, but learning also involves reflection and critical feedback, both distinct elements of the MWP. I want to thank all the participants for making such a learning process possible and, in par- ticular, for the experience we have all gained. A well-deserved special mention goes to the novel experience of the Academic Practice Groups. It has been within these groups that a collegial active learning has taken place, a valuable experience that I think Fellows will take with them into their future academic careers. ",
        "Max Weber PrograMMe, annual rePort 2007-2008 2 The Max Weber Programme not only provides support to the Max Weber Fellows but also, through the MWP Academic Career Observatory, to everyone interested in ob- taining information and a better understanding of the international academic market, in the Social Sciences and Humanities in particular. The MWP Academic Career Ob- servatory is now the most complete web-based resource on the topic and, based on its information, has this year produced its first report, \u201cTowards an Open and Competitive European Area for Research Careers.\u201d The Max Weber Programme is a project for the development of new forms of post-doc- toral research and education. As one of our Fellows acknowledged, the first who should be thanked are the taxpayers of the European Union who, through the vision of the Europe- an Commission DG Education and Culture and the support of the EUI, are making such a project possible. But the taxpayers\u2019 contribution would not have social returns without the enthusiastic work of the MWP staff and also of those Fellows in particular who have been very actively involved in the Programme. It is not up to me to assess success; the research and academic experience of the Max Weber Fellows speak for themselves. But it is up to me to thank my collaborators and the 2007\u20132008 Max Weber Fellows. Professor Ramon Marimon Director of the Max Weber Programme July 2008 The Max Weber Programme Activities 2007-2008 The aim of the Max Weber Programme, which recruits Fellows from all over the world, is to set standards of excellence in research and academic practice and, in doing so, to become a step- ping stone in the early development of a fruitful academic career for the Max Weber Fellows. In addition to the activities the Fellows are involved with in their respective departments, Fel- lows participate in workshops, seminars and activities within the Max Weber Programme all designed to support and strengthen their academic achievements. The activities of the Max Weber Programme are concentrated around two core themes: Aca- demic Practice and Multidisciplinary Research. Academic Practice Activities Based on the experiences gained from the academic practice activities in the first year of the Programme, the academic year 2007-2008 concentrated on four themes: Presentation and Communication; Job Market; Publishing and Writing; Teaching and Assessment. Presentation and Communication The academic career path is becoming more and more competitive and it is thus essential that one has a good sense of how to present and communicate in the academic world. The initial \u2018September presentations\u2019 of the Fellows\u2019 research agendas not only served the purpose of introducing each Fel- low\u2019s work to colleagues, mentors and, more generally, to the EUI community, but also served as an exercise in public presentation. The seminars were videotaped and followed by feedback sessions in which presentation and public speaking performance were assessed by the EUI Language Centre. Another very important way of presenting oneself is on websites, through online bio-sketches and CVs and the MWP offered fellows the opportunity to develop skills for their design through work- shops and individual tutorials, skills that are related to a successful search on the job market. MWP Activities related to Presentation and Communication : \u2022 September Presentations (Max Weber Fellows) \u2022 Web page Development Workshop (Overnet Education, Florence) \u2022 Academic Communication (David Bowskill, Language Centre, Humboldt Univer- sity Berlin) Thomas Hintermaier, Max We- ber Fellow, September Presen- tation ",
        "Max Weber PrograMMe, annual rePort 2007-2008 3 Job Market The Max Weber Programme actively supports Fellows seeking an academic position. First, in addition to the above-mentioned workshops in which Fellows discuss and develop their CV, cover letter, bio-sketch and web page, they also share information and discuss job market strategies in their fields. Second, Fellows received professional feedback on their presentation and interviewing skills. Mock-interviews were filmed and assessed by professionals and gave Fellows the opportunity for further individual self-assessment on interview techniques. MWP Activities related to the Job Market: \u2022 Mock Job Interviews (Friedrich Kratockwil, SPS Department; Hans Micklitz, LAW Department; Martin van Gelderen and Arfon Rees, HEC Department; Salvador Or- tiguera, ECO Department). \u2022 Interview Skills Training and Feedback on the Mock-Interviews (Susan Goldie and Terry Jones, The Careers Group, University of London). \u2022 Preparing for Academic Practice (Graham Gibs, former Director of the Centre for Excellence, University of Oxford). The MWP is also a platform for obtaining information about, and reflecting on, the current state of the academic job market. In particular, the Academic Careers Observatory offers a unique resource for doctoral students looking for a job in academia and, in general, to people interested in the international comparison of academic careers. Job Market Status of Max Weber Fellows (by the end of the academic year): Of the 40 Fellows 28 were actively on the job market during their fellowship. 25 of these had successfully found positions by the end of their fellowship and three had not yet concluded their job market process. Of the 12 remaining, nine already had position they will return to and three were offered two-year fellowships and will stay with the MWP for another year. Publishing and Writing The MWP considers writing and publishing a core element of the Programme. Two sets of activities were carried out to support the Fellows in this area; the workshops organized by the Programme and the writing activities offered by the EUI Language Centre/ FIESOLE Group. MWP Activities related to Publishing and Writing: \u2022 Publishing Strategies and Refereeing Practice (Peter Mair, SPS Department, EUI; Martin van Gelderen, HEC Department; Neil Walker, LAW Department; Ramon Mari- mon, Economics Department). \u2022 The Virtues of Proper Academic Writing (Deirdre Mc Closkey, Departments of His- tory, Economics, English, and Communication, University of Illinois at Chicago). \u2022 Converting a Thesis into a Book (Angus Wrenn, LSE Language Centre). \u2022 Publishing Strategies and Dealing with publishers (Richard Fisher, Cambridge University Press). \u2022 Making a Proposal for the European Research Council (Ingo Linsenmann, RSCAS, and Tony Molho, Department of History and Civilization, EUI). \u2022 Working Papers and the Use of Cadmus (Veerle Deckmyn, Head of Library, EUI). \u2022 Large Project Management (Fabrice Larat, University of Mannheim and Ingo Lin- senmann, RSCAS, EUI). Seminar Room, Villa la Fonte Linsenmann & Molho Workshop \u201cMaking a Proposal for the ERC\u201d \u201cThe Interviewing Skills Practice and the Mock Job Interview was great, I credit them to getting a job.\u201d brigitte le normand, Max Weber Fellow .

        "Max Weber PrograMMe, annual rePort 2007-2008 4 Activities carried out by the EUI Language/Fiesole Group: The consolidation and enhancement of academic communication skills in English were an inte- gral part of the Max Weber Programme. Organised by the English Unit (EUI Language Centre/ FIESOLE group), they were designed not only to assist non-native fellows in fine-tuning their English skills but also to support the writing process for all the members of the Programme. In September, members of the English Unit observed the Fellows\u2019 presentations and provided feedback on language use and communicative effectiveness. The activities during the year were organized into three components: an academic writing course, offered in the First Term, and individual tutorials and disciplinary writers\u2019 groups, the latter two continuing throughout the year. The writing course focused on how resources such as modality, reporting verbs and self-reference are used to express writer stance and identity in academic texts. Complementary to this work was a series of workshops run by Nick Groom (Language Unit, Birmingham, UK) on the use of discipline-specific corpora to support the writing of research articles for targeted journals. Individual tutorials were used by over half the Fellows, not only to discuss pieces of writing for publication and do \u2018dry runs\u2019 for presentations but also to get feedback on writing for para-academic purposes, interest in which had been trig- gered by several of the Academic Practice Workshops. A new initiative this year, the writers\u2019 groups \u2013 open to both native and non-native speakers of English \u2013 were designed to provide a structured environment in which Fellows could get and provide feedback on their own and others\u2019 writing, contributing in several cases to creating networks among Fellows supportive of disciplinary writing practices. The EUI Language Unit and the Max Weber Programme also offer the Fellows an extensive cor- rections service. English Language correction has been offered to all Fellows for their publications and working papers. Several Fellows have also enjoyed use of the correction service for their Power Point slides, CVs and cover letters. Teaching and Assessment The Max Weber Programme aims at improving and developing standards of excellence in the teaching skills of the Fellows, obviously taking into account that Fellows arrive with different teaching experience and that teaching methods differ across fields and university systems. MWP Activities related to Teaching and Assessment: \u2022 Reflecting on and Refining Pedagogic Practice (Bryan Cunningham, Institute of Education, University of London). \u2022 Micro-Teaching (short teaching sessions all filmed and provided to fellows and to Angela O\u2019Neill for feedback) \u2022 Reflections on Teaching Types and Teaching Skills (Coaching on the Basis of Pres- entations by Angela O\u2019Neill, Coll\u00e8ge d\u2019Europe, Bruges). \u2022 Different Cultures of Teaching and Learning ( Neil McLean, LSE Language Centre). \u2022 Managing Spaces and Classroom Management ( Nick Byrne, LSE Language Centre) \u2022 Managing Large Groups: the Use of Power Point ( Neil McLean, LSE Language Centre) \u2022 E-Learning in Support of Lectures and Seminars and Seminar Management Skills (David Bowskill, Humboldt University, Berlin). \u2022 On the Importance of Curriculum Development ( Lynn McAlpine, Director of the Centre for Excellence, University of Oxford; McGill University, Canada). \u2022 Evaluating and Commenting on the Work of Students ( Mary Scott, Institute of Education, London). \u2022 Creativity and Plagiarism in Academic Writing ( Angus Wrenn, LSE). \u2022 Curriculum Presentations (by fellows with EUI Faculty). Practical Teaching Experience offered to Fellows: In order to enhance the Max Weber Fellows\u2019 teaching skills different options to gain practical ex- perience at different university levels were offered for those interested. 1) EUI: All Fellows were associated with one of the EUI departments where they were given the opportunity to offer graduate seminars to PhD Researchers. During the academic year 2007-2008 Jan-Hinrik Meyer-Sahling, Max Weber Fellow Valentina Fava and Arthur Dye- vre, Max Weber Fellows Lynn McAlpine Workshop \u201c On the Importance of Curriculum Development\u201d ",
        "Max Weber PrograMMe, annual rePort 2007-2008 5 all Fellows gave at least one presentation in either an EUI seminar or working group. Some fel- lows led colloquia with EUI researchers and organized the Dublin Summer School and the JMU Graduate Symposium, both hosted by the EUI. 2) Local Universities : During the academic year the MWP expanded considerably the network of collaboration with local universities and established links with many of the Florence based Ameri- can campuses and the Italian Universities offering undergraduate or Master\u2019s level courses. Among these are James Madison University, Gonzaga University, New York University at La Pietra, Syra- cuse University, FIT/Polimoda and the Istituto di Studi Umanistici. 3) Teaching Abroad: The MWP set up a teaching abroad programme with the London School of Economics in which Max Weber Fellows were offered the possibility of one week\u2019s teaching experience in May 2008. Five Max Weber Fellows, Matei Demetrescu, Joanna Wolszczak-Derlacz, Yoko Akachi, Carmen Menchini and Eszter Bartha were in London from the 12th to the 16th of May. The exchange was set up by the Max Weber Programme and the LSE Teaching and Learning Centre. The Fellows all gave a public lecture and a seminar and received professional feedback on their performance from Nick Byrne, Director, and Neil McLean, Professor at the LSE Teaching and Learning Centre. In addition the Fellows had meetings with LSE faculty members in their fields. \u201cThis was a very useful experience; the visit was a very good complement to other workshops on teaching skills I participated in during my fellowship at the EUI.\u201d Matei Demetrescu, Max Weber Fellow. \u201cThe basic model allows for training followed by live practice and reflection. My impression of both the training in presentation giving and seminar teaching was that it was helpful and offered an opportunity that would not otherwise have existed. I would also say that the five Fellows involved were positive and a real pleasure to work with.\u201d Neil McLean, LSE Language Centre. Academic Practice Groups The discipline bound academic practice groups were a new initiative in the second year of the Max Weber Programme. The Practice Groups were intended to complement the Practice Workshops and served as follow-up or preparatory sessions for the existing workshops. Additional topics and themes were discussed in the groups. The Practice Groups allowed for more discussions and in- depth exchange of ideas and experiences within the disciplines. The groups all produced short re- ports summarizing their meetings. At the end of the year the experiences of the Academic Practice Groups were summarized positively as a means to exchange ideas and academic experiences. The groups helped establish very close working ties and personal ties among the Fellows. ECO Fellows Practice Group The Economics group was coordinated by Anna Lo Prete and held meetings once every month. The ECO group produced short reports on each meeting that were all uploaded to the MWP Intranet (Moodle Platform). During the meetings the following topics were discussed: \u2022 Publishing in Economics Journals \u2022 Job Market process and Fellows\u2019 experiences \u2022 Refereeing practices \u2022 Teaching practices and Fellows\u2019 experiences \u2022 MWP Academic Careers Observatory \u2022 21st Century scholarly communication in Economics \u2022 10 articles with a high standard of academic writing and impact Max Weber Fellows and LSE Language Centre in London Yoko Akachi, Max Weber Fellow Anna Lo Prete, Max Weber Fellow & ECO Academic Practice Group coordinator \u201cThe LSE practice made me realize that tea- ching is fun and that you can get better with some useful tricks and with experience you can only gain by being active. Most of all, I am thankful that this practice gave me more confi- dence in public speaking and teaching.\u201d Yoko akachi, Max Weber Fellow . ",
        "Max Weber PrograMMe, annual rePort 2007-2008 6 HEC Fellows Practice Group The History group was coordinated by Heather Jones. The organization of the different meet- ings was carried out by various fellows. The group produced short reports of each meeting. The group exchanged in particular different national experiences on how to navigate in the academic world as a historian, covering the following topics in their meetings: \u2022 Conference organization \u2022 Publishing articles and monographs \u2022 Electronic teaching resources for historians \u2022 Funding sources \u2022 Microhistory with Carlo Ginzburg \u2022 Teaching skills \u2022 The Max Weber Working Paper \u2022 Evaluating students \u2022 End of year MWP evaluation preparation LAW Fellows Practice Group The Law group was coordinated by Anic\u00e9e Van Engeland and Francesco Maiani. It took a lit- tle extra effort for the lawyers to find common ground on which to base their meetings, partly beacuse of their different professional and national backgrounds. This also turned out to be one of the strengths of the group and the Law Fellows stressed that special attention was given, throughout the group\u2019s meetings, to the international dimension and comparison of teaching models, requirements and experiences. The topics discussed included: \u2022 Course Development \u2022 Class Management \u2022 The use of Power Point in the classroom and other venues \u2022 How to deliver effective presentations \u2022 Measuring the impact of publications \u2022 Publications strategies and research SPS Fellows Practice Group The SPS group was coordinated by Stephanie Mudge. The group worked well and each enjoyed learning from each other, exchanging alternative experiences and academic practices, peer feedback and peer review. In addition the group saw their practice meetings as a good incen- tive for establishing teamwork and group collaboration. These were the topics discussed: \u2022 Job market Strategy \u2022 Publishing Strategies \u2022 Teaching \u2022 Funding Resources and Grant Applications \u2022 PhD Experiences \u2022 Refereeing and Reviewing \u2022 Social Science as a Vocation Self Organized Job Talks Several Fellows have been actively searching for a position to follow their fellowship with the EUI. When needed Fellows have given practice \u2018job talks\u2019 to their fellow colleagues to get feed- back on presentation, style and content. The support for this was high and Fellows have been impressively supportive towards each other. The feedback and exchange among and between Fellows from the different disciplines has been noteworthy.

        "Max Weber PrograMMe, annual rePort 2007-2008 7 Career Support for EUI Researchers The Max Weber Fellows have a good knowledge of the status of the academic job market. They have shared this knowledge not only with the MWP Academic Careers Observatory but also with PhD researchers at the EUI. On June 6th, the Fellows organized, with the EUI Academic Service, a \u201cCareer Strategy Session for End-Stage Researchers at the EUI\u201d. Short presentations were given by Francesco Maiani (LAW), Brigitte Le Normand (HEC) and Jan-Hinrik Meyer-Sahling (SPS) on \u201cHow researchers should use their last 12 to 18 months at the EUI to prepare for the academic job market.\u201d The feedback on the session from researchers was positive. Multidisciplinary Research Activities Other than the academic practice activities, a second set of activities was organised that was designed to improve the Max Weber Fellows\u2019 understanding of the four disciplines, to enhance interdisciplinarity and to create a greater understanding of research and research careers in the Social Sciences in Europe and the United States. Max Weber Lectures The monthly Max Weber Lectures were delivered by distinguished scholars representing the four disciplines of the Programme (Economics, History, Law and Political and Social Sciences). The Programme aimed to invite scholars with a special interdisciplinary focus that would be of broad academic interest to all members of the academic community both within and beyond the EUI. The lectures were always at 17.00 and were followed by a cocktail at Villa La Fonte open to all present. All lectures are published in the Max Weber Lecture Series and are available as pdf files from the EUI publications database CADMUS.

They were organized by the MWP following up on sugges- tions from Fellows and other recommendations. The aim was to enhance multidisciplinary understanding between the disciplines of the Programme. The MWP understood multidisci- plinarity as a process of learning across disciplines, nations and cultures while keeping respect for the conventions of the other disciplines.

        "Max Weber PrograMMe, annual rePort 2007-2008 9 Max Weber Conferences In 2007-2008 the Max Weber Programme sponsored three major conferences: 1) Academic Careers in the Social Sciences and Humanities \u2013 National Com- parions and Opportunities (30 November 2007) The higher education system is undergoing changes in most European countries. This is not least due to the Bologna Process, which aims to create a homogeneous higher education land- scape in Europe. However, even though many governments have introduced reforms to make the academic workplace more attractive and counter the brain drain from the continent to the Anglo-Saxon countries, academic careers still vary greatly between countries. Navigating the different national academic systems and the plethora of available funding and grant systems is not an easy task. More easily accessible knowledge on the various academic structures and career prospects is in high demand, not the least due to the increasing mobility of scholars. To meet this need, the second MWP-ACO conference explored the academic ca- reer options of young PhD holders, focusing mainly on the disciplines of Economics, History, Law, and Political and Social Sciences. Keynote speakers included: Frances Meegan (Careers Advisor, LSE Career Service), Jose- Gines Mora (Director, Centre for the Study of Higher Education Management (CEGES), Va- lencia University of Technology), Kamma Langberg (Danish Centre for Research Analysis, University of Aarhus, Denmark), Daniel Denecke (Council of Graduate Schools, Washington), Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Sawicki (Director, Lille Centre for Politics and Administration), Daniele Checchi (Dean of the School of Political Sciences, Department of Economics, University of Milan), Lisa M. Lynch (William L.

The aim of the conference was to bring together leading international schol- ars, not so much to assess Hume\u2019s contributions, but rather to explain and discuss how some of his different insights have persisted, and still pose open questions in current research in Eco- nomics, Law, History, and Political and Social Sciences. The conference briefly reviewed David Hume\u2019s inquiry into the development and functioning of civil society, and it concentrated on the role of Norms and Institutions as a recurrent theme from the Scottish Enlightenment to 21st century research in the Social Sciences and Humanities. Keynote speakers included: Russell Hardin (New York University), James Harris (University of St. Andrews), Susan James (Birkbeck University), Neil McArthur (University of Manitoba), Nicholas Phillipson (University of Edinburgh), Margaret Schabas (University of British Co- lumbia).

The con- ference brought together leading scholars from diverse disciplines to explore both historical and contemporary evocations of the different dimensions of inequality. A multidisciplinary examination deepened the understanding of the phenomena and positively informed explora- tions of policy measures to fulfil the aspiration towards a just world order. Across time and geographical context, inequality of income, status (gender, race, culture, reli- gion) and capability have been seen through the different institutional arrangements governing human interaction. In an era of globalization, market mechanisms are generating new struc- tures of inequality both between and within countries and regions. Historians, political scien- tists, economists and legal theorists are all grappling with the issue of understanding, defining and evaluating the formation of inequality and equality. Grappling with this issue has acquired pressing urgency given the tensions experienced in forging social, economic, political and cul- tural interaction in a pluralistic world. Keynote speakers included: Homi K. Bhabha (Harvard University), Giuseppe Bertola (Uni- versity of Turin), Mathias Thoenig (University of Geneva), Andrea Cornia (University of Florence), Leondro Prados de la Escosura (Universidad Carlos III de Madrid), Ann Shola Orloff (Northwestern University, Chicago), Margarita Estevez-Abe (Harvard University), Yasemin Soysal (University of Essex), Patrick Weil (Universit\u00e9 Paris I), Jay Winter (Yale Uni- versity), Luc Wintgens (Universit\u00e9 Bruxelles), Otto Pfersmann (Universit\u00e9 Paris I Pantheon Sorbonne), Gianluigi Palombella (Parma University), Heather Perry (University of North Carolina), Pierre Purseigle (Birmingham University), Andreas Bieler (University of Not- tingham), Don Kalb (Central European University, Budapest), Tam\u00e1s Krausz (E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lorand University, Budapest). Co-organised Conferences Studying Religion and Politics (17-18 March 2008) - the Max Weber Programme and the Political and Social Sciences Department, EUI The workshop was organized by two Max Weber Fellows and Researchers and Professors in the SPS Department. The theme of the workshop was the return of religion to the public sphere posing important scientific and methodological challenges of how to study these phenomena. The aim of the workshop was to discuss and map different ways of doing research on questions regarding the relation between religion and politics. One question that the workshop engaged with was whether or not the study of the interaction between religion and politics poses any unique methodological challenges to researchers. Integration without EU membership in Europe: models, experiences, perspec- tives (23-24 May 2008) - the Max Weber Programme and the Law Department, EUI The workshop was organized by three Max Weber Law Fellows (Francesco Maiani, Ekaterina Mouliarova and Roman Petrov) in cooperation with the Law Department and the Max Weber Programme. The workshop provided an excellent opportunity to develop a better understand- ing of existing patterns of integration of third countries with the EU. The speakers - diplomats, judges, professors and researchers from Europe and beyond - focused on issues of a legal, po- litical and historical nature, such as the limits of EU enlargement, successes and failures of Homi K.

It was agreed that the \u201cintegration concept without membership\u201d is not well defined and agreed among policy makers and academics. In particular, it is impor- tant to specify the political and legal means employed for the \u201cintegration concept without membership\u201d. The discussion during the workshop focused on the membership issue in the EU political agenda and the best experiences of the existing EU contractual frameworks that could be applied in the future. Graduate Symposium on the Future of European Union Policies in Theory and Practice (26-27 June 2008) - the Max Weber Programme, the Law Department, EUI and James Madison University The Max Weber Programme at the EUI and James Madison University\u2019s Master\u2019s in European Union Policy Studies held the first graduate symposium on European policies. The two insti- tutions issued a call for papers, initiated by the Max Weber Law Fellows Arthur Dyevre and Anic\u00e9e van Engeland, and was addressed to doctoral researchers and Fellows from all depart- ments at the EUI, and to graduate students enrolled in the Master\u2019s in European Policy Studies at James Madison University. Janine Kisba Silga, a first year EUI student, was awarded the prize for the best paper of the graduate symposium. The aim of the symposium was to discuss the various policies adopted by the European Union, appreciate the effectiveness of these policies, analyze their impact in the field, evaluate whether or not these policies respond to citizens\u2019 needs and understand the European Union as a system of governance. The graduate symposium pursued two goals: to promote the presentation and the critical discussion of current EU policies and to focus discussion on the instruments of evaluation of these policies. Max Weber Fellows Working Group: State Socialism and Beyond The working group was organized by Brigitte le Normand and Eszter Bartha. The purpose of the group was for members to meet on a regular basis and present their research to an interest- ed and informed audience. The group discussed new approaches to the study of social, cultural and political change in the region of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. The group met eleven times over the year and ended the year with a one day symposium \u201cLe- gitimation and State Parties in Socialist Europe\u201d on 29 May, 2008 organized in collaboration with the Department of History and Civilization, EUI. Max Weber Fellows from all four disci- plines and Fellows from the Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies actively participated in and presented papers to the working group.

        "Max Weber PrograMMe, annual rePort 2007-2008 12 MWP Academic Careers Observatory Established in March 2007, the Academic Careers Observa- tory (ACO) of the Max Weber Programme is now in its sec- ond year of activity. The Observatory is funded by the Eu- ropean Commission and, in line with the overall objective of the MWP, it provides online information on academic careers in Europe and beyond to young researchers. The ACO monitors disciplines that the EUI and the MWP also incorporate: Economics, His- tory, Law and Political and Social Sciences. Using the resources available within the EUI and the MWP, the Observatory builds up information for a wider internet public. At the same time, the ACO interacts with its users by allowing them to post comments on the content of its web- site. As this report of activity shows, in the year 2007-2008 the ACO has both reinforced and expanded the way in which it interprets and performs monitoring. Information on academic systems and specific disciplines The backbone of the ACO project is to provide information on national academic structures and job and research opportunities made available by universities and research institutions. On the Observatory\u2019s website users can check information on national higher education sys- tems and barriers to access by non-nationals, career requirements, the type and number of positions available in each system, salaries and discipline-specific information. Web addresses are provided so that researchers can check the list of national universities, total positions, job databases and even specific programmes that, in each state, offer postdoctoral and other re- search opportunities. To get certain types of information, especially on positions and salaries, the ACO sometimes directly contacts the competent national authorities. Four sections of the ACO website provide this information from different perspectives: 1) country reports related to EU and other countries which are viewed as important receivers of international researchers; 2) files on the career patterns and resources related to each of the four disciplines; 3) comparative analyses on specific issues (salaries, gender and age); 4) a list of job and funding resources. Career tips and academic practice ACO \u201ccareer tips\u201d have been online since early 2008. To develop these, the ACO turns the informa- tion provided by experts in academic practice, who train MWP Fellows, into focused and valuable advice. Tips include questions such as applying for a postdoctoral position, turning a PhD into a book and what to do (and not to do) before and during a job interview. The Observatory also relies on the experience of EUI faculty for participation in, for example, panels selecting projects for the 7th EU Framework Programme to guide researchers in drafting research proposals for the Programme. Discussion forums The discussion forums aim to foster networking among researchers worldwide and give them the opportunity to debate questions related to academic careers, job opportunities, salaries and many other issues that are also of concern to the Observatory. The structure of the forums mirrors that of the Observatory\u2019s website sections, giving participants the opportunity to put questions and receive comments on a wide range of issues. ",
        "Max Weber PrograMMe, annual rePort 2007-2008 13 Europe and research In May 2008 a new section was added to the website which helps users navigate the EU system and funding related to research. Through this, the ACO intersects the European Commission\u2019s policy to support researchers\u2019 work and mobility within an open and competitive European Re- search Area, capable of attracting first-class academics from all over the world. Although the EU contribution to the Social Sciences and Humanities is still relatively limited, there is evidence \u2013 which the ACO very much welcomes \u2013 of increasing attention being paid to, and availability of funding for, these disciplines, and we deem this crucial for the construction and functioning of a knowledge economy. Reporting on academic careers The logic that guides reporting by the ACO is to put the information collected by the Ob- servatory into a more analytical perspective, useful for understanding facts, changes and de- velopments in the academic sphere. In early June 2008, the ACO released the report \u201cTowards an Open and Competitive European Area for Research Careers\u201d. The report defines different trends and models of national academic structures, and discusses issues such as salary and women\u2019s representation in academe. It also discusses the increasing relevance of postdoctoral researchers in the Social Sciences and Humanities, and the development of research potential as a preliminary step to finding a way into an academic position. This and other texts produced by the ACO can be downloaded from the \u201cACO documents\u201d section of the Observatory\u2019s web- site. MWP-ACO conferences Conferences provide both an important source of information for the ACO and a unique op- portunity to test its own information and vision on issues related to academic careers. At the same time, they offer experts and Fellows the chance to discuss viewpoints and opportunities concerning the development of academic careers. So far, the ACO has organised two confer- ences. The first start-up conference on \u201cResearch and Higher Education in Europe: Opportuni- ties and Challenges for Young Academics\u201d was organised in May 2007. In November 2007, a second conference concentrated on \u201cAcademic Careers in the Social Sciences and the Humani- ties: National Comparisons and Opportunities\u201d. The next conference will take place in Novem- ber 2008 and will focus on \u201cUniversity Autonomy and the Globalization of Academic Careers\u201d. The themes, programmes, contributions and reports related to each conference can be found on the ACO website under the \u201cACO conferences\u201d section. Conclusions: the challenges ahead Although the Observatory has achieved a great deal, more remains to be done in the light of the broad changes that national academic systems are going through, and eventually their place within the EU framework. At the same time, further attention needs to be paid to the specific features of these systems and the increasing skills required by the academic profession. Num- bers show that we are reaching more people: in May 2008 the ACO website exceeded 12,500 monthly hits, by far the highest number since March 2007 when the Observatory went online. We are happy with this, and take it as a stimulus to keep monitoring academic careers and sup- port the future generations of scholars and professors.

        "Max Weber PrograMMe, annual rePort 2007-2008 14 Max Weber Programme Intranet - Moodle During the first year of running the Max Weber Programme it became evident that it would be useful to have an online communication tool to exchange documents and build up a common platform with all the knowledge and expertise that is gathered and discussed within the Pro- gramme. To fulfil this need the MWP established a Moodle platform accessible to Fellows, staff and workshop facilitators. The platform is used for the exchange of internal documents such as Power Point slides from presentations, reports from Academic Practice Group meetings and in general for the exchange of information and documents of relevance to the Max Weber Fellows. The platform was also used as a communication tool for online discussion among the Fellows and the facilitators on the Programme activities and for more informal, social use. The Moodle platform has been functioning since January 2008. Villa la Fonte and the Cultural and Social Life of MWP Villa La Fonte, the most recent addition to the EUI\u2019s deservedly well-known buildings, is the home of the Max Weber Programme. In the fifteenth- century the Villa, also known as Villa Bel Riposo, was the proud posses- sion and summer dwelling of the Bruni family. One of the most famous Florentine citizens, the humanist, orator and Chancellor of the Floren- tine Republic, Leonardo Bruni (1369-1444) lived here. Leonardo Bruni\u2019s grandson sold the Villa for a thousand \u2018fiorini\u2019 to Francesco di Nerone in 1460. Nerone later saw his house and grounds confiscated by the Medici. As in the case of so many Tuscan villas, this one was later acquired by wealthy Americans, the Smyths, owners of the Vermont railway, who lived in the Villa until after World War II. Twice a day the local electrician, still alive today, brought blocks of ice here on hot days. Mark Twain was a guest of the Smyths and read from his work in the garden theatre. Beautiful surroundings like this ask for a vivid cultural and social life and the cohort of Max Weber Fellows 2007-2008 made this happen. Eve- ry Wednesday collective lunch for all Max Weber Fellows and Staff was served in the Saletta, an event that came out of a Moodle mensa survey to enhance use of the mensa. Table tennis tournaments, the formation of the Mad Max football team which took part in the annual EUI calcetto com- petition Coppa Pavone , the EUI choir, Cinema Villa La Fonte and Tuesday lunchtime debates were just a few of the many social activities that took place around the Villa. A social committee organised outings to the Chi- anti and memorable cultural visits in and around Florence. These visits took place under the expert guidance of Dr. Domnique Fuchs, curator of the Stibbert Museum, and included visits to the Vasari Corridor, Palazzo Pitti, Palazzo Davanzati, the Bargello, San Marco and the Uffizi. The Fel- lows were also hosted at I Tatti, former home of Bernard Berenson and now housing the Harvard University Centre for Italian Renaissance Stud- ies, by its Director Prof. Joe Connors, and at La Pietra, former home of Sir Harold Acton, and now housing New York University in Florence, by its Director Ellyn Toscano.
