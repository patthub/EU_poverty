Resumption of the session President. - I declare resumed the session of the Euro pean Parliament, adjourned on Friday, 18 November 1994. President. - distributed. 2. Approval of the Minutes The Minutes of the last sitting have been Are there any comments? Provan (PPE). - Mr President, in last Friday's Minutes there is no mention of an explanation from the Commis sion as to why it did not make a statement on Spanish accession to the common fisheries policy. The President in the Chair had agreed to find out why Parliament's request was not acceded to by the Commission and we have not yet received an answer. I wonder if you could give us an indication as to when we could expect one. President. - We will check that, Mr Provan. Your comment is quite correct. (Parliament approved the Minutes) 3. Statement by the President President. - Members of this House are aware of the outcome of the referendum in Norway on accession to the European Union. We respect the democratic decision of the Norwegian people, which the Norwegian Govern ment has undertaken to implement. We regret the deci sion not to want to join our Union, but we in this House will do everything in our power to maintain and further develop the existing good relations between the Norwe gian Storting and the European Parliament and, of course, between the Norwegian people and the peoples of the European Union.

        "No 4-454/2 Debates of the European Parliament 30. 11.94 President As regards the consequences of the Norwegian decision, in line with the European Parliament's resolution of 4 May, I will ask for clarification from the Council and the Commission as to what steps now have to be taken. This Parliament will do its utmost to ensure that the enlargement calendar for the three new Member States of Sweden, Finland and Austria is adhered to. I will inform the House of the Council's and Commission's replies. I see that the representative of the presidency of the Council wishes to make a statement. We are happy to have Mr Hoyer here with us. Hoyer, President-in-office of the Council. - (DE) The Council regrets the outcome of the Norwegian referen dum. Of course the European Union will respect the Norwegian vote. All of us in the European Union would have welcomed Norway. That is why Germany, like all the other Member States, supported the Norwegian appli cation for accession and did all it could again and again to try to ensure that the accession negotiations produced results that in our view should really have been accepta ble to the Norwegian people. The European Union will continue its relations with Norway on the basis of the EEA, which has proved its worth. Moreover, the same applies to Norway as to Switzerland: they are and will remain friends and the door to the European Union remains open. For the European Union, the accession of Austria, Fin land and Sweden is an outstanding political success, which is in no way adulterated by the absence of Norway from the group of accession countries. The accession of these three states will give sustained support to the function of the European Union as a central pillar and anchor of stability of a new European peaceful order. It has once again given proof of its power of attraction and ability to act. With the accession of Austria, Sweden and Finland the European Union is joined by states that have influenced and shaped European history to a considerable extent. Well-tried democratic structures, efficient econ omies and the rich cultural heritage of the accession countries will further strengthen the foundations of the European Union. This week I will be approaching the permanent represen tatives for the first time on the question of institutional adjustment to which the President referred. The presiden cy will raise Parliament's questions during the Member States' deliberations and inform Parliament of the out come as soon as at all possible. President. - Thank you for that statement, Mr President- in-Office. (') 4. Welcome President. - I am happy to welcome to the official gallery several Polish members of the European Union-Poland Joint Parliamentary Committee, headed by the co-presi dent, Mr Borokowski. (Applause) ) Verification of credentials - Composition of committees \u2014 Docu ments received - Transfer of appropriations - Application of urgent procedure: see Minutes It gives me special pleasure that your visit today coin cides with the consideration of Mr Oostlander's report on the preparations for the accession of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and I wish colleagues an interesting stay and many fruitful discussions. 5. Order of business President. - The next item is the order of business. The final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at yesterday's meeting has been distributed. On the Izquierdo Rojo report: Green (PSE). - Mr President, I should like to refer the Izquierdo Rojo report back to committee under Rule 129. I understand that there is support for this referral back across the political groups but we should make it abso lutely clear that this report must come back to the December part-session in Strasbourg once the Fisheries Committee has met again. I would like to ask for referral back on the implicit and explicit assumption that it will be back on the agenda of the December part-session in Strasbourg. President. - On that motion by Mrs Green, we can allow one speaker for and one speaker against. Mr Macartney would like to speak in favour. Macartney (ARE). - Mr President, I would like to support this motion. It is already absurd that this Parlia ment and this committee have been asked to debate matters which have been rejected explicitly by the Coun cil of Ministers twice. This is an attempt not only to waste our time but to prevent us from coming back to the subject when it has been properly worked out by the Commission. So I strongly support this proposal. There is a further important point, namely the dubiety about the legal basis of the whole proposal. I suspect that one of the reasons why the Norwegians, especially the fishermen, voted No in the referendum was that they had no faith in the way in which this Union has treated the fisheries question and the accession treaties of Spain and Portugal in particular. There is a real dubiety about this and I should like the committee specifically, under Rule 53, to look at the legal basis when it presents its report. President. - Mrs Langenhagen, are you speaking against the motion? Langenhagen (PPE). - (DE) Mr President, I am sorry, there was a mistake. I would have liked to speak in favour of Mrs Green's motion, but since I do have the floor now, I would ask for a split vote on that motion. President. - Since no-one wants to speak against, I now put the motion by Mrs Green to the vote. (Parliament decided to refer the report back to the committee responsible) The order of business is thus established. ( 2 ) 2 ) Speaking time: see Minutes ",
        "30. 11.94 Debates of the European Parliament No 4-454/3 6. Decision on urgency Proposal for a Council Decision (COM(94)0303 - C4 - 0089/94 - 94/0168(CNS) concerning the continued devel opment of the Handynet system within the framework of Decision 93/136/EEC establishing a third Community actin programme to assist disabled people (HELIOS II 1993-1996) Hughes (PSE), chairman of the Committee on Social Affairs, Employment and the Working Environment. - Mr President, I oppose this request but only on the grounds that I understand from your own services that it will not be possible to take this item with debate over these two days. It is a very important issue to millions of disabled people within the Community. It therefore requires a proper debate. It has been politicized, not least by the United Kingdom Government's actions in trying to withdraw from the Handynet system. I understand the German presidency trying to get urgency because without this it will have very little of substance on its agenda for the Social Affairs Council on 6 Decem ber. But it could take this item as an A point before the end of December on any other Council. And maybe this will give the German presidency some time which it could devote to the anti-poverty programme which is not on the agenda and which it has disgracefully held up for six months. (Applause) Oomen-Ruijten (PPE), rapporteur. - (NL) Mr President, I am not altogether sure I follow what Mr Hughes was saying but the rapporteur and, I believe the chairman of the committee, are in favour of having this subject placed on the agenda with a brief debate. I think it is a good thing, Mr President, especially as we are about to have a European celebration of disabled people at the beginning of next month, on 3 December, that we should have a debate on this again. Just a very brief debate; we will be satisfied with that and can then accommodate the Coun cil's wishes. Brittan, Sir Leon, Member of the Commission. - Mr President, Commissioner Flynn is very anxious that the House should take the Handynet dossier under the urgen cy procedure of this special session. The timing of Parliament's debate on this is very important if the Council of Social Affairs Ministers is to take a position at its meeting of 6 December. If it is not able to do that valuable time will be lost and I do not think it is realistic to expect it to be an A point in the way that has been previously suggested. President. - We will now vote on this motion. (Parliament approved the request for urgent procedure) Pailler (GUE). - (FR) Mr President, it is 30 November and tomorrow, 1 December, will be World AIDS Day. I wonder if it is due to fear, moral taboos or intolerance that the House has remained silent on this occasion. Allow me a few moments to quote the words of a French national who says that 'AIDS is much more than a disease, it is one of the scourges of this century.' He then shows us the tormented face of a dying African child left to its fate because medicine is too expensive. He shows us the wasted body of a drug addict or homosexual allowed to die a slow death because priorities lie elsewhere. God, how intolerable are those who whimper about the AIDS victims of Senegal whilst fixing peanut prices. God, how loathesome are those who start the fires of social exclusion by lay-offs and expulsions and then, play the role of self-righteous firemen handing out a few ecus here and there. As a human being, a communist, a homosexual, it is my duty today to take up this challenge and fight against AIDS. As a woman and a communist Member, it is my duty today to beseech this House, on behalf of my Group and French Communists, to under take some initiative in this field. Langer (V). - (DE) This week we are all very much aware of the capture of Bihac by the Serbian troops. I do not think we can pretend that nothing has happened! Bihac has more or less fallen, and that virtually destroys any prospects of a halfway acceptable peace in Bosnia. It has put the role of the UN, but also of NATO and the European Union, in the wrong light, and quite rightly so! (Applause) The UN and the international community of states were not able to implement what they called for in numerous resolutions. They virtually proved themselves to be failures in terms of protecting international law and achieving ajust peace. That also puts the European Union at risk! The Americans are now cynically saying that the Serbs have now won the war. The President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Kinkel, has also let it be known that Milosevic will probably have to be promoted to become an angel of peace now. Among others, we have now heard that in view of... (Interruptions) Mr President, obviously the interpreters can no longer be heard. (Unrest) The day after tomorrow the contact group will be meeting here, after disappearing from the political arena for six months and paving the way for the most recent events. We call on the Council to report on this here in Parlia ment tomorrow, for the Council to appear here... (Applause) ... and state its position! President. - The Council is present and has heard what you said. Ladies and gentlemen, we are obviously faced with a major technical problem, that will have to be remedied. I must therefore suspend the sitting. (The sitting was suspended at 4.05 p.m. for technical reasons and resumed at 4.10 p.m.) President. - Let me inform you why the sitting was suspended. One of the amplifiers in the interpreting booths broke down. It was a technical fault that has now been dealt with. So we can resume the sitting. Since part of what Mr Langer said could not be inter preted because of that technical fault, I am prepared to give Mr Langer the floor again, not however to make a ",
        "No 4-454/4 Debates of the European Parliament 30. 11.94 President political statement but only to speak to the motion he wanted to table. Langer. - (DE) Mr President, what we would like is for the Council to make a statement here in Parliament tomorrow pursuant to Rule 37 of the Rules of Procedure on the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and on the Euro pean Union's position on it. The day after tomorrow the contact group will be meeting here in Brussels. It had virtually disappeared from the political scene for six months. We believe that Parliament and the European public have a right to know the position of the European Union and the Council on this question. That is why we ask you, Mr President, to ascertain whether this House is prepared to put such a request to the Council and whether the Council is prepared to reply to it. President. - Are there any objections to Mr Langer's motion? Since that is not the case, I ask the President-in -Office whether he is prepared to make the statement requested by Mr Langer tomorrow morning from 9 a.m. to 9.30 a.m. Hoyer, President-in-Office of the Council. - (DE) Mr President, I have understanding for that motion. I will make the necessary contacts and inform you as soon as possible whether the Council is able to make this state ment tomorrow morning. President. - Under our Rules of Procedure, we cannot oblige the Council to make this statement because the motion was tabled very belatedly. In the event that it agrees to do so, I will enter this item on tomorrow's agenda for 9 a.m. Roth (V). - (DE) Mr President, with reference to what Mr Hoyer said and to his maiden speech here as a new European politician, let me congratulate him very warm ly on it. Things can move so fast and people can become European politicians so unexpectedly! He said that nothing could be more efficient than the German Presidency. I wold ask you, Mr President, to examine once again what the promise to ensure democra cy, transparency and openness and strengthen the coop eration with the European Parliament really means. The Council of Ministers of the Interior is meeting today and tomorrow. Our Parliament's Committee on Internal Affairs has been trying for quite some time to obtain the documents drafted for that meeting. We have received a rudimentary agenda but not a single session document! Yet we learn from the papers today that these documents do exist and that the press has been discussing them in the meantime. I consider it quite unacceptable for documents to be discussed publicly that the German Presidency has constantly refused to produce for this Parliament and its Members! President. - Mrs Roth, even if you are right, I must point out that this is not a matter that is on the agenda! Gollnisch (NI). - (FR) Mr President, I shall be very brief. Our communist colleague has mentioned the tragedy of AIDS and the steadily rising number of cases throughout the European Union. It will be for the House to decide whether or not it wishes to undertake work in this area. As a representative of the political group that first raised this question in the French Parliament, I should merely like to say here that one thing did surprise me in the remarks made by my fellow Member. Certainly, victims of all description deserve our compassion, in particular innocent victims like African children or sick people who received contaminated blood transfusions when their national authorities knew them to be contaminated. However, the honourable Member also mentioned moral taboos. May I simply say in conclusion that I do not really know what she means by this term. If she is referring to the basic restraints on which our civilization is founded, then all I can say is that if these restraints had been observed, we would not now be deploring the spread of this epidemic. 7. Accession by the countries of central and eastern Europe President. - The next item is the interim report (A4- 0081/94) by Mr Oostlander, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, on the strategy of the European Union to prepare the countries of central and eastern Europe for accession, with a view to the European Council in Essen (9-10 December 1994) (COM(94)0320 - C4-0137/94 and COM(94)0361 - C4- 0138/94). Oostlander (PPE), rapporteur. - (NL) Mr President, we are dealing here with new countries in Central and Eastern Europe which have freed themselves from the yoke of dictatorship. These new countries are entitled to be offered opportunities by the European Union. This is nothing new to us. Because we have already in the past and for purely political reasons absorbed into the Euro pean Community countries which freed themselves from dictatorship by their own efforts. But the fact is that the present situation is far more complicated, the issues far broader, far deeper. There are different kinds of countries in Central and Eastern Europe: the four traditional Vise grad applicants, other acceptable applicants in Central Europe such as Slovenia, other countries in need of help such as Albania, the former Republic of Macedonia and other countries in Eastern Europe. There are countries which in political terms are far removed from us, for example the criminal bandit state of Serbia, which we are allowing to develop and countries which are moving away from us politically. In Central Europe we have the Baltic states which are very close to us and could be potential member states. And then there is a very different category to which we are not at present ready to offer membership: the CIS states, the former Soviet Union. Now that the Berlin wall has gone it is most important that no new wall, or gulf, is created between us and these countries of Eastern Europe. Because even if we are not offering the prospect of membership, we are able to be far friendlier and more constructive in our relations with them than we could in the past, in the areas of security and trade. The resolution lists a number of structures in which the CIS states could usefully take part. So in talking about the accession of third countries from Central and Eastern Europe we are not once again drawing distinctions. The distinction that used to exist will now be drawn somewhat farther to the east; it will seem less like a distinction and certainly be less marked than the distinction which currently still exists between us and the countries bordering the southern coast of the ",
        "30. 11.94 Debates of the European Parliament No 4-454/5 Oostlander Mediterranean. We have certain priorities. The resolution says very clearly that there has to be a balance between our attitudes towards the east and our attitudes towards the countries bordering the southern coast of the Mediter ranean. For some Member States there are major interests involved here and the security of southern Europe is certainly a matter of prime importance. This resolution points firmly to the need to develop structures for dialogue and to provide the necessary resources for a policy vis-\u00e0-vis the South. Our aim with this resolution was speedy action with an eye to Essen, since the summit on 9 and 10 December will provide a first opportunity of discussing these matters. But we want to serve notice to the Essen summit that changes are needed to our structures. We are familiar with the debate, from bitter experience. We want to get away from the dominance of intergovernmental influences and we want to extend the machinery of Community decision-making, the only one which works. That means at the same time that Parliament's supervi sory powers must be increased. It means too that we want to inform the populations of applicant countries better so that they are well prepared for what awaits them. We do not want to offer them a democracy in decline, an unravelling Union, but something worth having. Internally that requires not only institutional changes but a variety of other changes too. Mention has already been made of agriculture policy, transport policy, coal and steel, the Structural Funds. We shall have to reassess our policy in all areas, in the light of the new position and taking account of the acquis communautaire. On that basis we shall then have to make some adjustments. The Committee on Budgets has made a number of important suggestions. We certainly must not allow a return to the situation in which the Council makes all manner of promises and pledges and then presents us with a budget in which we have no real say. The Committee on Budgets quite rightly says that we need further resources if the accession of the new member countries is to be achieved at all. The criteria for accession set out in this resolution are very important. We want a European Union which truly embodies a sound legal order, based on broad acceptance of judaeo-christian cultural values. Democracy, the con stitutional state, a good policy on minorities and human rights, these are our prime criteria. If they are met we can proceed more quickly towards political cooperation, the second and third pillars, and early moves towards this have already been made. On the matter of security, expansion by NATO may precede the completion of the European Economic Union with these new countries as part of it. We are speaking here against the background of the betrayal of Bosnia-Herzegovina. I think it is a good thing that this resolution does not forget Bosnia-Herzegovina and that we expressly ask the Council what the possibil ities are for the legitimate Government of Bosnia-Herze govina to take part in certain aspects of the PHARE programme. Tillich (PPE), draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. - (DE) Mr President, the Committee on Budgets has looked mainly at the financial aspects of the future enlargement of the Community with the accession of the Central and Eastern European countries. As you know, we had to do so under constant pressure of time, just like the Committee on Foreign Affairs. It is extreme ly important that the European Parliament should deliver its opinion on the financial aspects of the enlargement of the European Union with the accession of the Central and Eastern European countries before the Essen summit. Before the Central and Eastern European countries are given further promises in Essen, it is essential that we answer the question how these countries are to be supported financially in future, for in this area we are dealing with Category IV non-compulsory expenditure, where Parliament certainly has quite a decisive say. We welcome the support for the Central and Eastern European countries. But it is also in our interest to include the question of support for the Mediterranean countries or countries bordering the Mediterranean. We have set out a fourteen-point approach in our opinion on the Oostlander report, and in our view the priorities are as follows: first, enlargement cannot take place on the basis of the current aspects of the Community's own revenue. We ask the Council and the Commission to give answers here. At the same time we want a balanced relationship between financial support for the Central and Eastern European countries and for the Mediterranean states. We believe that we have reached the upper limit in Category IV with the PHARE programme, which accounts for about 25% of the existing volume, and that we therefore need new resources to ensure continuous support for the Central and Eastern European countries. At the same time, of course, there is the question of how the measures proposed by the Commission in its strategy document - a whole catalogue of development areas - e.g. PHARE and TACIS, can be implemented. We expect the Commission and the Council to establish the priorities. In the view of the Committee on Budgets, the resources should be tied to the consolidation of democracy in these countries. In that context, we call for monitoring and control. We need manageable criteria, democracy must be safeguarded. At present, for instance, there is the problem in Rumania, a country which we know is trampling on the rights of the Hungarian minority and where a law is now to be passed. We call for really tough criteria and believe that in the end the Commission must also have the courage to halt or delay the allocation of resources. Of course we are also asking the Council and the Commission about the costs of enlargement. Here in our Community agriculture is already heavily subsidized and we know that things will not become easier when it comes to integrating the agriculture of the Central and Eastern European countries into Community policy. IN THE CHAIR: Mr AVGERINOS Vice-President Wolf (V), draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we in the Committee on Social Affairs saw in the original version of the report that the social dimension, which was rather underemphasized in the Commission document too. needed to be highlighted more clearly. In the course of the further committee discussions, Mr Oostlander accepted this. It is now clear that the social dimension must be a component both of ",
        "No 4-454/6 Debates of the European Parliament 30. 11.94 Wolf the structured relationship strategy and of the integration strategy as such. However, we are still not entirely convinced that this approach, under which the real needs are identified country by country and an action plan is then drawn up for each country, has really been taken up in the version now before us. There is still a need for further discussion here, which cannot be satisfied now but which we must announce for the future, for the approach needs to be more concrete and specific. Only then can we face up to our historic task, namely to promote political integration in eastern Europe in a responsible manner after the radical changeover to democracy, in order to counteract the danger of nationalism. All this needs to be put in more concrete terms. Yet I regard Mr Oostlander's report, in its present modified form, as a good basis for Parliament's position with a view to the approaching Essen summit. Hoyer, President-in-Office of the Council. - (DE) Mr President, thank you for this opportunity to make a statement. The European Union is facing new challenges with regard to shaping its external relations. After the catastrophe of the second world war, the task of contri buting to the creation of a political order that ensures peace, security and democracy triggered the dynamics of the European integration process and this task needs to be redefined after the upheavals in Central and Eastern Europe and also in relation to the European Union's new role in the Mediterranean region. In the Mediterranean region, as in Central and Eastern Europe, it is incumbent on the European Union to use its influence as a political and economic anchor of stability. Various instruments are used to that end. In the Mediter ranean, the Union has adopted the strategy of wider and deeper cooperation in the framework of close neighbour ly relations. In Central and Eastern Europe the Union contributes to stability and security by offering the prospect of accession and by a programme for bringing the associated partner states closer to the European Union. The following points need to be emphasized in relation to Central and Eastern Europe. The priority today, in terms of stability and security in Europe, is to consolidate the reform processes with a view to strengthening their economic and political dynamism and their successful progress is of vital interest not only to those states themselves but also to the European Union as a whole. The stability of the countries in question and of the neighbouring regions depends on that. So the success of the reforms also has direct implications for the security and wellbeing of Western Europe. The Council has noted with great interest the interim report on the pre-accession strategy drafted by this Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy. Let me assure you that it is being examined very carefully. Even at this point I would stress that there is very close agreement on the priorities and basic political orientation of the process of integration. Nor am I overlooking the points of criticism made in the report. They will be examined with equal care and - where possible - be taken into consideration when the strategy is implemented. One significant result of the General Affairs Council meeting this week is the agreement among Member States that this strategy for the integration of the asso ciated partner states in Central and Eastern Europe in the European Union should be presented to the European Council in Essen, at which time there can of course also be an exchange of views between the heads of govern ment and foreign ministers of these countries. The agreement this week is based on a substantial document, that is endorsed by all the Member States and was coordinated closely with all the associated partners in Central and Eastern Europe, most recently at the joint consideration at foreign minister level in Luxembourg on 31 October. With this strategy and the detailed catalogue of measures it contains, the European Union and its Member States are giving a clear and unambiguous signal. The European Union is the catalyst for an emergent pan-European order that encompasses the partner states in Central and Eas tern Europe, and once the European Council in Copen hagen has given a positive reply to the question of 'whether' this future accession is possible, the European Council in Essen will give further-reaching answers on 'how' to prepare for accession on the basis of the strategy agreed this week. This strategy will be implemented politically by the development of structured relations, dating back to a Council decision in Copenhagen. In that way we will imbue our foreign relations with Central and Eastern Europe with a new quality. As from 1995 there will be regular multilateral meetings between the Member States of the Union and the associated states of Central and Eastern Europe at every political level, including meet ings of heads of government, which will consider ques tions of common interest in all the relevant subject areas. Since stabilization depends also and above all on econ omic recovery, the strategy gives priority to integration in the internal market. The planned gradual adoption of the EU internal market rules by the associated states has a key function here. The Commission, working in close cooperation with the associated partners, will draw up a detailed white paper on this. It will be presented shortly, i.e. during the French presidency. The process of integra tion will depend decisively on the political course that will be set here. It is the precondition for the start of a dynamic growth that will have the economic impetus to bring many of the state credits and transfers that seem possible today into these countries. This integration into the internal market must be accompanied by the develop ment of infrastructures, link-ups with the trans-European networks and increased regional cooperation. At the same time it is just as important to ensure the envisaged cooperation in the field of a common foreign and security policy and to draw up joint work programmes in the fields of internal and legal affairs, and especially measures to combat organized crime, the environment, and culture and education. In two critical areas that are a special burden on the EU budget, the European Union is facing particular chal lenges. These are of course the agricultural and structural fields. These are two areas where cries of doom are heard particularly often. Simply to add up the extra cost to be expected following the accession of the Central and Eastern European countries based on the current acquis communautaire is, however, misleading. Instead we must ensure, through a policy of small, feasible steps that on the one hand the attempts at reform in the Central and Eastern European states make some progress in these ",
        "30. 11.94 Debates of the European Parliament No 4-454/7 Hoyer particular areas and on the other hand that no insurmount able obstacles are set up within the EU in these areas. With a view to seeking a solution to the difficult agricul tural problems, the integration strategy calls for a sepa rate study on alternative strategies for integration in the field of agriculture. Furthermore, agreement was reached between the Mem ber States that the PHARE programme should be used more for infrastructure purposes. That will be possible firstly by increasing the volume of PHARE resources for investment promotion from 15% to 25%, secondly by a compromise on the indicative multiannual financial plan ning for PHARE. The strategy proposes fixing the resources allocated to the PHARE programme in the years 1996 to 1999 at no less than the amount allocated in 1995, with further rates of increase being decided after the European Council in Essen. Much the same applies, of course, to Mediterranean policy. The basis will remain the decisions of the Edinburgh European Council on the Financial Perspective, especially in relation to the cate gory of external policy areas. This does not conceal the fact that the main burden of the necessary reform efforts will have to be shouldered by the reform states themselves. It is also in their hands to decide when the time is ripe for beginning the accession negotiations. That cannot be decided on paper, but only on the spot on the basis of the progress achieved at a particular point. The European Union will, however, do its part through the pre-accession strategy to smooth this difficult path as much as possible. Brittan, Sir Leon, Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first I should like to congratulate Mr Oostlan der and the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Security for this report. The work done in such a short time is remarkable and with this report the European Parliament is making an important contribution to the discussion between the Heads of State and Government in Essen next week. The Commission largely shares the views expressed in the report on enlargement itself and on the ways and means of getting there. We particularly welcome the recognition of the importance of a close involvement of the associated countries in a structured dialogue, includ ing the common foreign and security policy. We wel come also the recommendation to build on the existing European agreements to create further economic and trade cooperation. And we welcome the approval of the strategy designed to prepare the associated countries to adopt the internal market and the competition and state aids policy. We also share the view that agriculture is bound to be a key element in the integration of these countries and we intend to present in 1995 a study on alternative strategies for the development of relations in this sensitive field. However, with regard to the budgetary aspects we regret that the report is not more assertive in endorsing the multiannual financial envelope of ECU 7 billion for the PHARE programme over the years 1995 to 1999 which the Commission has proposed. In the Commission propo sal this amount in its annual breakdown would be indicative because it would be subject to the annual budget procedure where the European Parliament will have to pursue its priorities. A stronger endorsement of this though by the European Parliament would, through the incorporation of PHARE into medium-term assist ance strategy, increase the visibility and the impact of the programme on the process of reform. It would also improve the predictability of the European Union's assistance, thus stimulating investment, facilitating coor dination with the other donors and encouraging the decentralization of the implementation of the pro gramme. The Commission wants to continue its dialogue with the European Parliament on the strategy for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe in the context of the further work of the Oostlander report. We hope that a budgetary conclusion more supportive of the real needs of these countries will be sought to the satisfaction of all parties. But I have to say that the Council of Ministers meeting on Monday represented an important step forward, more so perhaps than has been properly represented in the press. The reports of the Council meeting have seemed to suggest that we have not been able to make any progress in resolving the question of the accommodation in financial terms of the needs of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the needs of the Mediterranean countries. That is really not quite the case because it underestimates the significance of the approval Mr Hoyer referred to of a five-year programme of finance where at least the current levels of finance in both areas would be supported. That gives the assurance which enables forward planning to take place in a way that it has not taken place before. What is also important is that it was made clear that there should be a floor and not a ceiling; and not just a floor but a floor attached to an elevator because it was also agreed that there should be increases of the current amounts in the area of the PHARE programme, even though the Council did not agree a precise figure for the increase pending the consideration of the needs of the Mediterranean countries but also of other areas where our foreign policy needs to be buttressed by financial support such as the African countries, the Latin American countries and the countries of Asia to which I have had occasions to refer on numerous occasions in the recent past. I believe that the decision already taken at this stage that we will at least maintain what we have now for five years and that there will be more is something that should give heart to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. And I say this welcoming, as others have already done, the presence of members of the Polish Parliament here in Parliament today. I hope this Parliament will welcome what has been done but spur the Council of Ministers on to accept the full sums that the Commission has put forward in an indicative way in its document. If it does that Parliament will be engaged in its historic task of supporting this development of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe towards membership of the European Union and it will also be fulfilling the historic task it has always had in the past of encouraging both Commission and Council to have more courage than they might otherwise be inclined to have and to go further and faster than they would otherwise go. Titley (PSE). - Mr President, may I say straightaway how much I welcome the Commission communication on the strategy for accession by the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. It brings much needed reality to a debate which up to now has been very long on rhetoric and very short on reality. In the European Union and beyond there are many politicians, including leaders of countries, who, quite frankly, have been very dishonest on this question ",
        "No 4-454/8 Debates of the European Parliament 30. 11.94 Titley of enlargement to include Central and Eastern Europe. They say they are in favour but do not look at the implications. Some of the people who are most in favour are the people most likely to complain about the difficul ties they will have to overcome in order to ensure the accession of these countries. We should also be more realistic in terms of the timeta ble. If we are to get the IGCs ratified before we open negotiations with Central and Eastern European coun tries it seems to me inconceivable that we are talking about enlargement to Central and Eastern Europe before the year 2000. There are many major issues to decide. That was very clear in the Council meeting although I take note of Sir Leon's remarks that the newspaper reports might not be entirely accurate about what hap pened in the Council. Clearly, however, there are consid erable difficulties to be overcome if we are to pave the way for enlargement to Central and Eastern Europe. Colleagues will recall that the current round of enlarge ment in effect took five years to negotiate with four years being taken up simply on the European Economic Area. It is bound to be a much more complicated process for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. But in our enthusiasm for enlargement to Central and Eastern Europe we must not unbalance the European Union in the process. We cannot negotiate on any other basis than a full acceptance of the acquis communautaire by any country which wishes to join the Union. I reject some of the statements that appear to have been made by certain people in the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Security that somehow we should start creating exceptions for certain countries who wish to join the Union. Negotia tions must be on the basis of the acquis communautaire. The problem with the Commission communication, how ever, is that there are certain gaps in it. It very success fully tells the candidate countries what they have to do in order to join the European Union. It does not address so firmly the question of what we have to do if we are really going to allow these countries to join. First, we need to establish some sort of vision of where we think the European Union is going. It is not enough simply to add on countries. Now that we are fifteen we must stop and think exactly where we are going and what sort of Europe we wish to build. Certainly, as has been referred to by the Council and Commission, it is inconceivable that we enlarge to Central and Eastern Europe without some further reform of the common agricultural policy. The financial transf ers that have been estimated are astronomical and I do not believe any single current Member State is prepared to see these sort of financial transfers. We have to look at our common agricultural policy and, speaking personal ly, I believe we must ask ourselves the question: Do we really need a common agricultural policy any longer? Or should subsidiarity reign over agricultural policy in the future? Similarly, we must look at regional policy. Some of the figures I have seen suggest that Spain would be a net contributor to regional policy if the Central Eastern European countries join. I do not believe Spain would accept that situation. These matters have to be addressed in an honest way and we must start addressing them now and stop pretending they do not exist. In the meantime we should continue this process of flexible cooperation. When we looked first at the EFTA countries who could not join the Union at that time for political reasons, we created the European Economic Area. We recognize that with these countries their economies are not strong enough so we should be creating a European Political Area involving them in political dialogue at all levels and, in particular, involving them in a security structure which we need to build for the new Europe. That should be a priority and should not wait upon accession. We should be starting that debate at the moment. I welcome the Oostlander report and the Commission communication but we must start discussing this matter with a firm air of reality about the future of the European Union and how we can possibly enlarge it to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. Goerens (ELDR). - (FR) Mr President, the Oostlander report would no doubt have been clearer if the temptation to produce a crowd-pleasing document with something in it for everybody had been avoided. At this stage it would have been far preferable if the report had just set out one or two major principles for our guidance. The most important of these is that the majority of the Central and Eastern European countries are destined to join the European Union. Then, insofar as we now need to send the right political and psychological signals to the Central and Eastern European countries, we ought to mark out clearly the stretch of road that will lead from association to accession. So let us avoid the endless theological and teleological debates that can only further aggravate the cacophony which already pervades this field. The same applies to the notorious 'deepening' or 'widening' argument. Without wishing to reopen the debate on the objective of 'widening', I do believe that it would be more appropriate to talk of rapprochement to describe the tasks and challenges lying ahead of us. There is no need for 'pies in the sky', for raising expectations that we know in advance we shall not want, or shall not be able, to satisfy. It is totally unrealistic, for example, to talk at this stage of a strategy for preparing the countries of Central and Eastern Europe to join Economic and Monetary Union when we are still in the dark about which countries of the present Union will be ready for EMU membership when the time comes. Nothing will have been gained if the culture of lies that Central and Eastern Europe used to live in before 1989 is now replaced by phrasemaking and illusions. A detailed and realistic inventory of all the various obstacles as a contribution to the establishment of a new order charac terized by justice, peace, prosperity and security would in fact make for faster progress. Carnero Gonz\u00e1lez (GUE). - (ES) Mr President, the Confederal Group of the European United Left is in favour of the enlargement of the Union to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe; it considers that as well as being necessary, this is unavoidable. It is clear at this juncture that it will be impossible to develop European unity without the participation of these countries. How ever, while in favour of this enlargement, we think that it must be conducted in accordance with the principle of deepening. It will be impossible to proceed with the integration of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe in due course if all the mechanisms of the Union are not properly prepared for this. This is something that should ",
        "30. 11.94 Debates of the European Parliament No 4-454/9 Carnero Gonz\u00e1lez be tackled during the revision of the Maastricht Treaty in 1996. In our view, the accession of these countries must be prepared without haste, but also without hesitation. Their accession cannot be obtained at the expense of what has been achieved so far, and must not result in discrimina tion between members or the creation of different catego ries of members. It must be organised in terms of a contribution to the political and economic unity of Europe, mindful of the views of all the members of the Union, not just the most powerful. The applicant coun tries must ensure that their basic social balance is not sacrificed to meet the requirements of the single market; sufficient funding will therefore have to be made availa ble to underpin the main common policies, such as the CAP, so that the same budget does not have to be shared out among more countries. Enlargement of the Union to include the countries of Central and Eastern Europe must, we believe, comprise political measures too. And we do not think it a good idea to strengthen and extend NATO - directly or indirectly - through the association of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, thus establishing it as a pan-European security body. On the contrary, the CSCE must be developed as the sole organisation in this area. We consider that enlargement eastwards must be bal anced with enlargement southwards, namely in the Medi terranean area. We therefore support the proposal by the Commission to considerably reduce the disparity between aid to the East and aid to the Mediterranean, and to ensure that the forthcoming 1995 Conference dis cusses the institutionalisation of security mechanisms which must, in some form or other, be similar to those established by the CSCE. Finally, we also believe that enlargement to include the countries of Central and Eastern Europe must not take precedence over the earlier applications for membership by Cyprus and Malta, and should not go ahead until relations with Russia and the CIS have been overhauled. Casini P.F. (FE). - (IT) Mr President, Mr Oostlander has done a good job, but the Forza Europa Group wishes nonetheless to make four further points in this debate: - Firstly: we have to identify both the institutional and the financial conditions - and this is one aspect of the problem - that will enable a Union enlarged still further to function properly, and this needs to be done before the accession negotiations are set under way. - Secondly: we have to ensure that there is a clear parallel between our treatment of the Mediterranean Basin and that of Central and Eastern Europe. We are in favour of new countries acceding - it would be inconsistent to say 'no' to our Polish friends present here after all the progress the Community has made in recent years - but any initiative taken in regard to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe must immediately be actively mirrored in regard to the countries of the Mediterranean, such as Cyprus and Malta. Not just, however, those countries with which accession negotiations are already taking place but also those countries of the Mediterranean Basin with which bilateral contacts need to be extended. - My third point concerns a delicate issue relating to full membership of NATO for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. Mr Caligaris has tabled important amendments on this. Before we give those countries guarantees of security, we need to establish just how practical this is. Events in Bosnia have shown that there are frequently clear discrepancies between political will and military capability. - Fourthly: 'bilateral conflicts should be resolved by negotiation and not stand in the way of quicker accession for certain states', as stated in the Oostlan der resolution. We share that view but, in view of the current bitter experience with Slovenia, we consider here that the European Parliament ought to look into a role of negotiator and arbitrator - for itself and its Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy - which could make it possible to overcome this problem. Daskalaki (RDE). - (EL) Mr President, our group agrees that the European Union must cultivate and encourage the prospect of enlargement towards the Central and Eastern European countries, especially since this carries a political message that we ought to put across clearly. For that reason, we consider that the approach in princi ple made by Mr Oostlander's report is constructive, since it concerns countries in a very sensitive part of the world. As many of those countries as satisfy the essential prerequisites, depending on the case, must at some time be included in the family of Europe because it is impor tant that there should be no more discrimination in Europe now that the walls are down, and because we believe that development will reduce the dangerous tensions that exist in some areas. Yet, we point out that any further enlargement towards the eastern countries should go hand in hand with a deepening process as an essential prerequisite of that enlargement, and the fact is that the report links the new opening of Europe to the institutional changes due in 1996. It must be confirmed, however, that the basic orientations of Mediterranean policy will not be affected, especially in regard to the accession of Cyprus and Malta. This motivates us to insist that those two countries should be invited to make clear their positions at the Essen Council. Finally, we stress the importance of cross-border cooper ation between those countries and the European Union, because we believe that this will contribute to long-term stability in the area. It must become clear, however, that all those places must show respect for the fundamental democratic principles and the principles of good neigh bourliness, as well as for the requirements of internation al law, including the inviolability of frontiers. Schroedter (V). - (DE) Mr President, the Green Group in the European Parliament is convinced that the Union should be open to all the people and all the democratic countries of Europe. That forms part of the political objective of building up a democratic and peaceful Union made up of all the peoples and countries of Europe. The German presidency proclaimed that it would make the process of integration one of its priorities. Unfortunately this integration is concentrated mainly on a common foreign and security policy, on internal and legal affairs policy and on trans-European networks. Above all things, that means enlarging the internal market. But this enlargement structure must not extend only to the internal market but also involve integration in every area of life rather than just being a means of improving trade with the ",
        "No 4-454/10 Debates of the European Parliament 30. 11.94 Schroedter east, shifting production sites to countries with cheap labour and exploiting the natural resources of these countries. The aim must be to strengthen the regional development in these countries and thereby also the democratic structures. Integration strategy must structure the political dialogue and must not start with off- loadings. We must not pursue a delaying policy that expects more and more concessions from the Central and Eastern European states while the European Union does not want to re-structure itself, is not prepared to make any struc tural changes in, for instance, the agricultural field. The European Union should take on a form such that it can shape our life together on this continent on the basis of solidarity and not play off east-south relations one against the other. Lalumi\u00e8re (ARE). - (FR) Mr President, the Oostlander report is without question timely and we have no objec tions to it. However, consideration of the report provides us with the opportunity to make a few points. Let me deal first of all with the aim - enlargement of the Union. It is quite natural to insist, as the rapporteur does, on the preconditions to be met if enlargement is to be successful. However, I would like to warn against poss ible ulterior motives that seem to exist here and there in some countries and inside some governments. Obviously I am not talking about Mr Oostlander himself. What I am referring to are speeches, stances and attitudes which suggest that, in fact, enlargement is not wanted. Therefore, and this is my second point, I believe that we need to make clear the reasons that argue in favour of enlargement. It is not only that we wish to satisfy aspirations coming from the East, or that we want to be nice to our friends from Poland -whose representatives here are most welcome - or from Hungary and else where. The fact is that it is also in our interest. Since 1989 and the disappearance of the iron curtain, our continent has seen momentous changes such as the collapse of communism and the resurgence of nationalism, intoler ance and war. Of course there has been more democracy, but there has also been a widening of the gap between the rich and the poor, the majority and the minority, together with great instability. So it is also crucial for us to establish strong links between Western Europe and Cen tral and Eastern Europe. Obviously, the question to be asked is what sort of links. The idea of a continent-wide confederation has been raised. This model, suggested by Mr Mitterand, has however been rejected. I myself used to think that the Council of Europe, which had the virtue of already being in existence, might provide the framework for bringing countries under one umbrella since it has mechanisms for cooperation. To some extent the Council of Europe has in fact fulfilled this role by bringing together 32 states at present, with Latvia shortly to join and then no doubt Russia too. But the Council of Europe, for all its merits, does not have the requisite resources - either of a material or especially of a political nature - to satisfy the expectations of Central and Eastern European countries. Nor - and in my view this is very important - is it able to bring stability to the continent. It follows that it is in our own interest to come up with other possible arrangements. Accession to the Union is one. But may I point out that pressure is likely to be all the stronger, and the need to grant full membership rapidly all the more urgent, if we do not find, and do not even look for, other arrangements that might enable applicant countries to await and prepare for entry with equanimity. I am thinking, for example, of security issues and military security in particular. Clearly, the security needs are enormous. Clearly, there is a need for reforms in NATO and the WEU, but we are advancing very slowly, too slowly. I also have in mind political dialogue. It is a good thing that the Heads of State and of Government of the Visegrad countries were finally invited to the Essen Summit. I regret only the hesitations and changes of heart that preceded the invitation. Politi cal dialogue is in itself desirable but it also has the huge advantage of being easy to organize. It is much easier to get political dialogue off the ground than it is to align economies or integrate industrial, agricultural and monet ary policies. I would say that if we had to start some where, we should start with political dialogue. Krarup (EDN). - (DA) When I look at the report and the documents from the Commission and the Council, I am sorry that there is not time to illustrate all the contradic tions which underlie the Union's continuous growth. In connection with the President's opening remarks, how ever, I should like to point out that my Scandinavian friends in Norway have not just voted against the Union for economic, social and political reasons, but that they have done so above all for the sake of Norwegian democracy. It is this democratic dimension which has led the Norwegian people to say no. It is a firm tradition in the North that governments ask the people whether they wish to join the Union. This is a tradition which could be extended to a number of other Union countries, but that would probably create a good many problems, because the Union has one major diffi culty, and that is its peoples. The Norwegian people have once again pointed to the conflict between democracy and technocracy - government by an \u00e9lite. And they have said no for the sake of democracy. With regard to Central and Eastern Europe, we are in favour of democratic, open cooperation but, like the Norwegian people, we do not think that the Union represents a framework which is capable of ensuring this kind of democratic trend. It seems to me that the Oostlander report and the other contributions that have been produced are based on an approach which assumes that Central and Eastern Europe will surrender to the Union. This path is a good one for the \u00e9lite. It is a bad one, a terrible one for the people, and it is a fatal one for democracy. Gollnisch (NI). - (FR) Mr President, the Central and Eastern European countries are our sister nations. They are European by virtue of their history, their culture, their languages, their religions and their suffering. Although the report by Mr Oostlander makes a few interesting points, we have problems in endorsing it for two main reasons. First of all, there is a real taboo surrounding the causes of the difficult situation these countries find themselves in since the suffering I have just mentioned has one cause, namely dictatorship. Yes, but what dictatorship, you might ask? Well, the revolutionary ideology that has broken, ruined and martyrized these countries has but one name - communism - whose horrors have equalled ",
        "30. 11.94 Debates of the European Parliament No 4-454/1 Gollnisch national socialism in barbarity; and yet some of its advocates are still here among us. We are now urging these countries to embrace democra cy. How condescending, how arrogant of us! Why were we not so insistent when they were being trampled under foot by the communist jack-boot? We talk of teaching the women of Central and Eastern Europe that men and women should have equal rights. The men and women in those countries have no time for the ravings of a few middle-class female lefties. All this goes to show that the Europe of Maastricht cannot accommodate the nations of Central and Eastern Europe. To be able to do so will necessitate a flexible, lightweight and inexpensive structure with provisions for common security and arbitration procedures for settling international disputes. Sakellariou (PSE). - (DE) The question of the dates of accession is still being treated in a woolly manner. The current presidency of the Council has not helped dispel any illusions about the dates of accession either, on the contrary! The presidency of the Council is pretending that accession will happen in the immediate future, which will create great frustration among the applicant coun tries. Here the presidency of the Council ought to know better, namely that no steps will be taken until the 1996 intergovernmental conference has been successfully con cluded, after which there will presumably have to be very lengthy negotiations on accession, which will push back the date to the next century. If that is not the case, then I would ask the President- in-Office to correct me. But even that is not a disaster provided we are able to use the existing European agreements to the full. The security situation and security needs of these states are a different matter, and especially of what are called the Visegrad states that currently find themselves in a kind of security vacuum, acting as a buffer between the NATO states and the states of the former Soviet Union, which should certainly never become NATO states. Our answer to these security needs is an insubstantial partnership for peace and a typical Radio Erivan announcement: 'YES in principle, but...' That is also reflected in the attitude of the presidency of the Council itself in relation to the accession of these states to NATO. Mr R\u00fche is more in favour of YES in principle, Mr Kinkel is in favour of a definite but. At first the USA were in favour of no in principle, but now they are in favour of 'Yes, after all'. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, these are no answers to such an important question. We must answer this question before we take decisions on accession. Robles Piquer (PPE). - (ES) Mr President, I am delighted to be able to say something that I am sure Mr von Habsburg would have wished to say tonight, namely that our Group quite naturally supports the excellent report by Mr Oostlander because we are all fully convinced of the need to plan the accession of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. These countries were, until recently, struggling under the totalitarian boot of Leninism, but have managed to liberate themselves and are now eager to join our Community, perhaps more so than some more traditionally democratic European countries, as we have seen following the referendum in Norway a few days ago. I should also like to add a more southern perspective to the Oostlander report, as seen through the eyes of my own country and the excitement we have all felt at the events in Central and Eastern Europe. I remember very well the visit I made to the great Polish nation, including my conversations with miners in Silesia and the Mass I attended in Warsaw, as well as my recent trip to the Polish border from the German Land of Mecklenburg- West Pomerania. Not to mention walks across the Charles bridge in Prague or in the Romanian Carpathians, the thrill of glimpsing the sea described by Ovid and visiting what was once a site of great natural beauty - later destroyed - the Valley of Roses in Bulgaria. These are some of the many reasons why we consider these countries as intrinsically and essentially European. Naturally, accession cannot proceed in a hasty and frivolous manner. We feel sure this will not be the case since integration without proper preparation would not be in the interests of these countries. We share the view expressed in Mr Oostlander's report that the integration of these countries should embrace ideological, political, economic and even defence concerns. By the same token, we consider that their future accession to the security structures of our European Union - which at the moment appear so uncertain and unsettled - is legitimate and necessary. In addition, Mr President, I wish to draw attention to the need - which has of course been acknowledged in the report - to ensure a balance between the requirements of Central and Eastern Europe and those of another Euro pean dimension - the Mediterranean. This has already been taken into account and it is to be hoped that the European Council in Essen will also discuss this other aspect of the European Union. Finally, I should like to ask the rapporteur, Mr Oostlan der, to consider the possibility of improving certain points in his report. We have examined some of the amendments with interest, particularly Nos. 37 and 41, which are intended to ensure that we do not commit the error of forgetting that the incorporation and accession of these countries must involve consideration not only of the budgetary and political aspects - as mentioned in para graph 24 of the report - but also of economic questions. In this connection, we feel that paragraph 7 could be improved through the addition of some of the amend ments I have just mentioned, since we are entitled, and indeed obliged, to examine the situation properly via the relevant reports to ensure that this accession, which we all want to see, does not jeopardize the acquis commu nautaire, an important achievement secured with great difficulty by the countries of the Community, and one which the new members must respect and make their own. Van der Waal (EDN). - (NL) Mr President, when the Berlin wall came down attention once again became focused on the continent of Europe as a whole. As a result, now that Austria, Finland and Sweden are joining, we have the direct prospect of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe becoming members too, as a political inevitability, but also because we have a moral responsi bility towards countries which spent decades bowed beneath the communist yoke. Thus the Union will in principle be open to those states which have a parliament ary system of free elections and which uphold fundamen tal rights and freedoms. ",
        "No 4-454/12 Debates of the European Parliament 30. 11.94 Van der Waal We fully endorse the message carried in Mr Oostlander's report. We also agree that further enlargement means that the Union's body of administrative instruments needs to be revised. But we are not happy with the way in which the report suggests it should be done. I am convinced that further centralization of powers as advocated in paragraph 2, accompanied by an ignoring of the subsidiarity principle, will progressively weaken the Union's image in the eyes of the man in the street. The referenda on the Maastricht Treaty and those held in the Scandinavia countries recently are clear evidence of this trend. Now that the iron curtain is no more we need a different style of Community architecture. The European Com munity must be rebuilt into a community of Europe, of European states. How, in a federal Europe, can a central parliamentary system ever be democratically representa tive of citizens who embody such a wide diversity of cultures, social systems and languages? We shall have to bend our minds to other dossiers too: funding, agriculture, the structural funds. But in any event we look forward eagerly to the White Paper on enlargement which the Commission has promised. van Velzen, W.G. (PPE). - (NL) Mr President, I must echo the tributes which have been paid to Mr Oostlander. I think his report is an exceptionally important one and certainly following Norway's 'no' vote, we need to open up prospects for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. I naturally endorse what my fellow group mem bers have said and since time is getting on I shall confine myself to just three points. It is important not only to consider the criteria for membership but also to look at what happens between now and the moment of actual accession. Take Romania, for example, which first of all failed to meet the criteria set for accession to the Council of Europe. And then on 23 June 1994 we see the Romanian National Assembly adopting an education act which seriously undermines the rights of the country's national minorities. We should also be alert to what is happening in Slovakia. I thus commend Amendment No 9 on this subject to the House and I believe we should not hesitate to curtail aid under the PHARE programme if the rights of minorities are violated. The rapporteur rightly says that we very much need to differentiate. I take it that Amendment No 78 can be interpreted as meaning that we can also differentiate if a country has greater needs in the area of security or a country has greater needs in the area of trade, that it will be possible to differentiate here too. Lastly we need a strategy, these same criteria which depend on the country's initial position. We need to adapt our progress and our pace. That must be the essence of our approach in offering generous new prospects to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. Castagnetti (PPE). - (IT) Mr President, Europe is both rooted in the past and a thing of the future. It began to be called Europe 25 centuries ago and yet it is still at the planning stage. Will the old Europe be capable of responding to the challenges of the modern world? Will its age be a source of solidarity or a cause for weakness? These comments and questions from Jacques Le Goff re-echo in the Chamber at this time of serious and tragic events: namely the Bihac holocaust and the outcome of the Norwegian referendum. The Norwegian referendum confirms that Europe is not yet sufficiently well-known and appreciated. Its citizens seem tired of words and in search of deeds. Bihac, sadly, reveals the impotence of Europe and the inconsistency of the European initiative; in those peoples still outside the Union it fuels the feeling of being left to their fate. Mr President, I consider the urgent need to assuage this sense of abandonment a reason for supporting Mr Oost- lander's excellent report and the relevant motion for a resolution. I realize that the accession of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe will involve for the Union issues of balance, the distribution of resources, the organization of markets and the effectiveness of the activities of the European Institutions - problems which will have to be resolved in advance at the 1996 Intergov ernmental Conference. That does not, however, mean that we cannot even now strengthen relations with the applicant countries on the basis of a structured dialogue, new commercial agreements, the creation of trans-Euro pean networks and new financial support measures. In that way, we shall prevent the feeling growing in those countries that the time it takes us to make decisions fails to take account of their problems and needs. Finally, we welcome the fact that the resolution reaffirms the need to pursue at the same time an effective strategy for the Mediterranean, and to do so not just in the interests of a geographical balance but in order finally to structure and complete a strategy involving the relationships and responsibilities of Europe vis-\u00e0-vis all of those regions to which it is linked by geographical location and political and cultural tradition. Spencer (PPE). - Mr President, as chairman of our delegation to the Czechs, Slovaks and Slovenes, I wel come this report and congratulate the rapporteur on what is an excellent piece of work. I welcome in particular the invitation for the Czechs and Slovaks to attend the Essen Summit but I would remind colleagues throughout Cen tral Europe that one of the key conditions for membership of the Union is a functioning and effective democratic system in those countries which apply. Secondly, as someone who believes that the admission of the Central European states to the European Union is of crucial importance for the long-term stability of our continent and something that I welcome, I must say that I hope, as we continue a debate that is bound to stretch over the next five years, we will no longer feed our Central European friends with rhetoric. In Prague, Bratislava or Lubliana people will tell you that they have heard enough good speeches since 1989. What they need now are concrete proposals with specific timetables. The Com mission has done a good job so far but there is always a danger in this Union that we will settle for rhetoric rather than work on concrete timetables and difficult details. Finally, I should like to make two points. It is clear to me that we should be pushing for the inclusion of Central Europe under the NATO umbrella at the first possible opportunity and what we will be doing with the Western European Union. These are important matters on which we are expecting some progress, certainly in Prague. ",
        "30. 11.94 Debates of the European Parliament No 4-454/13 Spencer Secondly, we will have to come to terms with the reform of the common agricultural policy. Without that we will not be able to live up to our commitments. Ferrer (PPE). - (ES) Mr President, the Commission's communications on the strategy to prepare the countries of Central and Eastern Europe for accession, covered in the report by Mr Oostlander, whom I would like to congratulate on his work, are very timely and appro priate, since they establish a framework for a structured relationship between these countries and the Community institutions, and contribute to their gradual integration into the Union. In view of this - and quite apart from the budgetary, economic and political problems which the accession of these countries will raise and which must be solved - those of us who believe that the opening up of the Union to Central and Eastern Europe is only fair for historical reasons welcome the formulation of this strategy and the impetus it will give to the integration of these countries. This impetus, however, is not enough in itself. The European Union must also assume its own responsibili ties and proceed with an in-depth reform of the Treaty on European Union in 1996. This will ensure that the Union can act as a haven, protecting the economic and social well-being to which the citizens of these countries are also entitled and guaranteeing the peace and security that will enable them to look to the future with hope. Brittan, Member of the Commission. - Mr President, in order to put the various themes that have been raised in this debate into perspective, it is necessary to remind ourselves exactly what the Commission has sought to do in its programme and what we can reasonably ask the Heads of Government to do in Essen. We have not sought to put forward a complete blueprint for everything that has to be done in order to achieve membership of the European Union by the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. We have sought to put forward practical steps that need to be taken at this stage to advance the moment when they can join us in a sensible way. I very much appreciate what Mr Titley and Mr Spencer said about the realism of the Commission's report and the need to avoid rhetoric at this stage. Consequently, the particular focus on a structured politi cal dialogue and the creation of a White Paper which is specifically designed to enable the countries of Central and Eastern Europe to accept the acquis communautaire which has been rightly said by Mr Titley to be necessary, is at the forefront of our efforts. That is a practical step and it will be accompanied by assistance to the countries concerned. It is not just a question of incorporating legal texts but of making major changes in the way they run their affairs. In making these very practical proposals to the Heads of Government we have not failed to appreciate the fact that after that has been done there are many other things that require to be done before the process of membership can be completed. Mr Carnero Gonz\u00e1lez and others referred to need to go on with the deepening process. It is exactly for that reason that it has already been decided that no negotiations for membership can be commenced until after the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference, which I hope and believe will be devoted primarily to answering the difficult but simple question: What changes do we need to make in our own institutions in order to accom modate a substantial number of additional countries as members of the European Union without paralysing ourselves, without slowing down, without becoming incapable of acting in the way that has made us a pole of attraction for those very countries. Reference has also been made to the need to deal with agriculture. We are very conscious that we have not put forward specific proposals. Simply to apply the common agricultural policy to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe would present formidable problems of cost etc. We have to ask ourselves to what extent we want to do that and to what extent we need to change our own policies as part of the process of adaptation in the years ahead. Similarly when it comes to the structural funds, we are all aware of the difficulties. We have identified those diffi culties. We have not proposed solutions. It is the path of realism to decide on the next steps but also to indicate the next-but-one steps even though we cannot yet say pre cisely what they should be. It has also been said by many that we need a balance between the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean. I entirely agree with that but it is important to talk about balance rather than precise parallelism. Some of those countries such as Malta and Cyprus have legitimate aspirations to become full members of the European Union. Others, it is perfectly well understood, do not. That does not mean that we have to neglect them or that we should neglect them. There is no mirror image, one of the other. Instead we have a balanced approach recognizing the importance of doing both. Other Members of the House such as Mr Casini have referred to the security aspects of the problems that we face. Of course, let us be under no illusions, one of the attractions of membership of the European Union for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe is that it helps their security even if there is not a security guarantee involved. The more direct approach of membership of NATO is also something which they aspire to and I do not think we should dismiss the partnership for peace as being simply a substitute. It is not, it is a first step. Everybody has now recognized that the question of NATO membership is a question of when not of whether. NATO has in a sense followed the path which we have outlined in the European Union, a path of preparation, a series of steps leading to an ultimate conclusion. This leads me to refer to what Mrs Lalumi\u00e8re asked in her speech. She asked: Why do we want them? It is not just because we want to be nice to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. There are three reasons why we want them as members of the European Union and why the Heads of Government in Copenhagen said so firmly. First, there is the moral reason. It is no use us shedding tears for 40 years at the hardships that they suffered under communism if, when the shackles of communism are removed, we are not prepared to receive them in full as members of the family of Western European nations. Secondly, there are economic reasons. In anything but the short term it will be a strengthening and not a weakening of Europe to have the countries of Central and Eastern Europe as part of our European Union. A number of them have already made remarkable strides in economic recov ery and structural change since 1989. ",
        "No 4-454/14 Debates of the European Parliament 30. 11.94 Brittan Thirdly, there is the strategic aspect. Bihac is a fact, as Mr Castagnetti said. We have indeed seen terrible things happening on our continent and we have seen terrible consequences and instability in Eastern and Central Europe too many times in our history to ignore the fact that it is only by incorporating those countries fully in the family of nations of the European Union that we can be sure of security for them and security for us. Those are the imperatives, those are the objectives and that is the vision. As statesmen and politicians, parliamentarians and offi cials, all of us in our different ways have to combine the vision with the practicalities. I believe the steps that the Commission has suggested represent a realistic next step - recognizing that there is much more do - of a practical kind towards the achievement of that goal of bringing the countries of Central and Eastern Europe in from the cold in the fullest sense of the word. It is a task that is worthy of all our efforts. It will certainly receive complete dedication and commitment on the part of the Commis sion. President. - The debate is closed. The vote will take place this evening at 7.30 p.m. 8. Trans-European networks President. - The next item is the report (A4-0076/94) by Mr Sis\u00f3 Cruelias, on behalf of the Committee on Trans port and Tourism, regarding the proposal for a Council Regulation (COM(94)0062 - C3-0155/94 - 94/ 0065(SYN)) laying down rules for the granting of Com munity financial aid in the field of trans-European net works. Sis\u00f3 Cruelias (PPE), rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, we are all agreed that it is essential to create trans-European energy, telecommunications and transport networks. The infrastructure deficit has emerged as a result of mobility requirements caused by economic and social transforma tions and the integration process of recent years. If we do not provide a series of trans-European networks capable of making up the current deficit and coping with the increase in demand envisaged in the next 15 years, significant distortions will emerge in the Single Market and our undertakings will become less competitive than those from non-EU countries. What is even more serious is that the main objective of the White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness, Employment will not be achieved: that of creating 15 million jobs. Now, the key question is: are the current financial resources and those of the coming years sufficient to cover the investments needed to build such infrastruc ture? The regulation we are debating defines the condi tions, procedures and arrangements for applying Com munity aid to trans-European network projects of com mon interest pursuant to Article 129c of the Treaty. Community aid granted under the budgetary line 'trans- European networks' will take the following forms: first of all, co-financing of viability studies, preparatory stu dies, assessment and technical support; second, a contri bution to the loan guarantee premiums; third, interest-rate subsidies; and fourth, possible co-financing of invest ment projects. The financial allocation envisaged for Community aid in this area during the period 1994 to 1999 is ECU 2 405 million, of which ECU 1 868 million are earmarked for the transport sector. Now, the Commission assessed the financing required for this infrastructure - which was one of the priorities laid down in the White Paper on Growth - at ECU 400 000 million for the same period. Therefore we are faced with an amount which represents only 0,6% or six-thousandths of the total allocation, which reveals a clear disparity between the requirements of a genuine Community infrastructure policy and the funding actual ly made available by the Union. In this connection, I should point to the limited role played by the Community hitherto, since in the period 1982-1993, the allocation for creating transport infra structure - including the infrastructure action programme and the ECSC and ERDF industrial loans - amounted to approximately ECU 16 226 million. When we compare these figures with the estimated investment requirements for infrastructure in the period 1990-2010, which have been set in terms of billions of ecus, we can see that more funding will be needed, both public and private. The sources of public investment in addition to the financial aid envisaged in this regulation include the budgets of the Member State, at national, regional and local authority level; the ERDF; the Cohesion Fund for four Member States - Ireland, Portugal, Greece and Spain; and also R&D allocations. The public investments from these sources will be supplemented by loans from other Community instruments such as the European Investment Bank, the EIB temporary loan facility, the European Investment Fund and the financial mechanisms of the European Economic Area. Despite the existence of these sources of funding, the Commission and the main financial intermediaries, such as commercial and investment banks operating in the field of project funding, consider that there will be a severe shortage of financing since private capital is reluctant to finance large infrastructure projects, particu larly transport projects as these are, from a strictly economic point of view, less viable. Therefore, the following steps should be taken to cope with the shortage of financing: first - this is the main objective - all measures likely to encourage private capital to invest in this type of project should be imple mented; second, new Community financial instruments should be launched such as the issuing of Union bonds - according to the Commission, this scheme could bring in up to ECU 8 billion per year; and third, the authorities and all economic and social operators should bear in mind that we must all work together to obtain the necessary financing and maintain the current pace of investment in the construction of infrastructure. Otherwise, the objec tives I mentioned earlier will not be fulfilled. To conclude, Mr President, I would ask all the members of this House to vote in favour of this regulation; it is important that it come into force on 1 January next so that there is no legal vacuum in the funding of transport infrastructure, as Regulation 1738/93 currently in force will expire at the end of this year. (Applause) ",
        "30. 11.94 Debates of the European Parliament No 4-454/15 Varela Suanzes-Carpegna Varela Suanzes-Carpegna (PPE), draftsman of the opin ion of the Committee on Regional Policy. - (ES) Mr President, Ladies and Gentlemen, the trans-European networks are the main arteries of the economy and there is no doubt that they are extremely important at regional level, and important in relation to European regional planning and bringing the regions of the Community closer together. According to the Treaty, the objective of the trans-European networks is none other than to contri bute to the Single Market and social and economic cohesion, taking account in particular of 'the need to link island, landlocked and peripheral regions with the central regions of the Community'. This was and still is the main concern of the Committee on Regional Policy: on the one hand, the contribution the networks can make to cohesion, and on the other, as far as this proposal for a regulation is concerned, the need for this aid to complement the other Community aid from the Structural Funds. We are pleased to say that the Sis\u00f3 report has fulfilled many of our requirements, and we are particularly satis fied with the inclusion of the new recital 2a and the new wording of Article 6, although we regret the fact that interoperability, rather than cohesion, appears to be the priority. We also regret the fact that shipping and rail transport are not included among the priorities in Article 7, since these modes of transport can have important implications for island and peripheral regions. We hope to be able to return to these issues when the guidelines on trans-European networks are discussed in this House. In fact, we consider that it would have been better, from both the legal and political points of view, to have discussed these in the first place, prior to this regulation on financing. Nonetheless, we congratulate Mr Sis\u00f3 on his report and on the enormous efforts he put into this, as well as the major contribution that the report makes to the issue at hand. We look forward, as I have said, to the debate on the guidelines so that we can shape strategy and ensure that these networks do not once again benefit the so- called heart of Europe only but also and above all, its peripheral regions, thus preventing the gap separating some regions from others from being further widened. I will end, Mr President, by pointing out that we are not here just to build roads or high-speed trains, however important that may seem. We are doing a much more significant job: we are in the process of creating a continent - Europe - and we must do so in a balanced and coherent way, as required by the Maastricht Treaty, which we ourselves adopted. (Applause) Piecyk (PSE). - (DE) Mr President, I want to begin by thanking Mr Sis\u00f3 Cruellas for his work. I think we will be able to adopt this regulation in Parliament this evening with a broad consensus. The regulation on Community aid for trans-European networks is not initially concerned with the large projects needed for trans-European net works such as transport, energy and telecommunications, which would also have major effects on the labour market but is concerned today with feasibility studies, interest- rate subsidies, loan guarantees. To put it in proportion: the proposed financial aid for 1994-1999 is barely ECU 2,4 billion. But we need ECU 400 billion, i.e. today's regulation concerns just 0,6% of the real financial requirement. The large, important infrastructure and network projects have so far been discussed outside Parliament, namely by the Christophersen Group, and that is the real scandal here. We have Maastricht, which envisages trans-European networks, as it does the co-decision procedure. But by setting up this group the European Council has done something outside, without and if necessary against Parliament and which is a snub to it. I can only hope that the Council will show its repentance in a practical way in Essen, that it will adopt a correct legislative procedure and forward the proposals via the Commission to Parlia ment, i.e. to its responsible committee, and that it will also show its repentance by deciding a sound financial framework for the trans-European networks. Sarlis (PPE). - (EL) Mr President, I would first like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Sis\u00f3 Cruellas, on his excellent work and on the trouble he has taken to finish working out this very difficult regulation. I stress that the regulation ought to be adopted as soon as possible, within 1994, because the previous regulation governing the way finance is provided for projects of interest to the Community, namely Regulation No 1738/ 93 (EEC), lapses at the end of this year. Consequently, the new regulation must be adopted as soon as possible. I must also say that Article 129(3) of the Maastricht Treaty explicitly stipulates that projects of Community interest must be financed from all the Community's resources, which means that they are to be financed both from the structural funds and the Cohesion Fund, and also directly from the Community budget. The debate on this regulation must not be confused with the other great debate concerning the guidelines for trans-European networks. The debate on the eleven or thirteen major trans-European networks, about which so much has been written, so much effort has been made and such eloquence has been displayed, and which has taken up both Parliament's and the Council's time, is a debate that is still in progress and will continue in Parliament during January 1995. On behalf of the European People's Party, I recommend that the Sis\u00f3 Cruellas report should be adopted as soon as possible. Kestelijn-Sierens (ELDR). - (NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, no one questions the usefulness of the trans-European transport networks. The great problem is how to fund the projects. Recourse will have to be made in large measure to the private sector. Mr Sis\u00f3 Cruellas points out in the explanatory statement to his report that only 0,6% of the budget is earmarked for trans-European networks. But I do not agree with his contention that there is a huge gap between a true Community infrastructure policy and the resources avail able to fund it. After all, a Community infrastructure policy does not mean that the Community has to fund the lion's share of the projects. The Community's job is to ensure that the Community interest is protected when the networks are set up, that national projects are coordinated and implemented in a coherent manner. In line with the subsidiarity principle I think the Com munity has to play a complementary and promotional role in funding. It is important that the Commission ",
        "No 4-454/16 Debates of the European Parliament 30. 11.94 Kestelijn-Sierens should cooperate with the banking sector in order to devise new financial solutions and as far as possible raise private capital. We support the Christophersen group's idea that financial markets should be developed to pro mote investment in infrastructure projects by private and institutional investors. Unlike the USA and Japan the Union does not have such markets. This will perhaps have to be allied to the principle of charging for the use of infrastructure. Lastly, a large majority of my Group believes that the objectives of the trans-European networks must not be confused with those of the Structural Funds. Danesin (FE). - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has identified the development of the trans-European networks as providing a much-needed method of tackling and overcoming both the present economic situation and the socio-economic disparities that already exist between the different Member States and the different regions. The setting-up and further development of the trans-European networks will contri bute towards the achievement of important Community objectives, such as the completion of the internal market and stimulation of economic growth, and will have a positive impact on jobs and the work cycle. The trans-European networks will also make it possible to eliminate bottlenecks and supply the missing links in the infrastructure chain; to remedy problems resulting from the lack of interoperability between means of transport and systems; and, finally, guarantee that Europe's citizens enjoy sustainable mobility. Mr Sis\u00f3 Cruellas' report establishes the general guide lines for a Community financial contribution in the trans-European network sector. This does not replace but is additional to the contribution of the Member States and is, given total Community assistance, extremely modest and very marginal in contrast to the objectives pursued. Finally, while I appreciate and support the work of Mr Sis\u00f3 Cruellas, I wonder whether the legal basis proposed by the Commission is justified. Given that the European Parliament has a power of co-decision in relation to the setting up of the trans-European networks, it ought also to have that power when it comes to the general guidelines on their funding. Donnay (RDE). - (FR) Mr President, you do not need me to remind you that the programme of major infrastructure projects envisaged in the White Paper on growth, compe titiveness and employment is in the doldrums owing to the lack of adequate funding. The stakes are accordingly very high indeed and if we are to fund the trans-European networks it is essential to carefully define the legal basis and the criteria for Community assistance. Allow me, to make three points on the report submitted to us today. Firstly, the project in question must be part of compre hensive and consistent policy embracing the use of the other Community financial instruments, namely the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Fund, the EIB and the European Investment Fund. Secondly, we need to make all the necessary budgetary arrangements for Community support right now. Thirdly and lastly, the master plans for the networks must be made available to the Union as soon as possible. Langer (V). - (IT) Mr President, in the view of the Greens, there was no hurry to table just now this proposal for a decision by the House, as we risk, so to speak, injecting cash before a decision has been taken on the master-plan and before we have a proper European transport policy. We are firmly opposed to the way in which this proposal encourages further the so-called high-speed approach, and that is also why we have tabled amendments; the way we vote will therefore depend on the fate of those amendments. It appears to us that no comparative assess ment is being made of the volume of capital being invested and the jobs that will be produced in the long term. In the area of transport policy, we are now faced with what is, in our view, the illusion of European growth to be relaunched using mega-projects. These include, for example, the tunnel planned under the Brenner - seeking to attach to this maximum priority without any notion of how it is to be funded and without, at present, any environmental impact assessment whatsoever. We are therefore asking once more at this juncture that the environmental impact of these projects in particular be looked into before we think about relaunching - specifi cally with an injection of funds - this transport policy. We are, in particular, opposed to having a policy of motorways, airports and high-speed links instead of a sustainable policy of mobility, especially in areas of major congestion. That is why, unless our amendments are adopted, we shall be unable to vote in favour and will have to vote against. IN THE CHAIR: Mr SCHL\u00dcTER Vice-President Jarzembowski (PPE). - (DE) Mr President, of course the primary responsibility for financing the networks lies with the Member States. But to the extent that the Union can take over the co-financing of preliminary studies or transport projects, there is virtually a division of respon sibilities. One group of states can call for additional financing from the cohesion fund or the regional fund, while another group can only call on the sparse resources in the Community's special transport budget. Given this disparate starting position and in view of the need to develop environmentally friendly transport net works, for example railway networks, we had placed great hopes in the working group made up of personal representatives of the heads of state and government headed by the Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Christophersen. This group was instructed months ago to find additional means of financing, including private finance. But when I now look at the more than 200 pages of the working group's report, I am reminded of the quotation: 'Mountains will heave in childbirth, and a silly little mouse will be born.' For the working group is actually raising the same questions we have known for a year without giving practical answers. Mr President, if this is the basis for the Council's decisions in Essen then they will be just as meagre as the results of the Christophersen Group. Furthermore - and here I would ask Commissioner Bangemann to listen to us - we should refuse the request of the working group of ",
        "30. 11.94 Debates of the European Parliament No 4-454/17 Jarzembowski personal representatives that it be allowed to continue its activities. We should insist that the Commission, Parlia ment and the Council take their work in their own hands within their respective fields of responsibility. Salafranca S\u00e1nchez-Neyra (PPE). - (ES) Mr President, I think it might be said, playing a little on words, that when the Europe of infrastructure, the Europe of construction, is progressing well, then the construction of Europe is progressing well. Mr Sis\u00f3's report is an effective step towards achieving this objective since, by providing a legal basis for the financing of the trans-European net works from the budgetary point of view, it is contributing to laying the foundations that will ensure that the oldest continent does not turn into an old continent. However, one of the essential aspects of this question, probably the most essential, is the extra-budgetary factor. Therefore I would like to ask the Commission whether it hopes, as a result of the work of the Christophersen group, to obtain the extra-budgetary resources and means from the Essen summit which were denied it at the Brussels summit. I am putting this question because it is clear that one of the key elements of the construction of Europe is the development of infrastructure, since in addition to being a legal and political concept, the integration of markets is, fundamentally and above all - as I am sure the Commis sioner would agree - a physical notion. Mcintosh (PPE). - Mr President, I should like to draw the House's attention to the plea for a greater public and private partnership and I hope that through Mr Sis\u00f3's report we can achieve that. We have a particular problem in the United Kingdom because when loans from the European Investment Bank in the United Kingdom have to be made through an intermediary, we have very little choice of intermediaries available. I hope that is someth ing the House and the European Investment Bank will take on board. Also, I hope we can use this report and Mr Piecyk's report to make sure that we have greater emphasis on road transport being converted to greater carriage of goods by rail and to increase access to airports and sea ports by road and rail. I would also add a plea that we should not confuse within the transport sector applications from the Cohesion and structural funds. I hope that no confusion will arise in the adoption of this report. I should like to conclude on a positive note. I welcome spot checks to put the public's mind at rest that the money will be spent on real projects. Bangemann, Member of the Commission. - (DE) Mr President, may I begin by thanking Parliament for the great attention it has already devoted to this proposal. I am especially grateful to the rapporteur for endorsing the basic idea we put before Parliament and the Council, as has also become clear from this discussion. There were a number of critical remarks, on which I particularly want to comment, for everyone is familiar with the history of this idea. Basically, the idea that we need a genuinely European infrastructure stemmed from the consideration that the internal market cannot function simply as a result of our removing legal barriers to its functioning. On the contrary, it was only logical also to remove the real barriers to its functioning. One thing was quite clear: in the three areas of transport, energy and telecommunications, there is no genuine infrastructure to match the needs of the internal market, or indeed that could do so in future. That is why the Commission proposed this infrastructure idea and we are very glad that in spite of all the difficulties that are as always in the way, this idea is making progress. As Mr Sarlis and the rapporteur have mentioned, let me emphasize again that today we are dealing with a partial aspect. I can understand the criticisms from some quart ers about the fact that we cannot also discuss the Christophersen Group report in this debate. I admit that is not satisfactory but as you all know it is important for the Commission to have a legal basis for the money that it wants to and is to spend next year on the basis of budgetary decisions. That is why this slightly early debate is taking place. However, the Christophersen report is no secret; I think that was a criticism by Mr Piecyk. As far as I know, Mr Christophersen appeared before various committees on various occasions and explained what the group of experts he headed has proposed. Of course what is decided in Essen will be the subject of a parliamentary debate and if the Commission draws any official conclu sions, such as a communication from the Christophersen Group, you will be informed in due form and have an opportunity to adopt a position. The main problem is that we have quite different financ ing possibilities in the three areas. Mrs Kestelijn-Sierens, the rapporteur, and others too have point out that basical ly there is a grotesque disproportion between the total financial requirement and the amount we are dealing with here, which is indeed only 0,6% of the total requirement. That is not due only to the fact that we are dealing here with studies, subsidies and suchlike, but not with cover ing the total requirement. This disproportion does in fact exist. And it can only be remedied if we draw partly on the resources of Member States and regional administra tive bodies while at the same time drawing largely on the private capital market. That is where the difference between the various infrastructure projects lies. In the field of telecommunications this can be done without difficulty. I am convinced - and we will be discussing this in a moment in connection with Mr Herman's report - that there are more chances in this field than in the field of major transport infrastructure projects. There too there are specific projects and specific sections and that can also be part-financed privately, on the basis of a private-public partnership, because they bring in the appropriate revenue, but there will also be sections where we can already say that this is not the case. That is precisely where the difficulty lies that will face everyone - the Member States, us, the Essen summit - and we will then have to decide the scale of resources we can allocate here. I am grateful to Mrs Kestelijn-Sierens for her remark - and Mrs Mcintosh said something similar at the end - that we should please distinguish between what we intend with the cohesion and structural funds and what we intend with this financing. These are indeed two different matters. Mr Jarzembowski pointed out that this will be a burden and disadvantage for those countries that cannot use any structural or cohesion fund resources. That is right enough, but we must keep to these distinc- ",
        "No 4-454/18 Debates of the European Parliament 30. 11.94 Bangemann tions. Otherwise we cannot be clear about the allocation of finances and responsibilities. Mr Langer again raised the question of whether such projects should not be discussed in a broader framework, i.e. not just in terms of financing possibilities but also in terms of transport and environmental considerations. That is quite correct. What we have had before us until now stemmed from transport policy considerations, which naturally always include environmental considera tions too. (Interruption by Mr Langer) Mr Langer, do let me finish ! You are always disappointed in advance. You should wait until I have finished my sentence and then perhaps you would react differently! Of course each individual project will be analysed in accordance with our own regulations, which we have laid down jointly, to establish whether it is environmentally compatible. That is a matter of course! But that is not the question today. As regards jobs, Mr Langer, I would be a little careful. If you look at the extent to which transport has now become a factor of employment, creating more and more new jobs, I would not speak so critically about airports. I need only cite the example of Frankfurt airport, which has now become the main employer in the Land of Hessen, more so than H\u00f6chst and more so than Opel. That is why when we speak of creating jobs we should not regard that as impossible in the sector of transport. Those are the questions that were raised here. I would also like to go into the question by Mr Varela Suanzes Carpegna on sea transport. That is an important point and I hope we will be able to adjust this matter when it comes to the practical implementation. The maritime forum has pointed to the importance of this old and new mode of transport and that is why we should make this adjustment. As for the amendments, we can accept more than half of them, namely Nos 1,3,4,6,7,9, 11-15,21,23,24,26,28 and 29. In any case we are already working on an amended proposal which incorporates this. We have problems with Amendments Nos 2, 8, 16-20, 25 and 27, but here too we can accept parts of them, and the only amendments we cannot accept, to the disappointment of the Green Group in the European Parliament, who are not listening to me now, are Nos 15, 22 and 30. President. - The debate is closed. The vote will take place at 7.30 p.m. today. 9. The information society President. - The next item is the interim report (A4- 0073/94) by Mr Herman, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on 'Europe and the global information society - Recom mendations to the European Council' and on the commu nication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament and to the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions: 'Europe's way to the information society: an action plan' (COM(94) 0347 - C4-0093/94). Herman (PPE), rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, the combination of spectacular advances made almost simul taneously in digital data processing capabilities and in the transmission capabilities of these same data opens up for mankind a vista of development and progress which will have a social impact comparable to that engendered by the discovery of electricity, the steam engine or the telephone. Those inventions gave Europe the technologi cal lead and provided the basis for economic and social progress that has been the envy of the world. The same will apply to the countries who are the first to master and put in place a modern information society. The Bangemann report rightly calls the attention of political leaders to the urgent need to steer Europe in this direction. Japan and the United States have understood better and earlier than us the implications of, and stakes involved in, these innovations. They have moved on from speeches and discussions and begun to act. Europe's possibilities, however, are considerable since it has managed to maintain and strengthen its significant tech nological lead in the field of switch systems, an indisp ensable element in the architecture of such networks. Importantly, ATM switches, which have been perfected by European companies, are currently - thanks to fund ing from European research projects - the most efficient in the world and indispensable to any opening up of information highways. Yet the message of the Bangemann report is not com plete. It is not enough to liberalize the telecommunica tions infrastructure to persuade private companies to automatically invest massively in these new sectors. Granted, a stable regulatory framework is needed, but above all - and it is in this respect that you are perhaps a little timid, Mr Bangemann - we need a supranational authority that can enforce these regulations, bring them into line with fast-evolving changes and arbitrate when there are clashes of interest among Member States. We know this, we experience it every day. Finally, in certain cases, we need to stimulate demand for new services where these satisfy real social needs, and we perhaps need to use tax incentives to promote investment, as happens in Japan. In their budget the Japanese intend to earmark 121 trillion yen for tax incentives and subsidies to promote the setting up of information highways. We on the other hand have not allocated anything, so there is a world of difference between the two approaches. The report I have the honour of presenting to you has secured a wide consensus on essential points. Many colleagues have made amendments to it, motivated no doubt by totally legitimate and valid considerations, but while they may have enriched the text they have also made it somewhat heavier. Because of this, the clarity of the message we wanted to send to the Essen Summit may have suffered a little. I would ask the Commission and the Council to regard the report as a reflection of the interest which the Commission's proposals have aroused in all our ranks and in all circles of society, rather than as a faithful expression of our wishes or legislative powers. So, Mr President, I think voting will be straightforward enough since we have been able to coordinate the votes of the main groups on essential points. There are still a few minor points to settle, but as we are still at the stage of recommendations and communications, we shall have the opportunity later to test the Commission's will and see how it reacts to our amendments and suggestions when we are asked to approve the directives or regula tions it decides to submit to us. ",
        "30. 11.94 Debates of the European Parliament No 4-454/19 Katiforis Katiforis (PSE). - (EL) Mr President, the report we are debating is a very thoughtfully composed document, as would naturally be expected from a rapporteur with Mr Herman's authority. Of course, I cannot agree with him that its message has lost something owing to the contri bution of other colleagues. On the contrary, I think it has been enriched. The White Paper and the Bangemann report have placed high hopes on the information revolution and the corres ponding great gains for Europe's competitiveness fore seen by their authors. The resultant changes in all areas of our lives are likely to be earth-shaking. For example, specialists tell us that it will soon be possible for our electorates in some way to take part directly in our debates, and later, it may even become unnecessary to elect us at all, because all citizens will be able to communicate and confer simultaneously in an electronic revival of the ancient Athenian Democracy. Though perhaps you could allow a Greek to tell you that direct democracy too had very many disadvantages and was by no means a panacea, as you can read in Thucidides. The economy, and personal life, will undergo similar revolutions and in the face of such world-historic changes it would be a mistake to view the new developments either in a narrow, technocratic spirit, or with excessive zeal on behalf of some of the interests created. On the contrary, we should turn our attention towards the gener al good, and in particular the following: - First, technological developments should be put on a pan-European basis, both cultural and regulatory. Only if established on a pan-European scale will technology be able to achieve its maximum impact in serving the interests of the Member States correctly. - Secondly, developments must remain non-monopol istic, and that of course does not just refer to public monopolies but includes private monopolies as well, either existing or future, which can only be an impediment to the progress of technology. - Thirdly, developments must be given a democratic character and we must avoid the danger, which of course the White Paper mentions but which I did not see repeated in Mr Bangemann's report, that Europe might become divided into the information-rich and the information-poor. It would be a tragic failure if the trend towards a two speed Europe developed a technological dimension in a Europe of two informa tion statuses. - Fourthly, the new developments must be given a markedly social character, and we must not allow the individualization that is appearing in sectors such as eduction, health and employment - areas upon which the social fabric of mankind has been based for centuries - to affect the social character we have achieved up till now in those sectors, inadequate though that may still be. We must not attempt to render developments subservient to our ideological or political prejudices. That is particu larly important for relations between the public and private sectors. Let those who worship the private sector not forget that there would be no civil aviation today, nor nuclear electricity, without massive state support. If necessary, and for as long as necessary, we will mobilize the public sector analogously in this case too. As for ideologies, the new technologies and the new society to which they will give rise will also bring new ideologies. Let us shed the self-preoccupation of our ageing world and allow the new humanity the luxury of moulding its own way of thinking. Ladies and gentlemen, the report we are debating either accepts the above points of view explicitly or remains open to them, and for that reason we support it and call for a positive vote. Larive (ELDR). - (NL) Mr President, the Herman report gives a clear signal to the Essen summit. We hope that Amendments Nos 23 to 32, which remove the note of socialist interventionism and suspicion, will be adopted. I am glad that rapporteur Herman has agreed to take out the word 'uniform' from paragraph 18. For us, 'uniform rules' goes a bit too far, harmonization and mutual recognition is better. A third point: we set great store by the creation of the European regulatory authority and we should like to see that included on the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference. Only if we get rid of national monopolies can Europe be competitive and attract the capital needed for this market to develop and grow, for the benefit of the consumer. Two questions to Commissioner Bangemann. The con tradiction between liberalization and funding primarily by the private sector. But as many as seven out of the ten telecommunications pilot projects are being paid for by public money. Is the Commissioner not being a mite too optimistic - we know him well -about funding by the private sector? Second question. The contradictions within our own information policy, our own institutions. Officials and journalists have automatic right of access to our own databases such as RAPIDE and OVIDE. The ordinary taxpayer who has helped to fund these services has to pay again if he wishes to use them. What is the Commission going to do about electronic transparency and accessibil ity of data to the man in the street? It should be free of charge. In this regard we are a long way behind other countries, for example the USA, Canada and Sweden. When are we going to follow their good example? Pailler (GUE). - (FR) Mr President, we find it hard to endorse the privatization of telecommunications, just as we have difficulty accepting all the deregulation pre sented to us as inevitable and the only way forward if Europe is to enter the information society. The claim that the creation of a competitive regulatory environment is the main axis and cornerstone of this future society has been hammered home to us so often that it sounds like an ideological condemnation of the public services, the public sector and its functions. Yet no assessment has ever been made of the performance of public enterprises - either in terms of their universal service achievements or, for example, in terms of their capacity to evolve in the direction of greater democratization. What is the basis of the assumption that public enter prises can only be economically inefficient, in terms of both production costs and charging? It would also be useful to have an assessment of privatized enterprises such as British Telecom in Europe. What we already do know however is that the price that has and will be paid is the loss of tens of thousands of jobs. What do we know ",
        "No 4-454/20 Debates of the European Parliament 30. 11. 94 Pailler about the price of services to British households or about equal access to basic services? Not surprisingly, the Commission appears only to be concerned about public monopolies. That is why it has turned down an anti-concentration directive against media groups in the private sector, going against the opinion of Parliament itself. Will the Commission be equally deaf to the Council decision of 17 November postponing telecommunications privatization - unlike Mr Bangemann, who with Mr Delors' approval, wanted to see it as early as 1995. Are we simply going to ignore the fact that people set great store by their public services? Unless I am mistaken, I heard that there was a massive general strike in Belgium yesterday, echoing those held in Italy and France in recent months. It is not that we reject technological progress but we must ask ourselves urgently whether it will not also cause the destruction of social ties, jobs and fundamental rights if we embrace it without proper concern for its social and cultural integration. Privatization which takes place in a headlong rush, allowing no time for reflection and ignor ing the safeguards essential to pluralism and the right of people to experience and develop their culture through audiovisual and cinematographic creations, could turn into a cultural holocaust in the eyes of History. Wim Wander wrote in the 1970s: 'The Americans look with envy at European culture and deplore their own lack of culture, trying to put it down to their absence of history. This is because they have not got the courage or readiness to face up to the fact that their culture and history have always been guided by the laws of the market.' Is it surprising that all that's left is the market? It must indeed be painful to admit that the market reflects one's national identity. We would certainly not want European culture to be equated with the marketplace. Wijsenbeek (ELDR). - (NL) Mr President, a comment under Rule 102 of our Rules of Procedure. How is it, I wonder, that while the previous speaker, who has just finished and who was speaking French, had the floor the microphone never faltered for an instant, but whilst the speaker before her, Mrs Larive, was talking the micro phone was switched off and on again three times. Is it because French as opposed to Dutch was being spoken or is this another piece of sabotage on the part of the French secret service? President. - I am sure that there is no question of technical or electronic sabotage. This can only be an unfortunate coincidence. Wolf (V). - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Herman has delivered a panegyric on the information revolution with what I can only call Jacobean pathos. However, the report goes a little further. The report also contains a large number of critical comments, which were already included in Mr Herman's preparatory work and did not just arise out of the corrections. It may just be an interim report, but nevertheless I would like to make it clear that there are genuine points of principle to be discussed, first of which is the question of the internation al authority. It is right, and here I definitely agree with Mr Herman, that we need international regulations and control and moderating bodies for those regulations. But we should consider very carefully whether this also means the centralization of power in an international authority. Secondly, the tax incentives certainly do not exhaust the field of the necessary public taxation. Provision must also be made for tax burdens, provision must be made for assistance programmes. Quite a lot remains to be done here. I heard with pleasure, Mr Bangemann, that you have very much further developed, modified and adjusted your original positions, so that the Commission docu ments no longer show signs of the kind of spill-over of the gold-digger mentality that has emerged in some areas of the information society. I am pleased about that. Let me point out once again that this is an interim report and that we need a very thorough discussion if this is so very revolutionary, and I think it is as revolutionary as Mr Herman has suggested. We tend more towards conserva tism here: we think 'don't try what you don't know' is a very sensible solution. In my view that is the kind of conservatism we should definitely adhere too. That is why I would like to announce that when we come to the final report we will insist on a very thorough and comprehensive discussion of the alternatives. As it stands this report is probably a useful signal for Essen, I would agree with that. Given our special posi tion, we Greens should not, however, endorse it. That is why we will abstain, in order to make it plain that there is still a considerable need for basic discussion here. Randzio-Plath (PSE). - (DE) I agree with the rapporteur that the entry into the information society will radically change social structures and relationships. This is a new industrial revolution with all the qualitative and qualita tive changes that involves. The information market dif fers from the other markets which is why we must make particularly sure that we take political flanking measures. I remember the discussion about the great projects for supply-dominated technical developments and adjust ments, for instance in the case of nuclear energy, where we began with private development and investment and the social implications were not evaluated until later. We should not let that happen again. That is why I consider it particularly important that the Herman report specifically points out that the state has an important role to play in shaping the information society. Mr Bangemann, I would be glad if you too would follow the American road, by allowing the public interest to have a part in determining how we enter the information society, for participation is more suitable here than marginalization, than the unilateral involvement of the industry that is concerned and therefore affected. Access for all, basic provision for all tax payers must be ensured. All citizens must have access to the basic provision of information because information and com munication shape the necessary dynamic, social, econ omic and cultural development and we must put these interests on a par with economic interests. In this context I am concerned that we may be facing a new split in society unless we create the appropriate regulatory framework. We must not allow gaps to appear between unskilled and highly qualified people, between the rich and the poor, between the town and the country, urban centres and peripheral regions. We must also make sure that we use our structural and cohesion fund resources and our available programmes to create acces sible, economic and equal conditions with regard to the principles of basic information supply. ",
        "30. 11.94 Debates of the European Parliament No 4-454/21 Randzio-Plath With a view to developing an efficient telecommunica tions structure I consider it extremely necessary to take another aspect into consideration and evaluate it, namely working relations, which will be changed by the new data highways. We need a kind of road traffic act for relations between the workers and the employers. Here too the state plays an important role in ensuring that freedom to form a coalition is not undermined in this area, for that too is a major component of our democracy. Hendrick (PSE). - Mr President, I should like to congra tulate Mr Herman on a very good report which captures the imagination of many of us here in Parliament. We totally agree with many of the things Mr Herman talks about in his report. We see the benefits of many of the new technologies in terms of the growth and prosperity of the Community and the economy of Europe. However, I should like to focus on a few particular issues, for example the impact on employment which is men tioned by Mr Herman with regard to the explosion of an information society. It is an issue which many of us on the Temporary Employment Committee are looking at. One thing which has become clear is that using new techno logy as part of an information infrastructure will contri bute to growth. Nevertheless, the question arises as to whether that growth will contribute to employment. Obviously our objective is to improve the employment situation across Europe. Figures from France have shown that in the last 20 years the GDP has increased by something like 80% while unemployment has increased by a factor of 5. We must ensure that these new initiatives actually contribute to employment. Therefore we must pay particular attention to the new jobs that they are likely to open up in terms of training, education and the associated vocational dimension. The other important aspect is that liberalization is seen in some ways as the knight on the white charger that will come along and rescue the European economy. Liberali zation can help but it is not the be-all and end-all. What we need is some degree of regulation and we need a European regulatory authority which will take responsi bility for setting standards so that systems can communi cate with each other. We must not allow a situation to develop where the commercial organizations, purely in order to gain market share, set what become de facto standards themselves so that only certain countries and certain companies benefit from the technology and we develop a system of technology haves and have-nots. What we need is a system which is of benefit to all our citizens and all our consumers and of course to business and industry. Let us keep our eye on the other issues such as employ ment, such as whether or not and how much liberalization we need so that everyone benefits from the information society and not just a few. Beres (PSE). - (FR) Mr President, advances in informa tion technologies and telecommunications are paving the way for a new revolution which I believe will be economic rather than just industrial. It will cause an upheaval in the daily life of each and every one of us and the advent of the information society is a global challenge that cannot be ignored. The European Union must there fore be prepared. But the Bangemann report's optimism about the benefits this society should confer on us is somewhat puzzling. The report strongly resembles a travel brochure describ ing a journey to the best of all possible worlds, offering a more humane, equitable and balanced society; self- fulfilment for the individual; more jobs; better social and economic structures. Judging from this report, the Com mission wishes to make the private sector and market forces solely responsible for ushering in the information society. The Commission calls for liberalization and deregulation. The best of all possible worlds risks being transformed into the world of Big Brother. In our view the information market is unlike any other. It threatens the very foundations of our democracy, society and culture. In other sectors we have already seen the consequences of full-blown liberalization. In airtransport we have witnessed thousands of job losses - and the process has not yet ended - the disappearance of less profitable routes and falling safety standards. The same is also true of capital liberalization. So are we going to make the same mistakes all over again? Liberalization means job losses and it's a policy we have had enough of. The excessively economic rationale of the Bangemann report triumphs over any genuine long-term political perspective. Experience teaches us that if you want to lay down rules, you should do so before liberal ization because afterwards there is no going back and the rules are more difficult to draw up and enforce. The information society should not become a pretext for destroying the very foundations of our society, for loo sening social ties, for creating more exclusion and for merely preparing new markets for economic liberalism. Kuhne (PSE). - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentle men, I would like to go into a few aspects which, I hope, will be incorporated in the report via several amend ments. The question of non-discriminatory access to the networks must not just be discussed in the context of individual communication or for small and medium- sized undertakings. What is also decisive in this connec tion is something that has not yet been brought up, namely the question of broadcasting. I think we must prevent commercial interests from undermining the clas sical concept of broadcasting, and we should take the Commission at its own word. For it established that broadcasting is a priority medium of identity and conse quently there is a need for specific legislative procedures and specific licensing procedures. We must also prevent those who sell the decoders from having the final say via the sales and marketing of networks and decoders on which other broadcasting organizers have access and which do not have access. That is a question that faces this Parliament on its own doorstep and I think it is useful and necessary for this question to be taken up as a signal even in the interim report. On the question of the European authority, which has already been raised, I think we must make it clear that it must observe the principle of subsidiarity in its activities. No-one in this Parliament would like to see a European authority deciding on the use of radio frequencies in its specific region. No-one wants it to be decided by some Brussels authority which transmitters must use which radio frequencies in Scotland, which radio and television frequencies are used in the Ruhr area, which radio and television frequencies are used by which transmitter in Spain. That is a decision that must be taken by the local area or region where at all possible. ",
        "No 4-454/22 Debates of the European Parliament 30. 11.94 Kuhne These are aspects which belong in this interim report in my view. Because interim reports always tend to apply for a longer time than the term would suggest, it is especially necessary to entrench this aspect of broadcast ing and mass communication in the interim report. Lage (PSE). - (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the global information society is no longer just a dream or science fiction. Europe cannot lose the chance of this technological change with all its economic consequences as well as huge implications of a social and cultural order. The magical virtuality worlds will shortly be within the grasp of ordinary people. The number of users of world wide computerised communications networks is growing at a monthly rate of 10%. Information highways and interactive multimedia are likely to bring about huge changes of unforeseeable proportions in the ways we communicate and gain access to knowledge. It could be said that human societies are seeing the emergence of a new means of communication, thought and work for which a new concept is being invented: 'cyberspace'. We must, however, avoid the temptation of technological utopias. 21st century Mankind would then be a prisoner of the media. Without wanting to go back on this new media adventure, we must defend the eternal goal of freedom. The European institutions deserve our full praise for their ability to predict and anticipate events by elaborating, on the basis of a White Paper on growth, competitiveness and employment, a strategy for the information society. The Herman report has my full support. It points out the undoubted merits of the documents being assessed but also shows where there are gaps, leaving plenty of room for questions. I must express some doubts, worries and uncertainties of my own. Firstly, for the peripheral regions and Member States of Europe, like Portugal, will the project for an information society help to reduce the disadvantages of remoteness or isolation, or will it be even more favoura ble to the central areas of the European Union? Secondly, will the speeded liberalization of telecommunications infrastructures and markets not deal a mortal blow to telecommunications companies in the less powerful Community countries? Do they not need to be given some hope? Finally, I think it will be necessary, given these unfair competitive disadvantages, to make availa ble Community funds to encourage investment in the less favoured areas of the Community in the information sector. The European Union must integrate into its strategy for an information society support to the less favoured regions. After all, these regions do not want to go 'Back to the Future'. Izquierdo Collado (PSE). - (ES) Mr President, it is only right that I should start by congratulating Mr Herman. His comments and observations are very relevant. I also think that his views on the information society are very profound and sufficient to enable this House to issue a clear message to European citizens that we are facing a key challenge for the future, a new historical era which will enlighten a new society, and a revolution whose effects will be incalculable. It is to take nothing away from Mr Herman if we also recognise at the same time the merits of the Bangemann team, the contribution by Mr Herv\u00e9 and - why not - the sensitivity of the Council and Commission whose docu ments made this report possible and on which quite a few comments in the report are based. So much for my acknowledgements and congratulations, let me now turn to criticism and self-criticism. This is not an interim report, but a final report. We do not need to burden ourselves further with global considerations or preliminary preparations because the main issue is crystal clear: while we are still deliberating, the Internet - an American initiative - is penetrating Europe. European universities are becoming linked up in order to gain access to it, while the European Union institutions are concluding strategic contracts with it. Without asking anyone's permission, and through the power of its tech nology, the United States is in the process of converting Europe into a subsidiary, through this initiative. This very good report by Mr Herman should not be regarded as provisional but rather as final. It has fulfilled its objective. The next step is the compiling - and coordination - of autonomous reports on specific ques tions by the various committees. We must progress simultaneously and rapidly from the various corners of this ocean which is the information society. Mr Bangemann, when will we in the European Parlia ment receive the proposals aimed at launching the prac tical legislative process which are required by all those concerned? Bangemann, Member of the Commission. - (DE) Mr President, I would like to express my gratitude for this discussion too. I think there is certainly a need for some further discussion. At any rate I have realised that what we set out in this report and in our action programme was obviously not clear enough to dispel a number of misgiv ings. But we are still in the early days of this process and I would like to attempt today to go into a few of your criticisms. But before I do so, I want to thank the rapporteur, my friend Fernand Herman, very warmly. In his report he quite rightly reiterated what we regard as the main feature of what we call the information society, namely its revolutionary innovatory quality. That is really no exag geration. This is an innovation that also and in particular will have radical implications for our social system and for the situation of people in the European Union. Let me assure all those who have reminded us of this that we have not disregarded it but that it was the point of departure of this report. When you read this report you will find that in the first chapter we described the scale of the revolutionary effects this new development will have. Then we gave priority to all these social problems, e.g. partnership for jobs, a jointly formed or a fragmented Europe, the social challenge, etc. It is simply not true what some speakers have alleged in the debate that we simply ignored that and took the ideological approach that we need more free markets, we must liberalize, and then all will be well. That is just what we did not do in the working group and - let me say this emphatically to the last speaker - that is just what the Commission did not do in the proposals it presented. I will refer to a number of these proposals in a moment. The very term information society is meant to indicate that unlike the Americans and the Japanese we ",
        "30. 11.94 Debates of the European Parliament No 4-454/23 Bangemann are not aiming at purely technological ends. For America and Japan speak of highways ofinformation, which gives rise to the factual error that it is simply a question of creating the infrastructure, which is quite wrong from a technical point of view too. Instead we ourselves rejected this technological, one-sided approach and said we must have a broadly based political debate on the politological and sociological consequences of this revolution, and do so with all concerned, and naturally with Parliament, with all those who bear responsibility. We must not disregard this opportunity and we must also use it correctly. It is on that basis that we started on the action plan. That is before you too, for we did not just present the report to you but also our actin programme in which we listed all the legislative measures, some of which are already under way, some of which are still needed. In this programme we distinguished in practice between three stages. Stage 1 is the important stage of liberalization. That is not an attack on public ownership of undertakings in this field. It is simply a clear indication - as is made crystal clear in the report - that competition between the various under takings must help to make innovation possible. Public undertakings can of course take part in this competition. For we are not just holding theoretical discussions but also giving practical examples. If you take Sweden as an example, you will see that the postal service, which remains in state ownership, has successfully asserted its position in competition vis-\u00e0-vis other private undertakings. Nor is that at all surprising, for these public undertakings, that used to have a mono poly, have a very large number of assets, infrastructure and people who can handle them. Their position within this competition is not at all bad. Both in this report and in the measures we have proposed we have merely declared the abolition of public-law monopolies to be essential. That is something quite different! If we want to continue discussing that, we will be limping far behind what the Council has already decided. About a year ago the Council decided by a majority to liberalize telephone services. In the middle of this month it decided unanimously - i.e., by the vote of all the Member States - that the infrastructure should also be liberalized in accordance with this same timetable and that there will be free, regulated access to this infrastruc ture. I would like to say to all those who have raised this question again, such as Mrs Payet, that if we reopen this discussion, we will not be doing justice to Mr Herman's report or to the decisions we have meanwhile, thank God, taken in the Union. Stage II relates to regulations, and it is simply not correct to say that we merely concerned ourselves with liberali zation and did not recognize the need for new, Europe- wide regulations. You need only read the report, it is all there. For instance, if you look at Chapter III of the report you will find a list of all the things that need to be regulated: protection of intellectual property, protection of the private sphere, electronic protection, legal protec tion and security ofinformation, ownership of the media, the role of competition policy. We have also submitted proposals on some of these areas. And we have consi dered, although somewhat cautiously, the question of whether we do not need a European authority for this - note, not an international authority but a European institution - and that is surely proof that we do see a need to regulate this area. I have nothing against this being done according to the principle of subsidiarity. I could live with the idea - and we have proposed this alternative to the Council and Parliament - that either we formulate such regulations at European level if they are necessary or that we mutually recognize the various national decisions. That could be acceptable too. But we need some kind of decision making body, otherwise there will be chaos. What alrea dy applies to the national regulations today applies equally to European regulations. If we want to ensure free access to the infrastructure, we need someone to lay down the conditions and monitor compliance with them. I have nothing against this being done at national level, but the regulations must be compatible and must not lead to faults on the market itself. This would of course be easiest to avoid through a European body. So if I am told I have been too cautious here, my answer would be yes. But we have not formulated this in such a cautious manner because we are afraid of the European Parliament but because we are afraid of the reaction from the Member States, and as the reactions in the Council show, this fear was not entirely unfounded. But please, I have absolutely nothing against Parliament saying that we need European regulations here. That is how I see it too. The universal services do not come into this discussion; that is the second part of our Green Paper. But we have already assured Parliament and the Council that we are envisaging rules for universal services. Three arguments are always put forward. Argument No 1 : we do not want to replace a public monopoly by a private monopoly. Agreed, we do not want that either. That is why we have the rules of competition. Argument No 2: the peripheral regions, as the Portuguese Member emphasized again, are being disadvantaged. But if people do not understand that this new information society puts the peripheral regions in particular in a position to compete better with the central areas, then I really do not know what more I can say about the advantages of this idea! This is certainly a major advantage for peripheral regions, which will surely become clear in the further discussions. Argument No 3: jobs. Here too we need only look at developments in Sweden or Finland or those following the recent Union decision on mobile phones. The liberalization of mobile phones has created a sub stantial number of jobs throughout the Union. Reference is often made to America. Well, 40% of the newly created jobs in America can be traced back to the development of information structures, which means that we too will create new jobs. It may be that an inefficient public monopoly company would lose jobs that were in a sense not productive in the past, but who would argue with that? Can anyone explain to me why it is more socially acceptable to maintain an overblown, public, bureaucrat ic apparatus at the cost of many individual small and medium-sized undertakings which have to suffer from it and then lose out in the competition with other jobs? I have nothing against public undertakings, but I am entirely against the assertion that this kind of apparatus, which is inefficient and expensive, is the true social achievement for which the Union should yearn! I regard that as absolutely wrong! It has rightly been said that everyone must have access. There is an amendment by Alan Donnelly which I would ",
        "No 4-454/24 Debates of the European Parliament 30. 11. 94 Bangemann like to support strongly. That amendment calls on us to create the necessary facilities in the towns, communities and regions, wherever the citizens could have access to such information facilities, so that everyone really can obtain such information for free. There is nothing to be said against that. Of course, when we speak of copyrights we must also accept the restrictions for public purposes if we want to keep it all balanced. On the question of culture: we must safeguard the European identities and support them through our politi cal decisions. But I am against mixing everything up together in this field, i.e., curtailing or restricting certain economic possibilities in order to protect identities in that way, for it will not succeed. But we can use these possibilities in order genuinely to ensure the vitality of the cultural identities of the Union. That is cultural policy! The coexistence of economic and technological advances on the one hand and support for culture on the other is something I consider entirely feasible. But if we want to assure the vitality of culture by means of quotas, restrictions or non-admission to a market, we would be taking the wrong road and killing off both the economic possibilities and culture too. It is to that end that we have submitted this proposal and I hope that it will become clearer during the further discussions than has been the case so far that the Commission really has not chosen a technocratic-bureaucratic approach but has tried to meet this challenge. President. - The debate is closed. The vote will take place at 7.30 p.m. today. 10. Welcome President. - Ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure for me to welcome the speaker of the National Assembly of the Republic of South Africa, Dr Frene Ginwala, and a delegation of ten Members of the South African Parlia ment who have just taken their seats in the official gallery. (Loud applause) The South African delegation is in Brussels for the first interparliamentary meeting with our new delegation for relations with South Africa, chaired by Mr Gerard Col lins. I hope that the forthcoming debate on the EU/South Africa Cooperation Agreement will show that the Euro pean Parliament wholeheartedly supports the new South Africa as it progresses towards a democratic and bal anced rebuilding of the country and its social structure. 11. Cooperation Agreement EU/South Africa President. - The next item is the report (A4-0084/94) by Mrs Kinnock, on behalf of the Committee on Develop ment and Cooperation, on the proposal for a Council Decision on the conclusion of the Cooperation Agree ment between the European Community and the Repub lic of South Africa (COM(94) 0402 - C4-0171/94 - 94/0216(CNS)). Kinnock (PSE), rapporteur. - Mr President, when it receives this Parliament's consent, the interim agreement with South Africa will be a landmark and an act of political significance both for us and for South Africa. Here we will establish the legal framework for the administration of future cooperation with South Africa. The interim agreement was formally signed by Sir Leon Brittan and Deputy Executive President Thambo Mbeki in October this year. I am delighted that both sides ofthat agreement are here this evening. The agreement esta blished clear guidelines for strengthening relations between the EU and South Africa and will in my view offer a unique opportunity to promote harmonious and sustainable development. After decades of isolation, of boycott and of institutionalized racism, South Africa is now ready to enter a new and mutually beneficial relationship with the European Union. In his introduction to the reconstruction and development programme, Nelson Mandela said: 'Democracy will have little content, and indeed will be short-lived, if we cannot address our socio-economic problems without an expanding and growing economy'. That is the challenge I hope we will share. The South African Government has identified its needs and its priorities and we have an obligation to help it to lay firm foundations. Nelson Mandela's government wants to meet basic needs and to create the opportunity to create the conditions for econ omic reconstruction and growth. Trade and investments are central to these objectives and it has to be said that the interim agreement on its own will not sufficiently accelerate European investment or encourage trade. I therefore urge this Parliament to view this interim agreement as a declaration of intent, a declaration of our determination to build future partner ships. The European Parliament can be justly proud of the determination it has showed in the special programme in the past to work with the Kagiso Trust, the Southern African Bishops' Council, the Catholic Conference, the South African Council of Churches, with trade unions and with women's groups. European development aid helped to create the circum stances for change and helped to build a strong, vibrant civil society and to build a resilient democratic culture. These were essential ingredients as the people of South Africa struggled against the oppression of apartheid laws. It is now time for us to make a positive response to the first non-racial democratic elections in South Africa. A chapter has surely closed in the history of Africa and an opportunity now exists to open the way to a new future, a new chance for South Africa, for southern Africa and for Africa. Indeed, events in South Africa have served as an inspiration to all of us in Europe who abhor the racial bigotry which threatens our own continent. Our cooper ation with South Africa has, and will, strengthen our will to fight racism and xenophobia in Europe. It is essential at this time that any new framework for European Union- South Africa relations is set firmly in the context of the Lom\u00e9 Convention and the existing structures of Euro pean Union-ACP cooperation. We recognize that all members of SADC are members of the ACP and the cooperation which this represents will surely be enhanced by the inclusion of South Africa. Future agreements should offer access to South African goods without undermining other members of Lom\u00e9 including other SADC member states. Our relationships will naturally, and would always, be seen in a regional context and will build upon the commitment of SADC countries, including South Africa, to equity, to peace, to ",
        "30. 11.94 Debates of the European Parliament No 4-454/25 Kinnock stability and mutual trust. It is clear that at a minimum some form of Lom\u00e9 cooperation is needed and that is implicitly recognized in Article 6 of the agreement. Harmonization issues should be addressed in the context of the mid-term review to be concluded by the end of February 1995 and a Lome-South Africa relationship can open up new trade opportunities and establish the politi cal role of South Africa on the African continent. Finally, I must refer to our claim that there have been serious shortcomings in the management of the Commis sion's affairs in South Africa. This interim agreement is an opportunity to ensure that financial and technical cooperation programmes are protected and are effective. We would like to see the programme in the EU delegation office strengthened so that we can respond to the needs of South Africa in a responsible and effective way. As budget rapporteur, I am keen to see a full evaluation of projects with particular attention to the extent to which programmes are reflecting and respecting the guidelines established by the European Parliament in its budgetary procedure. The Committee on Development and Cooperation bud get, for which I have been responsible, has committed ECU 125 million for reconstruction in South Africa. This represents a substantial increase and we have, incidental ly, prioritized our interest in sport for young people in poor and urban areas. Since the election, South Africa has experienced a gradual increase in trade and investment. The EU is South Africa's largest market and accounts for over 40% of its exports. The interim agreement endorses the political transition but we will need to see an improvement in GSP for industrial and agricultural exports. Bearing in mind the enlarged Community and improved markets, Mediterranean countries should not feel threa tened by improved market access for South African agricultural products. The interim agreement does not represent a long-term framework but, nevertheless, it has a significant political importance for South Africa and for our role in emerging world affairs. The agreement is a small step. Europe has much to gain from southern Africa and we welcome the prospect of a new relationship of solidarity and cooperation. The strength of South African people has been and remains an inspiration but our strong, emotional attachment to their struggle now needs to be backed up by strong deeds. (Applause) Matutes (PPE), draftsman of the opinion of the Commit tee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy. - (ES) Mr President, relations between the European Union and South Africa were practically non-existent for years because of the apartheid regime in force in that country. The European Parliament did what it could to procure the end ofthat regime. I would recall that the 1988 Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought was awarded to Nelson Mandela who, at that time, was still in prison and was unable to come to this House to accept the award for several years afterwards. Therefore we were all delighted with the outcome of the negotiations which ended the system of apartheid in South Africa and enabled elections based on universal suffrage to be held in April of this year. Moreover, Members of this House played an active part by attending those elections as observers. Now a government of national unity presides over South Africa, consisting of members of the three main parties in the South African Assembly. For the first time an official South African delegation is visiting this Plenary, as you already mentioned, Mr President. Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs, which I represent, warmly welcomes this agreement with South Africa. It is not, of course, an exhaustive agreement, but it is important as it lays the foundations for closer future relations. A final point: the agreement contains an article which the Committee on Foreign Affairs regards as particularly important, not only in relation to South Africa but also to all other countries in the world. This is the first time that an article states that relations between two parties must be based on respect for human rights and democratic principles. We hope that we can develop these success fully. How will this new framework develop? That remains to be seen. However, this House and the committee which I chair have decided firmly to contribute to its success. (Applause) Pons Grau (PSE). - (ES) Mr President, on behalf of the Socialist Group I am speaking in support of the report by Mrs Kinnock on the interim agreement with South Africa. As previous speakers have remarked, this is an historic and particularly gratifying day for us. How many times have we in this House discussed and debated South Africa in the past! And always in terms of a problem. We have always had to distinguish between the majority population of South Africa and the South African Gov ernment of the day, asserting our support for the people and our condemnation of a regime which, fortunately, no longer exists. Therefore it is a matter of genuine pride and pleasure to receive in this House a delegation from the South African Assembly. Just a short while ago, this would have been unthinkable. Hence our congratulations and our support. I must add that the path that lies ahead will not be an easy one. There are problems now and there will be problems in future. It is for the South African people and their democratic government to decide on their future. This interim agreement is simply a small demonstration of support so that we can work together to ensure an easier future based on solidarity and mutual understand ing, as well as hope and the respect that the new South African situation deserves from us. I think therefore that it is right that we all congratulate ourselves and unani mously support this draft interim agreement. Maij-Weggen (PPE). - (NL) Mr President, the cooper ation agreement between the European Union and South Africa introduces a new and positive chapter into rela tions between the Union and South Africa. Positive because it is the starting point for further arrangements which should and no doubt will follow. It is very necessary to help nurture the tender young democracy in South Africa, as was evident from the reconstruction and development plan put forward recent ly by President Mandela. This includes on the one hand a programme for development of rural areas and townships focusing on better housing, better education and better health care for the black population. On the other hand it ",
        "No 4-454/26 Debates of the European Parliament 30. 11. 94 Maij-Weggen envisages more work for millions of people, and that needs trade and investment. As regards measures to combat poverty and improve housing, health care and education the European Parlia ment, with our Group's support, has already decided how the Union's aid programmes should be applied. I must stress once again how important it is that these pro grammes should be channelled through organizations such as the Southern African Bishops' Conference, the South African Council of Churches, the trade unions and other NGOs. These organizations are very close to the people and enjoy a large measure of trust from the black population. That provides good guarantees that the aid will be used to maximum effect. No less important is the development of trade, both regionally in Southern Africa and with Europe. In this context I fully understand South Africa's dilemma in deciding whether it is an ACP country or whether it should conclude bilateral agreements with the Union. I understand that just recently minister Trevor Manuel said in a statement that South Africa was opting to join Lom\u00e9, though it would perhaps be asking for special terms. I said on a previous occasion in Libreville that we ought to appreciate that South Africa is a special case. On the one hand it has a highly-advanced economy, but on the other hand it is a developing country. We need to bear in mind that quite a few African countries will be in that same position in the future. So it is important for us to be flexible. I should like to ask the Commissioner how he plans to handle these specific wishes of South Africa and this specific situation. We feel very optimistic about developments in South Africa. We have great respect for President Mandela and former President De Klerk who saw the chance of bringing about peaceful development in South Africa. We have great respect for the population - black, white and coloured - who are realizing this transition. We can be very proud of South Africa. It is an example to the world, an example of how a difficult transition can be accomplished peacefully. Cox (ELDR). - Mr President, on behalf of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reformist Group, I want to take this opportunity to warmly welcome the South African delegation here today. I am pleased it is present for this debate on the first European Union-South Africa Cooper ation Agreement. It is an important symbol of friendship and the occasion is an important symbol of democratic South Africa taking its rightful place again among the family of nations. I welcome today's report and today's agreement as timely. However, it is only a start. The new South Africa of course needs our financial assistance but it is a proud country and in its pride it wants to earn its living. The great test of our resolve to be of assistance will be when it comes to the conclusion of deeper and new trade agree ments and when we talk about investing and encouraging investment there. That is the key to stability in the new South Africa and that in its turn will be the key to regional stability in southern Africa and that is the agenda we must build on from today. Pettinari (GUE). - (IT) Mr President, I wish to underline the political, as well as the economic importance of the agreement we are discussing and that has been described by Mrs Kinnock. This is the first economic agreement between the European Union and South Africa, and we have reached this agreement because we are at last dealing with a different South Africa: the first democratic South Africa with a president legitimized by democratic elections which, not surprisingly, resulted in the presi dency of the leader of the majority so long hatefully discriminated against through apartheid. It is for me and the other Members of the Confederal Group of the European United Left a source of great satisfaction to be able today to discuss this agreement in the presence of the president of the South African parliament. My Group and the parties belonging to it have long striven for a democratic solution in South Africa. I do not feel able to say the same of the European Union: it did not perhaps do all it could have done during the dark years of apartheid; more could have been done to speed up the process of reaching a solution. What is certain is that there is a great deal that the European Union can do now and in the near future. I therefore hope that the report we are discussing will be the first in a useful and lasting relationship between the European Union and democratic South Africa. My Group will therefore be voting firmly in favour of the report put forward by Mrs Kinnock. Baldi (FE). - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking Mrs Kinnock for her painstaking work in her report on the agreement between the European Union and the Republic of South Africa. That agreement has to be seen to be of great significance because of its political and economic implications. It is appropriate to acknowledge the crucial role played by South Africa for the maintenance of peace in agreement with the other states. We have also to recognize the effort made by that country to remedy discriminatory condi tions. That commitment needs now to be firmly sup ported through clear and targeted measures in key sec tors: infrastructure, transport, energy, communications, water supplies, improved conditions of hygiene and health, guarantees of food supplies, their storage and distribution and urgent measures to set in place suitable conditions of employment given the worryingly large numbers of people who had left the country and are now returning. In relation to trade, it is vital that we adopt an independent monitoring clause as a way of guaranteeing equity and transparency in relations between the European Union and South Africa, privileged partners in trade in products of vital importance such as, for instance, agricultural products. In the light of what I have said, we consider it right that South Africa should be considered a partner on an equal footing with the ACP countries and, to support that view, my Group will be voting in favour. Collins, Gerard (RDE). - Mr President, I particularly welcome the opportunity to debate Mrs Kinnock's report during today's sitting in view of the fact that it coincides with the first-ever official visit by a delegation of the South African assembly to our Parliament. I would like to join with you, Mr President, in welcoming the speaker of the National Assembly and her colleagues to today's session of Parliament. This morning I had the privilege of chairing an exchange of views between representatives of this Parliament and ",
        "30. 11.94 Debates of the European Parliament No 4-454/27 Collins, Gerard our South African colleagues. During the course of our discussion it was clear that there is a strong desire on both sides to move forward quickly and to build a strong relationship between the European Union and the new South Africa. I hope that this House will give its approval today to Mrs Kinnock's very fine and comprehensive report. This House should be appreciative to her for her efforts in this regard. The interim agreement between the European Union and South Africa will establish a legal framework for the development of the European Union's future relationship with this part of the world. We thank Sir Leon Brittan and his Commission collea gues for their efforts in giving us this interim agreement which is in itself only the first step in the process of building a longer term and more worthwhile relationship between Europe and the people of South Africa. There are many further issues which will need to be addressed in the context of detailed discussions such as commercial trade relations, development aid, tourism, scientific and technological cooperation and I hope we can move forward quickly to the negotiating stage. I call on the Commission to give these issues a high degree of priority with a view to presenting Parliament with detailed proposals for the development of a comprehensive and long-term agreement between the Union and South Afri ca as soon as possible. Aelvoet (V). - (NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, may I remind the House that we have a delegation from South Africa here with us at the moment. I think it will be interesting for them to follow what is going on here and for them to see that we take a very keen interest in what is going on in South Africa at present. I welcome the fact that the European Union is concluding an interim agreement with South Africa in which the majority of the population has at last been given political rights. But social and economic rights must follow quickly, otherwise the fledgling democracy will explode. The interim agreement is important precisely because of this. It authorizes a lot more activity, but commits the Union to relatively little. Hence the need for Parliament to watch very carefully to ensure that the agreement is properly completed and implemented. I think it is most important for the immediate future that a clear framework should be devised for the resources allocated to development cooperation in South Africa so that they can be clearly divided between government and non-government initiatives. The fact that there are at present two European Union structures operating in South Africa, the delegation recently set up and the programme coordinating group which has been opera tional for some time, is currently the cause of problems and frustration. I wish to make a clear appeal here to the Commission to take measures as soon as possible to allow the delegation to be strengthened and the exper ience of the programme coordinating group integrated into the delegation's work. Unless this is done it is pointless making fine statements about the European Union being a partner you can count on, because it needs above all and in the first instance to be a partner on the spot and a well organized partner. In this way the Union will show how far it can be counted on. IN THE CHAIR: Mrs FONTAINE Vice-President Wijsenbeek (ELDR). - (FR) Madam President, I should like to raise a point of order with reference to Rule 102 of the Rules of Procedure. You are no doubt in a better position to answer my question than Vice-President Schl\u00fcter. This is the third time today that the microphone has been out of order when a Dutch-speaking Member has taken the floor. May I suggest that you contact the services concerned to find out whether this is deliberate or not. President. - It goes without saying that no technical malfunctions are deliberate. We shall do our best, as quickly as possible, to ensure that everything is in perfect working order in the Chamber. This is not yet the case but we shall be attending to the matter. Diez de Rivera Icaza (PSE). - (ES) Madam President, would you also ask for the acoustics to be regulated. This is a very expensive building and it is quite intolerable that we should have to put up with such poor quality sound. Vanhecke (NI). - (NL) Madam President, in a minute and a half I must of course confine myself to essentials and above all to what has been said here so far. First of all let me say that I was always vehemently opposed to the political, economic and cultural boycott against the Republic of South Africa. And anyhow I could never understand why we boycotted South Africa but at the same time rolled over on our backs for the most horrendous dictatorships, for example the regimes of terror in communist Eastern Europe or the countless African states in which political opponents were treated more like crocodile fodder than negotiating partners. You might say that all this is over with now, that it is all history. But there are still a number of reasons why I think this report of Mrs Kinnock's should be rejected. We are after all talking about five billion in aid to South Africa for 1995. Fine, but I cannot accept that not a word has been said about the right to life, continued existence, mainten ance of their language and culture of those who made South Africa into the most prosperous country in Africa by their blood, sweat and tears. I refer to the whole of the white population and primarily the Afrikaner nation. They after all are entitled, perhaps even the most entitled, to our support and understanding. Brittan, Sir Leon, Member of the Commission. - Madam President, may I say that I share everyone else's delight that a delegation from the South African Parliament should be here as we debate these matters. May I also say a warm thank you to Mrs Kinnock for her report. She is absolutely right to say that what we have so far done is a declaration of intent and a first step only. Practical steps now have to be taken. With regard to the point she and others made about strengthening the delegation, it is our intention to do that and I hope that we can learn some lessons from the handling of PHARE. It is possible that we may be able to have an arrangement with decentralized technical assist- ",
        "No 4-454/28 Debates of the European Parliament 30. 11. 94 Brittan, Sir Leon ance units who would assist the South African Govern ment in programming the funds that we are providing. On 19 April 1994, a week before South Africa's success ful first democratic elections, the Council adopted on the basis of a Commission proposal a framework for the European Union's future relations with South Africa. It was decided that those relations should fall into two distinct phases: firstly, a package of immediate measures and secondly an offer to negotiate a comprehensive and long-term relationship with South Africa. The aim of the package of initial measures was to address the immediate needs of the new South African Government and included for example granting GSP benefits to South Africa which was accomplished in August of this year. But the initial measures also included an offer to con clude an agreement with South Africa which is the substance of your discussions here today. The Council's conclusions were precise on the shape and contents of this agreement. It should have a simplified structure with only a few articles including a strong human rights clause, a comprehensive cooperation clause and provi sions wherever necessary to enable the parties to engage in specific cooperation activities. In accordance with this, the contents of the agreement were discussed by the Commission's officials during the month of August. In October the Council gave its approval and I had the honour to sign the agreement on behalf of the Community on 10 October in South Africa with Vice-President Thambo Mbeki. If this House agrees with the agreement today we will need one final Council decision in December to conclude the procedure. As indicated in its text and as has been stated at several times during the debate, this first agreement does not in any way prejudice the content of the longer-term relationship nor its legal base. The present simplified agreement should be seen as a means of bridging the gap between the establishment of a democratic government in South Africa, which we so much welcome, and the definition of a more comprehen sive and long-term framework. It is therefore a matter of good timing that Vice-President Mbeki has just informed us of South Africa's desire to establish, as he puts it, the closest possible relationship with the Lom\u00e9 Convention while, at the same time, discussing elements that are more appropriately treated outside the Lom\u00e9 Convention framework in a separate bilateral EU-SA framework. It is on that basis that we intend to request negotiating directives soon in order to negotiate a long-term relation ship with South Africa. The agreement that is being discussed today is the first step. It was necessary for political reasons but also, as the Council said, to provide the legal basis for the develop ment of future cooperation. It is important to note that the European Investment Bank normally limits its operations to countries which are linked to the Community by a cooperation agreement. So the agreement I signed in October is the key to unlocking that crucial door of European Investment Bank money. That is the context which explains the simplified struc ture of the agreement. Whilst the human rights article is an essential element of the agreement, Articles 2 and 4 are the provisions whereby the contracting parties agree to step up cooperation in all areas and, within the limits of their financial means, make funds available to do so. The relationship between bilateral cooperation and the global interests of the South African region to which reference has been made in the course of the debate, is given proper attention in Article 6 following the guidelines provided by the EU-SADC declaration adopted by the Berlin Conference early in September. This is a first step. It is a necessary and crucial first step. We intend to build on it with the support of Parliament, as soon as possible to build a strong relationship reflecting the unique position of the new South Africa. I hope Parliament will support us in the first step and sustain us in subsequent steps as well. (Applause) President. - The debate is closed. The vote will take place shortly. 12. Votes Cunningham (PSE). - Madam President, on a point of order. We have just finished what can only be described as a historic debate on South Africa in the presence of a delegation from the South African Parliament which includes the Speaker and we are greatly honoured to have them with us. May I ask therefore that we maintain the momentum which has been generated in this Chamber and take the resolution on the Kinnock report now. There is only one resolution and we can demonstrate to the delegation here what I am sure will be our overwhelming support for this resolution and also demonstrate our commitment to and our solidarity with the people of South Africa. (Applause) Green (PSE). - Madam President, on behalf of the Socialist Group I want to support that request. A vote could be taken very quickly and would be an extremely good gesture. Oomen-Ruijten (PPE). - (NL) Madam President, it is not quite right to deviate from the order of business in front of all our fellow Members, but those colleagues who have just extended a hearty welcome to our fellow-parliamen tarians from South Africa ought really to have been here half an hour ago when Parliament paid a sincere tribute and wished our South African colleagues every success. But out Group naturally has no objections if other people feel we should do it all over again. President. - Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, I believe that if there had been a large number of amendments to this report, it would have posed a problem for me. But there are none. A vote can therefore be taken very quickly on the report which has a symbolic value given the presence of our friends.

Reason: we are facing a rather idiotic situation here. The Council has already decided, subject to the vote of the European Parliament. The majority of the European Parliament is against this Council decision and against its substance. The problem is as follows: if we vote against, this negative vote will mean that the Council decision enters into force. We can only prevent the Council decision entering into force if we refer the report back to committee, i.e., do not vote on it. There is a second reason for referral back. There is a certain lack of clarity here. If the set-aside area is reduced from 15% to 12%, the proportion of land that needs to be subsidized will rise from 85% to 88%, and under the Blair House agreement it is not clear whether the compensato ry payments that were agreed in what is called the MacSharry Fund can also be paid for the additional 3%. The Community farmers would no longer obtain com pensatory payments for these 3% if I understand it rightly. This matter must be clarified first, for it was still in dispute in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. We have put a question to the Commis sion. It is surely justified to clarify this first and to vote for referral back to committee.

We still have a great many amendments to vote on. It is 8.40 p.m. and I cannot make an exception. As you will remember, we once did it for all the group chairmen but that was in truly exceptional circumstances. Otherwise everybody has to abide by the rule. Langer (V). - (DE) Madam President, may I request that you ask the House whether it agrees that at least the group explanations of vote can be given before the final vote. For a number of changes have appeared in the course of the vote, and if we do not just want to be voting machines we must have a chance to react to some degree to the changes that have emerged during the vote and at least to explain the groups' positions. That is why I request you to ask the House whether it agrees to this. President. - Mr Langer, we cannot call into question what has already been decided. Obviously, no Vice- President is going to go back on this rule. There is no question of reopening the debate. No explanation of vote can be given, except after the voting has been completed. There is no reason why an exception should be made for anybody. Graefe zu Baringdorf (V). - (DE) Madam President, I am not satisfied with the way you are conducting the pro ceedings because you would not allow us to vote on the motion tabled by our group. Parliament is free. If this House declares by a majority that it does not want to do this, that is fine, but you cannot simply dismiss the motion! After all the Rules of Procedure are not dogma! President. - Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, there are no provisions whatsoever in the Rules of Procedure whereby the Assembly has to vote on the request made. I must repeat yet again that our interpretation of the Rules of Procedure instructs us to proceed in this way which, as you well know, is in the interests of the House. We cannot go on voting until 11 p.m. It is neither feasible nor reasonable. You are fully aware that our workload is increasing steadily and that we need a degree of disci pline. I do believe that this is reasonable and in the best interests of our work. ",
        "No 4-454/30 Debates of the European Parliament 30. 11.94 President (Applause) We have a number of important reports to vote on. If we carry on until 10 p.m. there will be practically no Members left in the Chamber. Votes cannot be taken on important matters without the required majority in the Assembly. We owe this to the citizens we represent. For this reason I am sticking to the procedure for which the President and Vice-Presidents assume full responsibility. (Parliament adopted the resolution) Report (A4-0076/94) by Mr Sis\u00f3 Cruellas, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a Council Regulation (EC) laying down general rules for the granting of Community financial aid in the field of trans-European networks (COM(94)0062 - C3-0155/94 - 94/0065(SYN)) (Parliament adopted the legislative resolution) Interim report (A4-0073/94) by Mr Herman, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on: - the recommendation to the European Council on 'Europe and the global information society' - the Communication from the Commission of the European Communities on 'Europe's way to the information society: an action plan' (COM(94) 0347 - C4-0093/94) (Parliament adopted the resolution) Explanations of vote On the des Places report Martinez (NI). - (FR) Madam President, I have taken the floor not so much to say nice things about Mr des Places' report, but to denounce the 200 000 ha of durum wheat that France has lost in exchange for a miserable present of another 50 000 ha. Finally, whilst I regret that our farmers in the Beauce are having a difficult time of it because of the Commission's errors of judgment, I cannot but welcome the Norwegian vote given the spectacle we have just been treated to. After all we have been through here in the last two hours, I would like to say how right Norwegian women were to reject the voluntary termination of nationhood. I would like to add, Madam President, how happy we are that on 28 November a small nation in the Big North stood up to avoid the sad spectacle we have just witnessed. Those of us sitting on these benches are all Norwegians tonight. Rosado Fernandes (RDE). - (PT) Madam President, I do not know whether I should not agree with Mr Martinez. I feel a bit of a fool making this statement on durum wheat. Of course, I shall be voting against and the other two Portuguese members of my group will do likewise. Mr Martinez spoke of the 200 000 hectares lost by France. Portugal did not even recover the hectares lost for its durum wheat. The increase is extremely important for the income of southern Portuguese growers and, in spite of the high regard in which I hold French agriculture, we cannot vote in favour of the des Places proposal. Berthu (EDN), in writing. - (FR) We cannot but wel come the documents submitted to us since they seek to limit the set-aside requirement to take account of dimin ishing stocks. But despite my support for this one-off adjustment, I should like my vote to be interpreted as a demand for a still heavier cut-back of set-aside and, to tell the truth, even the total abolition of this Kafkaesque system. After all, where has it got us? With the help of the price system we have managed to pull off the remarkable feat of producing large surpluses in certain agricultural sectors (resulting in the accumula tion of stocks which are expensive for everyone) whilst at the same time - and literally at the same time - opening up our borders to various imports, particularly animal feedstuffs. The result has been the simultaneous creation of expensive stocks for everyone on the one hand and a heavy deficit in the Community's overall agricultural trade balance on the other. The latter is a less well-known fact. Faced with this situation the reformed CAP has found nothing better to propose than the introduction of the set-aside system to reduce stocks. But this short-sighted policy fails to take into consideration the overall situa tion. What is more, it seeks to remedy with even more bureaucracy the evils engendered by this very bureaucra cy in the first place. We ourselves want to see genuine Community preference where market mechanisms are restored, self-sufficiency in food products is more effectively guaranteed and farmers are able to derive their main income from the sale of their produce rather than from bureaucratic hand-outs. Guigou (PSE), in writing. - (FR) The Members of the French socialist delegation are against the Committee on Agriculture's proposal to amend Regulation 1765/92 establishing a support system for producers of durum wheat. The report presented by Mr des Places on durum wheat is aimed exclusively at meeting the request of Mr Jean Puech, French Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, and so satisfying the cereal lobby of the Centre and North of France. The proposal in question is at odds with CAP objectives and the improved distribution of public aid between large and small producers. Furthermore, it calls into question some of the basic principles adhered to by France even before an initial assessment has been made - to the detriment of farmers from the South for whom this type of crop is often the only option. On the Cunha report Martinez (NI). - (FR) Madam President, despite the absence of so many of my fellow Members I would like to recall what the Common Agricultural Policy used to be all about in the days when we were being told that there were butter mountains, milk lakes and cereals stocks as high as Himalayan peaks. Today, the figures speak for themselves: in July 1993 we had no more than fifteen million tonnes of cereals, in 1994 no more than six million and in 1995 we shall have no more than two and a ",
        "30. 11.94 Debates of the European Parliament No 4-454/31 Martinez half million. In other words we shall soon have to buy cereals from abroad - which is already the case with durum wheat. As a result prices are on the increase, reaching more than 150 dollars per tonne. Cereal substitutes are becoming more and more competitive and are being imported from the United States. We shall soon have to abandon exports in order to be able to supply the national market - which is what our German colleagues wanted. Under these circumstances the only rational solution would have been to do away with set-aside, but we are told that this is demagogy. Then why was set-aside abolished in the United States two years ago? Second thoughts, Mr Commissioner, are at least possible in the case of set-aside - if I may say so - but not in the case of the grubbing up of vineyards for when the Commission realizes it was wrong, a whole civilization will have been torn up. Funk (PPE), in writing. - (DE) Following wide-ranging discussions in all the Member States on future agricul tural policy, the Council reached agreement in May 1992 on the most wide-reaching reform yet of the CAP. The purpose of the reform is: - effectively to restrict surpluses of certain agricultural products; - to stabilize farm incomes; - to encourage young farmers to stay in farming; - to give precedence to environmentally compatible agricultural production. The Council decision to reduce the set-aside land from 15% to 12% was a great surprise and also came too late for many sown areas. Parliament is being put under pressure, by the 'do or die' method. The policy to date has meant that intervention stocks are being markedly reduced. It makes no sense to increase this production again. Under the agricultural reform our aim is to stabilize the markets and prices. Now the prices are higher than the intervention prices, and we are glad of that. With this decision we run the risk that the price stability, market equilibrium and improved incomes will immediately be cancelled out again. If we have lower stocks we will need to pay less storage costs, and, moreover we can adhere to the GATT agreements. I can only agree to this proposal with extreme reserva tions. I also tie my agreement to the condition that the Commission agrees to a national balance of base areas. Poisson (EDN), in writing. - (FR) This explanation of vote on the Cunha report on behalf of the Europe of Nations Group was to have been given by Mr Philippe de Villiers but he is unable to be here and sends his apologies. The Europe of Nations Group has just voted in favour of the Cunha report, even though its recommendations are laughably faint-hearted. So our vote makes the best of a bad job. We cannot reject a cut, even an insignificant cut, in Brussels' compulsory set-aside rate although the very idea of set-aside and of financial reward for work not done is an insult to our farmers. This absurd and unfair system sacrifices European agri culture on the ideological altar of world free trade. In the name of GATT we are destroying the dynamism of our farmers and undermining the fundamental economic and social equilibria of all our countries. One wonders wheth er this systematic destruction of traditional equilibria is not the chief objective of the present Commission in Brussels. This in any case is the net result, and the justification for set-aside can only be found in this destructive ideology. Cereal feed for livestock is an excellent example of this technocratic absurdity. More than half of Europe's lives tock is fed on cereal substitutes imported at ridiculously low prices from third countries. These imports are equi valent to 30 million tonnes of cereals. If the European Union were to live up to its role and re-establish Com munity preference, it would substantially reduce cereal imports from outside the Community. Such incentives for European production would spell the end of any obliga tory set-aside system and restore the dignity of agricul tural work. The only honourable objective for the European Union's agricultural policy is self-sufficiency in Europe's food production. The Europe of Nations Group strongly con demns the letter and spirit of the set-aside system and calls for its definitive repeal and replacement by genuine Community preference in agriculture. On the Oostlander report Sakellariou (PSE). - (DE) Madam President, the Group of the Party of European Socialists regrets rejecting the interim report on the accession of Central and Eastern European countries with a view to the European Council meeting in Essen. While we fully endorse large parts of this report, two amendments have made the report so one-sided that it has finally become unacceptable. First, recital J and paragraph 33 have distorted the European Parliament's resolution of 21 July this year by construing the call to consider the possibility of Bosnia and Croatia participating in PHARE resources to actually granting them. We agree to the idea of considering the possibility, but consider the present wording wrong and exaggerated, especially because of the very problematic human rights and freedom of the press situation in Croatia. Further more, Amendment No 82 by the Group of the European People's Party calls for NATO membership of the Cen tral and Eastern European countries without further discussion or preparation. We do not endorse that either. This is in fact such a basic question that we are forced to deny the report our approval, that is to say to vote against this interim report. Oostlander (PPE). - (NL) Madam President, I am very pleased that the report has been approved. I fully under stand Mr Sakellariou's comments, because I too regarded the question of NATO membership as a possible precur sor to full membership of the European Union as very important. We have debated that in depth but have not been able to agree. And I think it is good that we have again heard a word or two of optimism about Bosnia. This whole debate is taking place against a tragic back drop and so it is good that we have at least heard a few positive things, but that will doubtless be coming up for debate tomorrow and we shall all have to say our piece then. The only thing I do not like is that this resolution has grown a bit too long. I would have preferred to give the Essen summit a shorter, more powerful text, because if we come along with 70 or so paragraphs I am afraid it will ",
        "No 4-454/32 Debates of the European Parliament 30. 11.94 Oostlander not be altogether clear what Parliament's real priorities are. But fine, that is the way it went and the things approved were certainly not politically contentious, in my view, and all in all I am very happy and I hope that this is the first of many positive steps and that we shall subsequently achieve a broader consensus in Parliament on this matter. Bertens (ELDR). - (NL) Madam President, I should like to start by saying on behalf of my Group that the procedure surrounding the Oostlander report has been something of a rushed affair. The 82 amendments only became available to us in all the languages this afternoon, and that naturally makes it rather hard for us to be properly prepared. I find that unfortunate. I also find it unfortunate that the Socialist Group ended up rejecting the report. I go along with much of what Mr Oostlander said. The report is an interim report and, as he says himself, it has become a bit too detailed, a bit too lengthy to be submitted to and used at the Essen summit. We are mostly in agreement with the rapporteur on the broad lines of the report and we agree too that the political importance of expansion towards Central and Eastern Europe is not only self-evident but also a prime need which is far more important than economic consi derations. We also agree that it is also very much in the interest of the new Member States that they should be joining a European Union which works, is democratic and able to take real decisions and make policy. We thus agree with the rapporteur when he says that further enlargement must depend on necessary institutional reforms to be conducted at the time of the 1996 IGC so that the Union can continue to function, can take decisions, and can be democratic and transparent even with 20 or even 24 members. This is in the interest not least of the new members themselves. Lastly, it cannot be emphasized enough that ever-closer cooperation should precede the accession of new Mem ber States in a variety of areas of mutual interest. Ever-closer cooperation not just between the Union and applicant states, but between the applicant states them selves. Where that cooperation also touches on third countries, directly or indirectly, it goes without saying that serious consideration will have to be given to the interests and concerns of these countries too. Langer (V). - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentle men, the great majority of my Group have abstained on the Oostlander report in the light, in particular, of the amendment making entry to NATO a kind of prerequisite for accession to the European Union. I personally voted for the report because I consider that the positive signal nonetheless holds sway. What was our - rejected - amendment that I very much regret? We wanted to convey to the Essen European Council that it is no longer possible to position the countries of Central and Eastern Europe in ever-new antechambers and waiting-rooms as they wait to become fully European. They are fully European in just the same way as we are, and it seems to me that if we now fail to re-establish a positive vision of rapid European integra tion - political integration in particular, this being, in our view, of greater value than integration of markets - we risk a dangerous movement away, partly towards nation alism, and this is currently happening in many countries and not just Eastern Europe, and also towards pure mercantilism: those who are strong and able to get ahead will do so for their own benefit. That is why we wished to insert into the Oostlander report a clear choice: we therefore favour political integration even where the economic circumstances are not completely apt because we consider that the common European home, that of the whole of Europe, is the political signal that has today to be given and that it has specifically to be a political and not, for example, military or market-related. Notwithstanding those limitations which the debate and somewhat agitated vote have introduced - which is why, Madam President, we regret that we were not able to give our explanations of vote beforehand to enable us to shape the views of the House and why none of us voted against the Oostlander report - we consider that it was important to convey that signal to the Essen summit. Gyldenkilde (V), in writing. - (DA) If I feel it necessary to give an explanation of vote, it is out of indignation at the fact that the majority in Parliament is using something which is so important for the whole of Europe as a means of exerting pressure for institutional change, giving Parliament greater power. This emerges clearly from paragraph 2, which I am therefore against. I am naturally in favour of Eastern Europe having the opportunity to join in cooperation with the EU, and in fact I would put this at the top of my list of requirements for the IGC in 1996. There is a need for cooperation in Europe, especially in the areas of the environment, energy and social policy, because only a united Europe, in which these matters are taken seriously, will be able to maintain and develop a Europe which is at peace. For these more elevated reasons, I am voting in favour of this report, but I reject the use of pressure to obtain powers for Parliament, and the pressurizing of those countries which may not wish to participate in some sectors, such as Denmark. Riis-J\u00f8rgensen (ELDR), in writing. - (DA) The Oostlan der report on the strategy for the accession of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe contains a number of good points and gives impetus to what is a fundamental East-West debate here in Parliament. Unfor tunately, we still lack the wholehearted support of the Commission and, in particular, the Council of Ministers. Most recently, we have seen the Council maintaining quotas for steel imports from the Czech and Slovak Republics, despite the fine words of its formal statements on the importance of helping Central and Eastern Europe. I welcome the fact that accession is to take place without the possibility of opting out of certain sectors, in other words the rejection of a multi-speed Europe. Institutional adjustments are required for the enlargement of the EU towards the East, but I cannot accept our use of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe as hostages, and I am therefore unable to support paragraphs 2 and 5 of the report. In the hope that there will be a breakthrough in the negotiations on Eastern Europe at the Essen Summit, I shall be voting in favour of this report. Theonas (GUE), in writing. - (EL) We categorically oppose the way in which the gradual incorporation of the ",
        "30. 11.94 Debates of the European Parliament No 4-454/33 Theonas Central and Eastern European countries is being pro moted. By means of second-rate procedures with the long-term aim of accession to the EU, the EU is trying to impose on those countries, in the name of democracy and respect for human rights, the path of savage capitalism and elimination of any obstacles that stand in the way of their full exploitation. The conditions hypocritically being dictated in the name of democracy degrade any concept of national indepen dence and sovereignty for those countries. We believe in establishing the broadest relations on equal terms with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, respecting their status as independent states and the will of their peoples. Colonial-type conventions and relations such as those being promoted under the guise of granting aid to those countries are unacceptable to us. If the EU really wants to help those countries, it will have to provide substantial financial aid to improve the living conditions of working people, to combat unemployment which is increasing by leaps and bounds, to create essential infrastructure, and all this under no circum stances subject to political or ideological conditions. And from that standpoint all the interventions in progress today do not really aim to help the people of those countries, but to benefit the interests of major monopol istic and multinational capital, which has found fertile ground in the virgin markets of the formerly socialist countries. We want to highlight the dangerous game being played with the new accessions to the EU and the Intergovern mental Conference of 1996 on the review of the Treaties. In the name of the EU's further enlargement, they are trying to formalize their attempt officially to establish the multi-speed EU. In the name of flexibility and effective ness, they will try to bring about profoundly anti democratic changes in the EU's institutional organiza tion, changes heralded by various scenarios exposed to the glare of publicity, and in that way to establish a hard core consisting of the developed countries. We also want to stress the need for immediate backing of the candidacies of Cyprus and Malta, whose applications for accession should not be linked to the EU's prospects of enlargement towards the Central and Eastern Euro pean countries. On the Sis\u00f3 Cruellas report Le Rachinel (NI). - (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the twenty-six Herculean labours in the White Paper on trans-European networks, reduced to eleven then raised to fourteen, will no doubt end up as no more than four or five if Mr Alphandery, French Minister for the Economy and Finance, has his way. If the main worry is the funding of these networks, the financial package for most of them has not yet been sewn up in the absence of a clear definition of the profitability criterion, taking into account national and Community funding and the possibility of loans from the European Investment Bank. The strategy of large-scale projects put forward in the White Paper by Jacques Delors - the New Deal Brussels style - is in serious danger of cutting a sorry figure at the Essen Summit in December, with only four or five projects finalized. True, ECU 1,8 billion of Community aid over five years for these networks is not going to stir Member State governments to action, especially as the deceptively 'good' idea of Delors about Community borrowing has been thrown out by the Member States in the name of orthodox budgeting. Under these circumstances private investors are not exactly queuing up to finance these priority projects which could easily finish up as purely national projects topped up by a contribution from the Community. In this area, just as in many others, Madam President, national political realities are at odds with the dreams of the Brussels Eurocracy. Van der Waal (EDN), in writing. - (NL) The initiative to set up trans-European networks creates high expecta tions. Not least for jobs. But so far very little has actually been done. I am broadly happy with the Commission document which sets out the legal base and procedure whereby financial aid will be granted by the Community. But decisions are still to be taken regarding project guidelines and choices. The question of funding in particular has not yet been sorted out. The first point is that it is primarily the Member States which are responsible for the completion of projects. And they will have to provide the lion's share of the necessary cost. There are various sources for this, for some coun tries the Cohesion Fund and the Structural Funds. They can also obtain loans from the EIB, and guarantees from the EIF, but always to a limited extent. Aid from the Community will be modest too. I have the feeling that not all the Member States realize this clearly enough. Much of the funding will thus have to come from private institutions. The question is whether their interest can be aroused. A number of large transport projects are in direct competition with existing forms of transport and it may thus take decades before they show a return. Another point is the choice of projects. We need to make sure that Community financial aid is strictly limited to truly European projects which will make a concrete contribution to setting up the network. The Sis\u00f3 report does not make enough of a demarcation between national and European projects. The funding criteria are also stretched in favour of national and regional projects. We hope that the Christophersen group will come up with good recommendations for the many bottlenecks which still remain. Wijsenbeek (ELDR), in writing. - (NL) The great danger with the trans-European networks is that priority will be given to projects in regions which qualify for aid from the Structural Funds. The purpose of the trans-European networks is different from that of the Structural Funds and the two objectives must not be confused. For each infrastructure project its practical value must be weighed in relation to the factor of opening up peripheral regions. Union funding should be given to studies on how various infrastructures need to be interlinked. If trans-European networks in peripheral regions are financed 100% out of the Structural Funds we have no quarrel with that, but the cost must not then be charged solely to the trans-European networks. The trans-Euro pean networks will only qualify for funding if they match the special objectives of the trans-European networks. ",
        "No 4-454/34 Debates of the European Parliament 30. 11.94 On the Herman report Guineberti\u00e8re (RDE), in writing. - (FR) The RDE Group has come out in favour of the interim report even though the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy was the only committee consulted. But why restrict the impact of this report? Why has it not been referred similarly to the Committee on Culture and the Media, of which I happen to be a member, or to the Committee on Employment since many new jobs are likely to open up? How frustrating for Members of Parliament who are hoping to be players in this new society. Commissioner Bangemann has pointed out again this evening that the information society is not an 'information tunnel', is not just technology and industry. The information society is a sociological development with man at the very centre of the upheaval. This in itself is a sufficient reason for Members to be involved in the launch of a voluntarist policy intended to accompany and anticipate technological changes. While aiming at main taining an equilibrium between players, be they private or public, as well as guaranteeing and furthering the blos soming of our culture in which our identity is rooted, this new political approach should also include areas such as artistic creations and rights of ownership over them, guarantees regarding political and scientific information, training, promotion of the democratic values of the Union and observance of the principle of equality of access. Such a policy will have to accommodate the paradox that both liberalization and regulation are needed to avoid concentration. This is an issue that every Member of Parliament will have to examine very carefully. Theonas (GUE), in writing. - (EL) By voting against the report I mean to express my grave concern about the guidelines of a plan which aims not just to bring about changes, but to reconstitute the very structures of our society. It is absolutely necessary to proceed with the utmost caution and to adopt the most critical attitude possible. The entire action programme was planned on the basis of strategies dictated mainly by the aims of the White Paper, and which consequently respond to its main objective, namely to increase productivity and competitiveness. The role of the Member States is ultimately downgraded to that of a 'sponsor', since everything to do with the state is now regarded as 'anti-social' whereas private interests are forging ahead with their objectives, undertaking to implement the services and applications in question, which are regarded as 'essential to innovation, growth and development'. The trans-European networks will constitute the 'nervous system' for communication between companies for the exchange of information, and are far less concerned to facilitate communication between the peoples of Europe and the world in general. The need for cross-border 'cooperation' of capital entire ly justifies the urgent need to create a 'suitable regulatory framework' for telecommunications, which entails their privatization not just at the service level, but following a recent decision by the Commission, at the level of infrastructure as well. They promise that the 'information revolution' will deal more effectively with the problem of unemployment, since the new technologies will enhance the flexibility of the labour market. We fear that the new working methods, the so-called 'tele-employment', will turn working people into a cheap raw material for industrial 'achievements', people who will guarantee the smooth running and competitiveness of their companies by remote control, isolated from any social interaction and without access to safety mechanisms for the protection of their acquired social rights, without the assurance of social security or any other form of coverage. Everyone is glorifying the new technological 'revolution' and exciting our imagination. Of course, the term 'revo lution' should hold no fears for us provided the aim of progress is to improve and upgrade peoples' standard of living, in anthropocentric directions. But none of this is achieved by a 'market-led revolution' that leads more to an 'Orwellian' society, to the subjugation of civilization and human communication, for the sake of promoting the self-centred private interests of multi-national capital. 13. Handynet system President. - The next item is the report (A4-0075/94) by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, on behalf of the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment, on the Commission proposal for a Council decision concerning the continued development of the Handynet system within the frame work of Decision 93/136/EEC establishing a third Com munity action programme to assist disabled people (He lios II 1993 - 1996) (COM(94)0303 - C4-0089/94 - 94/0168(CNS). IN THE CHAIR: Mr GUTIERREZ D\u00cdAZ Vice-President Hughes (PPE), chairman of the Committee on Social Affairs, Employment and the Working Environment. - Mr President, to clear up any unfortunate misunderstanding which may have arisen at the beginning of our session today when I spoke against urgency for this matter. At that time I understood that there would be no chance of a debate on this issue and my speech against urgency was based upon taking this issue without debate. I am pleased now that we have a debate, to see it dealt with urgently. Thanks to the good work of the few Members here present who have worked on this issue, the German presidency will have something positive to adopt on 6 December. I hope that clarifies the situation. Oomen-Ruijten (PPE), rapporteur. - (NL) Mr President, I should like to start by thanking all my colleagues most sincerely for their active support in the preparation of this report. Handynet is part of the Helios II programme and Parlia ment held a lively and very emotional debate on it two years ago. I was the rapporteur at that time too, so what were the problems as I then saw them? One of the problems of the Helios II programme was in my view that handicapped people were not sufficiently involved in and around the decision-making process so that actions under Helios were by and large not conducive to getting handicapped people integrated into all areas of social life. In this regard we have brought a lot more democracy into the Helios programme. But as rapporteur then and now, I ",
        "30. 11.94 Debates of the European Parliament No 4-454/35 Oomen-Ruijten still do not think we have done enough. Handicapped people need to have more of a say in the policy-making process, the political process and the advisory process so that - and I hope the European Commission will take this on board - policy on the handicapped, shaped by and for handicapped people, will feature even more prominently in all the work being done in Europe. Now to Handynet. Handynet was one of the major stumbling blocks for the Helios programme in 1993. What were my objections at the time? The programme costs too much. We were spending some 20 million guilders on it. The programme was not good enough, not fine-tuned properly and it was altogether inaccessible, even for people who knew their way around computer systems. That was why, when the Helios programme was being finalized, we asked for a separate evaluation of the Handynet part of it. We can now show that there has been some improvement. But I cannot agree that there is any cause for jubilation. I want to make that quite clear. So the European Parliament is now giving the green light, or perhaps I should say the amber light, for a further one-year period. What is to happen during that period? There needs to be better data processing. Better, but free, dissemination amongst handicapped people and their organizations. But the European Parliament's view is the programmes must not be expanded in any way. Why not? Quality must come first. It has improved, but the prime need is real action to remedy all the shortcomings which the organizations representing handicapped people have themselves pointed out to us. The amber light. And a reassessment after one more year. The European Parliament was and remains critical of the programme. So what we want to see is more new ways being sought during the coming year, not only to get handicapped people and their organizations more involved in things, to get a better spread, but also to shape the programme in such a way that each Member State gets something out of it. I have made a number of remarks on this in my report. So there will be a further year of work and adjustments. Our position is this: have a look in the course of that year whether you cannot get other partners to help support the programme. I am thinking not only of handicapped people and their organizations, but of the Member States too, and perhaps the private sector may be willing to cooperate on what started out as a very worthwhile initiative. So yes to a period of one year. We remain critical, and I trust that the European Commission will take on board many of the comments which have been made. Schmidbauer (PSE). - (DE) Mr President, I can only agree with the previous speaker. We have indeed worked jointly as a Parliament on the programme and amend ments and agree entirely on the direction to take. The proposal for a Council decision is a 63-page document describing the European information system on technical aids entitled Handynet. The decision section of this document consists of a single sentence. The 60-odd page evaluation of the programme is in my view not a genuine evaluation but a description. Only some 20% of disabled people, their family members or organizations for the disabled took part in the evaluation. The other 80% were, for instance, wheelchair manufacturers, rehabilitation specialists, information and computer specialists and administrators, who evaluated their own products and work. Nor is there any evaluation of the question why so many users cannot actually do anything with the system. Through the contacts that we Members have with various organizations for the disabled, we have received very varied messages. There are organizations that are rather satisfied, especially those from Member States that have never had any information system at all in the past. Others again say the national system is more user friendly; but the general criticism was that those con cerned, i.e., the disabled, were not sufficiently involved in the data collection and have little opportunity of direct access to the programme and the information. That is why the existing Handynet system needs to be deepened and improved before we can agree to any extension of it. We also call for the national data- collection centres and the Commission to work together more closely and for CD ROM to be made available on request to all organizations for the disabled. For in the past, when those concerned complained, the buck was passed from one place to another. The Commission representatives say it is up to the Member States to ensure the distribution of the system and access to it. The Member States say they are not the Commission's execu tive assistants. Those who laugh loudest in this case are certainly not the disabled for whom the Handynet system was actually created, but the manufacturers and dealers in the technical aids system. A further important point is that other Directorates- General apart from DG V, where the programme was formulated, certainly also possess information about assistance for the disabled. For instance data exists on the programmes for research and technological development in the framework of TIDE. This data could really give information on the latest situation and should certainly be made compatible with the Handynet system. On the basis of our amendments, which are really additions, and the call for greater participation by disa bled people themselves, we can endorse the proposal on the Handynet programme. Gyldenkilde (V). - (DA) Mr President, Handy net is concerned with providing information on technical aids for disabled people. The most important thing in this context is to establish whose interests are being taken account of here. The point has already been made today that it is not the interests of businesses which should be being considered, but rather those of the users. We are pressing very strongly for more user-friendliness and more guidance on what this system can be used for, and by whom. We shall certainly go along with the idea of allowing a year for this question to be clarified, because we quite honestly do not think that what is being put forward now is very impressive. I am convinced that we shall have to discuss this issue a good many times over the next few years. Are we to use data-processing techniques for the sake of the users and their needs, or for the sake of businesses? I believe that this is an important debate, and one we cannot avoid. On this occasion, however, we shall be voting in favour. We have worked on this in committee, and we agree with the rapporteur and the amendments tabled by the Committee on Social Affairs. However, we reserve the right to come back to the matter, if the Commission does not listen to the criticism which has been made. ",
        "No 4-454/36 Debates of the European Parliament 30. 11.94 Howitt Howitt (PSE). - Mr President, a project to improve information on equipment to assist people with disabili ties in Europe should be uncontroversial but in approving this report Parliament will be putting the Handynet scheme on trial. On trial because, despite the fact that there have been over six years of development at a cost of more than ECU 8 million to this European Union, tonight Parliament has no information that Handynet has benefit ted one disabled person anywhere in Europe. That is a disgrace. The Commission evaluation, where four out of five of those interviewed were manufacturers, administrators and specialists, gave little priority to disabled people who are the intended beneficiaries of the service. Of the 123 interviews which did apparently include disabled people no separate information is given between disabled peo ple, families and disability organizations. We know, however, that no disabled people were asked in Denmark, Greece, Spain or Luxembourg. Therefore, that evaluation was a nonsense. That is why Parliament's amendments tonight say that there must be a further review by the end of 1996 and an external evaluation including the views of representative organizations of disabled people to be submitted by the end of next year. Those amendments should be supported. However, this is not simply a question of poor informa tion. We know that people with disabilities have deep and justifiable concerns about the effectiveness of Handynet. First, 76% of the information on the system is about equipment for people with motor disabilities. If we have a system it should benefit all people with disabilities. Second, the design of the system is difficult if not impossible to use by disabled people themselves as the International League of Societies for Persons with a Mental Handicap has shown. Third, there is at present no information about the quality or usefulness of equipment in the database and vague assurances about this being developed are not good enough and once again direct feedback from disabled people who are users is required. Fourth, the Commission has admitted how limited its distribution is. Less than 300 CD-ROMs distributed of the February edition, only two for the whole of Denmark. Fifth, we should be very concerned about the commer cialization of the service. The CD-ROMs are being distributed by a private company and national centres in Member States are selling the information without any guidelines on price. Our amendment calls for information to be free to users. So, when this Parliament is next asked to vote on Handynet, let us see a system which is accessible to and demonstrably used by disabled people. Let me caution those that are responsible for Handynet not to ignore these demands. If they do so, they are putting their own future work and all of the development at risk. In September this year the British Government indicated to disability organizations in the UK that it intended to withdraw from Handynet and recognized that the funding would be lost to disabled people altogether. Despite the fact that it asked for comments in just two days, two months later it has yet to reach a final position. Next time this Parliament reviews Handynet do not force us into the same position of opposition with those who have a cavalier attitude to disabled people's services and refuse to support their justifiable demands for equality. In closing I wish to tell Parliament how its former Member, Giulio Regge from Italy, a disabled person, sought to gain access to the Handynet system in his country. He was unable to do so and if a Member of this Parliament cannot get this information this should sound a warning note which must be heeded. Oddy (PSE). - Mr President, I have one important message for the Commission. It must consult disabled people in the Handynet programme if that programme is to be truly useful for disabled people. My understanding is that the current Handynet programme is too central ized, out-of-date, too difficult to update and not suffi ciently linguistically flexible. It is simply not known amongst the disabled people for whom this programme is designed. Only one solution can make it a computer network by disabled people for disabled people. Many specialized colleges and courses for disabled people are already cooperating at transnational level and the Commission would be well advised to consult more fully with them. I fully support the remarks of my two Socialist colleagues. Steichen, Member of the Commission. - (FR) Mr Presi dent, on behalf of the Commission I would like to thank the House for having agreed to examine the Handynet dossier under the urgency procedure. This is especially important if the Social Affairs Council is to adopt a position at its meeting of 6 December. May I say how much the Commission appreciates the high standards and speed with which the rapporteur, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, has carried out her job. All the amend ments put forward in the report will be taken into consideration either in the Council's draft decision or within the framework of a Commission declaration to appear in the minutes of the meeting of the Social Affairs Council. By this declaration the Commission will commit itself to taking the necessary measures in order first of all to undertake an objective external evaluation, taking into consideration the views of disabled people themselves - something which quite a few of you have been emphasiz ing. Secondly, the aim will be to ensure a better distribu tion and marketing of CD-ROM in cooperation with the Member States. Thirdly, there needs to be an improve ment in the database of the technical module so as to meet the needs and wishes of disabled people. Finally, the software needs to be more user-friendly and data collec tion methods refined. As regards the amendments, the Commission wishes to make the following remarks. First, as regards Amend ment No 1 on promoting distribution, access to informa tion and financial arrangements, a strategy for promoting conditions to facilitate distribution and improve access to information for potential users will be submitted for consultation to the Member States and the consultative bodies of the Helios programme on 5, 6 and 7 December. Furthermore, the report evaluating the Helios II pro gramme, to be submitted at the end of 1995 in accordance with paragraph 2 of Article 11, will take account of the activities already undertaken and the arrangements for financial implementation. As regards Amendment No 2 on cooperation with ISO and CEN, close cooperation has already been established with ISO in developing the classification of technical aids ",
        "30. 11.94 Debates of the European Parliament No 4-454/37 Steichen and terminology used by ISO. The necessary arrange ments will be made with CEN to include in the Handynet database information on European standards in technical aids. I shall turn now to Amendments No 3 and 4 concerned with confining the existing database to the technical aids module. This is in line with the Commission proposal and also reflects the outcome of discussions in the Council. However, I feel obliged to point out that the Commission has received a large number of requests from organiza tions representing the interests of disabled people, demonstrating the considerable need for information, particularly in the following fields: vocational training, employment and accessibility of public buildings. Fol lowing an initiative taken by some Member States, cooperation among some national coordination centres of the Handynet network has already been established. As regards Amendment No 6 concerning the modifica tion of the Handynet system on 31 December 1996, I would point out that the distribution strategy for Handy- net CD-ROM is under examination by the Member States and by the European Forum of Disabled People. The Commission trusts that a final agreement on distribution procedures will be reached by early December. Provision has been made for the free distribution of three thousand copies of CD-ROM three times a year to a number of organizations designated by representatives from each Member State. Three thousand copies will also be put on sale on demand from organizations in third countries responsible for the production, sale and distribution of Handynet CD-ROM. The Commission will make a point of insisting on the quality of information contained in the Handynet data base. Cooperation is underway with the TIDE initiative with the aim of including the results of research and technological developments that are of interest to the disabled and elderly. The costs of extending the scope of Handynet CD-ROM, as planned for the future, are to be borne by all the parties involved. Finally, we come to Amendment No 6 on external evaluation. The Tavistock Institute runs the consortium of organizations responsible for the independent external evaluation of the Helios II programme. The evaluation strategy provides for consultations with organizations representing disabled people. The Commission will ensure that a report evaluating the utilization of the Handynet system is submitted to Parlia ment by 31 December 1995. The organizations that have received CD-ROM free of charge will be asked to systematically record the number of disabled people consulting the database. Schmidbauer (PSE). - (DE) Mr President, I would just like to ask the Commissioner which amendments he can accept. He has told us nice stories about how all is well or will be so. But I have not heard anything about which amendments the Commission will accept or whether it accepts them all. Steichen, Member of the Commission. - (DE) Mrs Schmidbauer, I have just stated that we will accept all the amendments. It is not possible to incorporate this in the text since the Council is to take over this proposal on 6 December. But we will try to incorporate all the technical and practical considerations as far as possible so that this proposal can be considered. President. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the inter preters for their cooperation during what has been a very tiring day, which went on far longer than envisaged.

This does not appear in the Minutes. Could you ask Parliament's services to have a look at the acoustics? As Members we enjoy being here and recognize the fact that this Parliament will do a lot of work here but it is important for us to look after our hearing as well. We have to turn up our earphones quite loud to be able to hear what the interpreters are saying because there is so much background noise on the floor of the House. A lot of us would appreciate it if you could ask the services to try to improve the acoustics in this room. President. - Mr Provan, you are absolutely correct. What you have said mirrors the sentiments of the vast majority of the House. At the moment we are continuously monitoring the acoustics and the public address system in this chamber. The acoustics and the sound system are nothing short of scandalous at the present time. You are 2. Employment policy President. - The next item is the report (A4-0056/94) by Mr Coates, on behalf of the Temporary Committee on Employment, on an action plan on employment policy to be adopted at the Essen European Council meeting on 9 and 10 December 1994. Coates (PSE), rapporteur. - Mr President, we are about to celebrate the enlargement of the European Union but this debate concerns the condition of the present Union in 1994. This is usually reported to include twelve Member States but there is in fact a thirteenth - the state of Exclusion. Today we consider how things have been going in the thirteen state. It is a populous territory. It includes more people than the unemployed whose condition is our current concern. But those denied work comprise at least 11% of our Union, no less than 18 million people. Counting them is very difficult but these figures are certainly not exaggerated. The inhabitants of the thir teenth state often settle there for a long time. 43% of them have been there for a year or more. 7.74 million people are involved in this condition. They number more than the citizens of Denmark or Ireland, Luxembourg, Finland or Norway. They are about the same size in population as Austria. Youth unemployment still runs at twice the rate of general unemployment. How do things go in the thirteen state. It is not difficult to document rising misery, to pinpoint areas of severe deprivation, to count the victims of child poverty. I was asked to visit a school in my constituency. The headmas ter Richard Rutherford was appointed this January. He ",
        "1. 12.94 Debates of the European Parliament No 4-454/39 Coates found that his children could not concentrate on their lessons. They were too hungry. But misery still elicits a human response and this good teacher organized local people to help. They began to provide breakfasts for the children as they came into school. Within a fortnight some of the parents were coming in to those breakfasts. Distress like this is multiplied by millions in the thir teenth state. But the effort to fight it is also shared by large numbers of people. I think of the village of Whalley Thorns where the coalmine closed 16 years ago and there has been nothing for the men to do since. That village is boarded up because all those who can leave have gone and those who stay behind live in the world of benefits and will power where, abandoned by the rest of the world, they try to survive. I think of a woman councillor in that village, Mrs Goucher who has begged the use of a wooden hut and who has cajoled the authorities to provide her with a small clutch of old computers where she teaches the youngsters in the village - and some who are not so young - to make themselves modern labourers in order to enter the restricted labour markets in that area. Fortunately these people are not alone. Help has been promised and it could be delivered to many if the resources were made available. That is why we want the White Paper on growth, competitiveness and employment to be fully imple mented. But implementation needs more than agreement in principle, it requires that the funds that are necessary should be applied to the task. It requires an agreement either to extend the European Investment Fund or other relevant instruments so that all the measures which are envisaged in the detailed proposals of the White Paper are in fact brought to fruition. Two people have been especially associated with these proposals. Mr Flynn is likely to remain with us to help continue the work he has been doing and we feel comfortable in his presence. As for President Delors he could certainly, if he wished, be elected President of the state of Exclusion any day he chose to offer himself. I hope this Parliament, like my constituents who are fighting this misery, will salute his departure by over whelmingly approving this report and thus ensuring that we together continue his struggle in order to fulfil the tasks he has defined. He understands extremely well that this project has united different traditions. Some of us will be voting for it to uphold the values of solidarity. Others would give those values an older name of Christian love. That is why, Mr President, we are seeking to persuade you to carry the strongest message to the Council of Ministers at Essen Summit. It is found in the fortieth paragraph of our report where it says: 'We cannot afford to fail our people in this promise. The states and institutions of our Europe will be measured by their success in facing this challenge'. (Applause) Hoyer, President-in-Office of the Council. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, an important and fitting signal was given by the European Parliament when it placed on the agenda for its final plenary sitting prior to the European Council meeting in Essen a lengthy discus sion on the next steps in implementing the action plan on growth, competitiveness and employment adopted in Brussels a year ago. In the view of the Council presiden cy, Parliament gave another appropriate signal by appointing, shortly after being constituted in July, a temporary committee on employment. We welcome this. I have now been listening with great interest to the comments of the rapporteur, Mr Coates. The presidency takes the view that the European Council needs to address a threefold challenge in Essen. First of all, the Essen summit must revitalize the economy and take effective action to combat unemployment; secondly, the role of the Union as a key factor in the security and peace of Europe must be enhanced; and thirdly, common mechanisms must be developed for the preservation of Member States' internal security. Like Mr Coates, the presidency believes that the fight against unemployment over the next few years remains a major challenge for Europe. The nascent economic recovery can only gradually bring about improvements in the employment market. The human cost of unemploy ment is considerable and requires a considerable increase in cooperation. The action plan adopted by the European Council in Brussels on the basis of the White Paper provides the European Union and its Member States with the necessary foundations. The role of the Essen summit will be to reaffirm the action plan and to continue the medium-term strategy set out in the White Paper. In practical terms, economic policy must henceforth help to translate the recovery into a process of sustained growth and to further raise the employment rate. The function of fiscal policy in this strategy is to effect resolute budgetary consolidation and to restore scope for national action, thereby bolstering the confidence of investors and consumers and counteracting the rise in long-term interest rates. In addition, monetary policy must inhibit any new inflationary trends so as to avoid undermining investment conditions and to play its own part in promoting growth and employment. Nevertheless, we must not delude ourselves; the prob lems on the employment market cannot be solved by vigorous recovery and a favourable microeconomic cli mate alone. These must be accompanied by long-term structural measures, in other words we need a policy of structural renewal that helps to improve Europe's compe titiveness and to remove structural barriers. In a sense, we must play our part in fitting Europe for the 21st century. At European Union level, this means above all the rapid development of trans-European networks in the fields of transport and energy. The discussions in the Ecofin Council and the Christophersen Group have shown that these can be funded without the creation of new instru ments. The objective at the national level must be to put greater emphasis on private performance incentives, competition and self-reliance. Every Member State must proceed from the starting point of its own specific circumstances while giving due consideration to fiscal requirements. A strategy for a higher employment rate also requires wage restraint. Similarly, there is a need for wage differentiation by region, qualification and sector in accordance with market conditions. Wages can thus play a more significant regulatory role and assist in tackling the processes of structural change. Now it is, of course, the social partners who bear the brunt of responsibility for ",
        "No 4-454/40 Debates of the European Parliament 1. 12.94 Hoyer labour costs. Pay increases which are out of step with productivity trends or which take no account of the supply and demand situation not only threaten the secur ity of existing jobs but also inhibit the creation of additional sustainable employment. It is essential that all those who have work should demonstrate solidarity with those who are seeking work. A reduction of non-wage labour costs, which are relative ly high in most Member States, can contribute to the creation of more jobs. The path to reduction requires strict discipline in the domain of social expenditure. To this end, the social insurance budget must not be bur dened with liabilities of a general social nature, and the aim of effective use of resources must be pursued. Reducing non-wage labour costs by switching part of the financial basis of social security benefits from pay- related contributions to taxation funding can naturally cause problems. Because of the variations between Mem ber States' social security systems and the ways in which they are financed, the effects on employment of such a reform are uncertain. It must therefore be left up to each country to seek appropriate solutions in this area. Unemployment benefits must also be more carefully targeted so that they can play an effective part in cutting unemployment. At the same time, an adequate margin must be maintained between remuneration and social security benefits so that there are ample incentives to take up work wherever that is or may be possible. Occupational training is vitally important, not only for reasons of labour-market policy but also as an investment in human capital. It can serve as an effective means of reintegrating the long-term unemployed into the employ ment system. More flexible working hours, by increasing productivity, can improve employment prospects. That can only be achieved, as well we know, with the aid of the social partners and those responsible for enterprises. Part-time work can play an important role, but other forms of working time must and should be included. Greater flexibility of working hours should cover as many fields of activity as possible - including, inciden tally, the public sector. Under the German presidency, the Council of Labour and Social Affairs Ministers and the Council of Economic and Finance Ministers have taken stock of our efforts in the struggle against unemployment, and this stocktaking will be reflected in our conclusions in Essen, just as the final report of the Christophersen Group will also feature in the conclusions of the European Council. Permit me to make a few more remarks on the preparation of the Council meeting in Essen, remarks which go beyond the subject of the Coates report. The elimination of war among European States and the creation of security and stability, peace and prosperity are the grea test achievements of European unification. Its success must be shared with the whole of Europe. It should be clear to us that there is a relationship of cause and effect linking the rapprochement between the new democracies and the European Union, the success of the economic and political reforms in those countries and the establishment of stability and peace throughout Europe. In Essen we shall adopt a strategy aimed at leading the States of Central and Eastern Europe towards the European Union. I commented on this in some detail in yesterday's plenary assembly. But the security of Europe is also closely linked to the stability of our southern neighbours. To the European Union, the Mediterranean region is of similar strategic importance as Central and Eastern Europe. In Essen we shall adopt a global strategy for the development of our relations with the countries of the Mediterranean region. This region must become an area of peace, prosperity and stability. There are plans to hold a Mediterranean Confer ence in the second half of 1995 under the Spanish presidency, a conference that will deal with all major economic, social and political issues. As regards the agreements with Tunisia, Morocco and Israel, I can report that we have these well in hand. I am confident that the negotiations can be concluded by the end of the year as planned. And in its relations with other regions of the world, too, the European Union is flying the flag, and this is of importance in relation to the preservation and creation of jobs. I am thinking here in particular of the transatlantic dialogue, which continues to be of vital importance to our entire continent. We shall acknowledge the growing impact of the States of the Asian Pacific region on the world economy as well as on regional and global security by adopting an Asia strategy in Essen. We continue to attach great importance to cooperation with the ACP States, as the current mid-term review talks illustrate. Our relations with Latin America will be further developed in accordance with the policy paper adopted by the General Affairs Council on 31 October. Security always presupposes internal stability. Develop ment of Community cooperation in the fields of home affairs and justice is a long-overdue step if we are to bolt the door against international crime and let the people of Europe experience in their own lives the successes of European cooperation. In this area, I must sadly report, results have not matched our expectations. The European Council must generate fresh momentum here. That applies especially to the creation of Europol. However, I do not wish to gloss over the fact that great efforts are still required in this specific area. The primary task at the European Council meeting in Essen is to fit Europe for the future. The starting position is favourable. In recent months the European Union has become more dynamic. You, ladies and gentlemen, as new, active Members of the European Parliament, have contributed a large share of this dynamism. At the start of the coming year a new Commission will take office; above all, from 1 January 1995 we shall be welcoming new Member States to the Union. As I stated in yester day's plenary sitting, the presidency of the Council deeply regrets that there will only be three new members and not four as first envisaged, but their accession will unquestionably enrich the Union in a manner comparable with the accession that we were able to secure nine years ago. Despite excessively high unemployment, and despite intolerable news from the theatre of war in the former Yugoslavia, hope is the prevailing sentiment as the presidency looks to the future. I believe that all of us - Council, Parliament and Commission - must face togeth er the task of strengthening and preserving the internal and external peace of the Union. Thank you, Mr Presi dent. (Applause) ",
        "1. 12.94 Debates of the European Parliament No 4-454/41 Flynn Flynn, Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I am very pleased to be able to join you and your colleagues this morning and my great regret is that because of a conflicting commitment with the Justice Council which is sitting today I shall not be able to stay for the full debate. I would like straightaway to compliment and thank Mr Coates for what I regard as a very sensitive and sensible contribution to focus us properly in this debate. I also wish to thank the Temporary Committee on Employ ment and its chairman, Mrs Villalobos Talero, for the very good and very constructive work which has been put into this report and the motion before the European Parliament. I should like to use this opportunity to emphasize that our strong and supportive resolution on employment comes at a crucial time for Europe. At the end of next week President Delors goes to Essen. He goes there to present the next stage in the Commission's contribution to the Community's action plan on employment and the con tents of that plan, with its emphasis on raising the employability of the workforce, increasing the employ ment intensity of growth, reducing taxes on employment, improving the performance of employment systems and targetting especially our young people. These aims have been focused and reinforced by the work undertaken by the European Parliament and we go to Essen not only with proposals for action but with proposals for a greatly enhanced planning process at Community level, mobiliz ing all of the Member States and the social-partners and building on the political support of the European Parlia ment. We go to Essen with renewed confidence. We have at last halted the rise in unemployment. Growth is back. It is back in the European economy and it makes our employ ment objectives more attainable. We are satisfied that the endogenous growth factors of productivity, competitive ness and profitability are all going in the right direction for a continuation of the growth pattern. But we are uneasy. There is a real risk - and it is based on the evidence of the last 20 years - that governments and others will be tempted to believe that we can ease off now, that we can ease off the pressure for structural change and put off the tough decisions that we collective ly know are essential if we are going to meet our objectives. Nothing could be further from the truth. During the late 80s, which is our most recent example and experience, we generated many jobs in this Union - some 10 million jobs - and these jobs were on a par with anything that was produced in the United States, but our structural employment weaknesses were such that only 3 million of those jobs went to the unemployed. The rest went to others, to new entries, to those who are effective ly unrecorded, the hidden, the unemployed and very often many of these were women. This means increased job creation must remain top of our agenda. And it must also remain at the top of all our policy decisions in the areas affecting our employment systems. The European Union is not poor. It is not poor in economic terms. We earn 30% of the world's income with a population of 7% of the world total. But we are poor in terms of jobs and we fail to translate our economic successes into jobs. So we have a very low rate of employment in Europe. Only 60% of our people of working age are in work, compared with 70% or more in the rest of the industrial world: in the United States, in Japan and in the new Member States joining our Union. If they can do it, the question has to be asked of us, why can we not do the same here in Europe. This is not just a numerical failure, it is a social failure. It is a failure in our modern societies and more and more people not only want to work but they need to work and our employment systems are failing to provide adequate access and opportunities for them. Some speak of the paradox of unemployed people along side unmet social needs. It is a paradox but it is not some uncontrollable natural phenomenon. It is a systems fai lure, a failure to transform the social incomes that help keep people involuntarily idle into incomes for doing useful work. It is a failure simply to translate growth into jobs. The work economy is the prime operational context for the distribution of wealth. Social welfare is inherently second-best and increasingly our social security systems are being put under enormous pressure to survive. So increasingly our social security resources and receipt of benefit must be related to and contingent on some action and made a positive support for the labour market. We need change. We particularly need to change the way the public purse is used. And we must protect the poor. It is our obligation to protect the poor and the weakest in society and we must defend the European approach to social justice. But we must also dramatically improve the effectiveness and the focus of our policy interventions. We simply need to reorganize ourselves to match the changes that are taking place all around us at this time. So we must also invest hugely in the future. Our education and training systems are no longer the envy of the world. Close to 5 million young people in Europe have virtually no qualifications and, not surprisingly, poor employment prospects. Indeed, over one out of every five young people are currently out of work and that is not the basis on which the Community should enter the 21st century. We are in danger of creating a lost generation of Euro pean citizens, young European citizens who are inactive and under-utilized. These are the people who could become the deprived underclass of our society. They would be the root cause of political and social unrest. This is something that must not happen and we must say that we will not tolerate the creation of a dual society here in Europe. President Delors is going to Essen. He goes to Essen with an ambitious programme and it is part of legacy from his years as President. It is also the challenge to the next Commission, to us who are staying on for the next five years and we must put priority on employment. We have to state it so that it is clearly heard and so that there can be no misunderstanding that in some way there might be an alternative. There is no other way. The priority has to be clearly enunciated and here is a good time to do it. We cannot let employment be the accidental outcome of other policy development. All our policy options must be tested against their social and employment impact and, where possible, they must be fireproofed against job losses. We know the scale of challenge. We know that we must create at least 15 million extra jobs if we are to halve the unemployment rate at the end of the decade. People say to me why 15 million? It is not the target we are talking about. The real point is that if you do not do this you cannot reach the situation where we have less than half our present unemployment rate at the end of the century. ",
        "No 4-454/42 Debates of the European Parliament 1. 12.94 Flynn So we estimate that of itself economic growth can at best bring about half of that reduction. In the White Paper we established the principles of a sense of purpose in pursuit of our goals. Now we are looking for further endorsement from the Member States on specific proposals and the political and planning process. Now I suggest is the real moment for decision. The weaknesses in our systems have been well identified and well documented over the past number of years. The analysis has all been done carefully and systematically focused. In a word the moment of truth has arrived for this Union and our continuing effort can be successful. It is a message of confidence that I would like to bring to Parliament today. We have the instrument and we are recommending the process. If we can bring together the commitment I have seen in the recent past and retain the commitment of this Parliament, we can do what we have promised the citizens of this Europe and bring about a change for the better insofar as our unemployment statistics are con cerned. (Applause) Green (PSE). - Mr President, the Socialist Group puts its full support behind the Ken Coates report. All the parties in our group went to the European elections in June this year with the first priority being the need to deal with unemployment within the European Union. There is not a family in Europe that is not affected by unemployment either through the direct experience in their own family unit or through the fear of unemployment. Perhaps that is the most debilitating feature of any family: the fear of unemployment and all that means for their life. So. our election campaign and our priority for the people of Europe was to deal with the issue with unemployment. That is why when we came to the new Parliament my group made its first initiative to set up the Temporary Committee on Employment. We are delighted that we have managed in the space of just a few weeks to put together a report, to send a message to the Council meeting at Essen. From this side of the House, we say to the Essen Council: please listen to the people of Europe. Listen! It is not good enough to send out soothing messages that things are looking better in Europe and if we just hang on and come a little bit further out of recession things will be even better. Employment is getting a bit better. It will be generated by the upturn in the European economy. It is not good enough for those soothing messages to come out of Essen and nothing more. Frankly, the people of Europe do not believe you. It does not match the reality of their daily existence on the ground. They know it is not the reality. They know the reality, even though perhaps not conceptually or in long-worded philosophical terms. They see what is happening in North America with NAFTA. They see America grouping together to support its own economy as a region. They see what is happening in Japan and the Pacific Rim and they know what happens in their own workplace when work patterns are changing, when work is being sent to other parts of the world and they know that in the long-term they cannot be sure of prosperity or even of long-term employment. The people of Europe expect a real response to that from the Essen Summit. They expect their governments work ing together to come forward with a proposal, with some action to deal with their major everyday anxiety. On behalf of the people of Europe we demand that response from the Council. We have the analysis. President Delors in his White Paper came forward with absolutely the right analysis. Even the British Prime Minister said it was an excellent analysis. So we know exactly what the situation is. We do not want to hear any more from the Council that it is just an excellent analysis. We want to see a real and appropriate response to the White Paper. We want a real commitment from the Council to move forward. We have heard from Mr Flynn this morning that the Commission goes to Essen with an action programme and he said growth is back. Growth in Europe is export- driven at this moment. It is what we have always wanted. Export-driven growth. Well, we have it. The developing countries developing as they are, and pleased as they are, are pulling Europe out of recession. In the meantime, within the European Union itself job creation remains sluggish, slow and Europe in its internal market, in its internal employment and job creation is still a very poor performer. We are told that the way to deal with this is, for instance, to have flexibility in the marketplace. We on this side support flexibility in the marketplace. But let us be clear what we mean by flexibility in the marketplace because one of the problems is, as ever, that terms are used to mean different things in different countries. When we on this side of the House talk about flexibility in the marketplace we refer to governments, to employers and to employees working together using all our strengths, using all our skills, to find an appropriate way to change work practices, to adapt work practices, to generate job creation in the European Union. By flexibility we do not mean simply deregulating and allowing the employers to have free rein over everything and to demean and undermine the conditions of the workforce in Europe. That is not what we in this Parlia ment will accept and it is not what the people of Europe want. It is not what they expect and it is not what they will accept. So, our message today is to the Council in Essen. Listen to the people of Europe. Do not just look at the analysis, act on it. You are going to have an action programme. The Coates report builds on the excellent analysis in the White Paper. I finish with perhaps the most important thing for all of us and that is our young people. As Commissioner Flynn has already stated, there is an underclass developing. It is crucial for the development and the future of the Euro pean Union that we make sure that our young people have a future, that our young people have hope. That is in our view the essential message that we need to come out of Essen. (Applause) Filippi (PPE). - (IT) Mr President, when, as one of its first acts, this Parliament decided to set up the Temporary Committee on Employment, it was for me, a new Mem ber with long experience of working with the trade unions, a source of great satisfaction. I saw in that decision the desire to place the fight against unemploy ment towards the top of Parliament's agenda. That is how the Group of the European People's Party interpreted the ",
        "1. 12.94 Debates of the European Parliament No 4-454/43 Filippi commitment in the Temporary Committee on Employ ment, and I therefore attach great importance to today's debate and the document we are preparing to approve. The Maastricht Treaty has laid down the criteria - predominantly economic and financial - for convergence for further steps towards European integration. It is my hope that through the document we are discussing - which will represent the position of the European Parlia ment at the summit of heads of state in Essen - an important stage will be achieved towards social Europe and that full employment will become an important parameter for assessing the level of internal cohesion. The substance and priorities of the document are not solely taken up with social issues; in fact, it is in the first instance proposed that structural measures designed to secure widespread and stable economic development should be adopted, failing which the objective of full employment is not feasible. The first issue raised in the document is that of making the European system more efficient and competitive by modernising infrastructure and mobilizing for that purpose greater public and private financial resources. Secondly, it is argued that at every level - European Union, the Member States and the regions - institutions must encourage the modernization of local economic systems by supporting innovation in existing enterprises, promoting new private and social entrepreneurs and supporting small and medium-sized undertakings as a whole. Clearly, those objectives will need to be backed by a consistent effort to push forward the process of European integration, by completing the internal market and extending economic and monetary cooperation between the Member States. But encouraging development and modernizing the economy is not enough if we are genuinely to create 15 million jobs by the year 2000, as proposed in the Delors White Paper; we need to apply more traditional policies concerning, for instance, the labour market, vocational training and working hours. Introducing greater flexibility into the labour market and vocational training are two sides of the same coin. Young people, women and the long-term unemployed remain our priorities. Improved use of the structural funds is the corollary and completes our proposal. Let me complete these general points on the substance of the document by emphasizing an issue which is only apparently one of methodology. I am referring here to the role that the economic and social forces can play in moving towards full employment. The quality of rela tions between the institutions and trade unions and employers' representatives is very important, as is, more generally speaking, the issue of economic democracy. If we consider closely events in the individual countries of the Union, we can - relatively easily - show that the quality of relations between and the ability to work together of trade unions, employers and governments, are directly proportionate to the results achieved. There is, for example, no doubt that in my own country, Italy, the improved results achieved at economic level coincide with a period of continuing consultation by the government with the trade unions and employers. Infla tion has fallen dramatically, social conflict has been reduced and the reform of the social state has been set under way without calling in question the fundamental rights of the workforce. It is that method, applied in recent years, which means that Italy is now able to make economic progress. That approach - which has, moreover, already been practised for longer still in other countries, should be applied to the whole of the Union, thereby achieving greater efficiency but also greater democracy for the purposes of solidarity. (Applause from the Right) Boogerd-Quaak (ELDR). - (NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, why is it so important for us to debate this resolution and the White Paper today? And why is it important for us to support paragraph 40? The European economy is arguably busy absorbing new impulses. We face enormous structural unemployment which manifest ly can no longer be offset by economic growth. Thus the whole of the labour market needs to be placed on a different footing. Taking due account, of course, in our Group's view, of the subsidiarity principle. We are living in an age of increasing individualization, but the law and legislative process are still too much geared to outdated visions of society. The standard employee, standard employer, standard company, these are less and less in evidence. If we are to address the problems realistically we need other measures, such as a more flexible labour market, a first and essential step. Our ideas on this run to flexible working time, flexible retirement ages, mobility and other forms of organizing labour, such as tele-working. One excellent way of introducing some flexibility is through \u00e0 la carte collective bargaining, where the social partners can play an important part and differentiation can be done on a clearly collective basis. I would be keen, though I realize this is a hot potato, to see greater flexibility too in social security arrangements. The need here is for the authorities to guarantee a socially accept able minimum whilst individuals and employers are given far more responsibility for social security overall. There is also an urgent need for labour costs, not net earnings, to be reduced, as Commissioner Flynn said. A number of labour cost cutting measures which are una voidable are a review of the social security system, the lowering of VAT on labour-intensive services. Our Group put down an amendment on this which will, I hope, find support. Labour costs might also be passed on to energy, consumption and other items. Lastly we would point to the importance of the entrepren eurial spirit and training to our economy and labour market. These two things need a lot of attention and encouragement. Desperate cases need desperate reme dies. Everyone knows that. We must square up to the job of change and renewal so that there is a real future for the young people of Europe. My Group will support those amendments which make such change and renewal possible. We hope the Council will now take action. Jov\u00e9 Peres (GUE). - (ES) Mr President, if the citizens of Europe support the construction of a united Europe, it is because they wish to find practical solutions to very real problems. And they would agree that unemployment is the number one problem in the European Union today. What is the European Union doing about it? In fact, it is up to the Member States to come up with policies capable ",
        "No 4-454/44 Debates of the European Parliament 1. 12.94 Jov\u00e9 Peres of absorbing unemployment, backed up of course by the coordination of economic policies. But what point is there in coordinating these policies if there is no proper approach to tackle unemployment? What kind of Euro pean economic policy could emerge from the coordina tion of the current rather unimaginative policies pursued by Member States? It is claimed that competitiveness can be achieved with measures that are resulting in greater job insecurity and the dismantling of social protection, but in fact all that is being achieved is the undermining and weakening of market and industrial relations and domestic demand. Moreover, the financial shortcomings of the European Union are obvious. Without a real European public investment plan, without a higher ceiling for funding involving loans and an upgraded European investment fund, we will be unable to cope with the situation. It is no good calling for the requirements of nominal conver gence to be met unless the proper instruments are made available to achieve real convergence. A number of these ideas are contained in Mr Coates' report, some explicitly and some implicitly. Yet the report has a number of deficiencies. To conclude, I would simply like to emphasise one amendment which summar ises the position embodied in most of the amendments put forward by the European United Left. The amend ment in question supports the position of the European Trade Union Confederation, calling for a reduction in the working week to 35 hours. Because of the structural nature of unemployment in the European Union, this is the path we should follow. It would change our outlook on work and leisure, and improve the quality of life for individual and communities. This must be the principle at the root of a new development model which would require fundamental changes in social relations in future. Garosci (FE). - (IT) Mr President, if we look at the first page of the Commission White Paper, the first thing we read is the question 'Why a White Paper?' The answer is contained in just one word: 'unemployment'. While we are aware of the scale and consequences of it, tackling it is difficult, as experience has taught us. All of us - the Commission, Council and Parliament - appreciate the problems involved in this task. It is for the House in particular, as the elected body, to respond to the calls of the people and citizens of Europe. What can Europe do to create more jobs? That, more than any other was the question put to us during the recent electoral campaign, and it is to that question, above all, that we have a duty to respond. The motion for a resolution that the European Parliament is proposing on employment policy and that the Essen European Council should adopt a few days from now, must provide an opportunity for endorsing the principles contained in the White Paper on Growth, Competitive ness and Employment. The motion for a resolution underlines the need to create a new development model which safeguards the atypical nature of the European social model characterized not only by market efficiency but a proper level of social protection. That particular approach seems slightly inconsistent with the White Paper, Chapter 10 of which clearly states that the need to fund social security systems will further increase indirect labour costs. In our view, the areas in which we need to focus action to speed up growth and create new jobs are mainly: reorgan ization of the public sector as far as the share of spending on GDP is concerned; transfer to the private sector of certain public utilities - post, telecommunications, trans port and energy - which could increase their own level of efficiency by introducing certain market mechanisms, decentralizing as far as possible control and administra tive responsibility; as far as the labour market is con cerned, further increasing efforts to reduce costs and enhance job flexibility, taking measures primarily in relation to taxation and contributions which place a burden on employment, substantially reducing it; increasing the flexibility of working hours, promoting agreements that reflect differing competitive circum stances, consumer needs and production techniques; increasing flexibility in regard to contracts of work by extending the range of contracts particularly in terms of the payment of contributions and employment protec tion; finally, improving systems of training and vocation al training by establishing closer links between industry and educational establishments, encouraging companies to provide further training at the workplace also. Those measures will, in particular, pay off in relation to what we are doing to help young people. We need, finally, to devote special attention to small and medium-sized undertakings. It is they that have in recent years created the greatest number of jobs. They have also grown in importance because, as a result of new produc tion techniques, the significance of economies of scale has been re-evaluated. Large companies have decentral ized certain activities abroad, and growth has been more rapid in the service sector, particularly in trade. Substantial problems remain, however - the low level of capitalization and a sluggish growth rate - the main causes of which are visible in an attitude, apparent in Europe, which is not always positive towards entrepren eurs. Lastly, if we are to overcome the problems of financing, it will be necessary to change taxation, improve informa tion on sources of external financing and increase access to the capital market. Industrialists are not asking to pay less tax but to pay it in a better way. That is why I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Coates, and the chairman of the Temporary Committee on Employment for their work. Both their and our work is devoted to one of the main objectives of the activities of the European Parliament: revitalizing the labour market. Guineberti\u00e8re (RDE). - (FR) Mr President, do we have to start a statement about employment by recalling that there are more than 20 million unemployed in the European Union? Is it really necessary to assert in a report on employment that Parliament has promised to create 15 million new jobs by the year 2000 with the help of the White Paper's remedies? Must we believe prom ises that bind only those who listen to them? No, the situation is not that simple and today we face an ever- increasing number of people who are excluded from society. Our concerns, at the start of the winter, are to find decent solutions for desperate situations. Our living standards are rising, but so is poverty. Employment is the result of growth, economic progress, and an entrepreneu- ",
        "1. 12.94 Debates of the European Parliament No 4-454/45 Guineberti\u00e8re rial spirit, but so is unemployment, it is the result of productivity, excessive social protection costs, trade and monetary policies, etc. This report presents a new action plan for Essen. Each group has input its ideas and tried to convince the others of its concerns. The rapporteur, Mr Coates, has not been idle. He has done a serious job and tried to unite the extremes. However, two concepts are put forward in this report as if they were truths. They are the idea of the efficacy of reducing working time and the idea that has been bandied about as the solution to all our woes, namely, a new tax structure. Nine million workers in Europe work more than 48 hours a week. Of course, if you include all the one-person companies, in which the bosses are responsible for production, sales, and administrative work at once, can we consider that time to be shareable? My country alone has one million such entrepreneurs who work alone. Give each of them a chance to hire an assistant and you will easily meet your targets. However, our labour costs are too high today. The solution is not to create new taxes on energy sources, CO2, capital, or property. Let's be reasonable. The committee's opinion on the European Community's economic policy is very cautious. Most of its members have expressed doubt as to the effects of this measure on creating jobs. Increasing indirect taxes will push wages up - we can be sure of that. And if Amendment No 49 were adopted, the RDE would have to abstain on this report. This report is intended for the Council, for Heads of State, who must be reminded of the simplest things, who must be asked to see far ahead and act close at hand. Looking ahead means setting up structural policies to maintain and boost growth by means of the right instruments backed up by sufficient financial resources. So, we approve of the idea of asking that the European Investment Fund be increased. Acting close at hand means implementing an active employment policy. We believe in employment if we can develop the social dialogue so as to make all those involved responsible for their actions and enable each person to participate in the company's choices and orientations. We believe in employment if the changes in working time are voluntary and discussed together and are flexible enough to allow for each person's particular situation. We believe in employment through reasserting Community market preference. We believe in employ ment through support for the entrepreneurial spirit of women, who have shown what they are capable of doing from North to South. Let us support local initiatives, for sources of new jobs are not only to be found in the services, but also by developing all the areas that our rush for cost-effective ness has caused us to neglect until now, namely, services for people, 'green' tourism, assistance for the elderly, and the environment in its widest sense. The use of the public resources that are spent on unemployment benefits must be improved. Small and medium-sized enterprises, like I said a moment ago, will grow in an environment that is favourable for them, that is, with investment aid, support for research, training and export aid. We know that to our shame we shall be called to account by the people for whom the employment policy has failed to open doors for so long that they no longer even bother knocking on them. Even if the States must be far-sighted in their employment policies, they must always be accompanied by action close to the people, for exclusion has no borders. IN THE CHAIR: Mr GIL-ROBLES GIL-DELGADO Vice-President Gyldenkilde (V). - (DA) Mr President, I should first like to thank Mr Coates, who has carried out a difficult piece of work in circumstances that were not particularly easy and under severe pressure of time. I would begin by saying that the number of unemployed people in Europe is now approaching 18 million. That includes all too many young people who have no hope of a finding a job and thus no hope or dream of a better future. This is nothing less than a social catastrophe for Europe, and it is likely to create social tensions of a kind that we have not seen for a very long time. The history of Europe shows us all what this can lead to. Action is therefore called for, and not just of the traditional kind, where growth and support for existing trade and industry occupied the leading role. A feature of European policy in the 1980s was an economy based on speculation, in which unproductive speculation was a growth area, while the creation of viable, environmentally friendly jobs which conserved resources was pushed into the back ground. The plans which are now being implemented from the White Paper have clearly placed the main emphasis on growth and competitiveness, reflecting a narrow line of thought regarding competition with Japan and the United States, while the main thrust of the job creation element has so far been directed largely towards motorways, bridges and airports, which in fact are not particularly labour-intensive. On the other hand, areas such as energy conservation, alternative energy, collective transport schemes and eco logy are clearly being given too low a priority in Europe, and these areas are actually highly labour-intensive. A green employment strategy in these sectors is what we in the Green Group are aiming at. We need a wide range of measures, and not just seven points, as in Mr Flynn's plan. Support must be given at grass-roots level to entrepren eurs and to small businesses that are innovative, energy- conscious and environmentally aware, quick to adapt to new forms of production and therefore also labour- intensive, otherwise we shall not create the number of jobs that are required. Billions are being spent to subsid ize passive support for people who are being excluded from the labour market. Let us come up with some ideas as to how this money can be used actively to create jobs in a variety of sectors, and indeed a number of fields are mentioned in Mr Coates' report, which I would say that we support, moreover. As regards research and training, we have to face the fact that if Europe is to compete, and that is what we have to do, like it or not, then it must be on the basis of a come-first strategy which builds on us carrying out research in Europe and having a lifelong provision for training, because adaptation is required. There are certainly plenty of jobs in the third labour market, which has been talked about a good deal for ",
        "No 4-454/46 Debates of the European Parliament 1. 12.94 Gyldenkilde many years now - the arts, culture, tourism, the environ ment and social sectors - if we can give some impetus to these areas. The policies which I have set out are what we think are required instead of flexible working time, widespread part-time work and deregulation of the labour market. That is not the way in which an enlightened Europe will move forward. It can only do so if young people are given hope and can dream of a better Europe - otherwise we shall lose the battle in Europe once again! Vandemeulebroucke (ARE). - (NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, all praise to Mr Coates and the coordina tors for this report. And I am not just going through the motions here. This report is the result of very intensive group work and it provides a useful opinion for the forthcoming Essen summit. A lot of active cooperation across political lines went into it. I should like to raise a few problematical points and enlist your support on them. Firstly, the report rightly says that it is no longer enough to promote economic growth alone and it stresses the importance of a policy for jobs instead. We are naturally pleased that the macro-economic trends are towards new economic growth. But that often means growth without new jobs. So pinning all our hopes on growth is not the answer. And growth must be adjustable to ensure that progress concentrates on quality not quantity. Secondly, the report is right to refute the idea that it would be enough to cut production costs in order to create more work. That idea is outdated; it is of course one way, but it is not the answer on jobs. Certainly when we look at the position of our Member States compared with the dynamos of South-East Asia. Employment is created there in conditions which smack of the 19th century to us. For that very reason the Sainjon amendment is very important. This advocates the introduction of a social clause to be applicable worldwide. Our Group also backs Mrs Boogerd-Quaak's amendment which seeks to extend these clauses to include criteria on living conditions. Conservative colleagues regard the Coates report as window dressing, but nothing is further from the truth. The Commission has just announced its new document on turning action on jobs into growth. This will be examined at the Essen summit. Commissioner Flynn sought to shake the Council out of its inertia by suggest ing five avenues for action: better training, a more intense strategy for jobs, a flexible labour market, lower labour costs, better labour procurement, a real policy on jobs for young people. Our report lends weight to the Commis sion position in the run-up to Essen. A word or two on some important amendments. First and foremost, a fundamental one. Work is not a privilege but a right, and this must ultimately be enshrined in the European constitution, this Sainjon amendment. Secondly, we are of course in favour of reducing labour costs but this must not be solely at the expense of consumption. In our view this would mean that once again it was the socially less well-off who suffered. We want to see the difference made up by further taxes on incomes and capital, and by the environmental tax. Our Group also rejects Amendment No 38 by the Christian Democrats which opposes any shortening of working time. We believe working time needs to be reduced, as evidence of new solidarity on our part: a redistribution of labour but also a better quality of life. That should be the message of Essen. Work as no longer a privilege but a right! Jensen, Lis (EDN). - (DA) Mr President, with unemploy ment soaring towards 20 million in the Union's Member States, we strongly support the exchange of ideas and information between sections of the labour market throughout Europe on how unemployment can be reduced. However, the People's Movement does not believe that the way in which the individual countries organize their labour markets is a matter for the EU. With 12 - soon to be 15 - different labour markets in the Union, there is no basis for joint Union initiatives, whether as regards vocational training, absorption pay ments for young people, the exclusion of older people or the much talked-about increased flexibility in the labour market. The fact is that, in our view, labour market policy is best handled by the individual Member States. To argue, as Mr Coates' report does, for more part-time work, temporary work and parental leave as a means of combating unemployment is, in our view - if you will excuse the term, Mr President - simply nonsense. Part- time work is a means of sharing unemployment among a greater number of people, but hardly of bringing it down. I would point out that for me, as a Dane, it is somewhat shocking to read a particular passage in Mr Coates' report, and I quote: '... the right to work is an inalienable right for every European citizen and must be enshrined in the future Constitution of the Union'. As a Dane, I am obliged to say that this is a constitutional right given to us in Denmark, and we in the People's Movement do not wish to see any right to work provided by the Union. Such a right must apply in the individual Member States, and this is very important for us. We feel that in this specific respect, the report goes too far. Some of the things said in the report about how the unemployment problem can be solved are close to the thoughts set out in the White Paper on growth, competi tiveness and employment. It therefore comes as no surprise that reducing labour market costs, especially those related to wages, is the main philosophy of the report. In a situation of high unemployment, it could well make a good deal of sense for individual countries to change the pattern of taxation, but the Union is not entitled to intervene in policies on tax and the distribution of wealth. These are and remain national concerns. The employment crisis which we have in the European Union, and which we have in Denmark too, is due first and foremost to a lack of demand and the economic policy being pursued. When the report calls for a marked reduction in base rates to boost an economic upswing, then the time has come to... (The President cut the speaker off) Le Pen (NI). - (FR) Mr President, unemployment is the most visible, if not the most serious, economic and social drama in Europe today. Twenty million unemployed according to official figures, probably more, not counting the 50 million poor. As there has been no proper analysis of the causes, all the solutions so far have been doomed to fail. Unemployment is a complex problem, but Mr Coates' report points only to the most superficial factors. Yet the causes are obvious if you look at the fact that not all countries are affected the same way. More than 10% ",
        "1. 12.94 Debates of the European Parliament No 4-454/47 Le Pen of the working population of Europe is unemployed. The figures are only 5.5% in the United States; 3% in Japan. Now, these countries both have light tax burdens and strong protection of their borders. This striking contrast sheds light on the analysis and dictates the solutions. The real and main causes of unemployment can be summed up in a couple of words: the massive influx of imports and immigrants and excessive taxation. Imports are destroying jobs in all sectors, especially in agriculture. In the name of what? In the name of free trade, which today is no longer a doctrine, but a dogma, a religion. It has ruined whole sections of trade, crafts and industry. In agriculture, the EEC and its CAP have wiped out twelve million small farmers over thirty years. Fifteen thousand young farmers started up in 1980. Today there are only 7 000. Jobs are being destroyed or are not being created. And when they do exist, they are taken by immigrants. In France, between two and four million jobs are filled by immigrants, as against 3.3 million registered unemployed. There would be practically no unemploy ment in France if it were not for the immigrants. Contrary to what is generally accepted, immigrants are filling more and more skilled jobs, for example, 7 500 of the doctors' posts in French hospitals. On top of that, the immigrant community costs France some 200 billion francs a year and accounts for social costs officially estimated at 74 billion francs in 1990, thereby increasing the tax burden still further. Europe is the continent of taxation, and hence of unem ployment. Taxation in Europe averages 41% of GDP, which is 10 points higher than in Japan and the United States. For example, over the past thirty years a 20-point rise in taxation in Spain produced an 18-point rise in unemployment. In Ireland, a ten-point rise in taxation produced a 13-point rise in unemployment. Taxes are stifling the economy and destroying jobs directly, by discouraging investment and work, and indirectly due to the weight of bureaucratic red tape, which is estimated to cost 100 billion francs a year in France. The massive tide of immigration and massive taxation - those are the enemies of employment. The solutions are obvious, without the ineffective gimmicks that have been proposed for the last twenty years. Until now, Europe's leaders have all opted for unemployment by doing away with the borders, letting immigrants pour in and increas ing taxes and other charges. We propose to bring about full employment by reinstating Community preference, in practice and legally, by applying the Treaty of Romei and using the own resource it provided, that is, customs duties. This does not mean closing our borders. There is a happy medium, a wise policy, between the 52% provided for in 1960 and the 17.5% collected today. Is it wise to make customs concessions to Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and the Emirates, when they are richer than we are? In reforming the system of generalized prefer ences the Commission itself acknowledged the mistakes it made... (The President cut the speaker off) Argyros (PPE). - (EL) Mr President, thank you for your understanding, since this is my maiden speech in this House. The Coates report not only bears witness to the importance the European Parliament attaches to the issue of employment, but at the same time increases the statutory validity of the Commission's action programme and facilitates its acceptance. And despite the differences I experienced personally on the Temporary Committee on Employment concerning certain specific points in the report, I too, along with my other colleagues, must congratulate Mr Coates on his serious and balanced approach to the subject. Mr President, I think it is important for this House to agree with the White Paper's central contention that development, competitiveness and employment are the three corners of an indissoluble triangle, and that action which supposedly combats unemployment but makes no contribution to increasing competitiveness and to speed ing up development, ultimately ends by increasing unem ployment itself. Such action as the inadequate provision of finance for jobs that are not really needed and cannot be sustained in the competitive conditions of the market. Slack financial management, whatever its short-term impact on employment, is a disincentive to investment, undermines the climate of competitiveness, and reduces still further the European Union's ability to create new and sustainable jobs. I believe that dealing with unem ployment is a high-priority objective that can certainly be addressed by speeding up the pace of economic develop ment. But that is not enough. This development must as soon as possible be made steady, rapid and self-sustain ing. I think the creation of new and flexible structures in the labour market could have important positive conse quences for employment. The labour market should operate in such a way that economic recovery has the greatest possible impact on employment. For that reason, it is important for the European Union to address the structural problems of the labour market. As a first step, existing rigidities should be done away with. I also think that the problems of the labour market and social policy are decisively influenced by the special characteristics of each Member State and by the historical context in which they were created. Among the plethora of specific and clearly perceptible social realities, I believe that despite the differences between them, there are areas to which the Member States ought to turn their attention. Those areas relate to the implementation of horizontal policies that will favour the development of small and medium-sized enterprises by creating the appropriate environment, improving information regarding the supply and demand in the labour market, and modernizing vocational training. I also appreciate that the European Union has an impor tant part to play in supporting the activities undertaken by the Member States. More particularly, I believe that the resources of the structural funds can contribute positively to economic and social cohesion, and thereby substantial ly promote employment. For that reason, I think the Commission ought to monitor the management of those resources closely, and ensure that they really are being used by the Member States to promote cohesion. Besides all that, however, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the problem of employment is a vital issue that affects the social partners themselves. And on that point I would like to highlight the efforts by the Commission and by President Delors in person, to create appropriate prerequisites so that the dialogue between the social partners will be continuous, consistent and sub stantial. However, the social partners themselves must also show appropriate zeal if that dialogue is to lead to ",

Van Lancker (PSE). - (NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope the Council presidency has grasped today that this European Parliament speaks on behalf of eighteen million unemployed, women and young people who are being marginalized and for whom we have to do something. There are no miracle solutions to unemploy ment and Mr Le Pen's xenophobic utterances are certain ly no answer. Nor is unemployment a natural law. If the Member States will only tackle unemployment with the same degree of conviction which they put into combating inflation and fighting for standards of convergence, we can have fifteen million new jobs by the year 2000. The finance ministers seem to forget that more work is the best way of reducing government deficits and it is thus high time, ladies and gentlemen, that the European Union approved some guidelines on employment. We want standards on employment as well as convergence. In President Delors' White Paper the European Union has a good starting point for a coherent policy of more jobs, but it has to be said that this splendid piece of work has not as yet left the launch pad. The Member States must face up to their responsibilities at Essen. The Union too has its part to play. Let me enlarge on three areas for action named in the Coates report. First and foremost, money has to work for us. You do not have to be a growth fetishist to realize that the envelope announced at the Brussels summit is very limited and even so the finance ministers are refusing to mobilize these funds. There is after all no dearth of money in Europe. The inequality of income between those who have to work to live, or do not even have that consolation, and those who live off capital has probably never been so great. Parliament adopted reports yesterday on the fund ing of trans-European networks and a European informa tion society. Well, let us hope that before the next summit we can approve a Council proposal on the financing of investment in the environment and an action programme for sustainable development. There is still plenty to do in Europe: housing, provision for the elderly, child care, training. That is why money in Europe needs to work. Secondly, we want a European social model with high employment and an equally level of high social protec tion. The reality in our countries is anything but that. Instead of working together, they are busy competing against each other. Labour is expensive, so wages have to go down. Social security is expensive, so cuts have to be made. Anyone who thinks about it knows that Michael Portillo's sound bites gloss overa huge group of working poor. Women who have to string together several part- time jobs, people obliged to work more than 50 hours a week in order to make ends meet at the end of the month. Europe needs to do something here, through social convergence, social guidelines. But we also want the Essen summit to relaunch the debate on a European property tax, on the carbon tax. That would at least enable the cost burden to be eased and shifted at last to capital and the environment. Thirdly, we attach importance to the redistribution of working time and leisure time. People want more than just work and a secure income. They want to live better too, they want more time for their own pursuits. In a number of countries, my own included, there is much discussion at present of a four-day week, of flexible working patterns, with sabbaticals, career breaks, etc. This project will also get bogged down if there is no European initiative. I realize that a European directive on a European collective labour agreement, a 32-hour work ing week, doubtless remains a pipe dream for the moment. But a framework directive on the redistribution of labour in a variety of forms could redistribute the work available and give people more freedom. I think that should feature on the agenda for Essen. So I do not understand the position of the EPP Group which would actually vote down a proposal put forward by one of its own members. We need an ambitious projects for Europe. An ambitious social project. We should work at it instead of trying to outdo each other through social or fiscal competition. Perhaps for some this resolution does not have enough new ideas. Parliament has repeatedly called for more social policy and more jobs. But if this project is so uncontroversial why not implement it? I hope this reso lution will at last impress it upon the Council that the Essen summit must not be a failure and that employment must have top priority there. If our views are again ignored today, Mr Delors, perhaps we should fill the chamber with the unemployed next time. Maybe their stories can persuade the heads of government better than we can. (Applause from the PSE Group) Mann, Thomas (PPE). - (DE) Mr President, the Tempo rary Committee on Employment today faces its first major test. We shall be judged on our ability to offer practical solutions in the fight against the scourge of unemployment and to insist on their implementation. Our message to the Council at the Essen summit is that the Member States' efforts to contain unemployment deserve respect and support. The signs of growth are encourag ing, but it is too early to sound the all-clear. Millions of people are still in search of suitable work. It is apparent that national exertions alone are not enough to achieve the aim of 15 million new sustainable jobs set forth in the White Paper. There is simply no alternative to a common European employment policy which does not ignore problem regions, which actively supports the social partners in their initiatives at EU level, which pools resources for cooperation in research and development and puts an end to the inefficient duplication of effort in these areas, which deters all efforts to engage in social dumping and which casts the future of the entire human and economic potential of the EU States into the balance. Qualified employees, with their knowledge, skills and working capacities, are one of Europe's trump cards. Some believe that the problem would be solved if the right to work and the right to training were enshrined in constitutions, even though the same people are well aware that no-one can guarantee such rights. The conse quences are frustrated expectations, a notorious breeding ground for political alienation. No, what we need are policies to secure work for the individual as an indispensable part of human life, policies unswervingly committed to the goal of full employment through programmes and concrete measures. Besides the seven agreed areas of labour-market policy, I believe that ",
        "1. 12.94 Debates of the European Parliament No 4-454/49 Mann, Thomas the main points of our statement for the Essen summit are as follows: - First of all, we seek a qualifications campaign for young and old in basic and further training. People who equip themselves for the future in this way can tackle the great technological challenges of our age with initiative and determination. Vocational train ing must come out of the shadows. We expect positive signals from the Council of Ministers in Essen that the Leonardo programme will be sup ported to the full extent proposed by the European Parliament. The best capital is and always will be human capital. - Secondly, we seek guaranteed fair competition for small and medium-sized enterprises, which continue to employ and train the bulk of the workforce. The objective is to provide them with scope to realize their innovative potential, to free them from bureau cratic red tape, to give them easier access to the European market and to expedite the realization of the Community initiatives Leader and URBAN. - Thirdly, we seek changes in working times, which is why we accept the idea of reductions, provided that the competitiveness of enterprises is preserved. Such changes must also, however, meet the wishes of the workforce and are therefore a matter for the social partners. The subject of part-time work cannot and must not be reduced to badly paid half-day jobs with which women are fobbed off. These women are at least equally entitled to skilled work in which they can find fulfilment. - Fourthly, we wish to uphold our European social model, which contrasts sharply with the ideas of cheap labour and limited protection of employees. Only action programmes aimed at securing sustaina ble and highly skilled jobs, as well as improved economic and social infrastructures and growth, have earned the EU seal of approval. The European Parliament should and will participate in such meas ures of active provision for the future. (Applause from the PPE Group) Gol (ELDR). - (FR) Mr President, part of my group will be unable to approve Mr Coates' report. I regret this all the more as its aim of restoring hope to the people of Europe by creating millions of jobs is a challenge that demands from us an enthusiastic and active response. However, I cannot approve the report for two reasons. Firstly, it does not put sufficient emphasis on the most effective means of creating jobs, such as competitive ness, reducing contributions and taxes, the flexibility of the labour market, and deregulation. Yet these are reme dies for unemployment that been put to the test and have done better than any miracle cures, the effectiveness of which remains to be seen. Secondly, the report contains some guidelines that I cannot approve. Notably, it pro vides for new fiscal measures such as ecotaxes, taxes on consumption and property taxes. These new taxes will destroy rather than create jobs. The report reflects an obvious conservative current by opting to maintain social security systems in their present form, whereas these systems have not only failed to solve the problems of poverty in many Member States, but are headed for bankruptcy and are destroying jobs. In a word, the report reflects, through what it omits and through what it contains, a socialist philosophy rather than a true compromise amongst the various currents of European thought. Ribeiro (GUE). - (PT) Mr President, we all agree that unemployment is the Community's number one problem. But when it comes to how to deal with this problem, we beg to differ sharply. A report such as this one must be the fruit of laborious work to emphasise what we agree on and reach com promises where we disagree. I must therefore compli ment Mr Coates on the way in which he has tried to fulfil a mission impossible so that, in time for Essen, the European Parliament can take a position for the attention of the Council - another mission impossible. A compromise was reached in particular between the political forces backing the White Paper already adopted by them, which they interpret in a sincerely or instrumen- tally over-optimistic fashion and those forces seeking to take the opportunity to advance further along the road of mercantile liberalization or mercantilistic liberalism in the labour market, taking as their excuse the argument that it is the way to foster the right conditions for potential investors to invest in job creation, as then they would be better compensated than if they take risks - so no more strikes, keep wages costs as low as possible, put a 24 hour limit on the working day, make people work 7 days a week, turn holidays into fiction or a mirage, do away with social security... We, on the other hand, want a less ambiguous comprom ise and want the position of the European Parliament to tackle the causes and not the consequences. We would like to see as few proposals as possible that merely bemoan the consequences and call instead for proposals aimed at finding a cure for the ill. The whole strategy and criteria for convergence are what have actually brought about those consequences and this strategy is being continued. And those criteria are still holding. All that this is doing is getting us in a vicious circle and making the serious effects of this strategy even worse. The economic recovery, the much publicised upturn, should not be turned into a demobilisation in respect of unemployment. Unemployment is not going to be solved overnight because of this recovery. Something is needed urgently: we need social intervention, and it is becoming increasingly urgent. Santini (FE). - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is now established practice in this Parliament to refer to the Treaty on European Union as the light that guides us, and this very morning many honourable Members have done just that. In fact, in Title VIII, Chapter 1, Article 117 provides that: 'Member States agree upon the need to promote improved working conditions and an improved standard of living for workers, so as to make possible their harmonization while the improvement is being maintained'. For a Community such as ours, which sets out to coordinate measures based on economic resources and their movement, that formula undoubtedly safe guards the dignity of the main player here and - monetary conflict, political controversy and convoys moving at different speeds notwithstanding - that continues to be the individual as he moves slowly and always with difficulty along the path of real progress. ",
        "No 4-454/50 Debates of the European Parliament 1. 12.94 Santini We have to ask how many of these sound proposals are applied daily at the workplace, particularly in relation to those who are disadvantaged, at risk even; those who have a right to work such as young people, the handicap ped, the elderly obliged to supplement inadequate pen sions by moonlighting and, in addition, foreigners, in particular non-Community nationals. Are we inquiring into their true conditions of work and pay are or are we content occasionally to launch certain programmes of support - for instance the Youthstart programme to support young people in their first jobs, the Leonardo and Socrates programmes to extend their train ing, the Helios II programme for the handicapped, Eurol- inkage for the elderly and so on - more or less to salve our consciences? What point have we then reached in achieving equality of opportunity for women, the disadvantaged and foreign ers? The European Parliament cannot bury its head in the sand given the increasingly serious problem that is worrying many governments in the Union: the large numbers of workers from outside the Community who enter Europe, largely illegally, organized and exploited by unscrupulous organizations which, disgracefully, take advantage of their hunger, recreating the spectre of a sort of slavery for the next century with the shame of chains that do exist although they are invisible. And then there are the seasonal workers from Eastern Europe who spend harvest-time in inhuman conditions, not only from the point of view of their contracts - frequently they have none - but also in terms of health and hygiene, crowded into dormitory stalls like animals. But setting aside those extremes, Mr President, which are not to be tolerated, there is undoubtedly also much to be done to bring into effect the much- extolled freedom of movement for the professions, mutual recognition of qualifications, equal pay and mutual recognition of full pensions. A great deal has been said about unemployment. But when it comes to the measures to be taken, there has always to be a proper relationship between benefit and pay to avoid encouraging forms of parasitism. Therefore, I ask the European Council to take into account at its forthcoming Essen summit those points also and not just the economic factors. Wolf (V). - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen of the House, as our colleague Mrs Van Lancker has said, we also have an ambitious social project, namely the transition to an alternative social model, to a new devel opment model as called for here by Jacques Delors. Full employment is possible, even today. Mass unemploy ment, mass impoverishment and the resulting erosion of the social security systems are a cancerous growth within the European Union but one that is still operable. Full employment, however, has a different meaning today than in the fifties and sixties. The role of man as the breadwinner and chief earner and of woman as the extra earner and housewife are now consigned to history, not least as a result of technological and organizational developments but particularly, and I address these words especially to my colleague Mr Mann, because of the campaigns of the feminist movement. Full employment today, therefore, presupposes a reduction in working hours in a manner that achieves an equal distribution of visible paid work and invisible unpaid work between men and women. Full employment and prosperity cannot be expected to materialize today as a mere concomitant of growth. The phenomena of 'jobless growth' in Europe and 'welfare growth' in the U.S. have demonstrated that clearly. The new development model is necessary, and we also need fundamental discussions about it. The Coates report is a good signal in the right direction for the Essen summit. Mr Coates has performed a superhuman feat here, for which we as Greens duly offer him our special thanks. We shall be backing this report. However, we shall also emphasize our own priorities by means of amendments, and above all we shall resist all attempts by Members from some corners of the European People's Party - I hope it is not the entire European People's Party - to erode the substance of this report, and we shall ensure that a clear signal is sent to Essen by this Parliament. Sainjon (ARE). - (FR) Mr President, work is a basic right for all European citizens, just like liberty and equality. Yet this right is being trampled upon. Close to twenty million men and women of all ages are reduced to unemployment. The White Paper had set the ambitious goal of creating fifteen million jobs by the end of the century. How far have we got? We could ask the same question about the policy of major infrastructure works. Someone has to be responsible for this delay and those responsible are to be found primarily in the conservative governments' camp. Mr Coates' report sets specific goals, but I am not sure that the Council will be guided by them in preparing for the Essen Summit. It may thank us for our excellent work, but what will happen to it afterwards? At this very moment I am thinking of the people, especially the unemployed, of all those who suffer because of the lack of social justice, because of unemployment and exclu sion, I am thinking of the human tragedies that strike millions of families and young people. That is why I feel it is crucial to show the public that here, in the European Parliament, there are women and men who are determined to break the chains of unemployment and show that there is nothing inevitable about the situation. This constant struggle is a civic duty, for the acceptance of unemployment can have disastrous conse quences for our modern democratic society. I turn to our governments to say to them: before you say 'no' to the suggestions and proposals concerning growth, living standards, working time, leisure time, and a new organization of labour, be more humble and listen to what the representatives of the people are telling you. Be willing to try out new ideas backed up by procedures for democratic worker participation. Don't neglect the SMEs, which are sources of jobs. Make progress in creating services for people, services for enterprises which, as we all know, are the main vectors of employ ment. Stop shilly-shallying about major infrastructure projects which, it is true, will create few jobs, but will help promote growth in Europe. If growth can resorb some of the cyclical unemployment, it will not solve the problem of structural unemployment. What is needed is a proper policy which dares, for example, to declare youth unemployment illegal in Europe. In addition to the necessary economic and social measures we must incorporate the right to work in the ",

Working for that simply amounts to restoring the image of a humanis tic Europe that is the guardian of people's rights to work. Berthu (EDN). - (FR) Mr President, the report of the temporary committee that was asked to give us an action plan for employment contains a certain number of gene rous ideas, but all of them are already well known and unfortunately not likely to help Europe get out of a situation of mass unemployment. For example, reducing labour costs by turning certain social contributions into taxes definitely will do nothing to improve companies' competitiveness, since they will be paying new taxes. And if companies do not pay them, individuals will pay them and their living standards will fall. We must not deceive ourselves. Similarly, it is not clear what sleight of hand will turn excessive indebtedness, which is a bad thing for a government, into a Community virtue, when any Community debt merely adds to the indebtedness of the Member States. The Temporary Committee on Employment, like all of our European societies, seems to have been caught in a trap with regard to all these issues and others, such as reducing working time. It is in the nature of global free trade to lead to a levelling down of wages and challeng ing our social models for better or for worse. And miracle cures that will allow us to keep the cause without having its effects have yet to be invented. In this respect, the as yet hypothetical social clause referred to in the Coates report is much too limited to be anything more than a satisfying intellectual concept. The only way to avoid the negative side-effects of free- tradeism is to reinstate Community preference, to put it bluntly, to introduce compensatory duties at the external borders to ensure that international trade once again reflects the cost of the indirect social damage sustained by European society. This will lay the new foundations for sound, endogenous growth. This reform is not, of course, a panacea. If we adopt it, it will not let us off liberalising our economies, privatizing our public sectors, reducing our taxes, or lightening our bureaucracies, including our social bureaucracies. But if we do not adopt it we will not be able to do anything and all the well-intentioned reports of all the employment committees will serve no purpose. Donnelly, Alan (PSE). - Mr President, first I should like to congratulate Ken Coates for an excellent report which has been produced in a very short period of time. I would like to take up the point made by Commissioner Flynn this morning. He asked the question why can we not have better job creation within Europe? Those of us who have sat in this House for the last few years and listened to the Council can give the answer to that question. The Council has still not recognized that the most productive investment for the Union is an invest ment in our own citizens. During this recession we have had to sit in this House and listen to the breathtaking indifference of minister after minister who have come to report on summit meeting after summit meeting between the heads of government. The only way this House should judge the Essen Summit, which will take place very soon, is whether it will lead to actions that will substantially reduce youth unemploy ment and whether it will lead to actions that will substan tially reduce long-term unemployment. If those actions are not forthcoming, we should judge the Essen Summit as a complete failure. It would mean that the Council and the European Union will have failed its citizens in the most important task, namely providing jobs for our people. If we simply have more wait-and-see complacen cy from the Council, that will be a disaster for our citizens. So, to show that Europe is really committed to coordi nated action at Essen, we need some clear signals. The first is the European Investment Fund. We could finance through joint public/private initiatives many of the things that are needed in the public and private sector to get our people back into work, to meet many of the unmet needs in the public sector, to help in hospitals and in schools, to get our people back to work. We could also give a commitment in the macro-economic guidelines which are published every year. In those guidelines, why do we not have a commitment to the creation of 15 million jobs? The Commission could put that in its own guidelines. Finally, I should like to say to President Delors that when he comes before us in December to give his final speech as President of the Commission we want him to give an honest assessment ofthat Essen summit meeting and tell us whether our political leaders have the political will to carry out this job. If they have not, we must report that back to the citizens of European Union. (Applause from the PSE Group) Thyssen (PPE). - (NL) Mr President, a lot has happened since the Delors White Paper. The economy has begun to pick up and Member States and social partners have taken effective steps which promise results. But more is needed. Action at Community level in particular is lagging behind and is in danger of losing credibility. It is not so much the Commission which is disappointing, despite our criticism of its management of the ESF which creates a disincentive rather than an incentive thanks to lumbering bureaucracy, and despite its total inconsisten cy over SMEs and social dialogue. We are disappointed above all by the Council. It has, happily, drawn up economic guidelines for a sound long-term macro-econ omic policy but is proving slow to shoulder its responsi bilities over employment. It approves the idea of the trans-European networks but will not give any commit ment regarding the necessary funding. It says that indi rect labour costs have to come down, but will not take the lead when it alone can set the criteria which will make everyone else follow the correct line. Decisions have to be taken at Essen, or the gulf between statements of intent and actual decisions will be too wide, and Europe will lose credibility. The time for decisions is now. People have to have some prospects otherwise we shall slide into a two-tier, fearful society which will turn away from democracy itself. So we need fast decisions along the lines of the White Paper and this report. An essential feature of the report is concern for a competitive and high-performing industrial sector. A fair chance for small businesses. A redistribution of labour, though not general and across the board, and certainly with an eye to and in combination with flexibility and the cutting of indirect labour costs, good training, a high but effective level of social protection and involvement of the social partners. ",
        "No 4-454/52 Debates of the European Parliament 1. 12.94 Thyssen This is the way we must go. The time for decisions is now, and this is my message to the Council. Parliament has worked hard to make a unanimous appeal to the Council. An appeal to make work into more work. I hope we shall be heeded. Dybkj\u00e6r (ELDR). - (DA) Mr President, I should like to highlight one of the points in Mr Coates' report, namely paragraph 11, which refers to the need for environmen tally, socially and economically sustainable development and calls for the development of an action programme based on Chapter 10 of the White Paper. I would call on President Delors to put all the Commission's weight and commitment and his own prestige into its involvement in the Essen Summit, with a view to securing the adoption of a sustainable action programme which is geared towards the future. If this aspect of the Union's work does not succeed, then half of the objective of the Treaty of Rome, in other words the creation of prosperity for our citizens, will not have been fulfilled, and we shall not receive - and rightly so - the kind of popular support without which the Union has no meaning. Mr President of the Commission, we expect a great deal from your involvement in the Essen Summit. Do all in your power to achieve a result in this area! If necessary, create a crisis situation, if it appears that success will not be forthcoming. The people of Europe will back you up. They know from their own experience the result of any lack of effort. We expect a great deal of you at the Essen Summit, President Delors. Bertinotti (GUE). - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentle men, the debate that is taking place on the work of the Temporary Committee on Employment and the Coates report is certainly of major importance. The problem of mass unemployment is the main problem of our times, and it may also be said that European civilization itself at risk for as long as this mass and structural unemployment persists. For that reason, we ought perhaps to be more aware of the huge and tragic gap between what we are discussing here and the actual policies applied by governments in Europe, policies which aggravate rather than alleviate the problem of unemployment. I also think that there is a shortcoming in the White Paper itself where the problems of employment are concerned: the 15 million jobs referred to will not, in my view, come into being simply by placing the accent on material infrastructure and job flexibility while undervaluing two factors that are crucial to tackling unemployment - the environment to be perceived as a resource for new development and a reduction in working hours. In Europe there are now signs of an economic recovery. That confirms, on the basis of practical experience, the argument that has been put forward here: during periods of crisis, recession and restructuring, unemployment is created, and the recovery is no longer able to remedy unemployment or even made small inroads into it. We need a radical change in economic social policies, but for this to happen we need an incentive and a guideline. It is our view that an across-the-board reduction in working hours could provide that incentive and guide line, with the same pay so that this policy can be constructed on the basis of protagonism, initiative and paid employment, the relationship of which with the new generations, environmental forces and the unemployed may constitute the fundamental resource for Europe. It must be across-the-board because nowadays a segmented policy of reducing work is no longer feasible. For that reason, 35 hours with equal pay should be firmly included in the action plan we are discussing. Paisley (NI). - Mr President, at Essen the Council will be considering a proposal from the Commission concerning a special programme for Northern Ireland. This region has one of the worst unemployment records in the whole of the European Union. Northern Ireland welcomes and is grateful for President Delors' initiative and his consult ing with the three MEPs from Northern Ireland about this vital matter. It is essential that money coming to Northern Ireland is seen to be absolutely additional and is targetted to projects which help to alleviate the unemployment pro blem. To get the people back to work must be a top priority and support for Northern Ireland's economic infrastructure is essential to this end. I welcome every proposal which can help to cure the unemployment plague both in Northern Ireland particularly and through out the rest of the European Union generally. Hughes (PSE). - Mr President, like Mr Donnelly before me I should like to concentrate upon one aspect of the problem we face, namely the lack of action by Member States. The follow-up by Commissioner Flynn to the Delors White Paper highlighted the sloth of the Member States in seeking to tackle the strategies they had agreed in that White Paper. It really is not good enough that the Member States have sat back and waited for that old economic cycle to grind around. As the Coates report makes clear, that has never been enough and will not be enough in present circumstances. Nor is it good enough that they have repeatedly hampered our attempts to improve the situation. I will give just two examples of that. First, we have worked hard on legisla tion, and we could do even more, to improve fair flexibility through that avenue, perhaps work on job rotation, on work-sharing, on training leave or other measures. But what is the point when important direc tives such as those on the posting of workers, on atypical work, on parental leave lie blocked year in and year out in Council. Another example: we worked for months with the Com mission to devise new structural fund regulations, new Community initiatives designed to concentrate upon skilling and re-skilling, on investment in our most impor tant resources, our human resources. But what have the Member States done in response? Most of them have either frustrated the use of those funds or diverted and distorted them to their own ends rather than those they were designed to achieve. This is a terrible situation. Commissioners Flynn and Christophersen and President Delors have all highlighted in recent months the woeful inadequacy of the response of the Member States. I agree. In this action plan we are asking them to adopt, the emphasis has to be on the word 'action'. They have to stop merely paying lip service to the fight against unemployment. They need to get on with their job to give our people the jobs they need. Chanterie (PPE). - (NL) Mr President, ladies and gentle men, first of all my thanks and compliments to the ",
        "1. 12.94 Debates of the European Parliament No 4-454/53 Chanterie rapporteur on his excellent work and his report. May I say to the Presidents of the Commission and Council that Parliament is once again, and rightly, making the point today that unemployment is an issue of absolutely central importance to the European Union. It is good that we are looking at it once again. The European Union must find an answer to mass unemployment and in so doing prove that it has the will and the ability to bring about not only an economic and monetary union but also a social union, to create a society in which everyone gets a fair crack of the whip. In other words it must guarantee the European social model which is based on a market economy sensitive to ecological and social concerns. I want to focus on three main points in the time available to me. One: flexibility; two: the redistribution of labour, and three: the reduction of labour costs. On flexibility, I am convinced that this will benefit employers as well as workers. Assuming, that is, that the debate is not confined to the issue of working time and the organization of work, but that attention is also given to supporting measures and guarantees of social protec tion. The Social Affairs Council of 6 December will be very important in this regard. Shorter working time can only be structurally beneficial in the fight against unem ployment if the competitiveness of the company and the social protection afforded to its employees are not jeopar dized. This means that blanket measures would be wrong and that a differentiated approach is needed to take account of the wishes of the workers and the specific nature of the sectors and companies concerned. I shall not dwell on the question of cutting labour costs, though I would like to make the point that in my view the strategy for economic growth, competitiveness and jobs will only work if the current impasses at various levels within the Council of Ministers are resolved at the Essen summit. That is the message we need to send from here to Essen. Haarder (ELDR). - (DA) Mr President, this report will not do any harm, but nor will it do a great deal of good. It is of the traditional kind, setting out a series of proposals which some countries have already tried, which have not been particularly successful and which the European Union neither can nor should become involved with. Some of the proposals increase taxes, others increase the degree of regulation by the authorities, but taxes and regulation are precisely part of the European unemploy ment problem. Unemployment in Europe is twice as high as in the United States and three times as high as in Japan. This is due neither to technology nor to competition from low-wage countries, but to the fact that we have built up welfare states which have unfortunately become too costly, too burdensome and too inflexible. The countries of Europe have become elephants with feet of clay. We must learn the art of making the welfare state less expensive, without creating greater social divisions. We must ease taxes for the lower-paid and on services, thereby strengthening the competitiveness of the work force. We must combat any lack of flexibility in the labour market, whether this stems from the authorities or from trade unions, which unfortunately are often far too traditional in their thinking. We must encourage innova tion and provide better opportunities for small and newly created enterprises, so that more young people have the inclination and the opportunity to set up in business for themselves. I agree with the Liberal spokesman who said all this and who defended these views in committee, but it was hard to gain acceptance for them, given the tendency of the Socialist Group, in particular, towards traditional ways of thinking, and therefore some of us will be abstaining in the vote. Malone (PSE). - Mr President, I welcome the Coates report but I represent an area of Ireland, Dublin, where there is 20% unemployment. So you will understand that this is my overriding concern as a politician and as a Member of this Parliament. In areas of Dublin there are pockets where there is 70% unemployment: areas like North Clondalkin, Neilstown, Tallaght, Darndale, Bally- mun, Blanchardstown. I could go on but the point is that people will probably never even know that we debated this issue here today or that we prepared a report on unemployment because they have opted out of the sys tem. Many of them do not vote and they do not have any faith in politicians or in political institutions to solve their plight. I think we have a moral and political responsibility in Europe together to tackle this problem of unemployment and to keep it as our overriding responsibility until it is solved. There is no point in having the so-called econ omic fundamentals correct if the most important of these is still too high. The Maastricht Treaty lays down admirably low targets for inflation and other economic indicators but says nothing about unemployment. This is not acceptable and I would strongly agree with the proposals to incorporate the right to work into the future constitution of the European Union. I am not impressed at all by soothing noises coming from some governments who say that when the recession is over all will be well. I call upon the Council now as other speakers have done to take action upon the principles outlined in this report and in the White Paper. I find it incredible that the European Council is apparently unwilling to follow through on past promises and to adopt a coordinated European approach and to finance the White Paper. I will end by saying that I wish our own President well at the Essen Conference as I do President Delors. Like Alan Donnelly I am looking forward to him coming to the part-session in December and reporting favourably. It is probably the last chance we shall have in Europe to get this right. Pronk (PPE). - (NL) Mr President, we currently have a German presidency and as you may know, the word Essen in German means a meal or eating. There is also a German proverb which says that one can only be high- minded on a full stomach. So we should not expect too much of Essen. High-mindedness will come later. I feel rather like that about this summit. People always talk a lot about what a summit should and should not do, and in the end it produces far less than we had expected, especially on a subject as difficult as employment. I still believe that the main responsibility for creating long-term competi tive jobs in the European Union rests with the social partners. Mr Filippi has rightly said that in those coun tries where a lot of emphasis is put on the issue, jobs have been created, whilst in countries were such emphasis is not given,jobs have not been created. The Netherlands is a very interesting example in this regard. In recent years, in the eighties, a lot of additional jobs were created, in ",
        "No 4-454/54 Debates of the European Parliament 1. 12.94 Pronk some respects approaching the US level. Sadly we must now fear that the trend will be totally reversed, since the aim is to do everything through the Government and there is little confidence in the social partners. I am willing to bet that we shall see employment levels in the Nether lands lagging behind those in the rest of the Union thanks to this policy. Authorities can do something. The Union can do some thing, Member States can do something but it is also very important, I think, that the report points out that local authorities can do something. It is striking that far more jobs are created in one local area than in another. We need to bear that in mind. Only in this way can we perhaps grope our way towards a solution. Kestelijn-Sierens (ELDR). - (NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in his report on a proposed action plan on employment policy Mr Coates says that policy to support the small and medium business sector is most important. I fully agree with that. For that reason I want once again to commend to the House the amendment to paragraph 22 put down by my Group, the European Liberal, Democrat ic and Reformist Party. This says that the VAT rates on labour-intensive services should be lowered. Specifically we want the scope of Annex H to the 1992 VAT directive to be extended to include certain occupations and trades, e.g. those in the construction industry, vehicle mainten ance and repair, shoe manufacture, to name just a few. The sectors in question would welcome a reduction in VAT. By moving towards a lowering of the rate the Commission and after it the Council would be giving a signal that they favour real measures to stimulate employment. Because the trades and services make a very real contribution towards solving the problem of unemployment. I would urge the House, on the occasion of this debate, to be mindful of that. Van Velzen, Wim (PSE). - (NL) Mr President, the documents we have been getting from the Commission in the last few days place great emphasis on education and above all on the poorly skilled. That in itself is quite proper. But I find no reference to the problem once mentioned by Commissioner Papandreou, namely that we have in Europe people who have been retrained six or seven times but still have no work. In some cases we can blame this on gross wage costs which are allegedly too high, but in other cases jobs are axed, often by authorities, or automated so that companies make a saving and authorities incur a cost. But there is a further cause which is not mentioned in the documents. This is that low-skill jobs are often taken by people with a higher level of training. Of every five jobs available in my country to people with basic training, four of them are filled by people who are overqualified for those jobs. The answer to that problem is not initially to create new jobs at the bottom end of the market but to create new high-skill jobs. That is important because the White Paper wants the Union to strengthen its competi tive position worldwide, through quality and high-level expertise and not through lower-grade jobs. It is a paradox that Member States are busy making cuts in higher education and universities, arguing that they have to abide by the criteria for EMU. It seems that there will be no early end to this kind of debate because now that the EMU standard of 3% has ben approved in my country, for example, we find Mr Hans Tietmeyer, President of the German Bundesbank, announcing that he thinks the figure should be 1% and at most 1%. I hope the Council will be wiser and realize that unless a reviving economy benefits people there is not much point to it. I hope, finally, that the Council will pay more attention to the added value of a collective approach at European level, because up to now all that has been mentioned is a range of individual measures and no common line is discernible. I wish the President good luck. Mather (PPE). - Mr President, there are many areas of Mr Coates' report which I would like to commend: the focus on emerging areas of work, especially where the private sector will be taking over from the public sector; the need to bring costs and skills to world competitive levels. But there are also some which I fear British Conservatives would not be able to endorse so warmly. The addition of social clauses to international treaties is one. The suggestion that central banks should reduce interest rates is playing with fire, given the dangerous risks of inflation and growth getting out of control. In the end this loses jobs when that boom has to turn to a policy-induced recession. We would also be nervous about any attempts to share out jobs through changes in working time. Our model is much more of the creation of new jobs which are sustainable rather than attempting to share out some finite number of jobs by artificially restricting working time. It is also an obvious matter for concern to us that this report would urge the passage of directives on the secondment of workers and on so-called atypical work. The reality is that in the United Kingdom only one in ten of the 300 000 new jobs created in the last two years were traditional full-time jobs. Nine out of ten of those jobs were so-called atypical. They were part-time, they were self- employed. It is very dangerous to suggest that we can artificially level up terms and conditions to the equivalent of full-time and expect those jobs to continue to be created. It would be a very dangerous risk. It is a risk which, on the evidence, we cannot take. So, whilst commending some aspects of Mr Coates' report, I fear that they are slightly outweighed by the list of downsides I have given and in those circumstances my colleagues will be abstaining on the report. Celiai (NI). - (IT) Mr President, the Coates report appears to us to be in substance general and somewhat vague. Yet again, there is the risk that so many - perhaps too many - words will go on to produce only a few real actions. We actually believe that deeds are absolutely necessary for employment as a whole, at the level of both employers and employees. Our hope of Essen is that it will finally produce a truly effective approach to relaunching as well as safeguarding employment policy, because we believe that that protec tion has not actually been provided, the fact being that from the White Paper of the Brussels European Council a year ago to Corfu in last June, there has, unfortunately, been largely no, or at least inadequate, combined action decided upon to resolve the very serious employment crisis: the average rate of unemployment in the European Union is around 11 % and therefore far worse than that in the EFTA countries, the US and Japan. ",
        "1. 12.94 Debates of the European Parliament No 4-454/55 Celiai Essen should not therefore produce mere declarations of intent but real decisions. I am thinking here, for example, of the need to identify specific targeted tax relief; I am thinking of increasingly clear support in decisions relat ing to small and medium-sized enterprises, cottage indus tries and agriculture. I think, basically, that improving vocational training, flexible working hours, combating long-term unemployment and the use of policy resources and those of the labour market are not in themselves sufficient and have to be accompanied by a review or, at any rate, a re-evaluation of certain decisions on the service sector - referred to in the White Paper - and, at the same time, an awareness that it is absolutely vital that both sides of industry accept their own responsibility in terms of cooperation between all groups involved. Crowley (RDE). - Mr President, the single greatest issue facing the European Union at the Essen Summit is how to create jobs for the millions of young people, women and long-term unemployed, many of whom are excluded from society by their unemployed status. I would like to welcome Mr Coates' report even though there are some parts which I do not agree with. There is no easy fix solution. Instead we must look to a wide range of actions to be undertaken by the Member States and the European Union acting together. In tack ling unemployment we can also help to deal with other major social issues affecting society such as crime, drugs, homelessness, poverty and the consequent additional social costs that have to be borne by the Member States. The Commission's White Paper on competitiveness makes an important contribution to the debate and, in particular, I endorse the emphasis on small and medium- sized enterprises. I would stress also the role of very small enterprises and the self-employed in creating jobs and the need for positive actions to support their efforts. The role of the structural and cohesion funds in countries such as Ireland are crucial to employment creation as are the new Community initiatives such as Leader, URBAN and the SME initiative. The European Investment Fund can make a positive contribution to tackling unemploy ment provided its borrowing limit is increased from the proposed ceiling of ECU 8 billion. There is scope for job creation in a number of emerging employment areas such as the caring services, the envi ronmental sector, tourism - and no better location for tourism than my own area of Cork - the leisure, culture and audio-visual sectors, all of which must be supported. I would also highlight a further initiative in the White Paper, namely the local issuing of vouchers by employers and local authorities which can be exchanged for local services instead of providing social services. Ways of bringing down non-wage labour costs, particu larly at the unskilled end of the labour end of the labour market, must be studied very carefully. I am not con vinced that some of the fiscal measures being proposed such as environmental taxes, taxes on natural resources, capital, consumer products and energy are the best options. Look at the uproar in Britain recently regarding the increase on VAT on fuel which will certainly serious ly hurt the elderly. The proposal for a European property tax is totally outside the competence of the Union. I am concerned that a carbon tax would have a detrimen tal effect on the cohesion states. We must protect the competitiveness of energy-intensive firms that face com petition from firms that are not liable to similar charges. My own country has an almost total dependence on fossil fuels. Most Member States have expressed doubts as to the effect of shifting the burden of social security contri butions in part to a C0 2 energy tax or other indirect taxes. We must all work together - national governments, European Union and local authorities to rid the Union of the scourge of unemployment. It is only by innovative ideas and new vision and new thinking that we can create that proper formula. Bontempi (PSE). - (IT) Mr President, I think that great credit is due to the Delors White Paper and to President Delors himself for ambitiously defining an identity and a common approach far more forward-looking than anyth ing our states have generally been able to express. That does not mean that there are no contradictions and limitations, but it does mean that this series of measures, instruments and approaches provides us with a sufficient ly ambitious task. What then is our function now, prior to Essen, avoiding attaching excessive importance to that occasion, although we know it represents an important step? It is the function that we are performing via the Coates report also of identifying the inconsistencies between the White Paper and the conduct of the Member States. Let us take an example: the flexibility of the labour market. Setting aside the fact that there is already much such flexibility, it is frequently interpreted as complete deregulation of the labour market. For example, in Italy, where we already have that flexibility, it means rejecting the social dialo gue and social relations. And that is a very dangerous factor, as has already been pointed out. Let me mention two other points which I consider essential. One is a matter of perspective: competitiveness to the point of becoming so short-sighted as to fail perceive that only if there are limits to this concept - which is becoming an ideological issue - will we be able to practise solidarity inside and outside Europe. The second concerns the model of environmental restruc turing of the economy to which the White Paper devotes substantial coverage and to which I would ask that much attention be paid. The replacement of the environment tax, taxes on employment and capital are strategic fac tors. Finally, a subject very dear to Jacques Delors and to which I would draw attention is the importance of the local element, that is the association factor and the need for proximity. There is much to be gained here; its importance consists in the fact that it involves not only the market or public authorities, it can also provide a substantial boost to the re-establishment of social cohe sion. McCartin (PPE). - Mr President, it is entirely appropriate that we should be discussing this problem at this time as it is the greatest problem facing the Union. On the other hand, we could do some damage to the cause by creating the impression that we at the level of the European Union have all the solutions to the problem. It should be understood that we work with a broad brush in Europe and we work over a longer time frame. We have created the single market. We have made it work more efficiently. We have freed up the labour ",
        "No 4-454/56 Debates of the European Parliament 1. 12.94 McCartin market to the extent that there is freedom of movement for workers. There are some things we can do. We have developed a decent regional policy for the poorer regions. But there is no guarantee that these things can be translated into jobs and the Member States still have in their own hands all the competences that are necessary to resolve the problem as it stands today: the competence to deal with taxation; the competence to deal with the educational system; the competence to deal with social welfare and, above all, with the levels of taxation in the individual Member States. These are the things which in the end will determine the levels of employment or unemployment and whether economic growth can be converted to employment. In the country I represent where we have one of the most serious problems in the Community, I would like to point out that through the regional policy we have succeeded in getting accelerated economic growth. But we have not converted that growth into jobs because government taxation and current expenditure is rising much faster than economic growth can justify. By increasing the costs of labour we are depressing opportunities for employ ment and we are reducing opportunities for investment by our high taxation policies. Therefore, let us not in the end create a situation in which the Community will become a scapegoat for the failures of Member States. If we create the impression here that we at the level of the Union can solve the problem, there is absolutely bound to be disappointment. We can do some things but we cannot do everything. IN THE CHAIR: Mr MARTIN Vice-President Seal (PSE). - Mr President, like other speakers I should like to thank Mr Coates and other people on the Tempo rary Committee on Employment who have worked so hard in producing this report. There is no doubt that unemployment is the scourge of our modern society and it is only going to be fought if we take some positive action. Like Stephen Hughes and others, I urge the Council to follow Parliament's action plan. With unem ployment approaching 20 million, Member State govern ments must realize that their policies are not reducing unemployment. Modest growth may be taking place but unemployment is still rising and increased growth alone will not reduce unemployment. It can only be reduced if we have the political will. If we stop thinking only about reducing inflation. We have to change our priorities and make reducing unemployment the top priority. Ken Coates when he addressed Parliament described the misery that unemployment brings, misery and despair which should be unacceptable to all our governments and which affects 20 million families not just individuals. In my constituency, as in others, the lack of hope amongst young people particularly is heartbreaking. In addition to this misery, there is the enormous cost of unemployment and it is not just the cost of benefits. There is the cost of increased crime because there is a proven link between increased unemployment and increased crime. There is the cost of increased health care because there is a positive correlation between increased unemployment and increased health care provision. And there is a cost of increased racial tension because unemployment is high est amongst our ethnic minority groups. Fifteen million new jobs must be our priority. We must support the Delors White Paper. We must support the creation of a European Investment Fund. And the first step must be to support the Coates report. Stasi (PPE). - (FR) Mr President, I should first like to make a general remark. If we cannot resign ourselves, if we are not prepared to resign ourselves to having twenty million unemployed within the borders of the European Union, it is first of all, of course, because of the human misery that unemployment involves for the individuals and families affected. It is also because the financial cost of unemployment weighs heavily on the economy, wea kening it and making it more vulnerable, and thus making job creation more difficult. This is a vicious circle that may become increasingly difficult to halt. If we must mobilize all our forces to reduce unemploy ment significantly, it is also because the current situation is very damaging to the image and influence of the European Union in the eyes of the citizens of its Member States as well as in the eyes of the whole world. The European Union wants to be a model, a social model, founded on democracy, a market economy, a certain level of social protection and a certain level of prosperity that is distributed fairly. The number of people who are excluded from the labour market seriously discredits this model at a time when our world, which is prey to all sorts of doubts and turbulence and grappling with war, oppres sion and poverty, needs this model more than ever. I should like to add that this morning, in the course of which we shall discuss, in succession, the tragedy of unemployment and the tragedy of Bosnia, we are truly confronted by Europe's two most serious failures. These failures must not, of course, undermine our determination to pursue European integration. On the contrary, they demand that we make even more vigourous efforts to strengthen co-operation among the Member States and to increase the powers and resources of the Union's authori ties. I should now like to raise a specific issue. There is a broad consensus in favour of lowering non-wage labour costs, especially social contributions, which weigh heavily on low wages, but there is also a broad consensus against lowering our level of social protection, which contributes to the European model. Alternative taxes must thus be found. The Coates report advocates creating environmen tal taxes. I do not contest the need for measures to protect the environment, but social protection must be backed up by stable financing. If ecotaxes achieve their stated objective, that is, if they manage to reduce pollution, the revenue they generate will decrease, whereas the cost of social protection will not. We might thus consider a tax on imports from countries with low levels of social protection. Besides offsetting the handicap imposed on European undertakings because of the cost of our social protection, this tax could help fight under-development in the world if a portion of the revenue generated were paid into a fund to help developing countries. Cabez\u00f3n Alonso (PSE). - (ES) Mr President, this is not the first time that this House has discussed employment, nor will it be the last. The question of how to solve the unemployment problem divides us in this House, and we are certainly divided on how to establish an order of ",
        "1. 12.94 Debates of the European Parliament No 4-454/57 Cabez\u00f3n Alonso priorities to cope with this problem. But, above and beyond these differences, which are both real and natural, the vast majority of Members of this House can agree that we do not want unemployment to become irreversible. We can also agree that there are no magic cures for this serious problem. On this occasion, we in the special committee appointed to examine this issue have tried to send a clear signal to the next European Council in Essen. Mr Delors' White Paper sparked off a public debate and we are confident that this report - for which I wish to congratulate the rapporteur - can take its place among the possible solutions to the complex problem of unemployment in Europe. We are emerging from the economic recession and our economies are beginning to grow. While the employment issue was our top priority during the depths of the recession, our main concern now must be to ensure that every European citizen of employable age has a job or occupation. But, in view of the current levels of unem ployment, it would be wrong to see economic growth as a panacea. In addition to economic growth, there must be competitiveness and rigorous structural reforms which, as far as possible, must be agreed between the social partners. Governments must set in place the conditions required to boost employment. The social partners - employers and trade unions - must conclude agreements to ensure more jobs on the labour market and keep inflation under control. We are in a position to benefit from technological developments, invest in human resources and take advan tage of the potential emerging from new infrastructure, environmental action and support for research and devel opment. There is nothing more threatening to the balance of our societies than unemployment, and nothing which will lead more quickly to marginalisation rather than integration. Unemployment prevents people from taking up genuine opportunities to play an active part in civil society. Growth, competitiveness, structural reforms and positive flexibility do not lead irremediably to deregulation, but rather to the consolidation of the welfare state. von Wogau (PPE). - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report presented by Mr Coates is like the curate's egg. The macroeconomic analysis has to be faulted because, although it is true that the rise in real long-term interest rates can adversely affect investment decisions, it is counterproductive to call for a cut in the base rate in response to this development. Slack monet ary policy would fuel inflationary expectations in the capital markets and lead to another long-term rise in interest rates. We must surely recognize that, following the latest increase in the federal reserve base rate in the United States, long-term U.S. interest rates have fallen. There are, therefore, no grounds at all for bemoaning a lack of transparency and legitimacy, especially since the European Parliament, through its Committee on Econ omic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy and its Subcommittee on Monetary Affairs, actively avails itself of the opportunity to create and broaden such transparen cy. It is regrettable that this report does not refer to the need to consolidate at long last the record budget deficits in the European Union. Capital is clearly in short supply world wide, a situation that is aggravated whenever govern ments have recourse to the capital markets. Therein lies a further reason for the rise in real interest rates. If real interest rates could be reduced by means of a more solid fiscal policy, this would have more salutary effects than a dubious stimulation of demand. Future economic growth can only occur through invest ment in the present. Investments, however, must be financed by savings, which cannot be made ad infinitum. Nor can a policy of easy money achieve any real success. It is regrettable that the report is so highly selective in its references to the European Commission White Paper. No mention is made of the fact that the investment rate in the European Union has fallen from 22-24% of GNP around 20 years ago to its present level of some 19%. This must be addressed by forward-looking policies in the Member States and the European Union. Moreover, it is indeed true that greater efforts in the field of vocational education, especially initial training, are required. In Member States where a dual system of part-time education combined with on-the-job training operates, youth unemployment is much lower than in other member countries of the Community. In addition, rapid technological change demands constant upgrading of employees' qualifications. The report accurately reflects this. Future growth, competitiveness and employment, as well as an increase in the investment rate through elimination of the excessive national deficits and improvement of the infrastructure of the European Uni on, are essential. Trans-European networks can play a prominent part here, as can a foresighted policy on the information society. Sindal (PSE). - (DA) Mr President, the process concerned is perhaps more important than the recommendations to the summit. It is a process in which Parliament, the Commission and the Council are involved and demon strate their will together, in which Parliament is demand ing results, in other words jobs, and in which we do not wish to see national self-sufficiency taking precedence over cooperation. This morning, we heard Mr Flynn talking about growth. It is a fact that the growth which we are experiencing is also coming to us from countries outside the Community, from third countries, from Eas tern Europe. It is a fact that the traditional growth philosophy does not work. We have to abandon these traditions. I should like to highlight and recommend the following areas for further action. The greatest threat to employ ment is old technology, not new. There is a substantial turnover of jobs on the European labour markets, but training and retraining initiatives lag behind this trend. The labour market is therefore becoming inflexible, a fact which also lies behind the structural problems. In terms of employment, there is considerable scope in economic policy cooperation, scope which an individual country will not be able to exploit without cooperating with other countries. The key to improving the employment situa tion is investment, both private and public, both through capital and in people. Reductions in working time should take the form of work sharing schemes, with a training element that increases job rotation on the labour market. The tax structure should be analysed further, both with a view to introducing a tax on interest at source at Euro pean level and to reducing the taxation of labour in favour of taxes related to the environment, for example. ",
        "No 4-454/58 Debates of the European Parliament 1. 12.94 Sindal Amongst other things, the Commission should consider how interest rate policy could be reoriented in Europe, so that it is determined on the basis of common European criteria, and not just criteria deriving from a single powerful country. With a view to the future work of the committee, the Commission should help to produce a European balance sheet, a situation report, summarizing the scope available in all our countries and what we can do together to create jobs. And to the Council, I would say: stop hesitating! Our citizens expect results. Katiforis (PSE). - (EL) Mr President, let us indeed thank and congratulate Mr Coates on his work, and thank the President of the Commission too, for doing us the honour of being here to observe our proceedings. For it is always worth remembering that if, today, we can talk about unemployment as an issue of the first priority, we owe that to his own enlightened initiative of the White Paper. We must not forget that. However, let us also come clean about certain unpalatable facts, such as the following: that the aim of creating 15 million new jobs, which the Coates report very rightly restores to the forefront of topicality, is first of all not an aim espoused by any responsible government organization, and secondly, not one that will be achieved. That it is not one of our aims, we have been told unambiguously on the Economic Committee, on behalf of the Commission, by Mr Kristof fersen, we have been told it by the Council and the presidency by their silence. The fact that it is not an aim of any among Europe's conservative governments, we see all the time. And to see that it is not going to be achieved, Mr President, we need only read the White Paper's analysis, which tells us that to create those 15 million new jobs by the year 2000, we would need a growth rate of 4 to 5% per year between now and 2000. None of the economic forecasting institutes, even in its wildest imagination, accepts that such growth rates can be achieved. So what is left? We are stuck with a low growth rate out of which we must squeeze the 15 million new jobs. But how? The only practical way is to down grade the emoluments of working people and create a class of working poor. If there are any who think this could be done without upheavals in Europe's social structure, they have forgotten the lessons of history. Mr President, we have been asked by Mr Flynn why we cannot get by, at any rate, as the Japanese are doing. But when the crisis of the 1990s began, Japanese companies accepted cuts in their profits, accepted that their profits should disappear, in order to avoid laying people off. Who, among European employers, was prepared to do that? And who, among Europe's political leaders, sug gested to them that they should? But perhaps the poor Japanese do not understand what competitiveness means. Perhaps some of those colleagues who have spoken to us so eloquently about competitiveness should go and teach the Japanese how to become competitive with 10% unemployment! Mr President, we were also asked by Mr Flynn why we cannot manage things like the Americans. But the Amer icans allowed the dollar to slide, Mr President. As also the British - whose unemployment is down - have allowed Sterling to slide, and I think that in Italy too, Mr Filippi, there has been some devaluation. But here, what are Europe's leaders doing? They want a hard currency, and do not care whether for that hard currency, the hardest of the hard - for nobody wants to see inflation - we will have to sacrifice 5 million - not 20 million of course - but 5 million working people. These are the great problems that the European Union could avert if it really wanted to face reality and not waste its time on trivia and on issues of secondary importance. Barros Moura (PSE). - (PT) Mr President, we can only welcome the fact that the Essen Council will be discuss ing measures to improve the White Paper's permanent plan. But beware! This means that the White Paper was insufficient and was never accomplished. This seems to me to be very worrying given that unemployment has become structural and persistent, despite the economic growth and recovery, in a society with deep social inequalities. The first main merit of the Coates report is that it has achieved a broad and significant consensus over the basic need for the White Paper's goal of creating 15 million sustainable jobs by the end of the century to be turned into reality. For this purpose the Council must make available the vital funds for investments provided for in the White Paper, and the adoption of efficient mechan isms to monitor application of the action programme by the Council and the Commission. Mr President, I an pleased to note that, in terms of the economic and social measures proposed in the Coates report, there is a re-affirmation of the validity of the European social model and opposition to the deregulating and liberal logic according to which, while pretending to support workers' rights, those rights are actually being eroded in order to bring down labour costs. It is not by applying American or Asian models that we are going to solve the tricky equation of growth and employment. Mr President, I think we must continue the debate on measures to stop unemployment. For my part - and I think I speak here for all socialists and the whole left - this debate must not shrink from a clarification of positions nor simply seek a consensus at all costs. It must set an objective and overcome and reverse the present situation, turning unemployment into the European Uni on's top priority. This should lead to a change in the convergence criteria, a reinforcement of the co-ordina tion of national economic policies, a reform of the common policies and rules on the Internal Market according to the objectives of economic and social cohesion; there needs to be a social dimension. The Union must be given the budgetary and fiscal resources to help the less developed countries and regions, those most affected by monetary union. This calls for an effective political and democratic regulation of the mar ket. Without that, even with good intentions and fine words, unemployment will continue to increase as a structural feature of the European Union and the econ omic policies of its Member States. Caudron (PSE). - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentle men, Mr Coates' excellent report is first of all a plea from the European Parliament and, through it, from Europe's eighteen million unemployed. It is a plea against the cancer of unemployment and for strong European meas ures to be taken very quickly to create jobs. But this report is also an urgent call on Europe's govern ments not to succumb to the illusion that growth will start up again all by itself. We know that there is a great risk that some of them will say that there is nothing left for Europe to do and the White Paper is no longer topical. That is a dangerous illusion. ",
        "1. 12.94 Debates of the European Parliament No 4-454/59 Caudron Finally, this report is a reminder that the economic and social sectors are closely linked, that non-wage costs must be reduced, but not wages and social benefits, that working time must be rearranged and reduced and we must make it easier for young people to get jobs. The current 'green shoots' of growth are, on the contrary, an additional reason for Europe to borrow, invest, and take action in all areas with the potential to create jobs, as Jacques Delors has so often reminded us. In this way, and only in this way, will we emerge from the crisis, by combining the European social model, job creation, social protection, market efficiency and effi cient undertakings. May the Essen Summit finally hear us and take the rapid, strong decisions that are required! Randzio-Plath (PSE). - (DE) Mr President, how can people within the European Union actually accept the Union and our democratic political system as long as their everyday lives are affected by this unprecedented level of mass unemployment? It is therefore correct, as the Coates report says, to instigate a new employment pact within the European Union. This pact, however, must not rest on the premise that cutting pay and unravelling the social security net are paramount. On the contrary, it must aim for improvements through greater flexibility, focusing on reductions in working hours, basic and further training measures and the promotion of new social services. Then, with our employment pact, we can really succeed in creating new jobs - and we do need at least 15 million of them. Measures relating to the labour market alone, however, will not be enough. In this economic Indian summer, we rely on an overdue application of nutrients in the form of investment aimed not at rationalization but at job crea tion. We are still far short of this ideal today. The assessment of the German and French Presidencies that we had already mastered the upturn and had now entered a phase of structural change is mistaken. It is a matter of consolidating and strengthening the economic recovery, which includes enhancement of pur chasing power, for our jobs will depend, among other things, on the extent to which internal demand within the European Union is stimulated. That is also the best and most socially acceptable way of consolidating our bud gets. I agree with everyone who says that we must regard budgetary consolidation as an important stepping-stone on the way to progress within the European Union - in the social sphere as elsewhere - but that alone will not suffice. Hence, we must also remember to ensure that interest rates are kept low and that sound growth with an acceptable environmental impact is encouraged. Mr Delors, I wish to thank you, not only for the White Paper but also for your repeated reminders that consoli dation of our capital markets is the key issue and that the new employment pact needs a stable monetary climate, which means action to prevent speculation. Rocard (PSE). - (FR) Mr President, I think Kenneth Coates' report is extremely important and very positive. I shall support it and vote for it. But I should just like to express a little regret. I believe that in the area of unemployment, where everything - flexibility, tax meas ures, the entire set of measures - must be tried, not enough attention is paid to the variable factor most likely to produce major, far-reaching improvement, that is, the reduction in working time. To avoid going back over what has already been said, I shall simply make three suggestions. The first is that this idea should not only be mentioned as one of the areas for government action, but also be included amongst the areas for action by the Union. The second is that the Union should recommend that the various Member States introduce the most significant and least costly measure available to us, that is, progressive retirement. And the third is to recall that an unemployed person costs society some ECU 20 000 a year, on average, in all our countries, what with the benefits paid out, social contri butions not paid in, and training courses. That is the sum of money that can be saved each time someone is hired and part of it should be used to fund the loss of income caused by the drop in overtime and to finance the necessary compensation to allow a sizable cut in the working week. There you have three suggestions, Mr President, to which I shall come back later, but at the time of the Essen Council, if Kenneth Coates could take them up, I should be most pleased to see them in the report, in addition to everything that it already contains and which is excellent. Villalobos Talero (PPE), chairman of the Temporary Committee on Employment. - (ES) Mr President, as chairman of the Temporary Committee on Employment, I wish first of all to congratulate all the members of the various political groups making up the temporary com mittee, particularly Mr Coates for the enormous amount of work he carried out in so short a time, preparing such a difficult report, which involved many problems, on the unemployment situation and policies to create jobs in Europe. Secondly, I wish to thank Mr Delors for having managed to launch a debate in Europe on the unemployment situation and job creation through his White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness, Employment, and also for having listened all morning to the various opinions of the members of this committee. Many thanks, Mr Delors. I also wish to thank Mr Kinkel for his presence here today. He is the President-in-office of the Council, and I hope that he will be able to assure Parliament that the Council will take on board the Coates report and the opinions of the European Parliament in its drive to increase employment throughout Europe. Throughout the morning, various politicians of differing political hues have put forward their views on each of the topics we have debated. There has been talk of flexibility. But what kind of flexibility and to what extent? There has also been talk of excessive labour costs, the corporate tax burden, vocational training, the need to promote small and medium-sized enterprises, youth unemployment, unemployment among women, long-term unemploy ment, the excessive cost of social protection, the problem of social exclusion in Europe, the need to maintain a way of life and a society that is fit to live in, as European society is today. I think that there are points on which we differ, but there are also many points on which we are all agreed: the need to maintain a united Europe, a Europe with an adequate level of social protection and a Europe which looks to the future with optimism. I come from a country with the highest level of unemployment in the entire Union - the average unemployment rate in the Union is 11%, while it ",
        "No 4-454/60 Debates of the European Parliament 1. 12.94 Villalobos Talero stands at 24% in Spain - and moreover I come from a region with the highest unemployment rate in Europe. Therefore my country and my region are more sensitive to unemployment than other countries lucky enough to have much higher rates of employment than we do. It is this heightened awareness of the problem which prompts me to agree fully with Commissioner Flynn that our difficulty in creating jobs indicates a failure on the part of European society. I wish to say to Mr Kinkel that he should not forget that economic growth, which is barely under way, will not solve the unemployment problem on its own. Some types of economic growth do not automatically increase the number of jobs available, a fact we should not forget. Let us hope that this sitting of the European Parliament will have more than passing significance. When we analyse the results of the Essen Council, I hope that we will be able to express our satisfaction at the fact that our sensitivity to the unemployment situation and social exclusion throughout Europe is shared by the various Governments making up the European Union. I would add that, despite our ideological differences, we must bear in mind the fact that we are entering the third millennium and that the situation in future will have very little in common with what we have experienced so far. I should like to call on my fellow Members here in this Parliament to start to cast aside the ideological dogma that history has handed down to each one of us and to show ourselves capable, collectively, of defending the people of Europe as a whole. This is an obligation. It is the reason why we are here. In my opinion, this is the be-all and end-all of this House. Delors, President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr Presi dent, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the special committee, its chairman, its rapporteur, and the various speakers for their contribu tions to solving this very difficult and distressing pro blem. Unemployment is a very distressing problem, for it is no longer simply a matter of adding up the individual tragedies caused by the loss of a job or, for a young person, starting working life on the dole. We are now talking about mass unemployment that is tearing apart the fabric of our societies, destroying cohesion, and will lead to that abominable two-tiered society that is contrary to the very principle of democracy and basic rights. Unemployment is a very difficult problem, because, believe me, if it were easy to solve, there would not have been any need for the White Paper. Each country would have done what was necessary, since the target of full employment has been a priority for many years. You know, as I do, that the chief responsibility for macro-economic policies and policies to combat unem ployment lis with national governments. This must never be forgotten. But we wanted to call our governments' attention, through the White Paper and above all through the warning given at the European Council in Copenhag en, to the fact that without a new and extremely vigorous response our economies were heading towards decline and our societies toward break-up. That is the reason for the White Paper that you examined at the time. I should now like to tell you, before the European Council in Essen, where we have got to and where we want to go. The White Paper is a framework for discussion and action at the national level, but we thought it might be possible at the European level to create a favourable environment for growth and job creation and that it might also be possible to promote some positive initiatives. How far have we got? Economic growth is returning. It will create jobs. But everyone agrees - and this must be repeated, even if it is a commonplace - that even growth of 3% on average until the end of the century will not enable us to bring the unemployment rate down below about 7-8%. Competitiveness is a vital factor and, contra ry to what some people say, if we are more competitive, we shall create more jobs than we shall destroy, in total. The proposals we shall make in Essen to increase competitiveness will concern first of all the twelve million small and medium-sized enterprises. Of course, the measures must be taken at national level, but it is necessary to lighten up the regulations, facilitate the creation and growth of such enterprises, facilitate their access to venture capital, and reduce their tax burdens. I believe that we shall be heeded in this area. We shall also put emphasis on the information society. I shall not dwell upon this point, since things in this area are on the right track, even if we still have to study all the consequences of the information society for society and employment. There are also some major infrastructure networks, which, contrary to what some people say, are not a neo-Keynesian recovery measure, but a way of making our economies more competitive by allowing us to move about faster and more cheaply. In this regard I must tell you, at my own risk, that the majority of the Economics and Finance Ministers are not prepared to provide on time the resources required to implement the projects that were studied at forty round tables held by the Commis sion and Commissioner Oreja. (Applause) Consequently, even if it is my last European Council, I shall not, for my part, make do with feeble statements. Either the Heads of State and Government understand that it is possible to finance these projects and they will be presented, for they are all technically feasible - fourteen of them are ready, that is, the eleven on the Corfu list plus three others - or else it is not possible and I shall tell you that at the December part-session. Thirdly, solidarity must come into play, for unemploy ment is not other people's business. It is not like when one talks about hospitals and those who are in good health say that disease will never strike them. Unemploy ment is our business, the business of every one of us, and we are right to demand solidarity,... (Applause) ...solidarity between those who have work and those who do not; solidarity in negotiating who gets what slice of the cake and the added value generated by growth; but not solidarity to be asked of wage-earners alone; solidarity to be asked of others, of individual entrepreneurs, of farm ers and businessmen. We must not take those who have work hostage in order to give them bad consciences. It is a problem for society as a whole and economic policy. (Applause) ",
        "1. 12.94 Debates of the European Parliament No 4-454/61 Delors Finally, imagination is also required. Contrary to what one might think, Europeans do not lack imagination and we shall table at Essen a first report that will show the tremendous local initiatives that have been taken to create jobs in response to either improvements in living stan dards or changes in life-styles. One interesting point that will be put to the Heads of State is this: it is often said that there is unemployment because more and more women are working. The problem is that more and more women want to work. That is the problem. But must they be refused work? (Applause) So, if more and more of women want to work, they want their working schedules and living schedules to be organized to let them be mothers at the same time. All this also offers numerous possibilities for creating jobs. In a nutshell, there are possibilities at the local level. All these issues will be expanded upon by the Commission in Essen. As far as employment per se is concerned, we shall ask for five guidelines that might be evaluated each year by the Social Affairs and Economic Affairs Ministers. I shall list them briefly as Mr Kinkel is waiting to speak: Making each person better able to fill a job, particularly through education and training, which was the last subject of the European social dialogue that was conducted between employers and trade unions; increasing the job-carrying capacity of growth through the rearrangement of working time, through the local initiatives, the innovations of which I spoke; reducing the non-wage costs of labour. I remain convinced, despite criticism, that if we do not achieve a rapid and major transfer of taxation from labour to polluting factors, we will not manage to set off the spark that will enable companies to change their hiring and employment behaviour. (Applause) Next, the tax on CO2, on which the Finance Ministers cannot agree and that they have reduced to a vague increase in excise duties, can be applied without harming our companies' competitiveness. We have provided sys tems for this. Fourth objective: adjusting employment policies so as to promote active expenditure and curb passive expendi ture. Fifth and last, taking measures in favour of young people, for it is unacceptable that those who are about to being their working lives see unemployment as their only prospect. This explains the Youth Start proposal, which has been taken up, I might add. It is vital for us to make a breakthrough at Essen. We know what Europe's two Achilles' heels currently are: the Yugoslav crisis and unemployment. We must show that we are making progress on at least one of them. But we shall not make progress unless we are united politically, and I see a number of proposals that could well shatter Europe's political union. Without the political dimension, for example, would we be able to defend ourselves within the World Trade Organization, to have a common trade policy, to enforce the social clause, to combat social dumping? No! All those who want to have the advantages of political Europe with the feeble institutions of the European Area are bad shepherds who are leading Europe to its decline and break-up. (Applause) Those are the choices for 1996. In the interim, the choice for Essen is simple. There is a view that is prevalent that macro-economic policy is made for the economy that will create jobs. This is, of course, true, but it must backed up by a policy aimed directly at employment, for our society has changed and needs imagination and innovation. It needs local initiatives, decentralization, incentives, so that job creation will become our prime obsession. (Applause) President. - The debate is closed. The vote will take place shortly. 3. Situation in Bosnia President. - The next item is the statement by the Council on Bosnia-Herzegovina. Before I give the floor to Mr Kinkel, may I thank him for his courtesy in coming to the House this afternoon. We invited him at extremely short notice and I know he left a meeting of NATO to be with us. We are extremely grateful. (Applause) Kinkel, President-in-Office of the Council. - (DE) Mr President, President Delors, this morning the European Parliament has held a very important debate about employment and about preparations for the European Council meeting in Essen on the basis of the report presented by Mr Coates. I myself was unable to attend, which I very much regret, because a very important NATO meeting is taking place at the moment - I have just interrupted it for a short time to come over here - in which we are discussing the enlargement of NATO and the very topic on which I shall shortly report, namely the situation in the former Yugoslavia or, to be more precise, Bosnia. I am sure, however, that President Delors and Mr Hoyer, the Minister of State, have taken on board the legitimate concerns of Parliament and will ensure that these are given due consideration by the European Council in Essen. The presidency is very much aware that the employment situation, the high unemployment rate, is the problem that most deeply concerns the people of Europe. Rest assured that we have tried to help during our presidency. We have cyclical growth with upward trends. Unfortunately, with employment lagging behind in the business cycle, we still have unemployment problems of horrendous dimen sions. I thank President Delors most sincerely for his dedication and for his committed speech today. In preparing for the Council meeting in Essen and in the course of our presidency, he has done an extraordinary amount of work on the issue of unemployment. Incidentally, we dealt extensively in the Council on Monday with the prepara tions for Essen, and I hope for the sake of Europe that it is a successful summit. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you asked me to make a brief statement on the situation in Bosnia. The dreadful situation in the former Yugoslavia, especially of course the present state of affairs in and around Bihac, is a matter of profound concern to us all. Barbarism in the ",
        "No 4-454/62 Debates of the European Parliament 1. 12.94 Kinkel truest sense of the word has indeed returned to Europe in the former Yugoslavia. It is primarily a European pro blem, and, sadly, we have been and still are unable to resolve it, try as we might. We are all united in our outrage at the inhuman aggres sion of the Bosnian and Croatian Serb leadership, which is now directed mainly against the Bihac region, where they have no right, absolutely no right, to be! The people in Europe - and not just in Europe, I might add - are sickened by the news and graphic images that portray ever more appalling scenes. This understandably arouses emotions in which the clamour for military intervention grows loud. We all understand this, we who have tried for years to cope with this dreadful problem. Yet anyone who wants to and has to assess the situation is bound to say with patent clarity that no-one is prepared to send ground combat troops into the former Yugoslavia, and I, as the German foreign minister, understand that only too well, and we should all understand it together. Nobody is prepared to send ground combat troops into a bloody battle in Bosnia, a view shared not only by all who deal with the politics of the situation but also by all military leaders. Airborne attacks alone cannot solve the problem. Let me explain why it is so difficult to intervene from the air in Bihac in particular. A three-pronged stranglehold is being exerted by the Bosnian Serbs, the Serbs supporting from Krajina and the Abdic people. That makes it so incredibly hard to intervene from above, given that we have no military airborne control systems and, although Bihac was quite deliberately designated a safe area after careful examination, it is simply not an exclusion zone as far as heavy armaments are concerned. That is what makes airborne intervention extremely difficult. Our friends and allies, particularly the Europeans, are committed on the ground under Unprofor. But these are lightly armed Unprofor troops who are under explicit orders not to engage in combat, who are not there to fight except in self-defence. On the contrary, their mission is to help in taking consignments of humanitarian aid to the people under threat and to ensure that the worst never happens. Setting aside my European Council hat for a moment, I should like to say, as the German foreign minister, that we Germans, of all people, cannot and will not apply any pressure, because we were unable, for constitutional reasons, to send any troops into the region and also because, for historical reasons, we have political prob lems of a special nature there. Accordingly, we have the very least reason to rally others with the battle cry 'Get in there and fight!'. As the German foreign minister, I wish to state that quite clearly, especially to our European friends. A word now on the UN and on NATO. Both are under massive attack. Let me begin with a few words on NATO. NATO can only be as strong as its member countries desire and permit it to be. NATO would have been prepared - and remains prepared - to play a more active military role if it were not, so to speak, a subcon tractor of the United Nations and were not limited, even under the existing Security Council resolutions, to inter vening only if the UN requests its assistance. For that reason I wish to take up the cudgels for NATO and to make it clear that it cannot be blamed; that, at least, is the conclusion I have reached after two and a half years' experience of this issue. As regards the UN, I must emphasize that the UN bears responsibility for 20 000 Unprofor troops on the ground, most of them European. Dr Boutros Ghali and special envoy Akashi, as its representatives, have to think very carefully about how to exercise this responsibility. I also understand my European colleagues, both foreign and defence ministers, agonizing about this responsibility. We must be tremendously careful not to be drawn into this conflict lock, stock and barrel, almost as a fourth belligerent. Besides, we have a two-key system: NATO can, and therefore will, only intervene if the UN so requests. A few thoughts now on the lifting of the arms embargo. The American executive is under intense congressional pressure to lift the arms embargo. The arms embargo derives from a Security Council resolution. It would therefore be necessary to amend that resolution. With regard to the lifting of the arms embargo, the European allies are all categorically opposed to its being lifted in view of the responsibility they bear for their own lightly armed troops. I also appreciate that view. As the German foreign minister, let me add that we - both Chancellor Kohl and myself - have always been very close to the American position on the lifting of the arms embargo as a moral and ethical standpoint. However, as the Federal Government we have also stated quite plainly that we shall not break rank with the solidarity and cooperative action of our European friends, whatever our views on the moral issue. That is how it will stay. Please consider what the lifting of the arms embargo would mean in the present situation. If the embargo were lifted, the Canadians, French, British and Danes - eve ryone who has troops there - would have to withdraw them, which, incidentally, the military leaders regard as a highly precarious undertaking. There would no longer be any guarantee that humanitarian aid would reach the people in need. Nor is it difficult to imagine - and I know this from countless talks with Presidents Tudjman, Izet begovic and Silajdzic as well as with the Serbian side - that the likely reaction would be a further escalation of the military conflict, with all parties guided by the precept of 'Every man for himself!' Although I am more inclined, from a moral and ethical perspective, to adopt the American position, at the present time I share with my European friends and allies the view that it is probably too late now for the arms embargo to be lifted. Just think what the Serbs would do if the arms embargo were lifted. What, indeed, would they have done by the time the parties to the conflict - and especially the weakest party, the Muslims, had actually received an adequate supply of weapons? That is a question which requires very careful consideration. Such a question may be approached from a moral and ethical standpoint, as many, including the United States, have approached it. But primary consideration must be given to how things will develop and, above all, where they will end, and so I ask once again for an honest discussion of this issue. Moral indignation alone cannot solve the problem! War is raging in Bosnia. A further injection of weaponry into an ongoing conflict will naturally result in more ",
        "1. 12.94 Debates of the European Parliament No 4-454/63 Kinkel battles, and the result could be a conflagration. It may come to that anyway; I cannot rule it out. I should regret it, but it may turn out that the arms embargo will be lifted in the end. In areas not yet affected by the hostilities, even more people would suffer longer. As I see it, at least, this would not eradicate the problem but make it even worse. So the sad conclusion to be drawn is that there is no alternative to a political, diplomatic solution. You know that I have invited the foreign ministers of the contact group for talks tomorrow. We shall discuss the problem today in the North Atlantic Council and this evening with Mr Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, with whom I held a discussion last weekend on behalf of the European presidency. In the past few days the contact group has held talks with Mr Milosevic; the group will report on these tomorrow, and we are working on proposals. We shall meet here in Brussels tomorrow. What shall we be discussing? Of course we must bring about a ceasefire in and around Bihac. We must work towards a total cessa tion of hostilities throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina. Before then we need humanitarian aid, accompanied by resolute progress towards a political solution on the basis of the peace plan drawn up by the contact group and the agreed ratio of 51:49%. That at least must not and cannot be altered. It is right that you should have asked me to come here, and I should like to appeal once again to the Bosnian Serb leadership to stop defying the entire international com munity. Contrary to much that has been said and alleged, we have actually been making some crucial progress. Three of the warring parties, if I include Mr Milosevic, have endorsed the contact group's peace plan. It is entirely wrong and utterly intolerable that one million Bosnian Serbs - and there are just one million of them - led by blinkered and insensitive political and military leaders and the parliament in Pale, should bedevil and mock the entire world! Make sure that this Parliament also renews its appeal to the Bosnian Serbs today: fall in with the contact group's plan as reason and honour demand! (Applause) President. - Thank you for that statement, Mr Kinkel. Langer (V). - (DE) Mr President, I cannot believe that not even the parliamentary groups are at least permitted to speak for one minute on the statements made by the President-in-Office of the Council. We asked him here, and we thank him for coming to inform Parliament, but he perhaps also wants to hear what Parliament thinks. He has appealed to us, and I think we should at least be given the opportunity to reply. (Applause) President. - Mr Langer, I understand the sentiments you express but the agreement was that we were adding this to an already very crowded agenda because of the impor tance of the item. Mr Kinkel was asked only yesterday to address us today and has not had time to consult with other members of the Council. So he cannot answer questions on behalf of the Council on this matter. Secondly, it is now 12.35 p.m. and we have a number of votes to take. The House is sovereign. If the House wants to hear statements from each of the group leaders that is for it to decide. The easiest way to resolve this question, rather than by a long debate, is to have a quick vote. (Parliament rejected the proposal) 4.

While I am very sympathetic to the proposals made, I feel it would be more appropriate if they were taken into account in the next report which should come before the House in July. Van Lancker (PSE). - (NL) Mr President, I think that Mrs Boogerd-Quaak's proposal to lower VAT on labour- intensive services may be a very interesting one. I think we ought indeed to discuss it within the working party, but as we have not yet done so, my Group will be abstaining on that amendment. Thyssen (PPE). - (NL) Mr President, perhaps I could inform the House that in the report concerning the fiscal environment of SMEs a paragraph was approved by Parliament which is word for word the same as the amendment we are now discussing. President. - Clearly there is no consensus to withdraw these amendments so we shall proceed with the vote. (Parliament adopted the resolution) Posselt (PPE). - (DE) Mr President, I had asked to raise a point of order before Mr Langer, but you evidently did not see me in this awful chamber. I only wanted to say quite briefly that we should react to this scandalous sell-out by the Council on Bosnia, which in my eyes is something that must fill any German and any European with shame. The President-in-Office himself has asked us to react, so let us do just that! What are you planning? ",

Explanations of vote Coates report Guineberti\u00e8re (RDE). - (FR) Mr President, the Essen Council will receive our message. To the honourable Heads of State I would say this: employment is a priority for all, but above all for the unemployed. Structural measures must be taken for the longer term to secure Europe's position in the world; effective action must be taken close at hand, because daily life demands that Europe not remain shut up in its ivory towers in Brussels. Daily life calls for the presence of Europe in our enter prises, especially in the smaller ones. Wolf (V). - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I regard it as a very important step forward that this Parliament is prepared to espouse and develop the sound principles contained in the White Paper and to conduct a discussion on the basis that the fight against mass unemployment, which, as Jacques Delors said, is one of the two main disgraces of Europe, is accepted as our primary political mission. To that extent we can congra tulate ourselves on having adopted a good report and on having resisted any temptation to adulterate this report with an infusion of OECD ideology. Elliott (PSE). - Mr President, I am delighted that this report by Ken Coates has been adopted by such a large majority because, for all the reasons we have heard this morning, unemployment is one of the biggest problems facing the Community and all our individual countries. I represent an area of West London where until recently this was not a major problem. Even in the dark days of mass unemployment in the 1930s it was an area where people came from all over Britain to find jobs. That has evaporated in the last few years. We now have an unprecedentedly high level of unemployment in West London well above the national average in some parts. Those jobs have mainly been lost in traditional forms of employment and largely stem from the collapse of traditional manufacturing industry. I do not believe for one moment that we can solve the problems of unemployment in the way the British Gov ernment wants to do by encouraging the growth of part-time insecure, poorly-paid employment and turning ourselves into a kind of sweatshop. The positive invest ment policies in people and in employment and in training that are advocated in this report are the way forward and I am delighted it has been adopted. Dillen (NI), in writing. - (NL) For decades now we have been continually bombarded with solutions to unemploy ment. And what have we found each time? - Firstly that the various solutions put to us, miracle solutions or ordinary, non-nonsense solutions, do not pass the test. In fact, year on year the problem has got steadily worse. - Secondly - and it may seem less important to the unemployed, but the responsibilities have to be identified and the finger has to be pointed at those who are responsible, those who are to blame - it has to be said, not gloatingly because too many million people have suffered, but cynically and accusingly that those who announce and promise improvements and the political parties which represent them have, by their folly and their political fecklessness, allowed the situation to deteriorate. Thanks to them the agriculture of Europe and Europe's people is at death's door. Thanks to them the small business sector has repeatedly been dealt severe blows. I could continue... Europe has not defended itself. Europe's people have not defended themselves. That is the root of the problem. And that is where the cure must be sought. Riis-J\u00f8rgensen (ELDR), in writing. - (DA) I would refer to my colleague Bertel Haarder's contribution to the debate, and will therefore be abstaining in the vote. There are some good points in the report, however, such as Amendment No 12 on reducing VAT for labour- intensive activities, and the proposals to improve the situation of small and medium-sized enterprises. Vanhecke (NI), in writing. - (NL) I find it hard to feel any enthusiasm for Mr Coates' report on the European Union's action plan on employment policy. But I readily concede that a number of interesting ideas have been put forward. I cannot go along with the thing as a whole. How, for example, can one blow hot and cold by saying that the level of labour costs has to be lower - fair enough! - unless at the same time one says that Member States and the European bureaucracy must put an end to their cavalier waste and stop chucking away tax revenue left, right and centre. They are doing anything but: the plan quite simply is to offset the reduction in labour costs by other, new taxes. How can one talk about the problem of unemployment amongst poorly skilled Europeans, without even once mentioning the gigantic problem of our non-European foreign workers and the unemployed amongst them? And once again I see that not a word is said about the possibility of proper remuneration for the parent who works at home. And I know the reason for this omission: we have a taboo in this Parliament; it is not permitted to speak of the family as the essential cornerstone of European society. 5. Adjournment of the session President. - I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
