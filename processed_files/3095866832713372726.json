        "1 Foreword As a member of the European Commission responsible for education, train- ing, culture and youth, as well as for the important area of active European citizenship, I am witnessing many striking examples of Europeans engaging in projects across national frontiers. Europe for them is not an abstract idea but a concrete achievement born of close cooperation on concrete projects in which they have invested their emotions, creativity and intellectual capacities. This very idea of constructing \u201cA Europe of shared experiences, ideas and memories\u201d is well demonstrated by the projects which were selected for the Golden Stars Award this year. The projects chosen in the \u201cactive European remembrance\u201d category bring to life the memories of those who became victims of the two totalitarian regimes Europe experienced in the 20th century and of those who in the name of humanity and democracy opposed those regimes. This is even more symbolic as in the coming year we will commemorate twenty years from the fall of the iron curtain where civic movements led by courageous men and women played a crucial role. We live in a democratic Europe today but democracy needs to be reinforced every day by the continuous engagement of active citizens. The two other types of projects were initiated by twin towns and civil society organisations from all across the European Union. They reveal the desire of Europeans to participate in Europe\u2019s political, social and cultural life as well as the high degree of commitment and innovation with which the projects were carried out. It is reassuring to see that in today\u2019s Europe there is both such a wealth of ideas and the will to translate them into concrete actions. I would like to extend my congratulations to all the winning projects of this year. I am convinced that the fate of Europe is in good and able hands \u2013 the hands of active European citizens.

        "2 3 The selection of the winners The European Commission initially evaluated 130 good quality projects, representing all actions and measures of the Europe for Citizens Programme. The evaluators analysed the projects, taking into account the permanent and annual priorities of the Programme and payed particular attention to projects which contributed to the themes of citizens\u2019 participation, development of opportunities for civic engagement in the EU and democratic innovations. Those themes are the focus of discussion at the Europe for Citizens Forum 2008, during which the Golden Stars Award ceremony takes place. A shortlist of the 24 projects that best corresponded to the priorities of the Europe for Citizens Pro- gramme and to the themes of the Europe for Citizens Forum 2008, were presented to a jury. The jury was composed of the following members: As Chair of the Jury, Mr. Hannu Takkula, member \u2022 of the European Parliament (EP) and rapporteur of the Europe for Citizens programme. Mr. Keith Walters, member of the Committee of \u2022 the Regions (CoR) and 1st Vice-President of its EDUC Commission. Mrs. Brenda King, member of the European Eco- \u2022 nomic and Social Committee (EESC) and President of the SOC Section. Ms. Sandra Ceciarini, representative of the \u2022 Council of European Municipalities and Regions (CEMR), Head of citizenship and international cooperation. Mr. Dietmar M. Woesler, Director of the Institute \u2022 for International Cooperation (IPZ) organisation, active in the field of town twinning. Mr. Karel Lannoo, chief executive of the Centre for \u2022 European Policy Studies (CEPS), as representative of a think-tank from the field of Active European Citizenship. Mr. Dominik Czapigo, representative of the KARTA \u2022 organisation, Poland, a partner organisation of a winner of a Golden Stars Award in 2007. The jury choose 12 projects to be awarded with the Golden Stars Award. The result is a well-balanced selection of projects that represented best practice for each of the actions of the Europe for Citizens Programme. All project categories are represented in the Golden Stars Award: town twinning, civil society and remembrance projects. Golden Stars Winners 2008 The European Commission identifies and awards the Golden Stars in order to give a special recognition to projects which have been particularly successful in the field of Active Euro- pean Citizenship. These projects can provide good examples and source of inspiration to other organisations and European citizens. Introduction The Europe for Citizens Programme promotes active European citizenship. The programme supports and gives grants to projects initiated by different kinds of organisations. Those projects provide citizens with opportunities to participate in the construction of a common Europe. The 2008 Golden Stars include projects in three categories: Remembrance projects By commemorating the victims, as well as preserv- ing the sites and archives associated with Nazism and Stalinism, Europeans can draw lessons from the past and learn for the future through projects dealing with this dark history of Europe. The three awarded remembrance projects all use participa- tive and innovative methods in involving European citizens in reflection, debate and actions related to common history, shared values, democracy and culture. For additional information on the programme, please consult the website: http://ec.europa.eu/citizenship or the Programme guide: http://ec.europa.eu/citizenship/how-to-participate/ doc92_en.htm Town-twinning projects Town twinning, as a grass roots initiative, favours direct and local exchanges of European citizens through activities designed and implemented between twinned towns. Among the winners of the Golden Stars Award 2008, we find examples of projects which have shown innovation in gathering European citizens and making them more participa- tive in and sensible to topics of European concern. Civil society projects Projects initiated by civil society organisations can be of different character; seminars, creating networks, production of films, thematic or artistic workshops, grass roots initiatives, information cam- paigns etc. The three awarded civil society projects for a Golden Star 2008 all bring forward concrete proposals and solutions regarding different Euro- pean themes, activities, realities and values.

        "Interview with Ellen Schnellb\u00e4cher, President of the Verschwisterungsverein Reichelshem e. V.: Aim: \u201cTogether with our twinned towns, we wanted to discuss topics on and enhance the knowledge of the EU. We dwelt on the question on how political decisions are made in the EU and we wanted to illustrate the basic values of the EU with the intention to make people more involved in issues on a European level.\u201d Feelings and testimonies: \u201cThere was a strong feeling of solidarity between participants and a very friendly at- mosphere, highly appreciated by the participants. Why don\u2019t we arrange those kinds of meetings every year in a rolling agenda?\u201d Difficulties and improvements: \u201cFor the next project, it will be important to improve the organisational as- pects, like for example translation. We didn\u2019t have simultaneous translation and from that we suffered from loss of time and misunderstandings that could have been avoided.\u201d Tips: How did we do it? Visibility: \u201cWe enhanced the visibility of the project through posters and leaflets and we ensured a good media coverage in the local press. We also prepared papers with infor- mation sheets about the EU and stands for distributing this information.\u201d Follow-up: \u201cThis summer, we arranged a youth camp in Reichelsheim, hosting young people from Germany, France, Poland and Hungary for eight days. It was a great success and we plan to arrange those youth camps on a regular basis together with our twinned towns. We believe that engaging young people in the discussion on the future of the EU is as important as arranging the town twinning meetings for adults.\u201d 6 7 Bretagne (France), Jablonka (Poland) and Nagymany\u00f3k (Hungary). Activities The meeting, which was organised in order to prepare the enlargement of the town twinning by including the towns Jablonka and Nagymany\u00f3k, saw a good combination of workshops, interventions, artistic events, activities for school children and a series of debates on themes of European issues connected to the local context. Some activities for school children such as learning the European anthem, painting T-shirts and preparing a typical national meal were also held. Participants 280 people participated in the meeting: town of- ficials from the host town and the invited towns, pupils and teachers and people from a poor social and economic background. Duration The meeting was held between 20\u201325 October 2007. Results There was a high level of gained knowledge about the above mentioned themes among the par- ticipants and the meeting prepared the basis for extending the bilateral town twinning relation to two new towns.

The participants of this particular twin town convention successfully embraced both Europe- an subjects and interests of the citizens which led to the insight that there is a connection between their personal experiences and every- day life in their home country on one side and the benefits of the European Community on the other side.\u201d Dietmar M.

Method: \u201cBefore you start a project, it is of great importance to have a good knowledge of the themes of the meeting and it is crucial to find out what topics the people of your town, as well as the partner towns are interested in. Our inhabitants are very much involved in questions concerning the global problems and questions related to the EU. Furthermore, in order for the meeting to be useful for participants, they must have the opportunity to present their individual opinions in debates and discussions. It is also important to be well orientated in conditions given by the EU in order to receive a grant, as well as to have in mind that the EU grant cannot sufficiently cover all the expenses related to the project.\u201d Interview with Franti\u0161ek T\u00e1m, Mayor of Bojnice Aim: \u201cAt the end of 2006 and in the beginning of 2007, there were mu- nicipal elections in Bojnice, Jesenik and Rosta and the outcome of the elections saw a significant change in municipal politicians and representa- tives. Moreover, 2007 was declared Year of Equal Opportunities by the European Commission and we saw all these events as a good basis for a town twinning project, focus- ing on these interesting topics.\u201d Feelings and challenges: \u201cThe meeting was quite demanding to organise, seeing that the participants (ranging from school children to pensioners) came from five different countries and spoke five different languages. Thanks to a well coordinated team of devoted people and a detailed, well outlined programme where participants could find their special topic of interest, the project proved to be a success.\u201d 8 9 Themes Impact of EU policies in societies. \u2022 Protection of the environment in Europe. \u2022 Social development. \u2022 Mobility in the EU. \u2022 European identity and integration. \u2022 Information on the Year of Equal Opportunities. \u2022 The function of the European Parliament and \u2022 democratic life in Europe. Geography The meeting was organised by Bojnice (Slovakia) and participating towns were Bad Krozingen (Germany), Rosta (Italy), Jesenik (Czech Republic) and Zator (Poland). Activities The meeting offered specific activities for each age group and included thematic workshops, presentations and artistic and cultural activities. In one of the workshops, the participants compared their systems of collecting litter, treating water and citizens\u2019 attitude regarding the protection of the en- vironment. Anna Zaborska, member of the European Parliament, presented the institution and her work. The pensioners club of Bojnice guided the groups in an orientation game. Participants The inter-generational aspect was strong, seeing that mixed delegations of children, youngsters, adults and pensioners were actively participating in the meeting. The participants were hosted by 47 host families. Duration The meeting was held from 3\u20138 October 2007. Results The delegations signed the \u201cBojnice declaration\u201d, where they make a common statement on their will and positive approach of working together for a European spirit in the frame of the European integra- tion process.

        "Tips: How did we do it? Methods: \u201cIt was highly important to include and consult all participants in the planning of the project. Furthermore, a successful project is a product of common discussions, work- shops and interactive meetings.\u201d Visibility: \u201cWe informed local mass media in due time before the project and information about our project was published in the local newspaper \u201cBialogardzianin\u201d.\u201d Follow-up: \u201cWe are planning to implement more projects that will deal with the problems as well as the positive characteristics of the EU. We will try to organise those meeting together with all of the eight partner cities of Bialogard.\u201d Interview with Stefan Strzalkowski, Mayor of Bialogard: Aim: \u201cWe used our town twinning net- work, which extends to different parts of Europe, in order to discuss democracy in an enlarged Europe.\u201d Feelings: \u201cThe project participants were very content and happy with the meeting and they felt that they had a great occasion to get to know each other and to establish new contacts and friendships.\u201d Improvements: \u201cThe project can improve by including more participants from outside the EU, for example partici- pants from Croatia and Ukraine. This would give us a great opportunity to compare the meaning and practice of democracy inside and outside the EU.\u201d Difficulties: \u201cThe most complicated issue was to gather all partner cities for this meeting. Only four out of our eight partner cities could attend the meeting and for future projects, we will try to assemble all our twin towns together.\u201d 10 11 Contact Contact person: Stefan Strzalkowski Tel: +48 9 312 23 10 E-mail: um.sekretariat@bialogard.info Website: www.bialogard.info Testimony of the jury \u201cThe initiative of Bia\u0142ogard demonstrates very well how town twinning can contribute to developing a European awareness and citizenship. With this Golden Star, we wish to encourage young people to follow the excellent example of Bia\u0142ogard and its twinned cities.\u201d Sandra Ceciarini Representative of the CEMR, Head of citizen- ship and international cooperation. Themes The enlargement process of the EU. \u2022 Objectives To initiate lasting co-operation between young \u2022 people from the partner towns. To foster the youngsters interest in European inte- \u2022 gration and democracy in Europe. To get to know Romania and Bulgaria. \u2022 Geography The meeting was organised by Bialogard (Poland) and participating towns were Akniste (Latvia), Gnosj\u00f6 (Sweden), Olen (Belgium) and Caracal (Romania). Activities This youth meeting saw a good mix of activities like presentations, lec- tures, workshops, games, sport competi- tions and a session in order to develop future projects between the participating towns. The participants prepared a touring exhibition called \u201cTown Twinning\u201d, showing works of local artists and pictures from the twinned towns as well as souve- nirs. The exhibition will travel during 12 months to the partner towns. Participants Each participating delegation consisted of 10 young people and 2 adult guides and all in all there were around 100 participants attending the meeting. Duration The meeting was held from 28\u201331 October 2007. Results The participants gained knowledge on the enlarge- ment process of the EU. Another concrete result of the project was the travelling exhibition that will be shown in all the participating cities. The idea is that this will inspire people in their preparation of future twinning exchanges.

        "Interview with Evelyne Laquit, The town twinning com- mittees association of Puy de D\u00f4me : Aim: \u201cWe had realised that youngsters in the communes of our twinned towns didn\u2019t show much interest in getting in- volved in town twinning activities. Therefore, we decided to organise a special youth meet- ing engaging young people from our twinned towns, in order to enhance their interest in and to communicate their vision of Europe. We also wanted to make them more interested in the functions of a town twinning committee.\u201d Feelings: \u201cThe youngsters were very enthu- siastic during the meeting and they showed great interest in learning more about Euro- pean topics, as well as a real will to engage in European actions such as town twinning. The main lesson learnt during the meeting was that young people are interested in participation and intercultural dialogue in topics that are of interest for them.\u201d Difficulties: \u201cThe main dif- ficulty during the meeting was the language. As the project budget didn\u2019t allow us to use simultaneous translation, we had to use English as the working lan- guage and this caused problems for some of the participants to understand and participate.\u201d 12 13 Contact Contact person: Evelyne Laquit Tel: +33 6 62 91 68 34 E-mail: evelyne.laquit@neuf.fr THE TWINNING COMMITTEES ASSOCIATION OF PUY DE DOME European Youth Meeting: Mobility of Young People in Europe Themes Mobility of young people in Europe. \u2022 The Treaty of Rome. \u2022 Europe and Town Twinning from youngsters point \u2022 of view. Geography The Twinning Committees Association of Puy de D\u00f4me consists of 35 twinning committees which rep- resent 65 municipalities from the region of Puy de D\u00f4me. The association organised a meeting, inviting the towns from those municipalities from the region and 21 cities from Italy, Germany, United Kingdom, Portugal, the Netherlands, Romania and Poland. Activities The meeting included a series of conferences on mobility in Europe and on the Treaty of Rome; ques- tions put to members of the European Parliament; comparative testimonies from young and old people and a photo exhibition of twinned towns. There was a questionnaire on Europe, prepared before the meeting by the youngsters themselves, and of which the results were presented in a plenary session. Participants 400 youngsters from the participating towns. Duration The meeting was held from 19\u201322 October 2007. Results The youngsters gained better understanding of the importance of being European and in fostering a European identity. From concrete examples, they improved their knowledge of mobility of young peo- ple in Europe. Finally, they increased their knowledge about other countries and cultures. Tips: How did we do it? Active participation in planning: \u201cWe en- gaged the youngsters to actively participate in the planning and execution of the meet- ing, all having concrete responsibilities like constructing the questionnaire, including the translations; to make the badges for the participants and to create posters and leaflets etc. This is important in order to motivate the youngsters.\u201d Follow-up: \u201cSeveral ideas of continued cooperation between the participants were launched, including for example to organise a follow-up of this meeting in Poland, as well as to prolong the meeting into the ordinary town twinning meetings.\u201d T O W N T W I N N I N G P R O J E C T S Testimony of the jury \u201cAs we know, a great part of young people is not very interested in political issues. An event like this one can help to encourage interests in political subjects, in taking part in twin-town events and in becoming an active European citizen.\u201d Dietmar M.

        "Interview with Michalis Christakis, Secretary-General of the municipality of Amaroussion: Aim: \u201cWe considered a European Quality Cities Network to be the most dynamic answer to the need for better and more sustainable patterns of European governance considering quality procedures. Our vision was to create respon- sive and efficient public services based on quality in favour of the European citizens.\u201d Feelings: \u201cWe are very proud that the project nowadays is a best practice example for similar cooperative synergic initiatives.\u201d Improvements: \u201cAn additional thematic day in combination with an earlier distribution of the speakers summarised interventions would have allowed the participants to better involve in a creative dialogue in the \u201cQuestions and Answers\u201d section of the conference.\u201d Difficulties: \u201cDuring the beginning of the Forum we had to deal with some minor technical difficulties, but these were solved through time tested solu- tions due to our experience derived from the applications of ISO 9000 and EMAS.\u201d 14 15 AMAROUSSION Forum of the EU Citizens and Municipal Offi cers: Fighting for Q-cities, fi ghting for a Better Daily Life Contact Contact persons: Mariana Markouli or Andreas Nefeloudis Tel: +30 210 8760306, 8760260 E-Mail: qcities@maroussi.gr Website: www. q-citiesnet.eu Tips: How did we do it? Methods: \u201cThe unique interest of the munici- pal authority of Amaroussion in the themes of the project, a good team spirit and the pas- sion for innovation and creativity related to the changing European environment were the main components for the successful outcomes of the project.\u201d Visibility: \u201cSix months in advance, there were pre-conference dissemination activities consisting of distribution of communicating conference material. Additionally, information leaflets about the conference were published and circulated to the public and cities across Europe.\u201d T O W N T W I N N I N G P R O J E C T S Testimony of the jury \u201cWith the Golden Star to the project of Ama- roussion, we wish to recognise a successful initiative showing how a thematic network can be a good tool to enhance a lively project and contribute to the European debate on a major issue for our society \u2013 in this case the impor- tance of public services.\u201d Sandra Ceciarini Representative of the CEMR, Head of citizen- ship and international cooperation Themes Quality procedures and practices in the field of \u2022 municipal services towards citizens.

Exchange of best practices and expertise on Euro- \u2022 pean policy-making in quality assurance issues. Geography The municipality of Amaroussion coordinated the project involving 36 municipalities from seven mem- ber states: Italy, Cyprus, Portugal, the Netherlands, Belgium, Romania and Sweden. Activities The project consisted of a thematic con- ference and four parallel workshops for the exchanges of best practices with an extended geographical coverage. The main scope of the meeting and activities were three-fold: first, to involve all interested parties in a European quality- building process, secondly to institutionalise, consolidate and expand the first European Cities Network for Quality entitled: \u201cQ-cities Network\u201d for the systematic exchange of knowledge and exper- tise. Finally, to sign a \u201cEuropean Quality Oath\u201d un- der the auspice of the Network for ensuring \u201cquality culture\u201d in municipal services and establishing new twinning bonds among its members. Participants Participants at the conference were political repre- sentatives of local authorities and municipalities, institutions, NGOs, quality experts, specialised practitioners, universities and citizens. Follow-up/Continuity The quality network of this thematic networking project has been holding conferences for three years, starting out as thematic \u201cpartners\u201d, they eventually established a network of partnerships, signed a Statute and expanded their network to other countries and municipalities. Results The results consisted of further establishment of new twinnings with interested towns, establish- ment of the first European Quality Cities Network of twinned towns, signing of the EU Quality Oath and committing members to combine their efforts for a better quality of citizens\u2019 life and a full, active European citizenship for their municipal authorities. A DVD about the Forum was produced, including a presentation of \u201cQ-cities\u201d and about the conference and its outcomes. ",

Activities The meeting included a conference with high quality interventions, workshops and debates, in paral- lel with an exhibition on sustainable development and a screening of the film \u201cAn inconvenient truth\u201d (David Guggenheim). Participants The meeting involved farmers and cattle-breeders, associa- tions of environmental protec- tion, students from establish- ments specialising in agriculture industries, teachers, community representatives, decision-makers, and a Member of the European Parliament. Duration The meeting, introducing for the first time the above mentioned themes, resulted in continued coopera- tion on those themes between the towns involved. A follow-up on this thematic networking meeting will probably be held in Wronki in two years. Results Within the framework of the meeting, a charter of environmental protection was signed by the four cities involved in the project. Furthermore, a DVD and a website were produced and articles in the local press mentioned the meeting. A forthcoming meeting has been scheduled in Poland in for two years time in order to analyse the repercussions and progress made in terms of environmental protection. ",

Why: \u201cThe main idea of the project was to create an occasion for dialogue between civil society organisations from different European countries, as well as gathering organisations from regions with strong social and political problems from old and new member states.\u201d Feelings: \u201cThe project has been a very enrich- ing and inspiring experience and we would like to thank our partner organisations who played a very proactive and responsible role through- out the project\u201d. Difficulties: \u201cApart from a certain financial constraint, the most challenging difficulty was to manage a very large partnership that could represent different countries and realities of the EU.\u201d 18 19 EUROMED CARREFOUR SICILIA The Organized Civil Society: New Tasks in an Enlarged European Union Tips: How did we do it? Teambuilding: The project started with a teambuilding phase, where Euromed Carrefour Sicilia met with representatives from CEDAG (Comit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9en des Associations d\u2019 Inter\u00eat G\u00e9neral) and NCVO (National Council for Voluntary Organisations), in order to build up a team of organisations that could substantially contribute to the project. Sharing of responsibilities: All activities were organised and developed following a strict rule of direct involvement of all partners. Particularities: In Palermo, the project participants were guided by the NGO ECO \u2013 for responsible tourism, to a cooperative that works with organic farming and agro-tourism, using fields and properties that once were confiscated by the mafia. In Bucharest, a social theatre presentation was held on how to work with youngsters on topics like social inclusion, xenophobia, discrimination and respect for the environment. Follow-up: Organisations participating in the project were very inspired to form new partnerships and initiate trans-national projects, as well as exchange best practices on social theatre and role games for youngsters. Testimony of the jury \u201cThe project\u2019s subject area lies at the heart of all civil society organisations\u2019 field of com- petence. It sought to make the voice and the concerns of socially and economically deprived societies heard at the European level, as well as to invite representatives of the EU to con- sider their recommendations.\u201d Brenda King Member of the European Economic and Social Committee, President of the SOC Section. Themes The role of civil society organisations in the Euro- \u2022 pean integration process and in promoting active citizenship in Europe. The role of the European civil society in fighting \u2022 social, economic and political problems in areas affected by poverty, war and criminality. Objective Develop dialogue between civil societies in Euro- \u2022 pean countries, as well as between civil society and EU institutions Activities Project activities included two conferences to de- bate upon the themes of the project and to share best practices. The conferences included field visits to local organisations. The participants also had the opportunity to meet and have a dialogue with representatives from the European Commission. Partner organisations and geography Partner organisations came from Ro- mania, Czech Republic, Poland, United Kingdom, Austria and Portugal. All in all, 170 representatives from local and international organisations participated in the conferences. Duration The project ran for 10 months. Results A brochure was produced including a presentation on how the formal dialogue between civil society and different institutions works in each participating country. Furthermore, a website was created which is meant to be an instrument for communication among partners, who also networked to cooperate on future projects.

Europe is not just Brussels, Europe is all of its cities and there is a need to make Europe concrete to its citizens. We want to achieve this starting at the grass- roots level.\u201d The organisation Babel International publishes the online Magazine cafebabel.com, with 300 000 visitors a month and 30 000 registered recipients of their newsletter.

Babel International counts on local teams composed mainly of volunteers situated in 19 coun- tries. The project consisted of a series of interviews which was done by approximately 60 young \u201ccitizen journalists\u201d in eleven different European cities and of eleven local debates. The central editorial team chose young journalists from its network and sent them to different cities to write about some of the above mentioned themes. The articles were pub- lished in a format that allows further exchanges and debates on line. Participants, audience and geography The participants were 60 young citi- zen journalists from all over Europe and local civil society organisations that took part in the debates organised in the framework of the project. The audience consists of 300 000 visitors a month of cafeba- bel.com and participants at the locally arranged debates. Duration The project ran for 11 months. Results The articles written by the journalists got published on cafebabel.com, where they could be discussed on the blogs and forums of the e-community. The project offered mobility and international learning experience for the youth journalists that were sent to the different European cities and helped to organise debates with a European perspective on a local level. C I V I L S O C I E T Y P R O J E C T S BABEL INTERNATIONAL EUReporter Tips: How did we do it? Visibility: \u201cBy choosing themes and topics for the articles that are important on a local level and by involving the local civil society, we enhance the visibility of the project. Local topics seen through a European point of view create the best interest and visibility, as the citizens can identify themselves better with local issues.\u201d Follow-up: \u201cIn 2008/2009 we will launch a project called \u201cEU Campaign\u201d, with the aim to start series of debates regarding next year\u2019s European parliament elections.\u201d Testimony of the jury \u201cThe project offered a great opportunity for young Europeans to exchange experiences and acquire different cultural perspectives.\u201d Dominik Czapigo Representative of KARTA organisation, Poland, a partner organisation of a winner of a Golden Stars Award in 2007.

        "Interview with Ieva Grund\u0161teine and Joana Rozycka-Thiriet, project managers: Aim: \u201cThe main aim of the project was to involve young people in the discussion on the future of Europe, to show how the EU functions and to encourage young people to become leaders of promoting active European citizen- ship at the local level.\u201d Testimonies: Students and teachers participat- ing in the meeting: \u201cAfter this meeting I want to start a European Club. I want to use the contacts I gained here and also organise a simulation.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to start an e-twinning programme with a Polish school.\u201d Improvements: \u201cFor future projects, we would like to invite people from non-EU countries as we already are in contact with schools in Ukraine, Belarus and Georgia. We think that the participa- tion of those countries would add another dimension to our project.\u201d Difficulties: \u201cThe first difficulty was of financial character as the funds we received were not enough to invite as many people as we would have liked to. The second difficulty concerned the involvement of the part- ner organisations, although very willing to help out with organising the project; they were too far away geographically to be useful for this matter.\u201d 22 23 Contact Contact person: Maja Selan Tel: +48 22 621 21 61 E-mail: m.selan@schuman.org.pl Website: www.euroclubnetwork.eu Themes Inspire young people to be active European \u2022 citizens.

The simulation in itself, focusing on Turkey\u2019s entry into the EU, was conducted by trained multipliers. Participants and geography There were 20 secondary school students and teachers from Poland, Spain, Italy, Czech Republic, Latvia, Germany, France, Slovakia and Hungary par- ticipating in the meeting. Duration The project ran for 8 months. Results An interactive web site was created in order to form a basis for a network of European Clubs. European Clubs exist within the schools and are created by students and teachers with the aim to improve the knowledge of the EU. Bilateral partnerships have been initiated and the participating pupils and teachers got inspiration to carry out simulations in their home countries. The organisation The Polish Robert Schuman Foundation (PRSF) is a non-governmental, non-political organiza- tion established in 1991. Its aim is to encour- age Polish citizens to actively participate in the process of unifying Europe and to spread the idea of active participation, by organising various activities like conferences, trainings and debates. The PRSF is also one of the initia- tors of the Ukrainian-German-Polish Forum es- tablished in order to facilitate direct contacts between NGOs and citizens\u2019 initiatives in these three countries.

Learning by doing: \u201cIn the planning and the implementation of the project, we applied the principle by young people for young people and learning by doing. We wanted to make sure that the youngsters find the meeting interesting and appealing and we managed to create a very positive atmosphere among the participants, students and teachers by com- bining formal and informal methods.\u201d Visibility: \u201cWe made sure that information about the project was updated on our website and we also asked participants from different countries to make sure to publish information about the project on their own websites, as well as spreading it to the local media.\u201d Follow-up: \u201cMany of the participating schools have already implemented their own projects together, for example exchanges and e-twinnings.\u201d CCCCCCCCCCCCC Testimony of the jury \u201cIf the EU is to be a success, the younger gen- eration must feel a sense of ownership of the institution.

Examination of the conflicting national, political \u2022 and ethnic perspectives of Nazi repression, in order to come to an overall understanding of the Nazi terror and its manifestations (i.e. extermina- tion camps). Europe-wide reflection on the future of \u2022 remembrance. Activities This was a 3-phase project, consisting of the col- lection of international victims\u2019 testimonies from different prisoner groups of the Dachau Concentra- tion Camp, a symposium about the content and methods of mediating victim testimonials and finally a documentation and evaluation of the project with international youth groups. The symposium made it possible to present and discuss testimonies of the second and third generation of the families of the concentration camp survivors. Participants and geography The participants were survivors, about 40 descendants and representatives of the succeeding generations which ensured an inter- generational aspect of the project. Furthermore, about 30 research and education specialists in the field attended the symposium. The participants came from France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Hun- gary, Romania, Czech Republic, Austria, Luxemburg, Slovenia, Germany, Bulgaria, Poland and Israel. Duration The project ran for 12 months. Results Hitherto, the perception of the Dachau concentra- tion camp in the documentary exhibition as well as in other education opportunities for visitors was shaped by the view of German survivors alone. The results of this project will be published in form of documentation and the plan is to complement the documentary exhibition at the Dachau Concentration Camp Memorial Site with views of victims of other nationalities. The organisation The International Dachau Committee was created in 1958 by survivors from the Dachau concentration camp. The organisation estab- lished the Dachau Concentration Camp Me- morial Site in 1965. CID aims to preserve and commemorate the main sites associated with the deportations to the Dachau concentration camp as well as maintain and archive histori- cally valuable materials.

Follow-up: \u201cThis project being part of an ongo- ing process at the Dachau Concentration Camp Memorial Site, the follow-up and continuity are self-evident. Our aim for the future is to contin- ue to raise awareness and transfer knowledge of the individual destinies and testimonies of the Nazi terror system, the Second World War and the Holocaust to coming generations.\u201d THE INTERNATIONAL DACHAU COMMITTEE The Transnational Culture of Remembrance at the Dachau Concentration Camp Memorial Site: Preserving the International Victims Testimonies for Future Generations Interview with Dr Annette Eberle, project manager: Aim: \u201cThe original idea of the project was to strengthen the memorial site as an internation- al place of reflection, by integrating the differ- ent views on the meaning of remembrance of the second and third generations from various countries.\u201d Feelings: \u201cThe most impressing feature of the project was the multitude of different destinies and paths taken by survivors after the libera- tion from the Dachau Concentration Camp, as well as the various ways to share their experi- ences with their families and with society.\u201d Testimonies: \u201cMy father chose life, not death.\u201d Descendant of survivor explains why her father chose not to tell her about his imprisonment and survival at the concentration camp.\u201d Difficulties: \u201cThe discussions at the sym- posium showed the possibilities, but also the difficulties of an understanding between generations, nationalities and descendants of survivors and research and education special- ists in the area.\u201d Testimony of the jury \u201cThis project represents a consistent effort not to abandon and forget the past without first drawing lessons to build the future. The prize goes to the overall and continuous endeavour to preserve the memories of the victims of Nazism.\u201d Brenda King, Member of the European Economic and Social Committee, President of the SOC Section.

        "Interview with Zuzana Dra\u017eilov\u00e1, project manager: Feelings: \u201cThe strongest feeling is that we participated in communicating something until now unknown from the world and in particular for the Czech Republic and for Slovakia. I also feel that we entirely fulfilled our planned goal to let young people take part of information about the unknown and interesting past of the Stalinist era in former Czechoslovakia.\u201d Testimonies: \u201cThe remarkable thing about our project is that the testimonies in themselves are the project. Furthermore, all those testi- monies together are offering a very compre- hensive picture about the 1950s in former Czechoslovakia.\u201d Difficulties: \u201cThe major difficulty was to receive the proper co-financing to the grant of the European Commission. Finally, after or- ganising a press conference in the Parliament of the Czech Republic, co-financing from the authorities of the Czech Republic was agreed upon. This support mainly came from the Ministry of Culture of the Czech Republic and Administration of Major City of Prague.\u201d Improvements: \u201cWe would also like to shoot testimonies with the sons of political prison- ers of the 1950s in former Czechoslovakia. We consider this as a complement to the inter- views with the daughters.\u201d 26 27 Themes Stalinism and its impact on the descendants \u2022 of political prisoners in the 1950s in former Czechoslovakia.

Duration The project ran for 1 year. Activities This documentary project combines collection of oral testimonies and the production of audiovisual archives. Students from FAMU \u2013 a film school in Prague, shot and edited interviews with daughters of political prisoners during the Stalinism era in former Czechoslovakia. Participants/Audiences and geography Students from FAMU film school and the daughters of the political prisoners. The project took place in the Czech Republic, but the testimonies will also be distributed to Slovakia, Germany, Italy, Poland and other European countries. Results A first presentation screening took place in March 2008 during the international human rights docu- mentary film festival \u201cOne World\u201d in Prague. The testimonies will be circulated to elementary and secondary schools in the Czech Republic and in Slo- vakia as from September 2008 and they will also be deposited in the archive of the Oral History Centre \u2013 Institute of Contemporary History (Academy of Sci- ences of the Czech Republic) in Prague. During 2009 the testimonies will be shown in schools in Italy and Germany. As a result of the project, the daughters of political prisoners registered their own civic associ- ation \u201cDaughters of 1950s\u201d with the Czech Ministry of Interior. The organisation The Czech citizens association \u201cNGO Docs, Youth and Society\u201d was established in 2006 by film producer Zuzana Drazilova, together with Vladislav and Jiri Marek. It belongs to the network of the International Oral History Association (IOHA), Czech Oral History Asso- ciation (COHA) and the European Documentary Network (EDN). The main goal is to produce audiovisual work on themes like Stalinism, the Holocaust, Anti-Semitism, social justice, racism etc. R E M E M B R A N C E P R O J E C T S Tips: How did we do it? Methods: \u201cWe used the modern audiovisual technology to produce audiovisual archives of the testimonies from the daughters. Further- more, the shooting of the interviews made by film students was supervised by Helena Tres- tikova, a popular Czech director of documen- tary films. The consultant during the shooting of the testimonies was Ms Jana Svehlova, the author of the doctorate thesis \u201cEnemies\u2019 Daughters\u201d from 1999 and originator of the self-support group of the daughters of politi- cal prisoners.\u201d Visibility: \u201cWe made large publicity for the project while realising it. The information was communicated in different newspapers, maga- zines, to radio stations and on websites and also through some programmes on the public Czech television.\u201d NGO DOCS, YOUTH AND SOCIETY Daughters of the Enemy Testimony of the jury \u201cI like this project because it employs innova- tive methods and highlights a subject that rarely receives much attention; it offers an op- portunity to learn new aspects of the European history\u201d.

        "Interview with Marta Van\u010durov\u00e1, project manager: Aim: \u201cWe wanted young people to be interested in the local history of the almost destroyed Jewish com- munity and other minorities, caused by the Holocaust. At the same time, we wanted the project to include testimonies from witnesses and bystanders of the Holo- caust, bringing survivors from small cities and villages to inform in local schools. This would allow the pupils to discover personal stories and create a personal picture of the life of an individual who lived during the Second World War.\u201d Feelings: \u201cWe were genuinely surprised how much a project like this could bring to young people today. The further we got into the project, the more we saw the deep historical, social and individual impact of the project through the response from the pupils and the teachers.\u201d Improvements: \u201cWhat we could improve is to do better PR for the project and enhance our cooperation with the Czech TV, as well as having more meetings together and better administration.\u201d Difficulties: \u201cThe fact that we are depend- ent on sponsors creates the insecurity of not knowing whether it will be possible to continue the dissemination of the project next year. On the other hand, this problem can also be an advantage. Inspired by the Ministry of Culture we made a video documentation of the project to be able to spread the project to other European countries, even if we won\u2019t have the sources or possibilities to travel with it anymore.\u201d 28 29 Themes To engage young people to learn more about the \u2022 Holocaust and to spread awareness about Jewish children who disappeared and were killed during the Holocaust in the Czech Republic. Activities The organisation supported a travelling exhibition to Germany, Italy, the UK and USA of the extensive project The Neighbours Who Disappeared. The history of the project goes back to the Education and Culture Centre of the Jewish Museum in Prague in 1999. Back then, students carried out research into local archives and gathered oral history from witnesses and survivors about children who disap- peared from their neighbourhood during the Second World War. Their work resulted in small exhibitions of panels that were later merged to create this trav- elling exhibition. Participants/Audiences Youngsters between 12\u201321 years old. Duration The project ran for 11 months. Results and geography With the international, travelling aspect of the exhibition, the project gained a strong European and international dimension as well as great visibility as it reached more than 1.300 students all over Europe. A network of organisations with similar activities was established. The organisation The Forgotten Ones Citizens\u2019 Association is an independent citizens\u2019 organisation founded in 2002 with the main objective to support history-related alternative educational activi- ties in Czech schools and make young people interested in topics concerning the Holocaust. The association is closely cooperating with different national institutions and NGOs in the Czech Republic. R E M E M B R A N C E P R O J E C T S Tips: How did we do it? Methods: \u201cFor each country, we produced a customised version of the exhibition, in line with the country\u2019s requests, along with the accompanying catalogues in English. Further- more, we applied the methods of oral history, multimedia education tools, long term student training projects and peer education.\u201d Visibility: \u201cIn the very beginning we asked for the allowance to be under the official auspices of Czech officials. The first years we arranged official presentations of the project in the Parliament and in the Senate. We involved schools in different countries to make PR for the project, encouraging them to contact local media. The Jewish Museum in Prague pro- motes the project as part of their seminars.\u201d THE FORGOTTEN ONES The Neighbours Who Disappeared \u2013 Tribute of the Child Holocaust Victims Testimony of the jury \u201cThe project is appealing as it stimulates awareness raising of our common European destiny in an original and creative way\u201d.
