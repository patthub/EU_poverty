        "C o u n t ry R e p o rt ZAMBIA Mosi-ao-tunya - the smoke that thunders - is what the local people call Victoria Falls, their greatest tourist attraction. Most Zambians recognise the potential of their country. They are frustrated that their efforts have not been more successful but they continue to work to improve their quality of life. Victoria Falls Dossier AN AGEING WORLD Older People are in the spotlight this year, with the launch of the UN International Year of Older Persons. The demographic profile of the world is changing - the over 60s is the fastest- growing sector of the population. There are about 580 million people over 60 in the world today - and two thirds of them are in the developing world. By 2020 this population will spi ral to 700 million. Such an increase in longevity - largely due to better med ical care and lower fertility rates - can be rated as one of the success stories of this century. But how can the quali ty of life of older people be assured? How prepared are developing coun tries for the demographic time bomb around the corner? At 85, Adera Karwirungu looked after 10 orphans in Rwanda, in the aftermath of the conflict. ",

        "Dr Nana Apt, President of the African Gerontological Society ' O l d er p e o p le do n ot g et t h e ir f a ir share of d e v e l o p m e nt a i d' |2 Dr Nana Apt is deeply k\u00ab involved in issues concern\u00ad I ing the elderly. As well as I teaching gerontology at I the University of Ghana, I she is President of the I African Gerontological So\u00ad I ciety (AGES International), I which was set up in 1989. I Its purpose is to raise I awareness among govern\u00ad | ments, NGOs and civil so\u00ad ciety of the plight of the elderly in Africa. She believes that the con\u00ad tinent is undergoing a social re\u00ad volution, with sometimes disas\u00ad trous consequences for older peo\u00ad ple, who are being left behind. Africa, she points out, is experien\u00ad cing an age boom which will peak in the year 2025 \u00ad and nobody is prepared for it. We had the op\u00ad portunity to meet Dr Apt at the African Gerontological Society (AGES) Workshop in Nairobi in April. She began by outlining the demographic trends and explain\u00ad ing why issues relating to old age are of increasing importance. \u00ad At present in Africa, I would say that older people (60 and over) make up between 3% and 5% of the total population. The small size of the elderly popu\u00ad lation \u00a1s one factor which has made their concerns somewhat invisible. Africa has huge numbers of children and young people and priority is usually given to pro\u00ad blems such as infant mortality and youth unemployment. But demographic trends show that the world is experiencing an age boom, and the largest increases are now occurring in the develop\u00ad ing countries. Indeed, it is esti\u00ad mated that the number of Africans aged 60 and over will increase from 23 million in 1980 to 102 million in 2025. This rate of in\u00ad crease is more than twice that expected in developed countries over the same period. What is different in Africa is that we will end up with rural segregration of older persons. It won't be intentional, but will happen because of significant mi\u00ad gration by young people to urban areas. And with more people living longer, by 2025 we are not just going to have grandparents, but also great\u00adgrandparents. House\u00ad holds of four generations will become the norm. We can't cope at the moment with grandparents, so how will we manage such a scenario? There is no pension or social security to speak of in Africa, outside South Africa and Namibia. \u25a0 You have said that western models of social security are not appropriate in Africa. What are the alternatives? \u00ad If you know the history of South Africa, you know that for a long time before the country was liberalised, it was operating a first world model. Their answer to old age was to build old people's homes. I visited some of these and they were like five\u00adstar hotels. As soon as people hit 60, off they went. Some of the people I spoke to in these homes had been there for 18 years. Others were healthy and strong and, to my mind, shouldn't have been there at all. They should not have been re\u00ad moved from their houses. Now this is changing in South Africa^. In fact, it is one of the first African countries to come up with a policy. It was quite a struggle to make people believe institutionalisation should only be for the very frail, who need continuous care. They now see that community\u00adbased care is the way to go. \u25a0 So you think community\u00adbased care is a good model for the rest of Africa ? \u00ad Yes. I think it is the best model, but this doesn't mean it should be a burden on the family, as it was seen to be in the past. From an African perspective, we need to look at our own function\u00ad ing capacity and take account of our own cultural base. Then we can decide how to modernise. We don't have the resources to hand out so we need structures that build on what we have, and help integrate the old into the commu\u00ad nity. \u25a0 How does that fit in with the trend of young people leaving the countryside and moving into urban centres? \u00ad Caring for elderly people involves looking at the community in its broadest context. It is about the actual development of the nation and the kind of society that we want. In most of Africa, the focus is on urban\u00adbased develop\u00ad ment, so it is not surprising that young people, after some educa\u00ad tion, are moving into the towns and cities. Rural areas are ne\u00ad glected and do not get a proper share of development. We have to make it possible for people to stay, and this means that resources have to be put into the rural areas. It means bringing in industry and employment, and improving hous\u00ad ing, healthcare and social facilities. Many people in my country would gladly move from the cities back to their communities where they are known, because they are fed up with the crowded conditions. Rural development is a must to attract people home. \u25a0 There is a perception of society in Africa as a sort of gerontocracy, where older people play an im\u00ad portant role, are valued for their wisdom and are cared for. But we \u0392 the Courier n\u00b0 176 \u00ad july\u00adaugust 1999 ",
        "have heard at this workshop that the cultural context is changing, and that the elderly are becoming more vulnerable and isolated. \u00ad Gerontocracy hinges on economic power. In the past, old people had power. They were the mainstay of the family, managing property, money and resources. The young needed them to get married, to choose names for their children, to get apprenticed and so on. So older people were en\u00ad trenched within their families. Now, with education, the roles have been reversed. It is the young people who are better educated, and who have jobs and money. They no longer need their grand\u00ad parents to find them a wife, or pay a dowry. This has eroded the power of older people, who are also getting poorer because they are not educated or literate, and can't fit into the modern economy. \u25a0 Defining old age is difficult. In developed countries, it tends to be linked to the retirement age but this concept of retirement has little relevance for most Africans. \u00ad The majority of old peo\u00ad ple in Africa have to remain eco\u00ad nomically active much longer than their western counterparts, and do not retire. They can't afford it, because pensions and social secur\u00ad ity only come with formal employ\u00ad ment, which is linked, in turn, to modern education and skills which most old people do not have. \u25a0 What has to be done to recog\u00ad nise the contribution of older people ? \u00ad The time has come to get our governments to begin focusing on this and prepare for the future. Old people should not be viewed merely as dependents, but as part\u00ad ners in development. At present, they work very hard without re\u00ad cognition, or adequate resources. Ways have to be found to enable them to live in a dignified way. They must be given what they deserve. \u25a0 Do you think there should be a charter of rights for older people, as there is for children ? \u00ad I think a policy on old age should be developed in Afri\u00ad can states. Many countries, such as Ghana and Uganda, have begun to discuss this. Policy has to be based on needs, and this requires first and foremost that studies be car\u00ad ried out. The policies cannot be formulated without the research. The main aim of AGES is to raise awareness of ageing issues within African governments, NGOs, and civil society. A very important component of our work is gener\u00ad ating data, through studies, to be used as the basis for developing policy. Workshops are held every three years. We take a theme and produce a report at the conclusion of the session. This year, it is about issues taking us to the millennium, with a special focus on the crisis that we will face by 2025. We are urging governments to start ser\u00ad iously developing policies. We are also looking at the problem of conflict, migration arising out of conflicts, and the impact of AIDS on older people. We have asked the participants to prepare a docu\u00ad ment on the formal and informal support systems that exist in their countries. This will be the baseline information, and the AGES re\u00ad search committee will put this together and draw up a proposal. We have to know how support systems are working in our coun\u00ad tries. In spite of poverty and modernisation, the family is still the mainstay of older people. We need to know what aspects of the system still work, where break\u00ad downs are occurring, and why we are unable to continue as we did in the past. In this way, new models can be fashioned, based on what already exists. \u25a0 You have said that an ageing society will be a female society. \u00ad Yes, and that is true of the whole world. Women's life expectancy is 10% greater than that of men. But longevity is not necessarily a joy for an African woman. Being left widowed can bring problems. She may be pushed out of the marital home. We have only recently had legisla\u00ad t i on in Ghana s a f e g u a r d i ng Residents of an old people's home in Lesotho. 'Community\u00adbased care is the way to go. Institutionalisation should only be for the very frail' widows from this. Also, because most women have performed the role of homemaker and have not been in the employment arena as wage earners, they do not have capital or resources. So longevity frequently means a deteriorating standard of living.\u00b7 Without re\u00ad sources, women are forced to con\u00ad tinue working until they are phy\u00ad sically unable to do so. Another thing is that their health needs are often neglected. Women need help so that they can survive in a dignified way when they are old. \u25a0 On the international develop\u00ad ment agenda, do you think that ageing needs to be given more attention? \u00ad I don't think it features highly enough either on interna\u00ad tional or indeed national agendas. It has not received much attention, and many international organisa\u00ad tions do not even consider the question. When they look at Afri\u00ad ca, they see a top\u00adheavy popula\u00ad tion of children and young people. But even if older people are a minority you can't let them perish. There is a crisis, and we must find ways to tackle it. A country can be judged by the way it treats its old people. My hope is that in this, the Inter\u00ad national Year of Older Persons, the subject will grab the limelight. I want development agencies to begin looking at ageing as a development issue. In contrast to the developed countries, older people in Africa are not depen\u00ad dent. They are involved in main\u00ad stream activities and should not be excluded from projects or credit schemes just because of their age. At the moment, older people do not get their fair share of devel\u00ad opment aid. \u25a0\u25a0 Interview by D.M. the Courier n\u00b0 176 \u00ad july\u00adaugust 1999 \u0392 ",
        "A f r i ca t h r o u gh w o m e n 's eyes I Some 200 women were ex\u00ad I pected to attend the Pan\u00ad I African Women's Conference I for Peace organised by UN\u00ad I ESCO in Zanzibar from 17 to I 20 May 1999. In the event, I nearly 300 were present, \u00a1n\u00ad I eluding government minis\u00ad I ters, researchers, experts, I members of associations, I educationalists and ordinary I active campaigners. Many of I them, it would appear, paid I their own travelling ex\u00ad I penses. From the four cor\u00ad I ners of the continent, they ^ ^^ all had just one aim in mind as they arrived on the Tanzanian island: to calm down the climate of escalating violence and to restore peace. From Botswana to Algeria, from Namibia to Burundi, from Ethiopia to Liberia, the stated desire of all these women was to put an end to the conflicts which are ruin\u00ad ing their continent and killing their children. They were prepared to overcome taboos, discuss demilitar\u00ad isation and the arms trade, and bear witness to the horrors of war \u00ad they were ready, even, to call into ques\u00ad tion the legitimacy of their coun\u00ad tries' governments. Above all, they were prepared to speak with one voice. Between t wo and four million people have been killed in wars waged in Africa in recent decades, the majority being wo\u00ad men and children. In Rwanda alone, over a period of barely three months, nearly one million were killed. Twice as many are now refugees. Yesterday, Mozam\u00ad bique and Liberia, today Guinea Bissau and the Comoro Islands. Then there are the many conflicts which seem to have gone on for ever: Angola, Sierra Leone, Su\u00ad dan. All are conflicts whose ori\u00ad gins are deeply rooted in their continent's history, in the history of colonialism, and in Africa's socio\u00adeconomic marginalisation and its poverty. A revealing ob\u00ad servation. Yet the will is there. According to Gertrude Mongella, elected president of the Zanzibar conference, 'Conflict has torn Africa apart. We women are the ones to rebuild it'. Just like all her fellow delegates, Ms Mongella, w ho was General Secretary of the World Conference of Women in Beijing in 1995, wanted this meet\u00ad ing to constitute a turning point in history or, at the very least, a strategic milestone. This was not the first time that Africa's women had met together. Many of them had attended the Beijing confer\u00ad ence and other, similar confer\u00ad ences on peace and development which had taken place in recent years in Dakar, Johannesburg and Kigali. It was out of these meet\u00ad ings that a 'henceforth irreversi\u00ad ble' Pan\u00adAfrican Women's Peace Movement was born. More so than the other conferences, Zan\u00ad zibar was to result in real strate\u00ad gies and a genuine agenda \u00ad precisely what is needed to help Africa\u00adat\u00adwar make the transition to Africa\u00adat\u00adpeace. Involving women The Zanzibar conference would have made a striking im\u00ad pression on those unaccustomed to this type of meeting \u00ad all debate and discussion seemed to draw inspiration from a spirit of solidarity. Ethnic, religious and tribal\u00adbased differences seemed to have been almost forgotten to the extent that it was some\u00ad times difficult to remember that some of these women's countries were at war with one another. Only faces and dress distinguished a Bantu from a delegate from the Western Sahara. This feeling of reaching out beyond national borders was accentuated by the fact that all these women would describe themselves, first and foremost, as mothers. Neverthe\u00ad less, when it came to voting on a text, the ties of sisterhood grew somewhat more indistinct. Their testimony referred primarily to children \u00ad abducted children, chil\u00ad dren enrolled in the armed forces, mutilated children and children deprived of their education. 'Education in the ways of peace \u00ad and in the problems involved \u00ad must begin at a very young age and form the corner\u00ad s t o ne of e d u c a t i o n al p r o\u00ad grammes'. More was to come: an end to violence and greater equality between men and wo\u00ad men, at all levels and in all spheres, was advocated. In this respect, the women clearly held strong opinions that they wished to express, had experiences they intended to share and proposals to formulate. Experiences were many, such as those of the 10 or so Sudanese women from a vari\u00ad ety of ethnic, linguistic and reli\u00ad gious backgrounds, who met to\u00ad gether in order to share their thoughts on the role they might play in constructing the peace. A group of women's associations from Rwanda were working to raise awareness of peace. Some Somali women had gone to the barracks of various tribes to de\u00ad mand the laying\u00addown of weap\u00ad ons, using songs as their only means of pressure. There were many similar examples of women \u0392 the Courier n\" 176 \u00ad july\u00adaugust 1999 ",
        "a c \u03c1 having taken action, sometimes just through traditional mechan\u00ad isms, unknown to their leaders. In parallel, a growing number of often extra\u00adterritorial networks were being successfully set up. A fundamental require\u00ad ment on the part of Africa's women was that they should be able to play a full part in conflict prevention and peace negotia\u00ad tions. They rejected any future role in which they were just the victims of war or were excluded from the negotiating table. They also demanded that they be in\u00ad cluded in the d\u00e9mocratisation process. In other words, the wo\u00ad men wanted more power \u00ad 'Not for the sake of power itself, but in order to improve the human condition', added Speciosa Ka\u00ad zibwe, Uganda's Vice\u00adPresident. They called for their full partici\u00ad pation at all levels and in all sectors. But 'there is many a slip 'twixt cup and lip'. This is a struggle in which they are hope\u00ad lessly outnumbered \u00ad it is usually assumed that 96% of decisions are taken by men, less than one tenth of members of parliament world\u00adwide are women, and the number is even smaller in Africa. By the same token, 99% of the world's economic resources are held by men. These data are in sharp contrast to the major eco\u00ad nomic and social role played by women in daily life. 'An end to exploitation; an end to margin\u00ad alisation' \u00ad these phrases were repeated several times over in Zanzibar, each time to thunder\u00ad ous applause. According to the dele\u00ad gates, 'There needs to be a change in attitude, firstly within the family, then at village level and then within the tribal sys\u00ad tem'. A challenge to the patriar\u00ad chal system, therefore, and the abandonment of deep\u00adrooted prejudices against women? Weapons, the scourge of Africa Although a reduction in conflict would come about as a result of a peaceful environment being established within families \u00ad better nutrition, education, etc. \u00ad it would also require a demili\u00ad tarisation of the continent, ac\u00ad cording to these African women. The majority thought this should happen now. Others felt that weapons are still needed to pro\u00ad tect a country's borders against potential aggressors and even to guarantee domestic peace. On this issue, the unified voice heard throughout the opening sessions and the workshops rapidly did a U\u00adturn, unfortunately silenced by a return to political reality. A b e t t er r e c e p t i on awaited the condemnation of the arms trade. This received total support. Governments and parlia\u00ad ments in Africa were given a proper dressing down, the wo\u00ad men imploring them to cut back their enormous military expendi\u00ad ture and to re\u00addirect these re\u00ad sources towards education, devel\u00ad opment and health. 'Reorienta\u00ad tion' was the watchword. They also called for the enrolment of children into the armed forces to cease and, if necessary, for their countries' leaders to change also. 'We're convinced that, with good heads of State, we will have no need for weapons with which to protect ourselves.' The 'quality' of leadership is reflected in the 'quality' of the State \u00ad Africa's women also pointed a finger at the West which, more often than not, supplies the military, rebels and other mercenaries. The 'quality' of the international organisations was also highlighted. Some of the women, for example, advocated the (overdue) modernisation of the OAU (Organisation of African Unity), 'which should serve the people and not the governments; which should no longer forget certain conflicts, like the one in Sudan'. Above all, communicate The text of the final de\u00ad claration stated: 'We, the women of Africa, wholeheartedly recom\u00ad mend effective access to tools and to appropriate communications technology, and to the latter's use, in order to step up the current creation of networks and to strengthen solidarity'. Commu\u00ad nication, information and knowl\u00ad edge spearheading the transition towards peace. One delegate la\u00ad mented the fact that 'when wo\u00ad men marched for peace in Sierra Leone, we heard nothing about it. When genocide was taking place in Rwanda, we received only very little information'. Receiving precise informa\u00ad tion on conflicts and peace issues allows one to plan, to take deci\u00ad the Courier n\u00b0 176 \u00ad july\u00adaugust 1999 \u0392 ",
        "a c \u03c1 sions and to act. This is actually difficult for women, who are often cut off from sources of information, particularly in rural areas. Yet access to and use of the media is also a way in which to change attitudes and to combat stereotypes \u00ad but which medium? Access to the written medium remains difficult, as many women in Africa are illiterate. Neverthe\u00ad less, there are songs, plays, and information centres, plus \u00ad ob\u00ad viously and primarily \u00ad radio, which is still the preferred way in which to circulate information \u00ad including messages of peace \u00ad to raise awareness and to mobi\u00ad lise. Not the propagandist radio all too frequently used in times of war, but a radio medium permit\u00ad ting women to express them\u00ad selves. Is this a workable propo\u00ad sal? A delegate from Central African Republic suggested, for example, setting up a partnership with the United Nations mission in her country, 'because it has country\u00adwide radio coverage'. Others were setting their sights beyond this and expressed a desire to set up a pan\u00adAfrican radio service, to cover the whole continent and broadcasting in 'non\u00adimposed' languages. Off the record Other proposals and stra\u00ad tegies were also discussed. A Women's agenda for peace in Africa was drawn up and a Zanzi\u00ad bar Declaration drafted. All the women mentioned time and again the masculinity of the con\u00ad flicts tearing Africa apart. The view in the conference hall was that 'wars are caused by only one sex: men'. It was not that they rejected the idea of working together with their male collea\u00ad gues; there was no question of 'taking over'. Quite the contrary, in fact. What they wanted was a genuine partnership and genuine support \u00ad not only from men, but also from the private sector, inter\u00ad national organisations and civil society. So, what of tomorrow? If women were to take the place of men, would they be more 'peace\u00ad ful'? One has to suppose that they would be. Yet it is regretta\u00ad ble that representatives and ob\u00ad servers in Zanzibar did not discuss the involvement of women in war. Is it not the case that there are women who also take up arms, who play an active role in a conflict and even aggravate it? The genocide in Rwanda took place not so very long ago. Furthermore, the gulf sometimes separating many of these women from life in the village and from r I lyAoj 1 \u03bd \\\"r \u25bc L|_S m \\\u039b v. i\u00df \u00abt \u00bb \u2022 village associations is sometimes difficult to bridge. During the workshops, in particular, partici\u00ad pants commented that their Afri\u00ad can sisters should be more realis\u00ad tic and should give greater recog\u00ad nition to \u00ad or at the very least not conceal \u00ad work at grass\u00adroots level, particularly in the field of education. This conference will also be remembered for the tone adopted by many of the women. Although many, admittedly, kept to the official line, none of them hesitated at speaking out. Their testimony left its mark. Whether at the plenary sessions, during the workshops or in private conversa\u00ad tion, some of them went straight to the point, pouring scorn on stereotyped, politically correct language. In this way they were able to give full expression to their horror of war, condemning rape, child abduction, gratuitous mutilation, torture and the esca\u00ad lation of inhuman acts. 'The rainy season is about to start. Only the Lord our God knows how many children and pregnant women will be able to survive it', lamen\u00ad ted Fatimata Deen from Sierra Leone. Are women more than ever the future of Africa? On emerging from the conference, some \u00ad mostly men \u00ad questioned how much faith could be placed in all these proposals. Would all these promising speeches actually bear fruit? There is scepticism on two fronts \u00ad firstly because Africa continues to project an image of conflict; secondly, above all, be\u00ad cause these proposals were put forward by women. Despite good intentions, the issue is one of gender and, ultimately, is just so much hot air. Women might be campaigning for peace, but they also have to campaign for better living conditions. Women should be aware of the role they have to play and their strength should no longer be ignored. If one were to pick out just one aspect of this 'Pan\u00adAfri\u00ad can Conference', it would per\u00ad haps come from the informal meetings which took place out\u00ad side conference hours. Women from Eritrea and Ethiopia would gather around a table, discuss issues and listen to one another's views. They decided to continue negotiation and to attempt to influence their leaders. Women from the Sudan did the same, and were imitated by women from the Comoro Islands and by representatives from all the coun\u00ad tries in the Great Lakes region.

        "A l do A j e l lo on c o n f l i ct in t he G r e at Lakes r e g i on Africa's Great Lakes region is plagued with instability. What began in August 1998 as an internal civil rebellion against President Kabila of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) still threatens to develop into a wider con flict. The situation has prompted the Southern Afri\u00ad can Development Commu\u00ad nity (SADC) to launch a med\u00ad iation initiative. On a recent visit to Zam\u00ad bia, The Courier met Aldo Ajello, the EU's Special Envoy to the Great Lakes Region, who spoke about the progress of the SADC initia\u00ad tive. Summarising the situation as 'a Congolese civil war which really requires an internal solution' he nonetheless pointed out that there were cross\u00adborder complications. The Rwandan government is still fighting remnants of the former Rwandan army (FAR) and Hutu militias (Interahamwe) responsible for the genocide, who operate from across the frontier. Uganda and Burundi say that rebels are using the DRC as a base for incursions into their territories. Meanwhile, some SADC countries are providing military support to President Kabila. These are the complex elements with which the mediators have to contend. The initiative is being spearheaded by a troika consisting of Zambia (re\u00ad presented by President Chiluba), Tanzania and Mozambique. Mr Ajello explained that the EU has no official mediation role in Africa (this is the task of the UN, the OAU and sub\u00adregional organisations such as SADC and ECOWAS). But it is ready to offer support when required to facili\u00ad tate preventive diplomacy, conflict management and the peacekeep\u00ad ing initiatives of other organisa\u00ad tions. Our interviewee has had a lot of experience in preventive diplomacy and mediation (pre\u00ad vious missions include Mozambi\u00ad que, Tadjikstan and Nagorno Kar\u00ad abak). His present task is to follow closely the peace process in the DRC and Burundi, and help the 15 EU countries formulate a common approach. In addition, his inputs are often welcomed by the African stakeholders involved. He explained how the SADC troika are overcoming three initial bottlenecks as a precursor to substantive negotiations. 'The pro\u00ad blems revolved around who would be accepted as recognised partners in the ceasefire talks; who would preside over Congo's internal peace negotiations once the cease\u00ad fire was in place; and what should be done about the remnants of the former Rwandan army and the Hutu militias.' Clearly, no ceasefire could work without the commitment of the rebel groups. Despite this, there was initial disagreement about whether to allow them to take part in the negotiations, to include them through proximity talks only, or to bar them alto\u00ad gether. 'Eventually,' Aldo Ajello told us, 'all parties \u00ad including President Kabila \u00ad accepted the principle of admitting the rebels as full negotiating partners, irre\u00ad spective of whether they had started t he c o n f l i ct and of whether this had been with sup\u00ad port from external forces.' As regards the proposed internal talks in the DRC, another principle was successfully agreed. 'The negotiations between the government and all the opposition forces \u00ad armed and unarmed \u00ad will be presided over by an interna\u00ad tional personality. Indeed, it was Laurent Kabila himself who sug\u00ad gested approaching the St Egidio community (a Catholic lay organi\u00ad sation which has experience in peace mediation). The aim is to reach an agreement whereby, fol\u00ad lowing a transitional period, gen\u00ad eral elections will be prepared.' Mr Ajello continued: 'At the regional level, the talks should lead to a guarantee of security for the neighbouring countries. To achieve this, all parties have ac\u00ad cepted that the FAR and Intera\u00ad hamwe must be disarmed and relocated.' He believes that the presence of these forces in the Congo has already led to t wo outbreaks of war and that the conflicts will continue if they re\u00ad main in situ. Offering an insight into what peace mediation entails, he explained that a mediator has to identify a realistic way out of a crisis which takes account of the interests of all the parties. Even more important is to get them to accept solutions and actually im\u00ad plement them. The job is based on teamwork and takes time. Every peace process has its own dynamic, and things cannot be rushed even if a quick solution is desired. A good mediator needs to be able to judge when extra time is needed to facilitate negotiations and also to recognise obstructive time\u00adwast\u00ad ing. Support for the SADC in\u00ad itiative has come from a number of sources \u00ad the EU, the OAU and most recently f r om President Ghaddafi of Libya. 'An interesting aspect,' according to Mr Ajello, 'is the solidarity displayed by the SADC members.' Despite recent bilateral problems between Ango\u00ad la and Zambia, President Chiluba's role as mediator in the Congo crisis has not been damaged (the conflict in Angola is another un\u00ad solved conflict). There is sense of pride within SADC that their orga\u00ad nisation is taking a lead role in the mediation. Aldo Ajello favours a major international meeting on security and cooperation in the Great Lakes region, based on the Eur\u00ad opean (CSCE) model. He told us that having pushed for such a conference, the idea now seems to be 'gaining ground'. A UN Security Council document, ap\u00ad proved on 9 April, reaffirmed the importance of holding such a gathering, at an appropriate time, under UN and OAU auspices. Mr Ajello maintains that the instru\u00ad ments currently available to Afri\u00ad cans to prevent or manage crises are inadequate. 'We need either to strengthen existing instruments or create new ones. Such a con\u00ad ference would be extremely useful in building a new partnership between the international commu\u00ad nity and African countries for dealing with the post Cold War world. As such, it would help create the conditions for the joint management of crises.' \u25a0\u25a0 co. the Courier n\u00b0 176 \u00ad july\u00adaugust 1999 \u0392 ",
        "U The European e l e c t i o ns - w h at n e x t? by Natalie Massart* Voters in the EU have re cently been to the polling stations to elect a new Eur opean Parliament. Such elec tions take place every five years and, on this occasion, mark an undeniable increase in the powers of the Parlia ment compared with the other European institutions. The challenges are consider able: greater institutional transparency, negotiations on expansion into Eastern Europe and greater harmo nisation of policies between the fifteen Member States. European identity is as yet a vague notion but one that is slowly gaining ground in the 15 countries of the Union. Although still tending to define themselves in terms of nationality, more and more people are spontaneously * Journalist at the RTBF describing themselves as 'Eur opean'. Such is the case, for ex ample, in Belgium or Germany - it is much less so in the United Kingdom. The European Commis sion's most recent Eurobarometer survey found that 60% of British citizens felt themselves to be Brit ish, pure and simple. Similar natio nalistic sentiments are shared by Portuguese (62%) and Swedish (59%). The sense of belonging to one and the same community is thus still in its infancy. The new rights accorded to Europe's citi zens - freedom of movement, right of residence anywhere with in EU territory and the right to vote in municipal and European elections - are apparently not yet sufficient to generate such senti ment. Undoubtedly it will increase when citizens reach the point when they acknowledge Europe as a strong political entity. Indeed, this is likely to be one of the objectives of the new Parliament. Towards a citizens' Europe The newly-elected Parlia ment will probably want to show that, behind the imposing glass and steel in Brussels, there is a genuine will to serve the interests of Europeans. Over the years, the European Parliament has gained power and importance. From a modest consultative assembly in 1952, it has become an imposing body of 626 MEPs, and increas ingly has the same rights as na tional parliaments. In 1993, the Maastricht Treaty conferred on the European Parliament powers of 'co-decision' in a number of fields, a procedure which requires the Parliament's approval before legislation in cer tain areas can be passed. With the Over the years, the Parliament has gained power and importance ",
        "e u r o pe Amsterdam Treaty, which entered into force on 1 May 1998, the procedure was extended to cover all areas except for the euro and the CFSP ( the common foreign and security policy). The European Parliament now has a full legislative role, the only stumbling block being its ongoing institutional wrestling match with the European Commis sion. Then, last March, the Com mission was forced to resign en masse following the publication of an in-depth report funded by the European Parliament. A committee of independent experts uncovered dubious practices within the ex ecutive in Brussels, the coup de gr\u00e2ce being the forced resignation of Commission President Santer. As a result, the European Parliament's power was enhanced. Further to this spectacular and unprece dented event, the Parliament in tends to assume the role of defen der of European citizens' and con sumers' interests - and to meet their expectations - a new respon sibility, admittedly, and one requir ing even greater reform of the Community's structure. The challenge of expansion Ten countries are readying themselves for European Union membership. The institutional ma chinery and decision-making pro cedures were, however, devised 40 years ago, for a community of six members; they are still in use today with 15 and will be called upon to operate with up to 25 Member States by 2010. Hitherto, many major decisions were taken by a unanimous vote within the Council of Ministers in areas as fundamental as foreign policy, taxation, rights to asylum and immigration - decisions which could be blocked by a veto on the part of just one Member State. This method of operation, which already generates bitter negotia tions between the 15 partners, looks likely to completely paralyse the cogs of that institutional ma chinery if the system is not chan- The institutions of the European Union According to the Treaty establishing the European Community, four institutions are responsible for conducting European business: the Commis sion, the Council of Ministers, the European Parliament and the Court of Justice. The European Commission The executive body. Based in Brussels, it is composed of 20 commissioners appointed by the Member States, with a President at its head (Romano Prodi), whose mandate is for five years. The Council of Ministers Its members consist of representatives of the 15 Member States. It is responsible for coordinating the policies of EU countries. Each government is represented by a minister, generally its Foreign Minister. At technical meetings, the Council convenes a meeting of ministers with competence in the subject on the agenda (agriculture, industry, social affairs, environment, etc.). The presidency is a rotating appointment, with each Member State holding office for six months at a time.The presidency has just passed to Finland, who will keep it until the end of this year. The European Parliament Elected in June 1979 for the first time by proportional representation, it is composed of 626 MEPs. Each country elects a number of MEPs in accordance with the size of its population. Parliament has the power to supervise the work of the Commission, which may be forced to resign by a vote on a motion of censure adopted by a majority of two thirds of the MEPs. MEPs vote on the Commission's budget and play a part in drawing up texts relating to the Internal Market. The Amsterdam Treaty, which came into force on 1 May, gives a greater say to Parliament. The Court of Justice This has a membership of 15 judges and nine advocates-general, all appointed by the governments of the Fifteen for a renewable term of six years. The Fifteen or the Commission may refer to it disputes with their partners over the interpretation and application of the treaties. ged to take account of the larger membership. Beyond the institutional framework, the accession of new members poses additional chal lenges, not least in economic terms. Account must also be taken of criteria such as democracy, and respect for social and environmen tal norms. Current debate is ad dressing precisely how this task might best be carried out. Candi dates for membership must come into line with European standards. From now up to 2006, and with no increase in its budget, the EU has made provision to release 45 bil lion in aid, but one might well ask whether the paying-out of such funds will be to th\u00e9 detriment of other sectors, such as agriculture and structural funds, currently paid out to the Union's poorest regions and countries. Yet, before contemplating full membership on the part of countries such as Hungary, the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovenia, Estonia or Cyprus, Europe itself, as it currently exists, needs to step up implementation of its integration policy. Harmonisation European integration is to be achieved, inter alia, through social, fiscal and environmental harmonisation; however, there is genuine disparity between the various countries. For example, in taxation, Luxembourg has always rejected the withholding-tax sys tem. The United Kingdom, too, refuses to lift corporation tax. Decisions on taxation are taken on a majority vote, so it is unlikely that there will be much progress in the short term towards harmonisa tion of fiscal legislation as it affects companies and capital. Confronted with the chal lenges of globalisation, the Old Continent owes it to itself to become stronger and more demo cratic. By accepting such a chal lenge, it will be able, at world level, to maintain its identity and to uphold its social and egalitarian ideals H N.M. the Courier n\u00b0 176 - july-august 1999 1 ",
        "F i n g e r p r i n t i ng t he f u t u re of chocolate in Trinidad by Michael Roberts* Contrary to popular belief, modern biotechnology is not all about shuffling genes around between organisms. It is also a powerful weapon in the armoury of the con ventional plant breeder. Ef forts to preserve the genetic diversity of global traded commodities such as maize or cocoa have received a major boost from advances in molecular biology. Such research efforts are of fun damental importance if plant breeders are to stay one step ahead of crop diseases. In the case of cocoa, such re search will not just protect the livelihoods of small-scale farmers in developing coun tries but will ensure that 'chocoholics' everywhere can still delight in their daily treat. Cocoa's origins in Mesoa- merica and its expansion through out the Caribbean and South America and later to Africa and Asia are the history of European discovery and imperial ambition. In many parts of the world, cocoa was introduced as part of the colonial compact. For example, it was first planted in the world's largest producing country, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, at the turn of this century. The tree is thus a relatively recent migrant to many of the regions where farmers depend most on it for their livelihoods. Assuring the future of that livelihood in the face of the continuous f i g ht against diseases such as Witches' Broom and Black Pod will depend on efforts to maintain a broad genetic base from which plant breeders can draw material. Cen tral to these efforts is the conser vation of cocoa germplasm in its areas of origin. * Agricultural economist and freelance journalist based in the UK. For more information, contact: Dr David R. Butler at the Cocoa Research Unit on +01 868 662 8788 or email: cru@cablenett.net The trinitario tree There are three different botanical species of Theobroma cacao or 'Food of the Gods' as the cocoa tree is more fondly known: the criollo, the forastero and the trinitario. Each tree bears pods of highly distinctive colour, size and shape. (The long striated shape of the criollo pod was the inspiration for Coca-Cola bottles.) The trinitario is, as the name suggests, native to the is land of Trinidad. Its origin lies in a disaster which befell the island in 1727. Up to that year, criollo trees had been cultivated on the then- Spanish controlled island. The dis aster of 1727, whose cause is unknown, led to the introduction of planting material from the darker-beaned cocoa of the Ama zonian forastero variety. This vari ety crossbred with the remnants of the original white-beaned criollo and the trinitario was born. From its beginning in Tri nidad, the trinitario variety has spread to Venezuela, Ecuador, Ca meroon, Samoa, Sri Lanka, Java and Papua New Guinea. Ensuring that farmers in these countries can fight disease thus depends in good measure on efforts to conserve germplasm from the home coun try. At the heart of this work is the Cocoa Research Unit (CRU) in Tri nidad. Cocoa research unit Efforts to catalogue and conserve cocoa germplasm in Tri nidad began back in 1982 when the Cocoa Research Unit realised it was sitting on not only one of the most extensive collections of cocoa germplasm in the world, but also one of the least accessible. The collection was located over several remote sites with old, neglected trees and little documentation. With a European Development Fund grant, the collections were consolidated into a single gene- bank. As a result of the success of this effort, the International Plant Genetic Resources Institute recog nised the Unit as a Universal Collection of cocoa germplasm. At present, the Unit manages about 3,000 cocoa accessions and new additions are being made all the time as collecting expeditions bring back cocoa germplasm from the wild. One of the more ambi tious projects being undertaken, with funds from the British Biscuit, Cake, Chocolate and Confectionery Alliance, is the collection and transfer of cocoa germplasm from a remote site in Eastern Ecuador to the burgeoning genebank in Trini dad. The aim of Darin Shuka and his colleagues, is to maximise the genetic diversity of the Inter national Cocoa Genebank, Trini dad managed by the Unit. By assembling the collection, the team at the CRU has ensured not only that a wide variety of cocoa genetic resources will survive for posterity, but also that plant bree ders world-wide will have a rich source of genetic material to in tegrate into new hybrids.

        "d e v e l o p i ng w o r ld CRU at the International Festival of Chocolate, held in London in November 1998 Integral to this process is the characterisation of new acces sions and the existing collection. And here is where techniques such as DNA fingerprinting have come into their own. Work began about five years ago and it is making more exciting applied research possible into the use of molecular markers to identify strains of tree with the genetic basis of resistance to Black Pod and Witches' Broom diseases. Greater resistance to these diseases should greatly assist poor smallholders who are the backbone of the cocoa industry the world over. Fine or flavour cocoa Trinitario trees are the prime source for fine or flavour cocoa beans. Fine or flavour cocoa is most commonly used in dark or rich chocolate to impart a more complex flavour. Most major cho colate manufacturers have pre mium-quality chocolate products in their range, which require fine or flavour cocoa from specific origins to create a distinct taste or colour for their chocolate. Over all, imports of fine or flavour cocoa into the traditional cocoa consuming countries of Western Europe range from between 5% to 20% of total imports. Fine or flavour cocoa has been eclipsed, however, by the phenomenal growth of trade in bulk cocoa. The share of fine or flavour cocoa in the total world production of cocoa beans has fallen from between 40% and 50% at the beginning of this century to just under 5% (120,000 tonnes) per annum out of a total market in 1997 of some 2.8 million tonnes. Nevertheless, production has risen throughout the course of this century and demand re mains constant. A stumbling block for what is now a small and specialised segment of the bulk cocoa trade is the absence of an agreed meth od to distinguish fine or flavour cocoa from bulk cocoa. Fine or flavour cocoa normally commands a premium over bulk. The size of the premium depends on the quality characteristics of the cocoa. A premium of \u00a350 to \u00a3250 (\u20ac75 to \u20ac375) per tonne over London terminal market prices is quite normal for this cocoa - although in exceptional circumstances it can reach up to \u00a3500 (\u20ac750) per tonne. Clearly, with such premiums at stake, disputes over quality can quickly sour relations between agents and suppliers. Ensuring quality and smallholder income Price premiums, quality and ultimate usage also determine whether or not the cocoa beans are regarded as fine or flavour by the chocolate manufacturers. Be cause of its special characteristics, fine or flavour cocoa should com mand a higher price compared with bulk cocoa. However, some cocoa producers and exporters from the Latin American and Car ibbean region find that market prices do not reflect the appro priate premium because of dis putes over classification, while im porters also cite problems of dete rioration in quality. To resolve this problem, the United Nations Common Fund for Commodities is funding a pro ject to evaluate the characteristics of fine or flavour and bulk cocoa and provide methodologies, stan dards and instruments for univer sal use in differentiating fine or flavour from bulk cocoa. For the cocoa industry in Trinidad, once the mainstay of the agriculture sector and financial barometer of the country, this project may de termine the long-term future of what little remains of the once extensive plantings. If the project succeeds, the 5,200 growers of Trinidad's trinitario tree will have a standard to meet. Furthermore, funds allocated to promoting the \u00a1mage of the fruit of Trinidad's native cocoa tree could, if all goes to plan, stir interest in the crop again on the Caribbean island. However, before the project can go ahead, the CRU must first secure matching funds from other sources. It is not just Trinidad's smallholder cocoa farmers that potentially stand to gain. Among the other beneficiaries of any success in establishing a test for fine or flavour cocoa will be Trinidad's main competitors, nota bly Ecuador which produces 60,000 to 70,000 tonnes per annum - over half the total world production. Colombia, Indonesia, Venezuela and Papua New Guinea should also benefit, each producing around 10,000 tonnes a year. In contrast, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Costa Rica and Grenada each produce only 1,000 to 3,000 tonnes a year. Conclusion Scientific research at the Cocoa Research Unit shows how the radical advances in modern biotechnology can be used to assist traditional plant breeders in their constant battle to find an swers to disease, quality and yield problems. Furthermore, over and above this applied research, tech niques such as genetic fingerprint ing are a major spur to conserva tion efforts. The Cocoa Research Unit is not working in isolation. It is part of a network of some 15 institutes worldwide involved in cocoa germplasm conservation. With this knowledge, chocolate lovers may sleep easier at night. the Courier n\u00b0 176 - july-august 1999 1 ",
        "M i nd t he gap by Eva Kaluzynska* Pay more attention to the phase between war and peace: that is Olara Otunnu's call on the international community. In an exclusive inter\u00ad view after a mission to Mozambique, the United Nations Secretary General's Special Representa\u00ad tive for Children in Conflict appealed to major donors to take more risks in fostering activities to help stabilise fragile societies. 'They have some idea of what to do when an emergency breaks out, they have some idea of what to do in peace, but they still don't know how to cope with the middle phase, they are not flexible enough,' he told the ACP\u00adEU Courier. Among countries in the 'gap' he named several he had visited recently \u00ad Burundi, Sudan, Rwanda. For Otunnu, programmers should seek pockets of stability in the midst of conflict, rather than waiting for perfect peace before volunteering assistance. 'The European Union can play a key role in rethinking attitudes, and can lead the way in modifying present policies.' Sierra Leone, for instance, could benefit from support with educational activities and training at local level. 'Don't adopt a wait\u00adand\u00adsee attitude. To consolidate peace in Sierra Leone, you must move in now, otherwise there'll be a rollback,' he said, expressing concern at relapses in African countries that had apparently been on the verge of resolving conflicts. Former Zaire, Angola, Congo Brazzaville, Eritrea and Ethiopia are among those experiencing such setbacks. Mozambique, in contrast, had put a stop to its internecine warfare, and was showing real commitment to sustaining peace, he said. Even in conflict zones, the will for peace and stability, expressed in practical initiatives, often defies belief in Otunnu's experience. 'I went to see what you might think are some basket cases of tragedy, and it gave me renewed hope to see such determination shining through at local level,' he said of a recent mission to Burundi. There he met Maggie, a Tutsi, who in 1993 had witnessed and survived the massacre of Hutu children taken from her care. She subsequently set up a number of orphanages with the support of the local prefect, a Hutu who abandoned a successful career abroad as an artist to come home and help rebuild his society. Maggie now works with Beatrice, a Hutu from her village, who had fled a 1972 pogrom in Burundi, and ended up in Rwanda, stable at the time. Beatrice married a Rwandan Hutu and had eight children. They left Rwanda in the exodus after the massacres there, and found themselves in Tingi Tingi camp, where Beatrice lost her entire family. She walked back to Burundi, and met Maggie, who asked * Press and Information Officer at the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO). her to join the work with orphans. How did Beatrice feel about working with a Tutsi now? 'Taking care of these c h i l d r en has given back to me the dignity of a mother,' she told Otunnu.

And he has built contacts with all major world players with potential influence over outcomes. In the EU, with its significant resources and important historical links with conflict zones, he sees the EU\u00adACP framework as a crucial axis. 'I want to make clear that this is not a case of the UN saying do this and do that, but a question of issues that are so fundamental and universal that it is natural for the EU to pursue programmes on them within its own terms.' Among issues on Otunnu's agenda for Africa is the need to prevent recruitment of child soldiers, and to respond to new phenomena such child heads of household and the appearance of thousands of street children, orphans of conflict. But his concerns extend beyond his home continent. After a mission to the Kosovo region, he launched an agenda stressing the need for schooling and other activities to give structure to children's lives and to protect boys from being drawn into fighting, or girls being exposed to sexual exploitation. As a roving ambassador, he aims to persuade parties trying to resolve their conflicts to recognise the needs of children as they start drafting accords, rather than as afterthoughts. Then comes implemen\u00ad tation. 'I hope DGVIII would be supportive in programming the need for schooling for children, often a big problem after conflict, as well as vocational training, basic primary healthcare, and measures to ensure that child soldiers are effectively demobilised and integrated into civil society.' Otunnu served as Uganda's UN representative, and currently holds a mandate till next year. 'I hope the millenium will be used as a turning point, and intend to do as much as possible in my role as a catalyst in the time available.' He spends much of his time on the road, identifying with those he meets in the field what can be done to make a difference in regions at risk. 'Go women, go children, go local,' he summed up. 'The real place where it's at is at local level.' \u25a01 E.K. I the Courier n\u00b0 176 \u00ad july\u00adaugust 1999 ",
        "No i d e n t i ty crisis f or overseas c o u n t r i es a nd t e r r i t o r i es by Malia Mata\u00efla* Everyone was convivial at the 'European Commission/ Member States/Overseas Countries and Territories' partnership meeting held in Brussels on 29 and 30 April. It was an opportunity to bring together, for the first time around the same table, all the overseas countries and territories of EU Mem ber States and to canvass their opinion about the fu ture of their relationship with the European Union (EU). Their current relation ship is based on special association arrangements which are due to end on 28 February 2000. During these two days of consulta tion and discussion various topics were addressed, such as trade ar rangements, financial instruments and the right of establishment. These will undoubtedly be the most important discussion points in the OCT 2000 negotiations and the future association arrangements. Representatives from these distant and very diverse overseas countries and territories (OCTs) - Anguilla, Cura\u00e7ao, Montserrat, Tri stan da Cunha and Wallis and Futuna - gathered in Brussels to shape the future of their associa tion with the EU. The debate, based on a discussion paper prepared by the Commission, was opened by Com missioner Jo\u00e3o Pinheiro, who stated that the time had come to revise the 'outmoded' association arrange ments and to implement new, har monious relations between the Community and the OCTs by taking full account of the specific econom ic, geographical, statutory and hu man characteristics of those terri tories. He added that the Amster dam Declaration invited a re-exam ination of the arrangements for * Trainee at the Information and Commu nication Unit of DG VIII (Development), European Commission. association with regard to four objectives: - more effective promotion of eco nomic and social development in the OCTs, - the development of economic relations between OCTs and the Community, - better exploitation of both their diversity and specific characteristics - including aspects relating to free dom of establishment - improved efficiency of the finan cial instrument - a concise summary of the challenges facing any future association. Towards a stronger partnership The principle of partnership was established in the 1991 Associa tion Decision - subsequently imple mented through regional meetings - but this was the first time that the European Commission, the Member States (represented at ministerial level) and all the overseas countries and territories represented by their highest local authorities had met together. The OCTs expressed their delight to be attending such a meeting and their desire to see a genuine partnership develop. To this end, they voted in favour of a proper institutional framework within which regular meetings could take place - Mr Gaston Flosse, President of the Government of French Polynesia, on behalf of his delegation called for the strength ening of the political dimension of the partnership by setting up an ongoing forum for dialogue. Ruling out a framework of the EU/ACP Joint Assembly type on technical grounds, the Commission envisaged an annual discussion forum. The overseas countries and territories showed great interest in this pro posal, going so far as to call for twice-yearly meetings at which they could address topics such as the programming of aid and individual cases. Aware of the constraints imposed by such meetings, some of them asked for the problem of the remotest overseas countries and territories, such as the Falkland Islands, to be taken into account within the new framework. Major topics Of all the topics dealt with at these consultations, the financial instrument gave rise to the greatest criticism. All those taking part, the Commission itself, the Member States and the OCTs were in favour of making the financial instrument more effective at procedural level and in terms of the rules governing calculations and payments. As re gards the rules on calculation, OCTswere in total agreement that the sole criterion of GDP/inhabitant seemed too narrow to them, given the often highly cyclical nature of these fragile island economies. Speaking for the delegation from Mayotte, Representative Henri Jean-Baptiste commented that it would also be important to take account of the structural problems of certain overseas countries and territories. Finally, they expressed the wish to set up their own fund, more suited to their needs, charac teristics and status. A number of issues were raised at the session on trade, particularly free access, health and veterinary rules and rules on origin. Most of the overseas countries and territories agreed with the mainte nance and strengthening of the current provisions, emphasising the importance of the principle of free access to the Community market. Some expressed a desire for the maintenance of mixed origin re garding ACP products and their own products. They deplored the use of protective clauses implemen ted in the case of sensitive agricul tural produce such as rice, which they thought harsh, maintaining that the small quantities they ex port could in no way constitute a serious threat to the European Community. Greenland, t h r o u gh its Prime Minister, Jonathan Motzfeldt, St Pierre and Miquelon and the Netherlands Antilles demonstrated a special interest in issues relating to rules on origin, and they called for an adaptation of such rules on the basis of geographical locations or in favour of small businesses. They also called for exceptions to be made in certain cases, such as the Courier n\u00b0 176 - july-august 1999 I ",
        "d e v e l o p i ng w o r ld I The countries and territories involved The 1957 Treaty of Rome included all the territories which had 'special relationships' with four of the six signatory States. As the colonial period came to an end, some of these countries and territories became ACP countries, whilst others remained 'overseas countries and territories'. The accession of new Member States to the Community resulted in an expansion of the association to other territories governed by the United Kingdom and Denmark. Part Four of the Treaty of Rome defined special arrangements for association with the overseas countries and territories, enabling them, notably, to benefit from preferential trade arrangements, EDF grants and loans from the European Investment Bank. The arrangements for association applying today were devel oped in the Decision on Association of 25 July 1991 (revised in late 1997). Today, there are 20 overseas countries and territories, 11 governed by the United Kingdom, six by France, t wo by the Netherlands and one by Denmark. All islands, the overseas countries and territories are scattered right across the globe, from the South Pacific to the Caribbean and including the Indian and Atlantic Oceans. The Atlantic overseas countries and territories - Greenland (DK) - South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands (UK) - St. Pierre and Miquelon (F) The Caribbean overseas countries and territories - Anguilla (UK) - Cayman Islands (UK) - Montserrat (UK) - Turks and Caicos Islands (UK) - British Virgin Islands (UK) - Aruba (NL) - Netherlands Antilles (Bonaire, Cura\u00e7ao, Saba, St. Eustatius, St. Maarten) (NL) Indian Ocean overseas countries and territories - M ay otte (F) Pacific overseas countries and territories - New Caledonia and its dependencies (F) - French Polynesia (F) - Wallis and Futuna Islands (F) - Pitcairn Island (UK) Uninhabited overseas countries and territories - French Southern and Antarctic lands (F) - British Antarctic Territory (UK) - British Indian Ocean territories (UK) that of goods which originate from third countries, and are processed in the overseas countries and terri tories, for example Canadian sal mon on St Pierre and Miquelon. There were a few points on which opinion diverged, except when the issue of regional econom ic partnerships was raised. Some of the overseas countries and terri tories appeared to be interested in the development of regional rela tionships with their neighbours (such links already exist between ACP countries and French d\u00e9parte ments and territories in the Indian Ocean), but this view was not unanimous. Some of the countries and territories, for reasons such as the size of their customs income or their geographical location, de clared themselves to be against such a level of integration which represents no economic advantage for them. Another important subject was the right of establishment. The overseas countries and territories were satisfied with the more flex ible implementation conditions con tained in the discussion paper. Some, such as New Caledonia, sup ported the removal of Article 135 of the Treaty of Rome on the freedom of movement of workers, saying that they would like to be allowed to protect their labour market. These measures they regard as necessary if due account is taken of the narrow nature of their labour markets and the proportion of young people in their popula tions. Aside from the major topics, other issues discussed included, no tably, the problem of drugs and money laundering. In the opinion of Governor Franck Savage, repre senting the British Virgin Islands, an article relating to 'this crucial pro blem' in their region ought to be included in the new decision. An appointment to meet in March 2000 After two days of consulta tion, all the overseas countries and territories agreed that the future Decision on Association should be a mixture of the current system and a review of the actual situation. The new system should allow the over seas countries and territories access to the socio-economic development to which they aspire. It should serve as a basic framework for such development, particularly by allow ing the creation of vital infrastruc tures, especially for island econo mies, inward foreign investment and the protection of the environ ment. These discussions allowed overseas countries and territories to examine their differences and emphasise similarities, and it was with a single voice that they de manded a clarification of their legal situation, so that the overseas coun tries and territories/ACP hybrid could stop being used before their next partnership meeting, after the decision of the EU's Council of Ministers.

        "St. Pierre a nd M i q u e l on 'Europe in the North Atlantic 7 * Twenty Overseas Countries and Territories (OCTs), which enjoy privileged relations with the Member States of the European Union, are currently Associate States of the EU. The majority of these OCTs receive aid from the European Development Fund. St. Pierre and Miquelon is one such State. A French dependency, occupying an isolated position in the Atlantic a short distance from the Northern United States and Newfoundland (Canada), this archipelago faces particular problems and is endeavouring to establish its development strategy on a firm footing in order to promote economic diversification. A short history and geography lesson 'Overseas' tradition ally conjures up images of sun-drenched islands and beach resorts, but not all OCTs are in this situation. St. Pierre and Miquelon, an overseas archipelago, is washed by another sea: the waters of the North Atlan tic, which are influenced by the cold Labrador Current. Twenty kilometres from the Canadian coast, off New foundland, St. Pierre and Miquelon is the last vestige of France's pre sence in North America, measuring just 242 km 2 and with 6700 inhabi tants. In 1520, the Portuguese sea farer Jo\u00e3o Alvarez Fagundes, the earliest known discoverer, christened the group of islands 'the Eleven Thousand Virgins', and it was not until 1536 that the French navigator Jacques Cartier, on his return from Quebec, stopped off in St. Pierre and gave it the name by which we know it today. As conflict and rivalry with the English continued over many years, French possessions in North America were slowly but surely lost forever. Only this archipelago off Newfoundland remained French, owing to its having been returned to France in 1815, under the Treaty of Utrecht. From that date onwards, the territory began to be organised on the French administrative model and in 1976 the archipelago became an overseas d\u00e9partement. This adminis trative system proved, however, to * Information from the St. Pierre and Miquelon Development Agency. Further in formation is available on the following website: http://www.cancom.net/-sodepar be ill-suited to local circumstances. For this reason, in 1985, it gained the hybrid status of Collectivit\u00e9 territoriale, with autonomy in fiscal and customs matters. This status proved to be necessary because EU customs arrangements taxed goods of Canadian origin entering St. Pierre, which meant that the local cost of living was very high. St. Pierre enjoys a privileged relationship with the EU as an EU- associate OCT, on the basis of Deci sion 91/482. The end of the traditional economy based on cod fishing Exposed to the winds and the vagaries of the Atlantic Ocean, the archipelago has quite naturally always been maritime in outlook, its principal industries being cod fishing and the re-supplying of fishing ves sels. The glory days of the fishing industry happened in the late 1800s, but certain measures were in the pipeline which seriously compro mised this economic activity. In 1976, the International Conference on the Law of the Sea defined a maritime economic zone reserved for coastal States and set its limits at 200 nautical miles. St. Pierre and Miquelon and Canada were immediately in dispute over the boundaries of their respective zones. In 1992, the New York courts settled this dispute and granted St. Pierre a zone of 24 nautical miles around the archipelago and also a 200-mile corridor to the south. The only drawback was that cod is not abun dant in these waters. From 1992 onwards, therefore, St. Pierre was totally cut off from its principal resource through the application of the moratorium arising out of over fishing in the zone. The archipelago had to seek a new direction and adapt its threatened economy. Towards economic diversification No longer able to earn a living from a dynamic industrial fishery, the archipelago opted to follow a highly original develop ment strategy of diversification, set in motion by SODEPAR, the econom ic development agency for the is lands. This diversification plan, de vised by SODEPAR with the colla boration of local economic partners, aims to take advantage of all the archipelago's resources and assets arising out of its geographical loca tion. The plan relies on active com munication: an Internet site in French and English is available to the public, a representative office for the archipelago has been created in Paris, and a liaison office has been set up in Brussels. Economic and political decision-makers have also St. Pierre and Miquelon. Washed by the cold waters of the North Atlantic ",
        "d e v e l o p i ng w o r ld made a number of approaches to European institutions. The policy to diversify the fishing industry has been successful and it promotes the exploitation of new species (whelks, shark) and the restoration of non\u00adindustrial fishing which takes less of a toll on marine life (lumpfish). Processing of this new sea produce is being developed, enabling St. Pierre to continue its fishing tradition and to create jobs locally into the bargain. Another resource to be exploited is seaweed. Similarly, aquaculture (mussels, scal\u00ad lops) looks set to become a dynamic development sector. Taking advantage of its location at the entry to the St. Laurence Water\u00ad way and its proximity to Canada and the US, activities in the manufactur\u00ad ing and processing industries are also being examined: goods are processed in the archipelago, which facilitates their access to the Eur\u00ad opean market under the provisions of Council Decision 91/432, which allows customs clearance operations. These new activities would not have taken off so well if infrastructures had not been overhauled. A new airport has been built to improve aircraft safety and a new air term\u00ad inal will also be inaugurated during the summer of 1999. These invest\u00ad ments have been possible thanks to EDF subsidies. In addition, the Port of Miquelon, in a particularly ex\u00ad posed location, has recently under\u00ad gone further development with a view to providing boats with a safer haven. The archipelago would like to make the most of economic cooperation with its Canadian and US neighbours, being, as it is, an The strategy to diversify fishing has been successful isolated OCT in the North Atlantic \u00ad St. Pierre and Greenland are the only dependencies north of the Tropic of Cancer. The archipelago has also developed an original line in tour\u00ad ism, based on the fresh climate which prevails at St. Pierre. Its low population density is conducive to eco\u00adtourism, and visitors are pro\u00ad mised abundant fauna and flora. To discover St. Pierre is also to discover a corner of France and thus of Europe in North America. Naturally, the island's hotel capacity has been increased, as has maritime transport. Taking advantage of the wind The archipelago is a windy place and is seeking to exploit this resource as part of two projects. The first one is based on the forthcom\u00ad ing opening of a 'Wind House', a combination of museum and Eur\u00ad opean scientific and technical centre which will provide visitors with in\u00ad formation and scientific explana\u00ad tions about the wind, how to ob\u00ad serve it and how to exploit it. This project could lead to a 'wind circuit' on Cape Miquelon. The second wind\u00adbased pro\u00ad ject involves an attempt to diversify the archipelago's energy sources. A wind\u00adpower generating site is to be created, with a view to providing 40% of the island's electricity re\u00ad quirements. There are two aspects to this project: firstly, it forms part of a general development strategy aimed at taking advantage of all the archipelago's features and resources and, secondly, it enables St. Pierre and Miquelon to act as a European technological showcase for its im\u00ad mediate neighbours in North Amer\u00ad ica. This wind\u00adpower site will promote the technology devised by a European undertaking, which has developed and adapted, specifically for St. Pierre and Miquelon, a wind\u00ad power generation system combined with a diesel engine. This is perfectly suited to the circumstances of the archipelago, notably in terms of climate and available space. A 'direct supply' system, it is very economical and is connected straight into the local distribution network, which means there is no need for costly storage of power since this is used as it is produced. Such technology is tailor\u00admade for isolated communities in the North Atlantic coastal areas of Canada and the US. The success of this wind\u00ad power generation site on St. Pierre could thus serve as the launch pad for this technology towards neigh\u00ad bouring Canadian and US regions whose circumstances are similar to those of the archipelago. Meeting the challenge The diversification strategy implemented by St. Pierre and Mi\u00ad quelon has already borne fruit in a number of areas, particularly em\u00ad ployment. Employment is the key to the archipelago's survival and therefore to the preservation of its cultural identity. A number of other projects are being looked at closely and the most difficult challenge is that of finding investors. St. Pierre and Miquelon now has to concen\u00ad trate its energy and capital on its long\u00adterm projects and, to do this, it is prepared to organise seminars presenting its activities in Europe, just like those it already organises in the United States and Canada, and to meet other OCTs in order to share experiences. \u25a0\u25a0 \u0392 the Courier n\u00b0 176 \u00ad july\u00adaugust 1999 ",
        "Country Report Zambia Historically, the winds of change have blown across the Republic of Zambia, on numerous occasions. Waves of migration down the ages and successive regimes have left their legacy on her terrain, culture, history, politics and economy. As the millennium approaches, the current regime is striving to revive Zambia's flagging economy, alleviate the current pov\u00ad erty and enter more fully the global system. Geographically, Zambia sits shaped oddly like a figure eight landlocked on the undulating high southern African plateau 1,000m above sea level. Her frontiers, a colonial inheritance, bear no relation to her ethnic composition and her location has embroiled her in much of the region's recent political history. Mo\u00ad zambique, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Botswana surround it to the south, Angola, to the west, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to the west and North, Tanzania to the north\u00ad east, and Malawi to the east. The great Zambezi River and its tributaries, the Kafue and the Luangwa, the three great lakes Tanganyka, Mweru and Bangweulu and the man-made Lake Kariba make water an abun\u00ad dant resource. The population of this vast country (752,614- km 2 ), the size of France and Benelux com\u00ad bined, is small (9.4 million). Yet Zambia remains one of Africa's most highly urbanised states with population concentrations follow\u00ad ing 'the line of rail' system from the Copper- belt region, close to the border of the DRC, in and around Lusaka (its capital since 1936), to Livingstone in the South. The country's fertile and mineral rich terrain remains largely uncultivated and uninhabited except by virtually every wild creature asso\u00ad ciated with Africa. Zambia has some of the world's finest national safari parks. Thanks to the high altitude, a temperate climate and decent average rainfalls (508-1,270mm per year) the potential for agricultural production is enormous. Great quantities of minerals, precious and semi precious stones are another blessing. But it is the world-size proportions of copper found in the Copperbelt, an area just 120km long and 40km wide that have determined so much of Zambia's recent history. Waves of Migration It was this abundance that made Zambia one of the cradles of Mankind three million years ago and brought the 73 different ethnic tribes to settle here. Drifting in from the North, Bantu tribes came with slash and burn cultivation techniques (chitmene) still prac\u00ad tised today. While the Difiquane (scattering of tribes) in the 1820s, of Shaka, warrior king of the Zulu and Ngony tribes forced the other significant migration from the Southern Afri- Zambia's vast territory remains largely uninhabited ca. Trade in copper, ivory, and slaves with the Swahili Arabs and the Portuguese also had its influence. According to Mr Katanekwa, Direc\u00ad tor of the National Heritage Conservation Commission, many tribes still remain distinct not only because of language but due to their decorative symbols and designs, .which have not changed since before Christ. David Livingstone's discovery of the waterfalls described by locals as Mosi-oa-tunya, the smoke that thunders, renamed Victoria Falls in honour of his queen, put the territory on the map for Europe. However, Christianity and the eradication of slavery were quickly superseded by colonial commercial ambitions. Colonialism Zambia, then known as Northern Rhodesia, was a prize taken by the British in 1889 administered firstly by Cecil Rhodes, the South African mining magnate and his British South African Mining Company (BSAC). Two groups largely controlled mining: the South African Anglo American Corporation and the Roan Selection Trust with BSAC retaining all mineral rights. The large indigenous labour force needed to meet the world demand for copper (800,000 tonnes at its height) was readily available. Displaced from their farm\u00ad lands by white settlers, forced to pay the 'hut tax' on their homes, mining was the only option left to earn money. African miners in the Copperbelt quickly forgot their tribal affiliations. Bonded by common interests arising from their exclusion from the econom\u00ad ic and political rewards of mining, they started Zambia's rich civil society by creating trade unions, cooperatives and millennial groups. The unifying effects created are even reflected in the country's State motto, 'One Zambia, One Nation'. The Federation of North and South Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) and Nyasaland (Malawi) created in 1953 under white settler control, served to crystallise organised nationalist opposition. In 1963, the British Government was eventually forced to give Kenneth Kaunda and his United National Independence Party (UNIP) a new constitution with a majority in the legislature for Africans and independence for Northern Rhodesia. At midnight, 24 Octo\u00ad ber 1964, Zambia's national flag was hoisted for the first time. the Courier n\u00b0 176 - july-august 1999 \u0392 ",
        "The Kaunda Years Kaunda, as President for the next 27 years, turned Zambia into a one-party state repla cing colonisation with nationalisation. His policies, based on a combination of Marxist and traditional African values, saw Zambia's economy spiral into decline, which eventually produced popular unrest. With most aspects of economic activity under government con trol, run by a bloated civil service, the economy slowed down. The mines, a major focus of nationalisation became the mono lithic Zambian Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM). Supporting liberation movements in neighbouring countries (Zimbabwe's ZAPU and ZANU, South Africa's ANC, Frelimo in Mozambique and SWAPO in Namibia) placed further hardships on Zambia. Denied access to the Atlantic and Indian Oceans for exports and imports, copper sales dropped. Sharp falls in world copper prices did not help either. The austerity measures imposed by the Inter national Monetary Fund (IMF) such as the withdrawal of basic food subsidies and the floating of Zambia's overvalued currency took their toll. By the 1990s, Zambians had had enough and wanted change. A clean sweep In 1991, they got it. Frederick Chiluba and the Movement for Multi-party democracy (MMD) won a landslide victory with the promise of democratic and accountable governance. Sweeping away the centralised and closed political and economic regime of their pre decessors and replacing it with broadly shared economic growth and improved social services were the stated goals. With IMF, World Bank and European Union assistance, MMD embarked on a major structural adjust ment programme (SAP) to open up the economy to foreign investment and encou rage greater private initiative and to dena tionalise. Having inherited an empty treasury, a foreign debt of US$7billion and an impo verished country, this was never going to be easy. Stabilising the macro economy Progress in opening up the economy con tinues. Prices have been decontrolled and subsidies eliminated. Exchange controls have been removed, the Zambian Kwacha has been floated and interest rates are now market determined. Many import restrictions have been eliminated together with a simplifica tion of the tariff structure. Trade reforms in 1995 and 1996, make Zambia's trade regime one of the most open in the Common Market of Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA). The budget deficit is improving thanks to the cash budgeting system, which restricts expen diture to actual revenue collections. Since VAT was introduced in 1995, there have also been improvements in tax administration and com pliance. The Bank of Zambia (BoZ), as the central bank, is responsible for assuring price stabi lity, stability of Zambia's financial systems and keeping a tight control of the money supply. According to Dr Kalyalya, Economic Director 'Zambia has managed to stay on course and is proceeding towards satisfying the IMFs struc tural adjustment programme. Repealing the Exchange Act lifted all restrictions on foreign exchange. After the series of bank failures which affected both the economy and inves tor confidence we have put preventative measures in place. Banking inter-mediation is also improving. We now have 16 banks, a stock exchange and there are a growing number of other financing institutions and leasing companies establishing themselves. Thus the means to raise long-term credit for capital for investment is developing'. Privatisation of non-mining parastatals is also marching apace. The Zambian Privatisation Agency (ZPA) has sold off some 236 out of 282 units, raising US$70 million in the process. For Stuart Cruickshank, Director of ZPA, there have been other positive effects, 'within the cotton industry, privatisation means that 200,000 out-growers instead of 50,000 are now receiving extension services and pay ments. With cotton production up to 100,000 tonnes this is more than enough to meet the needs of our textile industry.' The loss of jobs due to privatisation has to some extent been matched by job creation. Mr Cruickshank explained that half of the 6000 non-mining jobs lost were in retail, which since privatisation has created 4,500 new jobs. The Public Service Reform Initiative (PSRI) is the government's major review of the civil service intended to create an efficient admin- Privatisation is creating new jobs istration. 'Every government ministry has been reoriented towards decentralising and privatising many of its activities focusing on efficient service delivery' explained Bennie I the Courier n\" 176 - july-august 1999 ",
        "Mwiinga, Minister for Local Government and Housing. 'The aim now is to transfer greater responsibilities to local government, through decentralisation and improved democratic processes. We want to promote better tar geted services and give locals a stake in their communities. In this process, traditional tribal chiefs have received greater recognition. They have a defined role in local government and a recognised jurisdiction over local issues associated with custom and land distribution'. Decentralisation and greater stakeholder par ticipation are recurring themes. The health sector, a model for other developing coun tries, has already been decentralised with greater autonomy given to provincial and district health authorities. The Courier took a look at the Zambia National Blood Transfu sion Service. Coordinated from Lusaka, the service has established centres in all the major provincial hospitals, which are responsible for the district centres. Since 1990, the introduc tion of effective blood screening techniques and the development of a database of safe donors has resulted in safer blood products and a significant reduction in their transmis sion of HIV. As Drs Muyinda and Mulenga, Directors of the Zambia National blood transfusion service explained, in a malarial country like Zambia where chronic anaemia is common, safe blood supplies are crucial'. Public/private sector partnership has been another major theme, well exemplified in the National Roads Board (NRB). In a land locked country, a good network is vital. Zambia depends on its 66,000km-road net work for communication and as a focus for economic activity. However, much of the network is in very poor condition. Deteriora tion over time left only 20% of the core network (12,204km) which carries the major ity of traffic in a useable condition. Since 1997, upgrading core roads to a maintainable standard has been the key objective of Zambia's Road Sector Investment Programme (RoadSIP). And it is the task of the NRB to achieve this. Under the chairmanship of Mr Raymond Jhalla, the board's seven private- sector members, representative of transport, academic and commercial bodies in consulta tion with government representatives are changing this situation. A fuel levy received directly from the finance ministry funds the work. Results are visible. Today, teams of workers, filling potholes and doing tarmac work are a common sight on Zambia's roads. Moreover, the NRB regularly publishes its results and accounts in its quarterly maga- Upgrading Zambia's core road network is a key objective zine. Employment has been a major knock-on effect. Some 30,000 new jobs have also been created. But structural adjustment is hurting All is not well in Zambia. Structural adjust ment is biting hard without bringing the benefits hoped for. Poverty and its associated social ills: chronic malnutrition, poor ame nities and bad health affect 70% of Zambians. The average family (eight members) food basket costs ZMK228,000, per month but most families earn less than ZKM76,000. In the absence of jobs, the informal sector is mush rooming and so are the numbers of street children. HIV is another blow, affecting some 20% of the population. A visit to, a Lusaka shanty compound, N'Gombe and CINDI, (a women's and orphans' group) highlighted the burden being placed on women. As a result of AIDs and tuberculosis, many grandmothers on limited incomes have been forced to take responsibility for increasing numbers of or phaned grandchildren. With 60% of govern ment revenues required to service the exter nal debt burden, many of these problems are not being dealt with effectively. For Mr Mwila, representative of Zambia's chambers of commerce, the macro strategy is not sufficiently supported by micro eco nomic policies which could soften the impacts of liberalisation on individuals and local businesses. 'Privatised companies sold to Zambians without foreign contracts are fail ing due to a lack of facilities and programmes to aid access to forex and dollar-denominated loans', he explained. 'The weak Kwacha means only exporters can benefit. Local traders who import materials constantly have to deal with increasing overheads and prices while still remaining competitive. Inflation stood at 25% in May 1998. Low import duties for COMESA countries mean that finished goods imports are cheaper than locally man ufactured goods dependent on foreign sup plies. The trade deficit with South Africa also has seriously affected manufacturing. We are trying to diversify by developing agriculture, manufacturing, tourism, construction etc. but Zambia does not possess the broad industrial base that its neighbours Zimbabwe and South Africa have'. Even well-meaning social assis tance measures have hurt business in Zambia. 'Duty-free imports of second-hand clothing (saloula) put yet another nail in the coffin of the textile industry and cheap grain imports distributed by the Food Reserve Agency depress local farmers' prices'. Agriculture Nyshima, the staple diet food of Zambians is based on maize meal. Potentially, Zambia could produce sufficient maize to feed 300 million people but in reality Zambia's food production is inadequate. In 1997/8 maize crop satisfied only 67% of annual require ments. Mr Desai, Minister for agriculture, the Courier n\u00b0 176 - july-august 1999 ",
        "explained that apart from the recent spate of bad droughts, 'there exists a duality in the sector. We have a small highly productive commercial farming sector. Then there is a Maize meal is the Zambian staple food larger, much less productive small-scale farm ing sector'. Poor farming techniques, overuse of chemical fertilisers and lack of investment capital mean that Zambia's 600,000 peasant farmers are not up to the task of meeting annual maize requirements. The forthcoming Agricultural Sector Investment Programme (ASIP) intends to change this. 'The first aim is to re-organise this sector so that Zambia produces its two million tonnes of maize required annually' said Mr Dessai. In the longer term the aim is to turn agriculture into a major engine of Zambia's economic development. Falling copper production and prices and failure to sell ZCCM are another problem. The most important assets of ZCCM still await sale to Anglo-American. 'The sale of the mines is crucial to unlocking the whole of the Zambian economy and bringing in for eign investment' stressed Dr Kalyalya. 'But, the ball really is in the court of Anglo- American (the eventual buyers). The govern ment signed a memorandum of understand ing, which pleased the donors and prompted the IMF to move on a new three-year ESAF (Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility) ar rangement. But we're still waiting. BoZ is hopeful that once the sale goes through the uncertainties deterring foreign investors will be resolved. 'Currently, a lot of investors are adopting a wait-and-see attitude, for exam ple Sun International, the hotel developers,' said Dr Kalyalya. Poor governance and a lack of transparency in government management led the donors to withdraw aid in 1997. Without balance of payment support Zambia has still had to service external debts which will wipe out much of the positive progress made pre viously. Low voter turnouts for elections and the 1996 constitutional changes, which barred Kenneth Kaunda standing as a political candidate also aroused criticism. It was the government's imprisonment of opposition politicians. Dean Mung'omba, Nakatindi Wina and Kenneth Kaunda without charge and the strict measures imposed on the press in response to the attempted coup d'etat of 1997 that finally halted donor assistance. Some things are improving Two years on, the situation is starting to improve. Mrs Nawakwi, Minister for Finance, outlined in her 1999 budget a series of measures intended to reverse this situation. A 45% increase in social expenditure was promised. It would seem that the donors are gradually starting to relax their suspension of aid. The European Union has released some US$30 million for balance of payments sup port already this year. The World Bank will make US$170 million available in 1999. In May, Mrs Nawakwi also negotiated debt relief to the value of US$1 billion with the Paris club of creditors and was preparing to renegotiate donor aid with the Consultative Group later the same month. The extent to which progress in Zambia has been made depends on whom you speak to. 'Oh God! Things are better than 10 years ago. Back then, if you saw a box of toothpaste, you bought it. It might be another two years before you saw toothpaste again. Now you can get anything you want!' exclaimed Gary, at the Kubu Lodge, on the Zambezi River. Most Zambians recognise the potential of their country. They are frustrated that greater rewards have not already been reaped from their efforts. But still the spirit remains willing and they battle on. People are battling on resourcefully and patiently I the Courier n\" 176 - july-august 1999 ",
        "' C h a n g i ng Zambia f or G o o d' Interview w i th Vice-President Christon Tembo At the election in November 1996, President Frederick Chiluba was returned to of\u00ad fice for a second five-year term. His party, the Move\u00ad ment for Multi-Party Democ\u00ad racy (MMD), also gained an overwhelming majority in Parliament although, at 40%, voter turnout was low. The MMD manifesto entitled 'Changing Zambia for Good', pledged to build on the party's original programme of eco\u00ad nomic expansion, continued privatisation of state enterprises, and enhanced democracy. Now at the mid-point of its second term, the government faces a fair amount of disillu\u00ad sionment over the extent to which it has succeeded in implementing its ambitious social and economic programme. High inter\u00ad est rates, inflation and unemployment con\u00ad tinue to hamper the economy and make daily life a struggle. The final privatisation of Zambian Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) has also been delayed. Having survived an attempted coup in 1997, and the withdrawal of international balance of payments support, the government presides over a country which is nonetheless a relative haven of peace and stability in a region where inse\u00ad curity is increasing. In neighbouring Angola, there is still fighting between the govern\u00ad ment and UNITA rebels. Meanwhile, the conflict raging in the Democratic Republic of Congo threatens to have an impact not only on the Great Lakes region but on Southern Africa as well. At the time of The Courier's visit, President Chiluba was unavailable for interview precisely because of his role (to\u00ad gether with Tanzania and Mozambique) in spearheading the SADC initiative to restore peace in the DRC. This initiative is supported by the OAU and the UN. Lieutenant-General Christon Tembo, Zambia's Vice-President, is a former Minister of Tour\u00ad ism. In an interview, with The Courier, he set out his vision of his country's role in the region, the challenges and opportunities that it faces, and the Government's hopes for the future. Zambia is located in a part of the world which has experienced and is still experiencing civil conflict. What role can your country play In helping to secure stability in the region? It is true that we have seen relative peace in our country while surrounded by neighbours who, at some point, have experienced civil struggles for liberation or independence. Mozambique, Angola, Zim\u00ad babwe, South Africa and Namibia have all lived through this experience. The conflict in Mozambique has not long ceased and in Angola, the government is still battling with UNITA. Now, we have the conflict in the Congo where rebels are fighting against Presi\u00ad dent Kabila. Zambia tradi\u00ad tionally played a supportive role in assisting its neighbours to achieve independence. And we consider that we still have a duty to help our brothers in these countries find peaceful solutions to their problems. Of course, ultimately, it is our neighbours themselves who must resolve their internal problems and find the solutions that are best for them. We can only play a facilitating role in terms of providing an environment where they can actually talk to each other. For example, we facilitated meetings between UNITA and the MPLA of Angola, which resulted in the signing of the Lusaka Protocol in 1994 - although both parties have since scuppered the agreement and conflict has broken out again. In the current conflict in the Congo, our role really is to try and bring the belligerents together so that they can sit down and talk. Without such a dialogue, their problems cannot be resolved. We attach great impor\u00ad tance to promoting peace in the region because it is a prerequisite for development. Without it, we realise that Zambia will be unable to develop economically. The Angolan authorities have alleged that gun- running is taking place from Zambia to the UNITA movement. Could such allegations threaten Zambia's mediation role in the region ? I don't think so. These accusations were made and we challenged the Angolan government to prove them. As far as I know, no proof has been forthcoming. They remain simply as allegations. I think our friends were working on information which is unfounded, and on intelligence which is outdated and unverified. Zambia does not have the capacity to supply arms to any other country or organisation. Furthermore, no Zambian minister or busi- nessperson has sufficient resources to get involved in supplying weapons to anyone. the Courier n\" 176 - july-august 1999 \u0392 ",
        "Since 1991, Zambia has been going through a structural adjustment programme. This has involved a major reorientation of the economy but also a lot of pain for the general population. What are the government's current priorities for achieving sustainable economic development? The SAP has brought a certain measure of pain for our people. But they understand that there has been no alternative to this pro\u00ad gramme. Fortunately for us, because of this understanding, we have been able to forge ahead. The government has no intention of reverting to the kind of programmes adopted by the previous regime. Of course, we also realise that the resulting misery must be alleviated. So we are putting in place poverty alleviation programmes with which we hope to reduce poverty from the current level of 70% to 50% of the population by the year 2004. The measures we envisaged are in\u00ad tended to aid the people in achieving their own economic betterment. What economic sectors are you focusing on? Agriculture has great potential. Measures are being taken to help small-scale farmers. In line with this, we are currently introducing primary cooperatives, where the emphasis is firmly on the village and district level, to deal with the requirements of between 400,000 and 600,000 families. We believe that if we can stimulate the economic activity of these farmers, then the potential multiplier effects on other sectors are enormous. We are also looking to resuscitate other sectors to stimulate job creation. Our invest\u00ad ment programme aims to attract entrepre\u00ad neurs with capital to Zambia who will invest and create jobs. As you know, we have made a lot of progress with our privatisation programme. As for ZCCM, I believe that by the end of July 1999, we will have succeeded in completing the privatisation of all the mines. The government signed a memorandum of understanding with the IMF. This was a significant step enabling us to move towards a new, three-year ESAF (Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility). Once the sale of ZCCM is concluded, we should hopefully begin to see some loosening in the economy. Copper is still its backbone, and the mines depend on a large number of ancillary suppliers and ser\u00ad vices. So as things get moving, we expect to see multiplier effects not just in the Copper Belt but in the rest of the country, and in other sectors as well. We recognise that we have a large informal sector and are trying to improve the situation here as well. As a government, we realise that it is not possible for us to provide jobs for everyone. So it is imperative that we encou\u00ad rage people with skills and funding to become as self-sufficient as possible. This is already paying off - a good number of people are doing well even though they are in the informal sector. I heard a televised interview where one vendor said that he earns as much as K600.000 per month tax- free. This is more than the Vice President's salary! In the long-term, this trend should have positive knock-on effects. In Lusaka, where a large number of street vendors operate without a licence, the authorities have recently taken action to stop them trading. Will this not dampen the entrepreneurial initiative that you say you are trying to encourage ? A number of issues need to be considered, not least safeguarding the environment and public health. We are not prohibiting the traders from vending but simply relocating them to specifically-created market areas, which are provided with all the necessary amenities. This urban market programme is being implemented across the country, in- Dried fish and pulses for sale on the street in Lusaka. An urban market programme is being implemented across the country deed with donor assistance. Moreover, this action has received support from the street vendors themselves, which is a good sign. The macro economic measures that have been taken to stimulate a free market economy, such as the removal of foreign exchange restrictions and the reduction of trade tariffs, have been criticised by some local operators. For example, people in manufacturing and textiles say the measures are detrimental to their activities and future prospects. They argue that with high interest rates, inflation and a volatile currency, it is very difficult for them to produce goods that can compete with foreign imports. When you are opening up an economy, the process will not produce positive results for all overnight. The business community has been presenting its concerns to government and some people are complaining. Of course liberalisation has introduced competition where previously there was none. But in the new market environment, people will have to be more enterprising if they are to compete and survive. There is no doubt that some have been adversely affected by liberalisation, but you have to look at the bigger picture. How long could the previous system have been sustained? Taking the globalisation of the world economy, how would Zambia feature on the world market if we had continued the same inward-looking economic policies? \u0392 the Courier n\" 176 - july-august 1999 ",
        "In the 1970s, Zambia, like other developing countries, embarked on a programme of industrialisation based on import substitu tion. This, in effect, made us even more dependent on imports because of the need for input. A lot of our industry today still de pends on this external input. Hence the im portance of foreign there is a devaluation lates into higher costs for Zambian firms importing materials or equipment. For this to change, capacity has to be built firms orientated towards earning exchange. 'I am reliably informed that flowers grown in Zambia are of a better quality than those produced by our African competitors' exchange. Whenever that obviously trans- up and foreign Liberalisation has exposed Zambian compa nies to greater external competition. Those not geared to the new environment are the ones who find themselves adversely affected. We have had complaints about imported processed products being cheaper than lo cally, produced goods and there have been demands for countervailing duties. But such duties are very difficult to implement, be cause you have to have evidence that dump ing is taking place. Having said this, the Trade and Finance Ministers have been asked to look at the possibility of invoking specific duties on those items where there is also local production. At the same time, we must continue to respect our binding international commitments made under the WTO, the Cross Border Initiative (CBI) and COMESA - which is trying to bring down the tariff barriers. So you see we are caught in the middle. If you liberalise faster than your neighbours, as was the case here, you may find yourself in a situation where your neighbours can seize the advantage and use your country as a transit point. It is very difficult to fully meet the demands of the various economic sectors. But through ongoing dialogue, we are at least trying to bring about some improvement in their situation. What positive developments have there been as a result of the liberalising measures the government has taken? In some areas, Zambia's tremendous potential is beginning to be realised. This is particularly true for our non-traditional exports such as flowers. Indeed, in recent times, when we received no donor support for our balance of payments, we have managed to survive largely thanks to such exports. So the mea sures that we have put in place are cer tainly paying off in this sector. I am reli ably informed that flowers grown in Zam bia are of a better quality than those pro duced by our African competitors. Tourism is another sec tor with a lot of po tential. Zambia has many natural attrac tions. We have some of the best national parks in the world, not to mention the Victoria Falls. Indeed, discussions are cur rently under way with Sun International of South Africa about a major hotel develop ment in Livingstone. And copper is not our only mineral resource. A range of precious and semi-precious gemstones is found here. Small-scale mining in gemstones, emeralds and other semi-precious stones is another very promising area. Already, the major gemstone miners have started to hold auc tions here in Lusaka on a regular basis and these are increasingly attracting international buyers. The results are very encouraging. So Zambia has tremendous potential that is just waiting to be tapped. The international donor community expects you to demonstrate good governance. What priority are you giving to this? I doubt if there is any other country in Africa or indeed in Europe that has gone as far as we have. Initially, the issues discussed with our partners were elections, human rights, corruption and law enforcement. For each of these issues, we have taken practical steps to put the necessary instruments into place. We have set up an Independent Electoral Com mission, an Anti-Corruption Commission and a permanent Human Rights Commission which is currently reviewing its operations. We have also established a Drug Enforcement Commission which functions very well. We have allayed fears that we would not take into account the views of the opposition. I am happy to say that this government has had an ongoing dialogue with the opposition about issues seen as being particularly contentious such as constitutional reform, the electoral process and so on. The press also enjoys a fair measure of freedom. The government has gone as far as to give them guidelines on how to organise themselves so that they can oversee their affairs without interference from the authorities. So in the area of governance, I think we have made a lot of progress. Unfortunately, every time we succeed in a particular area, we find that our partners, the donors, seem to be adopting a new per spective. We find new criteria being added to the agenda which we also have to satisfy. This puts us at a dis advantage vis-\u00e0-vis our State House in Lusaka. '/ think we have made a lot of progress in the area of governance' ",
        "partners. In our view, everyone should stick to the agreed agenda and when we have achieved that agenda, it should be acknowl\u00ad edged that we have done well. The Constitution was reviewed in 1996. Are any further reforms envisaged to strengthen the democratic process prior to the presidential elections scheduled for 2001 ? In 1996, the main area of contention was the qualifications required to stand as a candi\u00ad date for presidency of the Republic. There was a series of reviews conducted under the Ch\u00f4ma, Mvunga and Mwanakatwe Commis\u00ad sions of Inquiry. From this process, it clearly emerged that the people of the country wanted the President to be a Zambian, and it was on this basis that we modified the Constitution. We have not done anything that goes against the wishes of the people. As far as we are concerned, this is now a dead issue. So no further reforms are envisaged. The Constitution will stand as it is. A minister was recently quoted as saying that some of the inertia currently being experienced in Zambia is due to abuses by some people in official positions. How much truth is there in this? I think that was probably me that was quoted. I was referring to the abuse of administrative positions in government circles that prevents major projects from progres\u00ad sing. I take the view that, within the civil service, there are some people who simply refuse to move forward. This deliberate inertia, often resulting from self\u00adinterest, has a negative impact on the development of the economy. This is one reason why we have undertaken a Public Sector Restructuring Initiative (PSRI) to rationalise all government departments. We want to get people moving and to increase efficiency. I should mention that the ministries which have already been restructured are now proving to be much more effective. The economic restructuring has resulted in a lot of redundancies and 'retrenchment'. How has this been tackled, bearing in mind that President Chiluba's own background is in trade unionism? As a trade unionist, he appreciates that workers must be paid for their labour. If a firm is producing well, then the employees should be properly remunerated. However, a company with a lot of personnel who are surplus to requirement cannot be efficient \u00ad and this is to the detriment of the firm and its employees. People are not being displaced indiscriminately, nor is their plight being overlooked. But in the past, we suffered from too many bloated para\u00adstatals that were highly inefficient and in severe need of rationalisation. In time, firms that have been through such paring\u00addown measures will be more efficient and competitive. Ultimately, they will generate new jobs and create a positive knock\u00adon effect in other sectors. As regards people who have been retrenched, the government is endeavouring, albeit with some difficulty, to settle their retrenchment packages. Great efforts have been made to facilitate this. Many employees have even been given the chance to buy their state\u00ad owned houses at very reasonable prices. This is precisely because the President recognises their plight and wants to assist them. Further\u00ad more, he has instigated 'the Presidential Initiative' which is a programme to provide accommodation for Zambians. So it would be unfair to say that the President is insensitive to the plight of the people being retrenched. Zambia has a very large debt burden. What effect does this continue to have on the country? Mrs Nawakwi, the Finance Minister, has just secured from the Paris Club a major success in terms of relief and rescheduling whereby 67% of our debt will be written off. We spend between 40% and 60% of our budget on debt servicing and this places a major strain on the economy. The money could be better spent on education, health or infra\u00ad structure. But we have to service the debt. The Finance Minister deserves to be congra\u00ad tulated for making our partners see sense. Of course, the package is not as complete as we would have liked. Ideally we would like to see all our debts written off. However, we shall continue arguing for this in future negotia\u00ad tions. What justification would you give for complete debt cancellation? I personally believe that the amount we have repaid to date is more than sufficient. I also think that the conditions placed on the loans we received were not really favourable. Above all, I feel that by using the money saved from debt servicing on other national requirements, we can, in the long\u00adterm, reduce Zambia's dependence on the donor community. Finally, what are your aspirations for Zambia ? With the policies we have been striving to put in place \u00ad opening up our economy to investors, revamping agriculture and tourism, and improving the economic climate more generally \u00ad I think we have created an environment which has tremendous poten\u00ad tial. And if the peace initiatives in Angola and Congo can be brought to fruition, we should be able to develop the regional economy. Southern Africa has more resources, minerals, and energy potential than South East Asia. Where the latter has an advantage is in human resources. With South Africa now on the scene, we are now beginning to tackle our weakness in human resources. I am convinced that by the middle of the 21st century, we could be talking about Southern African lions up there alongside the Asian tigers. \u25a0\u25a0 Interview by CO. \u0392 the Courier n\u00b0 176 \u00ad july\u00adaugust 1999 ",

        "'We are n ot yesterday's p a r t y !' Interview w i th UNIP The United National Independence Party (UNIP) governed Zambia under the leadership of Kenneth Kaunda for 27 years, for 19 as a one-party state. Swept out of office in the 1991 election, UNIP has spent its time in opposition revamping itself and its policies. Despite boycotting the 1996 elections, it still maintains that it is Zambia's main opposition force. When The Courier spoke to Muhabi Lungu, press assistant to Dr Kaunda and Rabbison Chongo, a senior member of the central committee and former minister, both were adamant that their party was still a force to be reckoned with. Mr Lungu ex plained that UNIP's 27-year rule spanned a turbulent time geo-politically. 'The Cold War and its polarisation of ideologies forced most African countries to take sides. Our defeat in 1991 was due partly to major changes in the global situa tion. In Zambia, people also wanted change and more pluralist government. UNIP moved with these changes, re-introduced multi-party politics and called an elec tion two years ahead of schedule. We did our best to manage the change.' 'When the MMD took of fice, they were an unknown q u a n t i t y ', Mr C h o n go pointed out. 'Now, voters can compare our records and decide which party is better able to govern. UNIP's job is to show them that, having understood the problems of the past, we have made the necessary adjustments to form a future win ning government'. The party believes it can make a comeback. 'But for the constitutional problems in 1996 that forced us to boycott the election', Mr Chongo said, 'it would have been perfectly clear that we are not yesterday's party. You only have to look at the two recent parlia mentary by-elections. MMD took one seat and UNIP, at its first outing since 1996, won the other. The other parties didn't even feature. It was similar in the local polls. These were sprung on us last December, with only 30 days notice to launch our campaign, and eight days to file nominations, raise funds and rally our supporters. Despite this, we came a very strong second with 24% of the overall vote.' Mr Lungu insisted this was a good performance given the time factor and other logistical constraints. Campaigners had to cope with the rains, the size of the country, poor roads and communications, and indeed, the almost complete inaccessibility of some areas. 'In some places, we were canvassing in waters waist-high, while the government was using government vehicles and helicopters to drop maize meal', he claimed. 'With more time, we would have done even better. This is not a washed-up party.' Mr Lungu said he understood part of the reasoning behind President Chiluba's remarks that Kenneth Kaunda should retire from politics and accept a more dignified elder statesman role. The former President's stature was such that he could easily carve a niche for himself outside the political arena. But he felt it was undemocratic for the head of state to 'manipulate the constitution and electoral processes to exclude a political opponent and make him retire.' He added: 'UNIP believes that Dr Kaunda represents its best candidate for the next election. If President Chilu ba is so sure that Dr Kaunda is finished, he should let him stand and allow the electorate to give the final verdict.' So what has UNIP done to make itself more attractive to voters? 'We have always been slightly left of centre,' explained Mr Lungu. 'Our detractors would call us so cialist, but the political tide is changing. Today, many EU governments are now left of centre, so even there, people are reassessing the impact of free-market poli cies. After all, huge inequalities sow the seeds of instability. UNIP makes no apology for being social democratic.' Mr Lungu defended UNIP's previous nationalisation policy. 'De spite significant state intervention, we still operated the economy on market principles.' He is scornful of the MMD's handling of privatisation, in which some 90% of former parastatals have been sold off. 'Look at the results. Zambia has suffered massive unem ployment and a big currency devaluation. Salaries have simply not kept up with infla tion.' 'There are certain rigidities in a developing economy,' argued Mr Chongo, 'which mean that government must still have a significant role. How can you expect the market to drive the agriculture sector in a Third World country like Zambia? Even in the EU, 50% of the budget is spent on farm subsidies! We want to manage an economy based on free market principles, but with state involvement to ensure that account is taken of social needs.'

        "The lifting of exchange controls and loosen\u00ad ing of the economy were welcomed by some in Zambia but Mr Chongo does not share this enthusiasm. 'We have the most liberalised foreign exchange system in this region and while UNIP would not propose to revert to the past, there needs to be a more prudent policy.' 'We are experiencing massive capital flight,' Mr Lungu added. 'With one of the highest interest rates in the world, investors are simply buying short\u00adterm treasury bills, taking their profits and then getting out.' Both men believe that the government has created an ongoing problem of food security. 'It is a policy\u00adoriginated famine', said Mr Chongo. 'For eight years, Zambians have not had access to fertiliser, seeds or extension facilities. Maize used to be stored all over the country. Today many people depend on handouts. In 1992, all of Southern Africa suffered a very bad drought, but it is only Zambia that still needs food aid today. This is despite the fact that last year, we had the best rains since 1952.' Mr Chongo criticised the focus on production for export and the commercial farmers 'who have neither the capacity nor the incentive to produce what is needed to feed Zambians.' The emphasis, he feels, should be on peasant farmers. He pointed out that the National Agricultural Marketing Board (NAMBoard) and the cooperative unions that ran it, have been privatised or abolished. 'But it was a successful policy. NAMBoard sourced fertiliser, sold it to farmers, provided loan facilities and stored maize. The system was replaced by government ministers acting as marketing agents and abusing so\u00adcalled market mechan\u00ad isms. The result has been wholesale disloca\u00ad tion of the sector and the situation we have today where people are going hungry.' As for manufacturing, 'it's a shambles', said Mr Chongo. 'At least the parastatals did produce goods. Zambia has simply become Southern Africa's biggest supermarket. We've become a warehouse economy, storing goods made elsewhere.' Tackled about Zambia's over\u00adreliance on cop\u00ad per, which some believe is in terminal decline, UNIP accepts some of the responsibility but Mr Chongo countered: 'After eight years, the government's failure to turn round the mines is incredible. Yes, we diverted mining profits to peasant farmers but precisely to diversify the economy. When we left office, production was 450,000 tonnes a year. By 1996, this had dropped to 270,000 tonnes. As Zambia's most important asset, the privatisation of the mines should have been handled with great care. The government has failed so badly that even the donors were forced to halt some aid to ensure better management.' Mr Chongo suggested that self\u00adinterest and kickbacks were involved. Commercial coffee plantation. UNIP wants more emphasis on peasant farmers and food production for the local market On the corruption issue, Mr Lungu mounted a stout defence of his own party's record. 'It is generally accepted that UNIP ministers were not, on the whole, corrupt. The government said they would crack down heavily on the alleged improprieties of UNIP but they haven't been able to find anything. So they threw other charges at us instead \u00ad treason, rioting and attempted coups. We were both imprisoned in 1996 and even Dr Kaunda was jailed \u00ad but never on a corruption charge.' Mr Lungu used blunt language in turning the corruption allegations back against UNIP's erstwhile accusers. 'The President cries \"give me evidence!\" That's the job of the Anti J Corruption Commission. But when it has investigated ministers, and even arrested them, the Director of Public Prosecutions has thrown out the cases on orders from the top.' As regards stimulating investment, Mr Chon\u00ad go indicated that UNIP would actively identify and kick\u00adstart potential investment opportu\u00ad nities. 'Government input is important. It has the capacity to initiate projects and attract investors to take them over. It can also foster protective policies for infant cottage indus\u00ad tries.' But what about the trend towards removing trade barriers? UNIP believes this must be done cautiously. 'The MMD removed too many tariffs too quickly in comparison to the rest of the region,' said Mr Lungu, 'and in the absence of a strong domestic base, we were flooded with imports from our neigh\u00ad bours. Local manufacturing has been destroyed. While UNIP would not revert to protectionism, there has to be an equitable balance involving support for Zambian indus\u00ad try.' He continued: 'UNIP took Zambia into COMESA and SADC. We initiated tariff reduc\u00ad tion and the removal of other trade barriers, but unlike the MMD, we did not create the environment that has prompted international companies based here to move to other parts of the region. It is only as a region that we can be viable \u00ad as a market, for attracting investors and for mass production. Our loca\u00ad tion at the heart of SADC/COMESA makes us a natural distribution centre.' Our interviewees recognised that it was vital to tackle Zambia's debt burden (which dates back to the period of UNIP rule). 'The original debt was relatively small and, indeed, con\u00ad tracted on the advice of multilateral donors', commented Mr Chongo. 'No\u00adone foresaw how interest rates would rise. The IMF, especially, must take its share of the blame for our current debt. Every Zambian owes something like $700. Entering the 21st cen\u00ad tury, Africa should receive comprehensive debt forgiveness, as a priority.' \u00a1HI co the Courier n\u00b0 176 \u00ad july\u00adaugust 1999 \u0392 ",
        "Zambia's newest political force Interview w i th the ZAP Guy Scott (left) and Dean Mung'omba The Zambia Alliance for Progress (ZAP) repre\u00ad sents a merger of six existing political parties (the National Citizens Coalition, the National Lima Party, Agenda for Zambia, the Zambia Democratic Congress, the Labour Party, and the National Party) plus one NGO (the National Pressure Group). The only other sizeable third party not included in the coalition is the United Party for National Development, led by Anderson Mazoka, a former manager with the Anglo-American mining company. When two ZAP founder members, Dean Mung'omba, leader of the Zambian Demo\u00ad cratic Congress and Dr Guy Scott, Chairman of the Lima Party, spoke to The Courier, the final negotiations to consolidate the new alliance were taking place. Despite technical difficul\u00ad ties with registration, ZAP's manifesto, con\u00ad stitution, colours, logo and slogan, as well as its campaign strategy for 2001, were all being finalised. Elections for the party leader and other key posts were expected to follow shortly afterwards. It is said that in an election, the MMD can count on about 30% of the vote and UNIP 20%, with the remaining 50% up for grabs. This sounds like a dream situation for a third force - but it is not so easy to win seats when the field is so crowded. Zambia has more than 35 political parties (other than the two big ones) and a first-past-the-post voting system which favours larger groupings. 'Need for effective checks and balances' 'Last December's local government elections were a major catalyst', explained Guy Scott. 'Even if you attribute a fair amount to rigging on the part of the government, the fact remains that the opposition parties did abys\u00ad mally. Since the MMD wiped out UNIP so thoroughly in 1991, we have had what is, de facto, a one party state.' In his view, the key question is whether Zambia really is a multi\u00ad party democracy. 'Will a more pluralist demo\u00ad cratic system emerge, based not on regional\u00ad ism but on genuine differences of constitu\u00ad ency, with effective checks and balances? We need a strong opposition, capable of ensuring that democratic processes function properly and that government activities are moni\u00ad tored.' 'All the problems that existed in 1990 are still there, including our failure to manage multi\u00ad party politics,' added Mr Mung'omba. 'UNIP was disastrous and the MMD has turned out to be a mistake', according to Mr Scott. 'Changing the constitution to allow a number of parties to compete in elections is only the starting point for multiparty democracy.' Committed to a more pluralist political system in Zambia, both men were actually founding members of the Movement for Multi-Party Democracy. Indeed Scott (a farmer) and Mung'omba (a banker) were among the authors of the ruling party's manifesto and constitution. They joined the MMD when it was still just a movement encompassing a broad range of interests: the business com\u00ad munity, students, trade unionists, politicians and intellectuals. According to Dean Mung'omba: 'Having persuaded Kaunda to change the constitu\u00ad tion, created a political party and won office, our objective was to allow for greater competition in politics. At that time, our one-party political system mirrored our con\u00ad trolled economy. Our policy was to open up the economy, denationalise, reduce state intervention and create an enabling business environment, to achieve higher growth and improved provision of social services.' Both men were given posts in the first MMD administration: Guy Scott as Agriculture Min\u00ad ister and Dean Mung'omba as Deputy Minis\u00ad ter in the Office of the President, with responsibility for economic development and international resource mobilisation (effec\u00ad tively donor aid). 'In all sectors, we met the challenge of the severe drought of 1992, while continuing to implement our other policies. We were also still committed to good governance and a major review of the constitution', said Mr Mung'omba. But both our interviewees became disillu\u00ad sioned and ultimately left the ruling party. 'Constitutional reform allowing multiparty politics was not enough,' Dean Mung'omba explained. 'The leadership betrayed our ori\u00ad ginal aspirations and frustrated our aim of implementing the manifesto. We were com\u00ad mitted to good governance and fighting corruption. In the absence of action in this area, it became difficult to push through the economic and social policies that we had envisaged.' Mr Mung'omba admitted: 'We were not far- sighted enough to ensure, through the party manifesto, that once in power, the pro- \u0392 the Courier n\" 176 - juty-august 1999 ",
        "gramme of reform would continue. The constitution still gives extensive powers to the executive. These powers were inherited from the Kaunda regime, and are at the expense of the judiciary and Parliament. So far, they have not been reviewed, though that was the original intention of the MMD.' 'I think most people would say that the MMD has undermined the legisla\u00ad ture more than Kenneth Kaunda ever did', remarked Guy Scott. 'These people un\u00ad derstand the principles of democracy. Any one of them could give a worthy presen\u00ad tation on the theory of good governance, but if their ac\u00ad tivities are not monitored, not much will happen in practice. It is not that the electorate is unsophisticated, but voters naturally look to their own particular inter\u00ad ests. When the government shows up with fertiliser dur\u00ad ing an election campaign, the message is clear. Every\u00ad one knows it shouldn't hap\u00ad pen but they also know that the legal system doesn't have the capacity to rein in this kind of thing.' Dean Mung'omba stressed: 'Ultimately, the good man\u00ad agement of a country is dependent on good leader\u00ad ship and good institutions. In our case, the institutions had still not been set up and, in the interim, the op\u00ad portunity for abuse of office was there. When a constitu\u00ad tional review, as the basis for future good governance, is at the core of your pro\u00ad gramme, then it is obvious that if you don't carry out that review, the rot is going to set in. In failing to give independence to the judi\u00ad ciary and Parliament, or to regulate the police, you implicitly encourage bad govern\u00ad ance.' Mr Mung'omba also had some harsh things to say about the privatisation programme, claim\u00ad ing that 'its failure had more to do with corruption than anything else. Corruption has become an impediment to investor confi\u00ad dence and private sector participation.' 'So far people have been very patient,' said Guy Scott. 'Things got very bad under Kaunda and the MMD told the people that it would take time to sort out the problems. But the stark reality is that the population has grown 25% since the MMD took office and the country's GDP has not increased correspond\u00ad ingly. The privatisation of the mines was left until far too late. The assets have declined in value and there has been a drop in commod\u00ad ity prices. All in all, things are pretty rough economically.' So what makes the ZAP different? According to their press material, they are offering a third way: government based on collective leadership, a common set of principles, ideo\u00ad logical clarity and alternative socially progres\u00ad sive programmes. Other key points of their programme include national self\u00adreliance, based on eco\u00ad nomic output and exports, and job creation \u00ad especially in agriculture, energy, tour\u00ad ism and production linked to indigenous raw materials. The ZAP manifesto, we were told, will place strong em\u00ad phasis on fundamental re\u00ad forms designed to improve the functioning of various institutions, and boost the role of civil society and tra\u00ad ditional authority. The new grouping says that it wants to offer a 'morality code' with the aim of restoring hope to Zambians who have 'lost faith' in the polarised politics of the country. Dean Mung'omba also spoke of their desire to achieve greater decentralisation, with powers devolved to the regions, provinces, and traditional rulers. He ac\u00ad knowledged, however, that 'as a result of Zambia's mas\u00ad sive and crippling debts, de\u00ad centralisation is difficult. At the moment, there is a limit to what can be achieved, whichever party is in power. What we need to do is create the right structures and empower the people.' A man from N'gomba compound on the outskirts of Lusaka. 'So far, people have been very patient... but things are still pretty rough economically.' For Guy Scott, the creation of the ZAP is part of the effort to 'develop a more mature political system. Where we lost before was in our failure to win credibility with the electorate. All the small parties were too busy fighting each other. The prospects are better if people start working together, settling their differences and showing a united front. Our aim is to reawaken interest in democratic processes by offering a third way.' As The Courier was going to press, the ZAP was preparing for its first electoral foray on 27 May. It fielded candidates in a number of local government by\u00adelections in different districts \u00ad including Luapula, the home of President Chiluba. \u25a0\u25a0 co. the Courier n\u00b0 176 \u00ad july\u00adaugust 1999 \u0392 ",
        "Coming up roses! Roses, coffee, fresh vegetables, herbs, spices and essential oils are all export commodities not traditionally associated with Zambia. Copper is still king. But it is precisely these non\u00adtraditional exports (NTEs) that are help\u00ad ing to boost the country's economy. They offer a means to mitigate the country's dependence on sales of metals, which are currently languishing. Production and market\u00ad ing of commodity crops with a high value added export potential have steadily im\u00ad proved. Zambian NTEs compete on world markets and are positively flourishing, finding buyers in the EU, Africa, Asia and the USA. This is bringing in much needed foreign exchange, and creating rural jobs over an increasingly wide geographical area. Their contribution to the economy has grown from US$100 million to over US$313 million in 1998 representing 33.2% of all Zambia's foreign exchange earnings for that year. Over the last seven years, annual average growth has been at a healthy 18% and better. Indeed, the Export Board of Zambia (EBZ) is confidently predicting earnings of US$400 million in the year 2000. The EBZ has identified some 20 \u039d\u03a4\u0395 sub\u00ad sectors but floriculture, horticulture and pri\u00ad mary agricultural products are by far the most successful. Despite the constraints of 1998, which included the Asian economic crisis, falls in commodity prices, the El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon, high interest rates and other domestic factors, these sectors continued to perform well. Floricultural products recorded a 57% increase on the previous year with earnings of almost $33 million. Similarly, horticultural receipts rose by about 30% to more than $50 million. And new \u039d\u03a4\u0395 sectors are now coming on\u00adline, the latest being high value crops \u00ad herbs, spices and essential oils. The number of exporters is also increasing. Since 1994, the five main export associations collectively have almost doubled their mem\u00ad bership. Terranova The Terranova Estate sits 1000m above sea level in Mazabuka, in the Upper Kaleya Valley. This commercial farm owned by the Street family, stretches out over 1000 hectares of some of Zambia's most fertile land. 200 hectares are laid out with regimented lines of plants, heavy with the arabica beans that produce Zambia's high acidity but mellow flavoured coffee. Zambia's geography, soils and climate provide almost perfect conditions for high quality production. Sophisticated Israeli water irrigation technology helps to compensate for the long dry season. Terrano\u00ad va produced 350 tonnes of coffee for export last season employing 300 permanent workers and some 2,300 seasonal pickers. Mr Street insists that while Kenyan coffee is recognised as the best in the world, 'only 10% of Kenya's coffee is better than the best that Zambia produces. He continues: 'And Zambia is gain\u00ad ing a reputation among the buyers because our sales samples are more truly representa\u00ad tive of the coffee we export.' Production is still not sufficient to attract major buyers selling blended coffees, but both output and the numbers of coffee exporters are increasing. The Zambia Coffee Growers Association currently has 37 commer\u00ad cial farmers and 900 small\u00adscale growers. Total national output in 1998 was 3000 tonnes (worth $6 million), double that of 1994 and over the next decade, a target of 30,000 tonnes has been set. ",
        "Terranova's activities are also expanding. The Streets have successfully carved out a niche in the American gourmet coffee market over the past five years. Using the brand name Terra- nova and a logo of a giraffe in a tuxedo and top hat (attesting to their coffee's African origins and exclusive quality) they currently sell 3000 (60kg) bags annually to speciality roasters in the USA. Not to be left out, Mrs Street, since 1996, has also been producing fresh vegetables for Agriflora, a major Zam\u00ad bian international exporter. For the Streets, it is 'Hats off to the Government, the EU, the European Invest\u00ad ment Bank (EIB) and the World Bank!' Liberalisation policies, coupled with the opportunity to keep for\u00ad eign exchange earnings, have been major incen\u00ad tives. In the absence of commercial bank loans, the EIB has helped with low-cost, long-term credits and the World Bank is about to do the same. The EU's Export Development Programme (EDP) has been another major source of support, providing short- term credit for inputs and small capital items as well as special technical inputs, seed trials and feasibility studies. The programme has done much to help the floricultural and horti\u00ad cultural export sectors weather the adversities en\u00ad countered on the domestic and international fronts. 'It's been great' says Mr Street. 'Apart from the credits, the technical advice on all aspects of crop production has been of a very high calibre.' In his view, 'It won't be long before Zambia is really on the export map and then perhaps we might start getting a few tour\u00ad ists!' Senzile Ltd - It's do-able! Makeni, a Lusaka suburb, is home to Senzile Ltd, a rose-growing and export enterprise owned by one of Zambia's youngest indigen\u00ad ous export farmers, Mtumba Kamanga, aged just 24. Proving that nothing is impossible, which is the meaning of 'Senzile,' he has built four greenhouses on two hectares of the family farm. Each contains 35,000 rose plants, and he is now producing 2000 bunches of roses a week (in four varieties: Prophyta,. Palline, White Lucas and Ravel) for sale at the Dutch auction markets. Interested in farming since childhood, Mtum\u00ad ba Kamanga started the business a year after leaving school in 1995. Supported by the Zambian Export Growers Association (ZEGA), his family successfully managed to get an EIB loan ($575,000). The youthful entrepreneur began growing roses in 1996 and exporting in 1997. Senzile Ltd is still a very young en\u00ad terprise, but it already employs 37-45 workers and is gradually becoming established. While exports are highly profitable, 'it's not all a bed of roses', Mr Kamanga told us. With two hectares under production he is only just breaking even because of the intensive in\u00ad vestment required and hefty costs for air\u00ad freight, auction charges and inputs. Rose prices fell 15% in the Neth\u00ad erlands in 1998 due to greater competition from both increased numbers of Zambian rose growers and producers in neighbouring Kenya and Zimbabwe. To remain viable, Senzile Ltd needs to expand to at least four hectares and start growing additional flori\u00ad cultural and horticultural products. At the end of the day, Mr Kamanga - recognising himself as an example to other indigen\u00ad ous Zambians - intends to stay in the business. In his view, 'it requires a lot of hard work and commit\u00ad ment but it is do-able!' 'It's not all a bed of roses.' Agriflora There is a good chance that if you buy fresh vege\u00ad tables labelled 'made in Zambia' in a British super\u00ad market, that the produce the Courier n\u00b0 176 - july-august 1999 \u0392 ",

Heavy investment in some of Africa's best state\u00adof\u00adthe\u00adart cold storage and packing facilities is paying off in terms of added value. Agriflora exports a range of perishable products to customers in Europe, the Far East, South Africa and the USA. Arriving within hours, prepacked, labelled and even bar\u00adcoded, Agriflora's fresh vegeta\u00ad bles, (mangetout, asparagus, baby corn, beans, sugar snap, chillies, courgettes etc.) can be transferred directly to the supermarket shelves. Started just four years ago, Agriflora's export vegetables operation is worth $15\u00ad16 million annually. A further three million is earned from exporting 25 million roses. Expansion of both activities is planned in the future. The company is currently considering branching out into processed and organic vegetables. Zambia's huge areas of virgin land offer a lot of potential for meeting the increasing de\u00ad mand for organic produce. Half of the produce is grown on Agriflora's own farm and the rest is supplied by 24 contract farmers (like Mrs Street, at Terranova) employing about 7000 workers. Having fixed a price for their produce, Agriflora provides the neces\u00ad sary inputs, materials and technical assistance and organises the cold storage transport to market. While most of Agriflora's out\u00adgrowers are commercial farmers, some small\u00adscale farmers are contracted collectively. The Kasisi Mission Station contract with Agriflora is an interesting example of this. The produce is grown by 30 families on individual hectare plots supervised by the Mission. A similar arrangement exists with the Riverside Insti\u00ad tute, a seventh day adventist mission. Indeed, Mr Slade rates the two missions as among his best producers. As one of the five or six major African vegetable exporters to Europe, (80% of the produce is destined for the UK), Agriflora is obliged to satisfy the ethical sensitivities of its clients to win market share. Apart from operating in compliance with various trading and quality standards, the treatment and social welfare of employees are also taken seriously, with most farms providing clinics, cr\u00e8ches and health education. Agriflora has expanded rapidly and success\u00ad fully, and in bypassing the auction houses, has achieved greater control over prices. But Mr Slade remains concerned about the con\u00ad straints facing Zambian exporters. In the absence of an established reputation, he says, it is difficult for Zambian exporters to obtain premium prices. Inadequate, irregular and expensive cargo airfreight, lack of indigenous technical expertise, lack of investment capital and credit, falling commodity prices, poor investor confidence in Zambia and the ab\u00ad sence of an export credit guarantee scheme were all cited as factors that limited perfor\u00ad mance in the sector. Despite these constraints, all three exporters that The Courier spoke to were upbeat about the future, both as regards their own opera\u00ad tions and the wider potential of Zambia to prosper in this sector.

        "'Odi!' 'Yewu!' 'Odi!' a Nyanga greeting, originating from Zambia's Eastern Province, means to an\u00ad nounce your presence or arrival, to which the welcoming response is 'Yewu'! Late last year, the 'Zambia-Britain Collaborative Music Project' sponsored by the British Council brought together a group of musicians of Zambian (Amashiwi, The Sakala Brothers, and Brian Zanji), British and Australian (Sarah and Nathan) origin, in a singular project to make their presence known. Viewing the arts and culture as an important factor of develop\u00ad ment, the British Council made it possible for these artists to spend two months together fusing their creative talents and musical influences: - African and European; classical and contemporary; traditional and modern - into an album on CD, comprising 13 original and traditional compositions and arrange\u00ad ments. Recorded live, to lose none of their vibrancy or spontaneity, each track performed in the African spirit of 'from the people to the people', conveys the essence of this cross- cultural collaboration reflecting traditional Zambian techniques and western classicism. The Courier attended the concert to launch the 'Odi' CD. The blending of values, norms, material and spiritual traditions of the 70 ethnically diverse peoples who today live in Zambia, resulting from waves of tribal migration dating back several centuries, is what defines Zambian music, like its contemporary culture. Zambia's music like its dance, ranges from quiet beauty to tireless animation bounding with life or resonant with joy. An integral part of rituals.

Similarly, its emphasis varies from the breathless acro\u00ad batic spectacle amid propulsive drumming to fine movements performed to the subtle sounds of instruments such as the kalimba, a hand-held thumb piano, or the silimba, a traditional xylophone. The musical tastes of the current generation in Zambia draw on this appreciation of traditional music but as everywhere they have been influenced by the West and sounds popular across the rest of Africa as well. In. the big towns, nightclubs and shebeens belt out the sounds of Kwela and Rumba (influ\u00ad ences from neighbouring countries such as Congo) and many local bands play to an increasingly westernised youth. The concert bounded into life, opening with the title track 'Odi!' to welcome everyone. 'Yewu!' came the warm response from the audience. Out in force were the young and old alike, not to mention the media, to catch this rare ensemble performance by so many well-known Zambian artists and to hear both new and traditional songs performed in their unique way. Some of the audience were sufficiently enthusiastic to show appreciation by doing what locals describe as relating - emitting a high pitched squeal made while whirring the tongue. All 11 performers, (three groups and one solo artist), while remaining true to their own traditions and vernacular, contributed to the compositions and arrangements. The fusion of their different talents and use of tradi\u00ad tional and new songs has given the album a wide appeal. Included in the traditional songs are Welako {Come back my child), Bamama (conservation), and Mbela, Mbela (a children's song). Amashiwi, an a cappella group of up to 10 female artists (only six performed on the night) formed the most visually dominant part of the evening's line-up. Dressed in costumes reflecting both their originality and their roots in tradition - beadwork around their necks and brightly-patterned bandanna-type skirts around their hips over black bodices recalled the influence of tradi\u00ad tional Tonga female costume. Amashiwi, meaning voices, formed two years ago after a workshop with the British a cappella group Black Voices. They have gone on to apply the techniques learned to local and new songs, all transmitting positive messages. 'Amweba', perhaps the evening's most heartfelt perfor\u00ad mance, tells of the female artist's struggle for the Courier n\u00b0 176 - july-august 1999 \u0392 ",
        "acceptance in Zambian society. Written by Amashiwi member, Maureen Luanda, Anwe\u00ad ba's plea to her parents is not to despise her chosen career, despite her good education; 'Singing is my talent' explains the song. Overcoming negative attitudes is something all the Amashiwi singers have fought to do, and they are succeeding. They have already successfully become a household name and will attend Zambia's prestigious National Honour and Awards Ceremony later this year. Some of the members of the group are stars in their own right. Maureen Luanda, with 16 years in the business as a cabaret jazz singer, is currently recording a solo album \u00ad 'nine tracks are done and there is one more to go'. The most traditionally or\u00ad ientated of the artists, Brian Zanji, folk musician, performer and storyteller, specialising in traditional instruments, provided much of the percussion, playing the drums, the kalimba, and the silimba. Internationally recognised in Europe, the USA and Africa, Zanji's composi\u00ad tions 'Tule Mbeza' (Put the Basket Down), and 'Tikiti' (tickets), reflect both his 'traditional roots that recall our ancestors' and international experi\u00ad ence. The first, based on a folk tale, moralises against jealousy and unkindness while the second makes a c o m p a r i s on b e t w e en transport systems in Nor\u00ad way and Zambia. the Brothers' music is aired across the region's radio stations, in Zimbabwe, Malawi, and South Africa. Completing the ensemble, with classical ta\u00ad lents on the flute and upright bass, acquired at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, London, Sarah and Nathan, added much to the sonorous sounds produced. No strangers to Africa, they have worked together on various projects in Tanzania, where Nathan also studied traditional instruments. As well as visiting Zambia in 1995 to work with the Sakala Brothers, they have recently formed a trio with Brian Zanji, the results of which, 'Njovo Ku Manzi' (Ele\u00ad phants at the water), a haunting flute and drum melody, was performed with dance movements by Amashiwi during the concert. The track is in\u00ad tended for a future CD. Nathan's composition 'In\u00ad ner Journey' rounded off the concert. Inspired by their collaborative experi\u00ad ence, all the artists in coming together have ta\u00ad ken a major step forward in the hope that there will be others in the future. In terms of appreciation of each other's style, Levi Sakala described it as a mixture of British serious\u00ad ness and relaxed Zambian jamming. Sarah, making Odi's presence known The Sakala Brothers, Levi and Moses, not blood brothers but brothers in culture, as a musical duo, capture the fibre of traditional music and transform it into a wholly new Zambian rhythm, which draws inspiration from life in the Lusaka townships. 'It's a township jive,' explained Levi. 'With two million Zambians living in Lusaka, coming from everywhere, you've got a melting pot of traditions. Traditional music exists along\u00ad side pop music. We've taken the two to create our own sound. Though its roots are traditional, the young appreciate our new rhythms and can relate. Older people are drawn to the traditional origins of the music.' And their music has reached out to large numbers already with songs such as 'Londole' about a husband begging his wife to forgive him and 'follow' him back home and 'Baya\u00ad mo' a celebration of motherhood. These titles already earned them a national award for 'best song' in 1997. Their 1998, album, 'Londole' stayed at Number One in the charts for eight weeks. Popular not just in Zambia, And the verdict on the Odi! Concert? 'On the Zambian music scene, rumba from Congo has been very popular here for some time like western pop music, but Zambian music is starting to come through. As we've seen tonight, artists are drawing on traditional music, fusing it with modern sounds, rhythms and even gospel and producing quality music that is attracting wide interest,' explained Paul de Sousa, local Lusaka disc jockey, on Radio Phoenix Inde\u00ad pendent Radio Station. Proving this, 'Odi!', having entered the music charts at Number Nine continues to do well in the Top 20.

        "Liquid Assets c o o p e r a t i on i n f o c us Fertiliser from the European Commission Food Aid Committee was sold to fund a post drought recovery programme in Zambia's driest regions In less than two years, with a verita\u00ad ble Midas touch, 27,500 tons of fer\u00ad tiliser has been transformed into liq\u00ad uid gold \u00ad water, gallons of it! And not only water but also rehabilitated rural roads and grain sheds, and low\u00adcost housing for rural and peripheral urban communities living in some of Zambia's most drought\u00ad affected regions: Southern Province, Lusaka, and Eastern Province. The fertiliser in question was not manure, but it has certainly generated a wealth of positive effects. In March 1996, at the Zambian Government's request, the European Commission Food Aid Committee donated the fertiliser to assist Zambia's post\u00addrought recovery programme. The fertiliser was sold on a commercial basis through the Agricultural Commodity Exchange so as not to undermine emerging agricultural mar\u00ad keting activities, benefitting 1,200 buy\u00ad ers, both direct users and middlemen who distribuied the product country\u00ad wide. The fertiliser had generated a total of 10 billion Zambian Kwacha (roughly equivalent to \u20ac5.5 million) by February 1998, and given birth to the European Union Fertiliser Development Fund (FDF). This counterpart fund and its joint EU/Zambian Government pro\u00ad gramme of development projects essentially targeted the worst impacts of drought. The programme was designed with the Zambian National Authorising Office (NAO) under the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development, the FDF steering committee and endorsed by the EU Delegation. The fund's manage\u00ad ment and administration has largely been conducted by the two\u00adman team that make up the FDF Advisory Unit consisting of Simon Cammelbeeck, fund manager (financed by the EU) and his deputy, a government civil servant on secondment. Starting in July 1997, Mr Cammel\u00ad beeck expects to have completed dis\u00ad bursement of the fund by June 1999. Unique not only because of its manifold positive outcomes, it will also be the subject of a TV documentary, currently in production. 18 projects with a total of 80 contracts have been funded to date. 'The overriding factor in conceptualising the programme' explained Mr Cammel\u00ad beeck, 'was to have a lean, mean and efficient set up: rapid and targeted (but also timely) disbursement of the funds directly to the project beneficiaries. There's no point releasing money to mend roads during the rains. Flexibility was vital in our project selection proce\u00ad dures and also full accountability'. 'Limited bureaucracy', 'efficient deci\u00ad sion\u00admaking' and 'making maximum use of existing capacity' were all cited as the elements for achieving tangible results so rapidly. All decisions were referred to the steering committee, con\u00ad sisting of representatives from the Finance Ministry and the EU, an accountant and the fund management. Moreover, where specialist technical knowledge has been required for selecting particular projects, technical experts also joined the steering commit\u00ad tee on an ad hoc basis. 'But you had a situation where it was possible to effect same\u00adday release of funds following approval of the steering committee,' he explained. 'In imple\u00ad menting the projects, maximum use has been made of existing professional capacity: government institutions, NGOs, private sector consultants and \u25a0 contractors, all having proven track records in their field of project imple\u00ad mentation and who were already work\u00ad ing in the designated areas to be given assistance.

Following joint govern\u00ad ment/EU approval they have been rapidly disbursed directly to beneficiaries.' Productive and social infrastructure The fund programme targeted 31 of Zambia's worst drought\u00adstricken districts and has worked to achieve the global objectives of facilitating better access to markets (via improved agricultural production and economic devel\u00ad opment) and improving living conditions for these rural and peri\u00adurban communities. Development of productive and social infrastructure has been undertaken using a four\u00ad pronged approach. As a complement to ROADSIP, the government's major road rehabilitation programme, rural feeder roads have been improved, particularly their drainage. In some cases, bridges and pontoons have been repaired. In rural areas at the height of the drought more than a mil\u00ad lion people lost access to reliable water supplies. Women and children were walking up to 20 km daily in search of water. Boreholes designed to service 250 people were being drawn on by over 800. Improved access to safe, con\u00ad venient and reliable water supplies at the household level was a priority. Rehabilitating dams, drilling new boreholes and installing pumps provides the means not only for more sanitary living conditions but also offers the possibility of developing market gardening. Improvement of crop marketing and distribution networks has also been addressed, in particular with the construc\u00ad tion of grain storage sheds in strategic rural locations. 'With the means to protect their harvests, local communi\u00ad ties are more in control of when they sell their grain and can negotiate better for input supplies and prices on the market,' explained Mr Cammelbeek. Special infrastructure projects with immediate impacts were also realised, for instance low\u00adcost housing was constructed in Lusaka. A sense of ownership Community participation has been another key element. 'All the projects have been demand\u00addriven,' stressed Mr Cammelbeek. 'As much as possible we have tried to instil a sense of ownership at the beneficiary level and set up local committees which have actively participated in the realisation of the projects and will be responsible for their maintenance with the local district authorities.' Despite being less than two hours drive from Lake Kariba and the great Zambezi River, at the time of the Courier's visit it was the first time in years that the six\u00admetre\u00addeep water reservoir in Nachibanga, in the Ch\u00f4ma District of Zambia's most drought\u00adprone Southern Province was brimming \u00ad and so were the villagers, with joy. One of the districts most severely affected by the 94/95 drought, Nachibanga and its water supply infrastructure are well on the road to recovery. Thanks partly to the good rains last season, but in the main thanks to the \u20ac212,030 of FDF used by Africare, the contracted water and sanitation NGO, together with the Nachibanga Dam Committee to rehabilitate their dam. It now holds 70,000 cubic metres of priceless liquid. In this pastoral region, the grass\u00adfed beef is considered locally to be among the finest in the world . The Tonga people are devoted to their cattle, considering them a walking symbol of their wealth. There are now water supplies for man and beast alike. The reason for all the joy is the newly reconstructed dam wall. Standing strong and firm, spanning 143m across the mouth of the reservoir, sprouting sisal and Rhodes grass, to consolidate it while deterring errant cattle, and with stag grass covering its slope, the dam wall gave little indication that until last October it had stood in disrepair. Breached in the middle, the spill\u00adway erod\u00ad ed and both the down and up\u00ad stream slopes in very poor condition, the reservoir had been parched. Constructed in 1968, it had already been breached three times. The vil\u00ad lagers' repair efforts were only ever temporary, due to lack of funds, with the consequent effects on local water require\u00ad ments. Mr Chinene, chairman of the Nachibanga Dam Committee described what happened during the drought: 'Many cattle were lost. Without oxen, using only manual labour, the hectarage under maize was severely reduced. Growing cash crops was out of the question. Women and children had to walk extreme dis\u00ad tances to fetch water. Many men had to leave the village to find work in Lusaka. Hand\u00addug wells produced no water because the very deep groundwater table was virtually depleted. Humans and cattle were forced to share the little water available, which obviously resulted in poor sanitation and disease \u00ad in particular, diarrhoea. People were even reduced to digging up roots to live on.' But all that has changed! The reservoir provides water for some 219 households in six surrounding villages over a six\u00adkilometre radius and 1500 cattle. As well as replenishing the water table, it offers a separate well for human use and the possibility of small\u00ad scale irrigation of the surrounding land, already earmarked for cash crop production. Mr Chinene remarked smiling that he was already looking forward to seeing it teeming with fish (a heron had already taken up a perch on site), and growing relish (the local green vegetable). 'We should have already started planting the cash crops,'explained Mr Mwiinga, headman of the village, 'but we've been late in finishing the maize harvest.' Project coordinator David Kabumu described Africare's role, as 'strengthening the community's capacity to recon\u00ad struct, manage, operate and maintain their own water facil\u00ad The Nachibanga Dam Committee \u00ad working together for water \u0392 the Courier n* 176 \u00ad july\u00adaugust 1999 ",
        "ities'. This has been achieved by working with the local community, through the eight\u00adperson dam committee, who, by holding monthly meetings are now responsible for monitoring the maintenance of the dam wall. Fees are also collected for the use of the water in the reservoir, looked after by Barnabas Mubila, the committee bookkeeper. Locals have been trained to build fences and monitor the dam wall, checking for new breaches and keeping cattle away . Africare, responsible for the Dam Rehabilitation Project in Southern Province, using ZMK 625 million FDF, have suc\u00ad 'strengthening the community's capacity to reconstruct, manage, operate and maintain their own water facilities' cessfully rehabilitated 16 dams and are working on a fur\u00ad ther two in the region to the benefit of some 80,000 people and their cattle over the last two years. 'Columba Ma Ninge!' (Thank you! in Tonga), cried Sarah Mirambo as children excitedly ran about, stopping only intermittently to look curiously at the strangers come to see their dam, chewing all the while on enormous sticks of sugarcane and revelling in glorious winter sunshine. With the Nachibanga Dam Committee, Sarah was out on parade to show off the results of her village's hard toil. This was going to be a day for celebrations and she was going to make sure everyone enjoyed it, with a generous supply of sweet beer, ground\u00ad nuts and sweet potatoes. While Simon Cammeelbeek may seem to have been on a two\u00adyear long spending spree, Sarah Mirambo and her fel\u00ad low villagers are dammed pleased with the tangible results brought to Nachibanga!

        "An ageing world by Dorothy Morrissey The UN has designated 1999 as the International Year of Older Persons. We look at how elderly people in developing countries are faring in terms of income security, health and human rights, in societies that are seeing radical changes in their social and eco nomic structures. The world is experiencing a steady increase in the number of elderly people (defined here as the over-60s). In demographic terms, this group is the fastest growing section of the global popu lation. According to United Nations statistics, the number of people over 60 rose by 63% between 1960 and 1980. Between 1955 and 2025, it was predicted that this age group would quadruple in size. Already, more than half the world's elderly people live in developing countries, and this proportion is set to rise to three- quarters by 2025. Lower infant mortality rates, advances in medical care and improved living standards mean that those who survive childhood disease now stand an improved chance of living a long life - no matter where they are on the planet. Time for celebration? Longevity may be regarded as one of the successes of the 20th century, but are older people - especially those in develop ing countries - really in a position to celebrate? Even in the north, this rapid demographic transition has caught people unawares, and many of the elderly now rank among the most vulnerable in society. How prepared is the developing world for the boom that is about to hit them? How can developing countries, suffering from lack of resources and often heavily in debt, implement the social policies that are needed to ensure the security of this older generation? A seat at the decision-making table In developing countries older people tend not to be passive dependents, but work much longer than their northern counter- Between 1980 and 2000, the biggest increases in the eld erly population will have taken place in Africa and Asia. And in just the first two decades of the third millennium, the forecast is that Sub-Saharan Africa's older population will almost double in size. It took almost a century for this to happen in countries such as France, Belgium and the USA. This raises serious chal lenges for policy-makers, who may not have the time or the resources necessary to respond. In the USA, the social security system was set up only in 1935, 160 years after independence. \u00ce '?fc fci? : the Courier n\" 176 -july-august 1999 ",

Despite this, their needs are often left out of the policy\u00ad making equation: in the HIV/AIDS pandemic, for example, where grandparents are left to look after young children orphaned by the disease and in crisis situations where elderly people are among the most vulnerable, both physically and mentally. In general, when resources are scarce, older people risk finding themselves at the bottom of the list. Emerging very strongly from this dossier is the message that, in the developing world, elderly people are valuable con\u00ad tributors to their families and communities. As such, they should not be pitied, but rather, in the words of Edward McKinney, (Fulbright Professor at Nairobi University) 'given a seat at the decision\u00admaking table'.

        "G r o w i ng o ld in A f r i ca by Ruth Evans Ageing is a process that creeps up on us all, wherever we live. Between 1960 and 1980, the number of people living beyond 65 years in creased by 63% worldwide. This demographic trend of more people living longer is set to explode early next century, with much of the increase taking place in the poorer nations of the world - those least able to cope with the problems of an ageing population. The UN International Year of the El derly has been launched to try to make us all more aware of the demographic trends and how they will affect us. Visiting a Somali refugee camp in eastern Ethiopia, I met a young boy wearing a T-shirt with the bold statement on the front: 'I'm too young to be 60'. It could easily be a slogan for the world's youngest continent in the 21st century. In some African countries, more than half the population is under 15 - but the reality is that with improved life expectancy, many more of those young people will live to a ripe old age. A few years ago, a Tanza- nian friend came to stay and was shocked to hear that my 92-year old neighbour lived entirely alone, with infrequent visits from her daughter and no family around to help her. 'This would never happen in Africa,' he said. 'Fa milies always look after the el derly.' Now, however, things are changing fast - and much faster than most of us realise. In Ghana's capital, Accra, I visited one old lady - also 92 - who was blind, toothless and incontinent. Her painfully thin body was covered with bed sores, and she lay on a filthy bare mattress on the floor of a small room, which had two other beds crammed into it, along with a pile of rat-infested rubbish in the cor ner. Her daughter and grand daughter had died before her, and now some distant relatives were grudgingly trying to look after her. She complained that nobody had washed her that morning and that she was hungry. Outside in the courtyard, the rest of the family was eating its mid day meal and a protesting child was being soaped and bathed in a plastic basin. Traditionally of course, Africa has respected its elderly, and large, extended families have provided guarantees for old age that would be the envy of many isolated and lonely pensioners in the Western world. In Mali, a tree has traditionally symbolised old age, with deep spreading roots p r o v i d i ng stability and leafy branches giving shade against the ravages of the sun. The link be tween age and wisdom is reflected in many of the traditional words used to describe an old man or woman, like 'elder', or Swahili greetings such as 'Shikamoo' which reflect the respect and hon our given to older people. At the same time, in the absence of pensions and social security systems, children are viewed as security against old age. The more children you have, the more there will be to look after you in your twilight years and the more secure you hope to be. Breakdown in family structures With rapid urbanisation and difficult economic circum stances across the whole conti nent, many families now find it impossible to look after the el derly, even though they may want to. Extended family structures are breaking down just at the point when the continent will need them most. According to Dr Nana Apt of the Centre for Social Policy Studies at the University of Ghana, the proportion of Africa's popula tion living beyond 65 is currently, at 3%, the lowest of any world Too young to be 60... but hopefully, he will be some day! region. This is set to change dra matically by 2025, despite the fact that in some African countries, notably Zimbabwe, Kenya and Botswana, life expectancy has fall en rapidly in the last few years as a result of AIDS. A baby born in Zimbabwe today is unlikely to celebrate its 40th birthday, even though six years ago, life expec tancy had reached an average of 61 years as a result of carefully- devised health programmes. These shocking statistics are important, not only because they reflect the human tragedy being experienced by so many African families today, but because of what they mean for the future. With so many of the continent's middle generations being wiped out, old people are left increas ingly vulnerable. It is often the older generations that are left to look after children orphaned by the epidemic. Just at the time when these old people would otherwise have looked forward to being cared for themselves, they now find they have to take on the difficult and burdensome task of bringing up and providing for - in some instances, numerous - grand children, some of whom may also be sick. the Courier n\u00b0 176 - july-august 1999 ",
        "d o s s i er Paradoxically, those who do escape the ravages of this epidemic can expect to live longer as a result of childhood immunisa tion and better health care pro grammes. The number of the very old in Africa is also expected to grow rapidly, just at a time when the traditional ways of looking after them are breaking down. Many Africans have not yet rea lised the extent of the problems ahead and are often surprised to hear about it, but statistics (insofar as they exist) show that traditional extended family support for old age is simply no longer working for many people. Few people outside formal employment have social security or pensions (even in Ghana where there is a well-established social security system, only 10% of the working population - mostly gov ernment employees - has any sort of pension provision). As families find themselves unable or unwill ing to take on the burden of care, more and more elderly people are now totally destitute. In Addis Ababa, HelpAge International es timate there are more old people living on the streets than there are children. They are now carrying out a study aimed at determining the true extent of destitution amongst the elderly. Lack of a social safety net Some countries, are now even thinking the hitherto un thinkable and establishing old people's homes. This is an entirely alien concept in many African societies, something which in the past was largely confined to the white population. Outside South Africa, Zimbabwe probably has the best-developed system of institu tionalised care on the continent, with over 100 homes catering for the needs of the elderly. At the expensive end of the market are homes still largely catering for the white community, and at the other end of the spectrum are homes for the destitute elderly, many of them foreign workers. These are mostly men from Malawi, Mozam bique, South Africa and Zambia, who came to work in Rhodesia many years ago and have since totally lost touch with their own families. One man I spoke to had not seen or heard from his wife and children in Malawi for over 40 years. Another old lady told me she had been born in Durban and had been brought to Zimbabwe as a domestic worker many years ago. She had not seen her own two children since then and, as she didn't possess a passport, could not return to South Africa to look for them. 'I am old now,' she said. 'I will die here.' The government of Zim babwe currently subsidises the homes but with the deepening economic crises and plummeting Z i m b a b we d o l l ar of r e c e nt months, many officials and care workers I spoke to questioned whether the country could afford to continue supporting even the most basic institutionalised care for the elderly. In any case, few black Zimbabweans would con template placing their own rela tives in such homes, even if they could afford the fees. To most, they are a cultural anathema and people are as opposed to institu tionalised care as Africans in other parts of the continent. Ghana experimented with two retirement homes in the 1960s. Both failed and had to close because not a single old person wanted to .live there due to the stigma of being seen as an outcast with no family to care for them. Rapid urbanisation across the continent is also having a dramatic effect on many old peo ple. The vast majority of Africa's elderly live in rural villages, and as the younger generations go to the cities in search of work and better prospects, the older generation finds itself increasingly isolated and neglected. For the former, often struggling to make ends meet in the city, it is difficult or impossible to find the time or money to make the trip home. Travel is expensive, often difficult and sometimes dangerous. Com munications to rural areas are poor or non-existent and it is usually impossible to find a reli able means of remitting regular funds to rural areas. Older people are more likely to suffer from a range of medical conditions associated with their age - ophthalmic problems, strokes, dementia and inconti nence. Many of these conditions are poorly understood and receive scant resources from medical bud gets stretched to the limit. Elderly people driven from their homes by war and famine are particularly vulnerable. Although the picture looks gloomy in many parts of the continent, there are also plenty of positive instances of local in itiatives to try to help older peo ple. There are also examples of new ways of thinking coming into play in response to the changing social trends. When Rwandan re fugees flooded into Karagwe dis trict in northwest Tanzania, local people saw the aid being given by the international community and NGOs to elderly refugees in the camps. It inspired them to try to do something to help their own elderly population in the area. A local NGO called SAWATA was set up with support from donors, and it now helps to make and install low-tech water tanks and cooking stoves in old people's homes, so they do not have to spend hours each day walking to collect scarce water and wood. In each village, local legal advisers have also been trained to give advice to old people on any problems they may have, especially the land disputes that often affect older people in particular. It is an example of simple, low-cost initiatives that can really help. The problems of the el derly cannot be looked at in isolation, argues Sister Jember of the 'Integrated Holistic Approach- Urban Development Project'. Be hind that mouthful of a title lies a very impressive community-based project in one of the poorest slums of Addis Ababa. The project has The SARATA office at Karagwe in NW Tanzania the Courier n e 176 - july-august 1999 1 ",
        "d o s s i er Preparing food at the day care centre for the elderly in Accra built a day-care centre where elderly people can come for com pany and a daily meal, and the elderly themselves have started a 'food on foot' scheme to take food to the ill and house-bound who cannot make it to the centre. The elderly are very much seen as an important and integrated part of the community and are given a great deal of help by the commu nity as a whole. In West Africa, HelpAge Ghana has set up a similar project. Most of their work so far is based in Accra, where they have also established a day care centre to give old people somewhere to go for company and to get a daily meal. They try to provide medical assistance where it is needed and have organised an 'Adopt a Granny' volunteer scheme to visit people in their homes. 'Most of these old people have nobody to help them and may be very sick', Simon Enyan, a 22-year old volunteer, told me. 'It is very important that we look after them because we will also be old one day and will need people to treat us nicely.' Unfortunately, that isn't al ways the attitude. In Accra, I met an elderly woman who had been w i d o w ed t wo months before. With tears streaming down her face, she told me her children had driven her out as a witch. One of her grandchildren had accused her of 'sucking out his wisdom' as an excuse for doing poorly at school. Now her own children will have nothing to do with her, and refuse even to feed her. Even the church would not intervene on the grounds that there was no proof that she was not a witch. This association of old age with witchcraft is common in many parts of the continent - and usually, but not always, aimed at women. Being branded a witch can lead to destitution, persecu tion and even death. It is a shock ing and stark contrast in a con tinent that has prided itself on caring for and respecting the elderly. Although draft legislation to protect the elderly and promote their rights has been mooted in several African countries, including Zimbabwe, Ethiopia and Ghana, not one of these proposals has yet made it on to the statute books. It is an indication of the low priority given by overstretched governments to the issues of age ing, despite the growing aware ness of the demographic trends facing every African country in the next millennium. Clearly, governments alone will not be able to meet the demographic challenges ahead. This means that individuals will have to take greater responsibility for planning for their own future and not assume they will be able to rely on their children. These demographic and so cial changes call for drastic action by both governments and indivi duals. New policies and priorities will have to be drawn up to ensure adequate provision from cradle to grave. But these new priorities will be competing for resources that are, in many places, already scarce and over-stretched. The most vulnerable elderly are also usually least able to articulate their needs and demands or make their voices heard. In Europe and North Amer ica, older people are becoming increasingly vocal in advocating their rights and needs, and as their spending power has also increased with better pension provision, so has so-called 'Grey Power'. Dr Nana Apt predicts that something similar will eventually happen in Africa as younger, educated gen erations live to a ripe old age and become more vocal in their demands. Last July, President Nelson Mandela celebrated his 80th birth day by getting married. A more positive role model for the launch of the UN International Year of Older Persons would be hard to find. Although he will soon retire from the South African Presidency, as one of the world's most senior statesmen he has also been one of the continent's most visible and active senior citizens - at a time when many of Africa's elderly are becoming less visible and more marginalised. The International Year of the Elderly may not make an enormous difference to the con tinent's senior citizens, but hope fully it will help raise awareness about the forthcoming problems and make people aware that age ing is a natural thing, which comes gradually and to everybody. Bar ring the discovery of some elixir of eternal youth between now and the millennium, growing old is something we must all face - and it is something for which we must take greater personal responsibil ity. It will be a challenge for individuals and their families, for governments and for Africa as a whole, as the world's youngest continent comes of age. H I the Courier n\u00b0 176 - july-august 1999 ",
        "A g e i ng a nd h e a l th by Dr Claudia Stein and Dr Alexandre Kalache* We are all ageing - every day of our lives. Ageing can be defined as the life-long process of progressive change in biological, psycholo gical and social structures of a person. For statistical purposes, 'the aged' are commonly assigned to specific age groups, for example, those aged 60 and above. However, the ageing process begins even before we are born, and continues throughout life. Although the func tional capacity of biological systems (e.g. muscular strength, cardiovascular performance, respiratory ca pacity) declines naturally after peaking in early adult hood, health and activity in older age are largely deter mined by the exposures and actions of an individual dur ing their life span. Research suggests that foe tuses undernourished in the womb grow up to be adults more likely to develop chronic diseases, in cluding coronary heart disease, high blood pressure and diabetes. Poor childhood growth is also linked to faster rates of ageing. Malnutrition in childhood, particu larly during the first year of life, childhood infections such as polio and rheumatic fever, and exposure to accidents and injuries increase the risk of developing chronic disease and/or disability in later life. Lifestyle behaviour, such as smoking, alcohol misuse, lack of exercise, and dietary habits lead ing to malnutrition or obesity, are often acquired in adolescence and early adulthood. This behaviour may add greatly to disease and disability at any age in adult life. Differences in education, income, social levels and expecta tions during life increase the di versity of ageing. Higher levels of education and socio-economic sta tus are strong determinants of health at all ages. Important gender differ ences exist in the way people age. Throughout the world, wo men have a longer life expectancy at birth than men, the largest differences being in Eastern Eur ope, Central Asia and in some Latin American countries. How ever, women tend to be affected by more disabling diseases in later life than men. Reasons for the different ageing experiences in men and women are still poorly under stood. The differences in the life experiences of men and women, which become more pronounced as they age, may in part explain the observed gender disparity. Women may suffer adverse effects from pregnancy and childbirth, which may lead to incontinence later in life. Women encounter inequalities in literacy, training, and job opportunities in many societies w i th life-long conse quences, including being less likely to receive social security in older age. In some countries, girls and women have poorer access to adequate nutrition and health care, as well as being more fre quently in contact with polluted water from domestic tasks. This leads to greater risk of infection from this source. Women may also have lower degrees of indepen dence and more restrictions on life choices, depending on prevailing social expectations and roles. These factors are associated with poorer health in women and their children. Similarly, the differences Throughout the world, women have a longer life expectancy at birth than m G n * Consultant and Group Leader respec tively with 'Ageing and Health', World Health Organisation, 20 Avenue Appia, 1211 Geneva 27, Switzerland ",

Although an individual has virtually no control over early life experiences and social factors which affect ageing, actions taken during the remaining life course greatly affect health in later life. Thus, individuals are able to influ ence how they age by adapting to ageing-associated changes and by adopting healthier life styles. So cio-economic factors, such as in adequate access to information, environmental constraints and poverty, may prevent the adoption of such beneficial life styles. An ageing world One of the major public health achievements of this cen tury has been the sharp decline in premature mortality from many communicable and non-communic able diseases. This is largely due to improvements in sanitation, hous ing and nutrition, in addition to medical innovations, including vac cinations and the discovery of antibiotics. Consequently, life ex pectancy has risen and is expected to continue to rise in virtually all populations throughout the world (Figure 1). This will lead to a steep increase in the number of people reaching older age. The sharp increases in life expectancy have been followed by substantial falls in fertility world wide in developed and developing countries (Figure 2), mainly due to availability of modern contracep tive methods. In India, for example, total fertility rates (TFR, the total num ber of children a woman is ex pected to have at the end of her reproductive years) decreased from 5.9 in 1970 to 3.1 in 1998 1 . This is a powerful determinant of population ageing, as the number of children and young people gradually decreases. The decline in fertility is even more pro nounced in China, where the 'one-child-per-family' policy was officially introduced in the mid- 1970s: total fertility rates fell from 5.5 in 1970 to the current 1.8, which is below the 2.1 replace ment level 1 . By 2020, differences in TFR between countries will have virtually disappeared. This demographic transi tion from a pattern of high mor tality/high fertility to that of low mortality/low fertility, is commonly referred to as 'population ageing', and will be compressed in to an unprecedentedly short period of time in developing countries. While it has taken France 115 years (1865-1980) for the propor tion of older people to double from 7% to 14%, it will take China only 27 years to achieve the same between 2000 and 2027 1 . Implications of rapid ageing There are currently about 580 million older people (60 years old and above) in the world, with 355 million in developing coun tries. By 2020 the figures will reach one billion plus, and over 700 million, respectively 1 . With this rapid growth in the proportion of older people, more people will be at an age of higher risk of developing non- communicable diseases (NCDs), which in turn may result in dis ability. In fact, NCDs including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and cancer are predicted to be the main contributors to the bur den of disease in developing coun tries by 2020 2 , and will be respon sible for over three quarters of all deaths. Notwithstanding this, com municable diseases - though de clining - will not have disappeared in those regions 2 , thus leading to the so-called 'double burden'. It will be increasingly more likely for more older people to have surviving parents, and the four-generation family will also become common in developing countries. It is projected that in Figure 2: Total fertility rate per woman in selected countries children 8 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 Source: United Nations Population Data 2000 2010 2020 the Courier n\" 176 - july-august 1999 ",

This implies that in future, one child may have to care for several elderly relatives, and the 'younger old' may be looking after the 'older old'. Given this population age\u00ad ing, it is becoming increasingly critical to ensure that populations will grow older while enjoying the highest possible health status. In this respect an encouraging and growing amount of evidence from developed countries suggests that people are maintaining better health in later life than ever before. For instance, there is evi\u00ad dence from some countries that disability rates among older peo\u00ad ple are actually decreasing 3 . The Long Term Care Survey in the USA has revealed that in the 1990s fewer older people lived with disabilities than was predicted in 1982 (Figure 3). The response to population ageing Rapid population ageing poses immense challenges to health and social services for all countries. Such challenges will be more daunting to developing countries, which are still faced with infrastructural development problems and scarce resources. We have seen how advances in medical technology have offered and, in all probability will con\u00ad tinue to offer, solutions to specific ageing\u00adrelated problems. Unfortu\u00ad nately these technologies are of\u00ad ten unaffordable for the majority of the population of such coun\u00ad tries. For this reason, and consider\u00ad ing the pace of global ageing, radical societal responses are ur\u00ad gently required. In acknowledgement of this, WHO established its 'Ageing and Health' Programme in 1995. This cross\u00adsectional programme, which promotes health and high levels of f u n c t i o n al capacity throughout the life span, is in.the process of establishing substantial collaborative work with academic institutions and NGOs world\u00adwide. Its main aim is to ensure the highest possible level of quality of life in older age by investing in factors which influence health throughout life. Since health and well\u00adbeing in older age are largely results of experiences throughout the life span, work on ageing and health takes a holistic approach, and involves other WHO pro\u00ad grammes such as primary health care, nutrition, child and adoles\u00ad cent health, maternal health, gen\u00ad der analysis, non\u00adcommunicable diseases, mental health and reha\u00ad bilitation. Therefore, the Ageing and Health Programme aims to play the role of catalyst for action within WHO, as well as in relation to multiple other partners world\u00ad wide. The UN commitment to advocating principles of active ageing has been marked by declar\u00ad ing 1999 the International Year of Older Persons. The UN calls for a 'culture' of ageing, that considers older persons as both beneficiaries and agents of development. It also urges the promotion of inter\u00ad generational solidarity, as well as encouragement of individual life\u00ad long development. The global Embrace WHO is taking the world\u00ad wide lead in promoting 'Active Ageing'. This principle encourages people of all ages to take steps to ensure greater health and well\u00ad being in the later years for them\u00ad selves and for their communities. During the International Year of Older Persons, the WHO Ageing and Health Programme is launch\u00ad ing the 'Global Movement for Active Ageing'. This is a network for all those who are interested in moving policies and practice to\u00ad wards Active Ageing. The Global Movement will be launched by a global walk event, the Global Embrace, on Saturday, 2 October 1999. In time zone after time zone, ageing will be celebrated in cities around the world through individual walk events. The Global Embrace is a round\u00adthe\u00adclock/ around\u00adthe\u00adworld celebration to which all countries are invited. It will be followed by the establish\u00ad ment of the 'Global Movement of Active Ageing' \u00ad a network con\u00ad ceived to inspire, to inform and to promote lifelong health. It will link local projects to a global community with similar concerns and to people all over the world. \u25a0\u25a0 CS. & A.K. References 1. World Health Organization.

        "T a r g e t ed m e d i c al f or o l d er A f r i c a ns by Professor Adrian O. Wilson* Africa has to face up to the health demands of a rapidly increasing older population. Unfortu nately, this growth is not paralleled by a comparable increase in resources allocated for health services. The consequence is that Africa's older people are not just particularly vulnerable ' as a population sub-group, they are also further marginalised by an institutional inability to meet their needs, whether in relation to provision of hospital or community care services. The following fictitious case history serves to illustrate this paradox, with a sequence of events typical for older Africans south of the Sahara. It is important to appreciate that the outcome described in this fictitious case is avoidable, even within the stringent constraints imposed by the aforementioned lack of resources. An illustrative case history Mr Kanyemba is 73 years old and has high blood pressure. He lives in an urban, high-density suburb with his widowed daughter and her six children. His son-in-law died of AIDS two years ago. His daughter earns the equivalent of US$20 per month and out of this, she pays dental and school fees for her children. She also feeds and clothes them and supports all family transport costs. Mr Kanyemba has no pension and is alone at home all day with the youngest of the children, who are not yet at school. One day, a neighbour discovers him collapsed, having suffered a stroke. Assessment on admission to hospi tal reveals a man who is conscious but drowsy and with a left-sided weakness which makes independent movement almost impossible. Mr. Kanyemba can, fortunately, swallow, but he has a urinary catheter fitted. He is put to bed with the cot sides up and treated with an infusion of intravenous fluids. The hospital physiotherapist visits him for a few minutes and rapidly assesses that she simply cannot afford the time to give him the level of treatment he requires, as she has far too much to do. After four days lying on his back, a five-centimetre deep pressure sore emerges on his backside. This is dressed and treated by the nursing staff. Mr Kanyemba does not progress. His daughter calls in regularly but her visits become less frequent as she realises that she may soon be called on to care for her father at home, alone. After four weeks in hospital, Mr Kanyemba remains catheterised and immobile. Periods out of bed are irregular and unplanned. He needs feeding, washing and toileting, and he intermittently lies in his own faeces. Finally, 'everything medically possible' having been done, the patient is put into a wheel chair and delivered to the front entrance of the * Head, Geratology Unit, Department of Medicine, University of Cape Town, Observatory 7925, Cape, South Africa. rvices a n ew i m p e r a t i ve hospital with a note stating that he has been discharged from his medical ward (the bed is now urgently needed for a new case). Some hours later, Mr Kanyemba is back home, either delivered by ambulance or collected by a reluctant, anxious daughter. A week later, he is readmitted to hospital, dehydrated and comatose, and he dies shortly afterwards of blood poisoning spread from a contaminated and putrid bedsore. Mr Kanyemba's experience is not uncommon but the sequence of events that follow his stroke result in an entirely avoidable death. To understand how Mr Kanyemba's death may have been avoided, it is necessary to examine the medical issues in relation to the whole social context in which his illness occurred. It is this essential recognition of the position of medicine for older people (geriatric medicine) in the broader context of the older person that differentiates it from other medical specialties. It has to be recognised that many of the potentially life-threatening consequences of ageing, are due to a lack of training and resources. Simple interventions such as basic training, appro priate support, and targeted medical expertise can make a huge difference to the outcome of cases like Mr Kanyemba's. The medical context The need for a comprehensive assessment of the patient's medical problems is essential. A precise medical assessment must be contextually related to the social and functional history, and this background information is the bedrock of an interdisciplinary approach to health problems associated with ageing. This principle will apply whether the patient is in rural Mali or urban Maputo. A management plan tailored specifically to the individual is formulated with medical objectives which emphasise mobility, functional independence, and continence. Mobility and continence manage ment plans will be the deciding factors in reassuring the relatives of older Africans that they may assume home care responsibility for an aged relative, in a sustainable fashion. Focusing on specific medical problems of ageing Wherever you are in the world, ageing will produce, to varying degrees, a mix of medical, mental, social and functional (physical) stresses. Medical stress is a result of multiple pathologies, reduced function of organs, too many drugs, and the fact that older people usually fail to present a typical picture of illness. One can add to this the facts that older people have less tolerance to physical stresses, and that there is more than a suspicion of indiffer- the Courier n\u00b0 176 - july-august 1999 ",
        "d o s s i er enee in prevailing medical attitudes towards them. It is then reasonable to surmise that the frail elderly (our most vulnerable) are at most risk, not only in the community, but also in hospital. The importance of multiple problems to the health of older people cannot be overstated. Taken individually, these problems may appear relatively trivial but when combined, they conspire to produce a cycle of decline which can be devastating. In addition, the tendency for doctors to rely on complex drug treatments often leads to a 'chemical' assault on fragile bodily systems that are much less able to withstand the complex interactions of drugs. This may result in unpredictable and harmful effects on physical and mental health which, in turn, adversely affects the ability of the older person to maintain independence. Allied to this are the mental and psychological problems resulting from bereavement, loss of intellect, social segregation, isolation and, of course, financial hardship. The problem compounds, and therein lies a recipe for decline. Pressures of living conspire with age to place an intolerable burden on every aspect of the life of the older person. In developing medical services for older people in Africa, special attention must be given to these concerns. Targeted medical services The reality is that Africa cannot afford com plex, capital-intensive structures for the provision of care for older people. If there is to be a measure of success in assisting them to survive, it has to be done by using resources that are currently available, and by mobilising the existing talents, energies and commit ment of both professionals and lay people. This can be effective in both clinical and cost terms in the primary care context. Most importantly, systems-based medical care can be encouraged, while the temptation to follow the western medical model of capital intensive do mains and structures should be resisted. Emphasis should be placed on teamwork; mixing skills and breaking down barriers between professions, while developing leadership skills. For services to be effectively targeted, there must be basic and specific knowledge of local older populations and their needs. Good data are the basis for all appropriate activities and interventions. Thus primary care teams, with care for the elderly at the heart of their programmes, must be developed in collaboration with all major stake holders. Close relationships between health workers, social services and NGOs will underpin targeted support for older people. A further desirable complement to such a strategy is generic rehabilitation assistance. To pro vide this, efforts could be orientated to training cohorts of generic rehabilitationists. These workers are essentially sensible, lay individuals trained by specialists in the basics of mobilisation, nursing, and functional assessment. Overseen by the various pro fessionals, they could provide effective and, most importantly, affordable community support for older Africans. Naturally, traditional healers would be encouraged to play their part within the multi- disciplinary process which occurs in the local cultural context. A guiding principle is that care systems are required which keep older people away from hospi tal, wherever possible and appropriate. To this end, a logical goal would be to develop targeted systems of integrated community care. Nowadays, there is a burgeoning variety of such models in the West. The time is now ripe for the development of appropriate local models in Africa. Mr Kanyemba revisited Returning to our hypothetical case study, when it is discovered that Mr Kanyemba has suffered a stroke, he is admitted to the local hospital. There, his daughter meets with nurses, physiotherapists, and related health workers to develop a tailored treat ment plan, which emphasises independence, and an early return home with continuing rehabilitation. Active treatment prevents the onset of pressure sores. The doctors treat the patient's blood pressure. Once the physiotherapist and occupational therapist have made a treatment plan, this is delegated to a liaison rehabilitation worker who works out the details of the discharge with the daughter so that the latter is confident that she can manage. This worker follows Mr Kanyemba's progress while he is in hospital and continues the treatment following his return home. Four to six weeks after his stroke, Mr. Kanyemba is able to move independently around the house and supervise his grandchildren, with the support of his daughter and community services. Conclusion There can be no doubt, given the scant resources available to Africa, that the primary care setting must be a priority in targeting care for older persons. Medical provision for senior citizens can be improved by implementing an interdisciplinary and community-based strategy of care without incurring unacceptable extra costs. At present, however, African health ministries are giving less and less attention to older people, while maintaining their longstanding emphasis on communicable diseases and maternal/child health issues. This neglect has pitfalls. By failing to face up to the realities of a rapidly-expanding older popula tion in Africa, the continent's governments face the prospect of being unable to cope in the future. It is not too late for ministries to revise their priorities so that planning and targeting of medical services for older Africans, allied to active pro grammes of health promotion, can take place along side existing imperatives such as control of infectious disease and maternal/child health. Such a change, in The International Year of the Older Person, would be most encouraging. H the Courier n\u00b0 176 - july-august 1999 I ",
        "I n c o me security f or poor o l d er p e o p le in d e v e l o p i ng c o u n t ri by Peter Lloyd-Sherlock\" Discussions about meeting the income needs of older , people in developing coun tries have been dominated , by debates about reforming retirement pension pro- . grammes. These debates have largely revolved * around the relative merits I of public and private sector . administration of pension I funds. The reform of pen sions provision is an impor tant issue, particularly for Latin America and former socialist economies, since the sheer scale of these programmes means that they have a significant impact on public sector finances, savings rates and labour costs. However, with the notable exception of South Africa, the majority of older people obtain most if not all of their income from other sources. As such, pension re form in developing countries will have little direct impact on the income security of large swathes of their elderly populations, particu larly the poor and vulnerable. Un fortunately, very little research has been conducted into broader as pects of the economic welfare and quality of life of older people in the developing world. This research ef fort must be extended as a matter of urgency in order to support the development of appropriate policies and interventions. A key issue is the extent to which population ageing in devel oping countries is a phenomenon which mainly affects economically- privileged groups, or whether it is occurring across society as a whole, including the poor. Many of the developing countries most affected by population ageing now contain large middle classes. Are these the only groups that are living longer? If * Health Policy Unit, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Keppel Street, London, WC1E 7HT, UK, this is the case, the challenge for meeting the income needs of the old will be less severe, since they will be more likely to have pension entitlements, economic assets and other sources of support. Indeed, in this case, equitable policies should seek to target those groups currently less likely to reach old age rather than older people themselves. Un fortunately, there are very few reli able data about the relationship between population ageing and poverty. Although existing informa tion suggests that poorer people are less likely to reach old age, an important and growing minority still do so. Few of this group are likely to have access to a retirement pension or to have made any financial provi sion for their old age. Indeed, for many of them a protracted old age may have come as a surprise - something which had not happened to their parents or grandparents. While they may only account for a small proportion of older people, they are, without doubt, one of the most vulnerable and economically insecure groups in developing coun tries. This article presents a num ber of observations about the eco nomic condition of poor older peo ple. Rather than give a very general overview, it focuses on three issues. First, it aims to question the conven tional view that all older people are financially dependent and make no contributions to the economic wel fare of others. Second, it examines the role of grassroots community assistance programmes for older people. Finally, it raises the issue of old age, poverty and gender. Economic contributors A major weakness of current debates about income security in old age is a tendency to assume that elderly individuals are simply the passive recipients of economic sup port, be it from social security systems or family members. This view is dangerously simplistic, and is based more on stereotyping than empirical research. In both industria lised and developing countries, older people are more likely to be home owners and to have accumulated savings. In slum districts, older peo ple have often made considerable investments of time and money in the construction of a home, which they continue to share with other family members. In these cases, some form of inter-generational contract may exist, through which elderly people obtain care from family members in exchange for the trans fer of resources, including inheri tance rights. However, this impor tant contribution frequently goes unrecognised both by the older people and the beneficiaries. Older people living in poor households may make a range of other financial contributions. For those who receive them, regular pension payments, no matter how ungenerous they may seem, often provide an important guaranteed source of monthly income in house holds where younger members are forced to rely on the vagaries of informal employment. Also, the lim ited research suggests that older people, especially women, are more likely to ignore their own income needs in favour of younger age groups within the family, particularly grandchildren. Surveys conducted by the author in slum districts of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil and Buenos Aires, Argentina found that nearly as many older people made a net contribu tion to the economic welfare of their households as those who de rived a net benefit from them. As more successful family members moved away from the family home, older parents were often left to provide for sick or unemployed children. Finally, in extended house holds the large role played by elderly women in the care of grand children and other domestic duties often enables younger women to seek employment beyond the home. In crises, the potential contribution of older people can be especially significant. For example, in post- conflict situations and in areas with high rates of AIDS mortality, older people have often been obliged to take on the role of principal carer for grandchildren. Debates about pensions and social security reforms overlook the continued economic activity of older people in developing countries. Given the low coverage of formal f the Courier n\u00b0 176 - juty-august 1999 ",
        "d o s s i er The author's research in South America revealed that in extended households, the role played by elderly women in the care of grandchildren and other domestic duties often enables younger women to seek employment beyond the home pension schemes, it is only to be expected that elderly people will seek additional forms of income. Estimates from the International Labour Organisation show that nearly half of 60 to 64-year-olds and over a quarter of those aged 65 or more were identified as eco nomically-active in 1990. The limited research conducted in these coun tries suggests that the aged are more likely to be involved in infor mal, part-time employment of a kind often under-reported in official sur veys. It is unclear whether this reflects a genuine preference to work on a casual basis or is due to the exclusion of elderly people from more formalised employment oppor tunities. Community programmes The previous section has shown that older people in develop ing countries have the potential to meet at least some of their own income needs and may even provide support to others. It is important to consider policies which may support these income-generating activities and economic independence. A key area for intervention may be the promotion of community-level activ ities which take a strong interest in issues of relevance to older people and in which older people are able to take a leading role. Community programmes may perform a range of income support functions, includ ing the provision of informal credit, and the development of workshop activities. In countries where social welfare schemes for older people exist, they provide advice and sup port for obtaining benefits and assistance. These should be linked to a wider range of services, such as the provision of basic health care and education, as well as social activities. Perhaps more importantly, they can reduce the sense of isola tion experienced by many of the aged and enable them to exchange experiences, articulate concerns and develop confidence, whilst raising the profile of older people in the community at large. Experience has shown that effective associations for more vul nerable social groups usually do not develop spontaneously and often need support from outside agencies, particularly in the early stages of development. To date, most devel oping country governments have not taken a major interest in sup porting such initiatives. This is sur prising, given the large sums spent on old age pensions in some coun tries, particularly in Latin America. At little extra cost, a more holistic approach to social welfare could be taken, complementing high-cost, in effectual pension programmes with a range of wider measures designed to help older people to help them selves. One clear exception to this trend is Argentina, where a para- statal agency (PAMI) had established a network of over a thousand day centres for older people by the early 1990s. These provided a wide range of services and proved to be highly popular. Unfortunately, these day centres did not target the poorest and most vulnerable aged and the responsible agency has accumulated enormous debts due to a combina tion of maladministration and cor ruption. Also, the centres did little to promote income-generating activ ities, reinforcing the philosophy of old age dependence on formal social security. Elsewhere, the task of sup porting local-level associations for older people has been left to NGOs and voluntary organisations. Given the lack of resources dedicated to them, these initiatives are usually small-scale and few and far be tween. The main emphasis has been on developing informal credit sys tems, particularly for elderly women. Successful experiences have been reported in a large number of countries, including Ghana, Peru and Thailand. These initiatives re quired considerable external support (skills and expertise, more than di rect funding) in their initial stages, but have the potential to be self- sustaining in the medium-term. Without support, there is little like lihood that similar credit schemes will develop spontaneously, particu larly among the poorest and most vulnerable. Effective policies are re quired to promote them. This should be a priority for state action, rather than delegated to a handful of NGOs. Income and gender. In developing regions, there are more older women than men, but the imbalance is much less striking than in industrialised coun tries. Indeed, in a small number of cases, such as India in 1990, there were more men than women aged 60 years old or over. As such, it may be an exaggeration to talk of the 'f\u00e9minisation of ageing' as a whole. However, it is apparent that there are important gender differences in terms of the economic opportunities and constraints facing poor older people. Generally speaking, older women are more vulnerable than men. This reflects processes occur ring throughout the life cycle (less access to salaried employment, and fewer opportunities to develop workplace skills and accumulate as sets for later life, etc) as well as processes occurring once they reach old age (they are more likely to be living alone and are less likely to have pension rights). In studies of slum districts in S\u00e3o Paulo and Buenos Aires, I found a small but significant group of highly vulner able older people with virtually no sources of income or social support. The majority of these were women, typically widowed, ex-domestic workers who had been abandoned by their families. Most c o m m u n i ty p r o grammes have taken a particular interest in older women. In part, this is based on the recognition of the gender bias of formal social security programmes and the key role played by many elderly women the Courier n\u00b0 176 - july-august 1999 1 ",
        "in household welfare. In some con texts, however, it may also reflect specific social difficulties facing older men. The transition from salaried employment, with the workplace as the focus of socialisation, to retire ment may be especially problematic for men, particularly in countries with high male labour migration, such as South Africa. Consequently, while not overlooking the general gender bias in income opportunities, it is important not to ignore the particular problems facing older men in developing countries. Final thoughts This article makes some ten tative observations about a small number of issues related to the income security of older people in developing countries. Its inability to give the subject a deeper or more complete treatment reflects a dearth of published research and the low priority given to older people in policy. The key message is that there is an urgent need to move away from traditional paradigms of old age dependence to ones in which the true potential of elderly people is recognised. Formal social security programmes may play a role for some of the aged, but their capacity to meet the income needs of poorer groups will be very limited for the foreseeable future. Nor should the family be seen as some kind of panacea for old age support. Rapid processes of change in developing countries are placing a great strain on traditional social structures. In some cases, it is the younger family members who are economically de pendent on older people, rather than the other way around. If future research is to provide the basis for effective policies, it must recognise that the economic welfare of older people can only be understood with reference to a range of other fac tors, including gender, health and social change. Hi Social security a nd t he e l d e r l y: t he A f r i c an e x p e r i e n ce by Edwin Kaseke* Although the concept of social security is as old as society itself, it has become a topical issue which now occupies the agendas of many governments - particularly in the developing world where social provision is poorly developed. Unfortunately, there has been a tendency to conceptualise it from a western perspective, ignoring non-formal methods of social security. Taking this perspective, the ILO described social security in 1984 as: - the protection which society pro vides for its members through a series of public measures against economic and social distress that otherwise would be caused by the stoppage or substantial reduction of earnings resulting from sickness, ma ternity, employment injury, invalidity and death; - the provision of medical care; - the provision of subsidies for families with children. Thus social security is pro vided on the understanding that individuals are exposed to contin gencies that interrupt their income- earning capacity. These contingen cies, listed in ILO Convention no. 102 of 1952, include old age, unemploy ment, sickness, invalidity, maternity, employment injury and death. The western viewpoint is that since in dividuals do not always have the resources to meet the resulting needs, they need to share risks and pool resources. Western-style social security takes three major forms: social in surance, social assistance and social allowances. Social insurance is a contributory arrangement that pro tects workers and their dependents against contingencies that impair their capacity to earn income (Midg- ley, 1984). The incapacity can be permanent or temporary. Contribu tions come from both employees and employer (in the case of the self-employed, the employer compo nent is absent). Benefits are pro- * School of Social Work, University of Zimbabwe. This is an abridged version of a paper presented at the AGES Conference held in Nairobi on 12-16 April, 1999. vided as a matter of right, and are paid when a member satisfies the contribution requirements. These may be earnings-related or on a flat-rate basis. Social assistance, by contrast, is non-contributory and means- tested. It is, therefore, funded from government revenue and is provided in cash or in kind to people of limited means. It is provided only when applicants have no other source of income. Social allowances are also non-contributory and funded by government. However, they are uni versal and not, therefore, means- tested. They are paid to groups with special needs such as the elderly, people with disabilities and mothers. They are not a common feature of African social security systems. There is a fourth category of social security which is largely pecu liar to Africa. These are the provi dent funds which were introduced in countries such as Tanzania, Ugan da and Zambia. Provident funds are compulsory savings schemes which provide lump sum benefits to mem bers on retirement or when they are exposed to contingencies such as invalidity or sickness. Employers and employees both contribute to the scheme. In considering social security from an African perspective, we should also take account of the non-formal systems that operate on the continent. These are largely based on kinship ties and mutual aid. Midgley (p.103) observed that 'the family also provided for those who could not participate fully in its efforts to produce enough for sub sistence and exchange: in this way those who were economically active supported the young, elderly, handi- 1 the Courier n\" 176 - july-august 1999 ",
        "d o s s i er capped and sick whose productive capacities were limited or impaired.' Thus, there are two major categories of social protection \u00ad formal and non\u00adformal. It is common for many Africans to draw on both of these systems. Non\u00adformal social security Traditionally, the extended family has always been seen as a social security system providing pro\u00ad tection to its members. It is based on the principles of solidarity and reci\u00ad procity, involving obligations on members to support each other in times of need. The elderly were respected and revered for their knowledge and wisdom and their role in interceding between the living and the dead. This guaran\u00ad teed, to a considerable extent, social protection for the elderly. Children too were seen as a source of social protection against the contingency of old age, which explains why African families are usually large. Industrialisation, urbanisa\u00ad tion and westernisation have all led to a gradual disintegration of the extended family system, rendering it ineffective as a social security insti\u00ad tution. Consequently, the elderly now find themselves vulnerable. Some children no longer feel ob\u00ad liged to support their parents and this undermines their role as a source of social protection in old age. Others still recognise their ob\u00ad ligations but are constrained by the harsh economic climate. This makes it difficult for them to extend effec\u00ad tive support to their parents. Over\u00ad all, the assistance rendered is too little to make a difference to the lives of elderly people. Recognising the declining role of the extended family, many rural people are establishing mutual aid societies as a form of social protection most commonly, burial societies. These have also mush\u00ad roomed in urban centres in many African countries. Others include rotating savings and credit schemes which allow members to pool re\u00ad sources and benefit from their con\u00ad tributions on a rotational basis. Un\u00ad fortunately, the very poor find it difficult to participate in such schemes because they do not have the capacity to make regular con\u00ad tributions. How to improve social protection for the elderly Q Strengthen traditional support systems by reasserting the principles of solidarity and reciprocity which have long been the cornerstone of the extended family system. One possibility would be to offer tax incentives to people looking after elderly parents or relatives. \u25a1 Lobby for the payment of a living wage to enable workers not just to meet their current consumption needs but also to save and prepare for old age. \u25a1 Make it mandatory for employers to provide occupational pensions to their employees, and make pensions transferable. \u25a1 Introduce comprehensive social insurance schemes in line with ILO Convention no. 102 of 1952. This should also entail converting provident funds into social insurance schemes to protect beneficiaries from inflation risks. \u25a1 Improve coverage of social insurance schemes by providing for voluntary participation by self\u00ademployed people, including smallholder farmers. Q Lobby governments to allocate adequate resources for public assistance, bearing in mind that many governments spend considerable resources on programmes that do not enhance human well\u00adbeing. Formal social security Although African countries operate some formal social security systems, it is clear that most of these are not comprehensive. The schemes that do exist are often disjointed and offer only rudimentary assis\u00ad tance. An analysis of existing schemes in many countries reveals that most provide protection against the contingency of old age or retire\u00ad ment. An example is Zimbabwe's Pensions and Other Benefits Scheme which gives a retirement benefit to people who have reached the age of 60 (or in some instances 55), and who have contributed to the scheme for at least 10 years. Those who have contributed for less than 10 years receive a retirement grant paid as a lump sum. Zambia has been providing an old age benefit under the Zambia Provident Fund. The benefit is pay\u00ad able on retirement as a lump sum representing the member's contribu\u00ad tions, the employer's contribution and accrued interest. Tanzania has a similar arrangement under the Tanzania National Provident Fund. Namibia and South Africa are differ\u00ad ent in that they provide non\u00adcon\u00ad tributory old age pensions wholly funded by government. Conse\u00ad quently, the coverage is wide, reach\u00ad ing most poor elderly people. Provident funds have inher\u00ad ent weaknesses which make it diffi\u00ad cult for them to provide meaningful social protection in old age. The benefits are vulnerable to inflation since they are not based on the social insurance principal. And as the ILO/UNDP observed in a 1996 document, 'there is \"an absence of insurance and solidarity elements which makes it impossible for those who are unable to maintain lifetime membership to get adequate protec\u00ad tion'. This means that provident fund members do not share the risks of old age. There is no pooling of resources to cover the contingency. As a result, the benefit is minimal and is not linked to the cost of living. Furthermore, the old age benefit provided under such funds is paid as a lump sum, not in the form of long\u00adterm income mainte\u00ad nance. This means that income in\u00ad security continues to haunt the beneficiaries of provident funds. The situation is set to improve, however, following decisions by (among others) the governments of Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia to convert ther provident funds into social insurance schemes based on risk\u00adsharing, pooling of resources and, most importantly, the introduc\u00ad tion of periodic instead of lump sum payments. A major problem in those countries that operate social insur\u00ad ance schemes and provident funds which provide old age pensions is that coverage is low \u00ad ranging between 18% and 30% of the population. The reason for this is that only people in regular employ\u00ad ment can be members of such schemes. But formal employees are only a very small percentage of a country's labour force. Most people live in rural areas where there are few formal sector jobs. Unemploy\u00ad ment is growing, notably in coun\u00ad tries that have structural adjustment the Courier n\u00b0 176 \u00ad july\u00adaugust 1999 i ",
        "d o s s i er programmes. In these circumstances, a significant percentage of the la bour force is denied an opportunity to prepare adequately for old age through savings and/or contributions to social security schemes. It is no surprise that the majority of the elderly still live in abject poverty. The vulnerability of retired people who did have employment can also be attributed to the inade quacy, or complete lack, of occupa tional pensions. In former British colonies, such pensions were initially introduced for the white settler community and it was only later that they were brought in for in digenous populations. Even now, occupational pensions are not man datory in most of the countries under discussion. It is common for low-paid workers to be given objects such as bicycles or wrist watches (in lieu of pensions) when they retire. It is difficult to understand how they can be expected to meet their post- retirement needs. The assumption has always been that African workers retire to their rural homes. In the case of Zimbabwe, Clarke observed in 1977 that rural areas were considered to be a kind of 'indigenous pension'. Meanwhile, most of those lucky enough to contribute to occu pational schemes receive totally in adequate pensions. The problem is exacerbated by employers who pay wages which fall far below the poverty line. Given that pensions are often calculated on the basis of the final salary, it is self-evident that low salaries today will translate into low pension benefits tomorrow. The AIDS pandemic in East ern and Southern Africa has wor sened the problem of income inse curity among elderly people in that many of the latter are forced to take over the care of their grandchildren after the death of the parents. Those who die of AIDS-related illnesses seldom leave much, if anything, for their offspring. Grandparents have to use the limited resources at their disposal to support the children, thereby driving them deeper into poverty. There is no doubt that the elderly are now living very stressful lives. The other form of social security which enables older people to meet their basic needs is the public assistance programme. Most countries in Eastern and Southern Africa operate such programmes, which offer assistance in cash or in kind to elderly persons who are deemed destitute. Although coun tries differ in their level of commit ment to support the destitute, parti cularly the elderly, the tendency is for African governments to allocate minimal resources to such pro grammes. As a result, the help that is available is often inadequate. Kutengule also notes that a sizeable proportion of the funds earmarked for public assistance in Malawi is spent on repatriating destitute peo ple to rural areas. This reduces the amount that accrues directly to the beneficiaries. Elderly people who cannot look after themselves, or who have no relatives to provide care, are often placed in old people's homes. Here they do not receive public assistance although the institutions often receive per capita grants from the government. In some countries, such as Swaziland, the extended family system is still so strong that the elderly are cared for in the community. There are signs though that this will not hold for very long. There are other factors un dermining the effectiveness of pub lic assistance in Eastern and South ern Africa. First, many potential beneficiaries, particularly those liv ing in rural areas, are either una ware of the existence of public assistance or do not know how to access it. Second, such programmes are not poor-friendly in that the offices dispensing the benefits are often located far from the people they are suppose to serve. Poor elderly people cannot be expected to walk long distances and may find it difficult to raise the fare for public transport (if it exists). Finally, it should be recog nised that the implementation of structural adjustment programmes in East and Southern Africa has worsened the plight of the elderly. SAPs have had a negative impact on welfare, undermining both formal and non-formal social security schemes. Conclusion The goal of providing social security to the elderly will remain unfulfilled unless governments re cognise that social welfare is vital to national development. Expendi ture on social welfare should not be considered wasteful but rather as an investment in human capital. Public authorities should take a two- pronged approach to the social protection of the elderly with a view to ensuring that their basic needs are met. Efforts should be directed at the young and middle-aged, enabling them to plan adequately for their retirement. And in their own planning for social security in old age, governments should com bine the formal and non-formal social security systems, recognising that there will always be a large majority unable to access the formal system because they are not in paid employment.

        "The economic c o n d i t i on of e l d e r ly Z i m b a b w e a ns by Donald J. Adamchak 11 The high fertility and declin ing mortality in developing countries in the post-World War II period is now begin ning to be reflected in age ing populations. The number of people aged 60 or over is rising both in absolute terms, and as a proportion of the overall population. This process will accelerate over the next four decades. Between 2000 and 2025, the '60 and over' category will expand by 129% in develop ing countries compared with the rise of 46% that is pre dicted for the developed world. We are already seeing a rapid ageing of the popu lation of east and southeast Asia, but over the next quar ter century, the greatest in crease will be in Africa (146%). Indeed, the elderly population of that continent will double in just 17 years. Zimbabwe is experiencing a rapid increase in the number of elderly persons, and the process is set to accelerate. Between 2000 and 2030 the numbers will in crease by a factor of 2.9 and by 2050, it is estimated that there will be about 3.5 million people in this age category (about 14% of the population). Demographic change and changes in institutional structures * This article was extracted from publica tions from two research projects conducted in Zimbabwe in 1988 and 1995. Dr. Adam- chak is Professor of Sociology at Kansas State University, Manhattan, Kansas, USA. Collaborators for the 1988 project were: Dr. Adrian Wilson, Andrew Nyanguru, and Father Joe Hampson.

One such change is happening in the family. Family support structures may be becoming less responsive just as the number of elderly people is rapidly increasing. Younger and older generations are becoming physically separated as the former migrate from rural to urban areas. The generations are also moving apart ideologically as the young increasingly receive more education and seek employ ment in the formal sector. Also, family size has declined in Zim babwe from 6.5 to 4.3 births per woman in just over a decade. Traditional norms and social ob ligations change in the process of societal change. What was once natural now becomes an obliga tion. Another problem for Zim babwe is that it currently has one of the highest rates of HIV/AIDS infection in Africa. Nearly one in four sexually active adults is HIV positive. This disease is destroying the middle generation - young adults and middle-aged people, leaving the elderly to care for their orphaned grandchildren. This explains why AIDS is known as the 'grandmothers' disease' in parts of Africa. As family support has de clined during the . development process in other parts of the world, alternative mechanisms have been created to fill the void. AIDS is known as the 'grandmothers disease' in parts of Africa because most of its victims come from the middle generation. ",

The only countries in sub\u00adSaharan Africa with national pensions (somewhat equivalent to social security) are South Africa (means\u00adtested) and Namibia (non\u00adtested). There is evi\u00ad dence from African countries that family support is changing and, coupled with the demands of the development process, the elderly may be facing an uncertain future. Any decline in traditional family support could be devastating with\u00ad out a commensurate increase in systemic support. The potential decline of inter\u00adgenerational trans\u00ad fers from children to parents could also negatively affect the transfer from parents and grandparents to younger generations. This is why it is important to understand the socio\u00adeconomic conditions of the elderly and to assess any changes over time. We used data from two surveys of elderly Zimbabweans to report on their economic cir\u00ad cumstances. Both surveys reflected the rural/urban distribution of households in the country (about 68% rural and 32% urban). The sample sizes were 150 elderly respondents in 1988 and 278 in 1995. Often, sample surveys are the sole source of information on income and cash generation. For several reasons, income is very difficult to assess for older Afri\u00ad cans. It is not regular and is not recorded like pensions or social security. There may not be regular and complete census or survey information. Many old people par\u00ad ticipate in the informal economy as agriculturalists or in other sales and service activities. The main sources of cash generation in both surveys were children, agriculture, and the in\u00ad formal economy. Elderly men were more likely to have earned a salary or received a pension than elderly women. Men also relied less on children, agriculture and the in\u00ad formal economy as sources of cash generation. This is consistent with other research which shows that women are the primary subsis\u00ad tence farmers, and that they per\u00ad form various activities in the in\u00ad formal economy. Elderly people also receive income from varied sources \u00ad which may prove to be a good survival strategy. In 1995, approxi\u00ad mately 6 1% of them received cash from t wo or more sources. In terms of inter\u00adgenerational ex\u00ad change, nearly 62% received money from their children (67% of the women and 55% of the men), although the sums involved were a relatively small proportion of their overall cash income. What is the economic con\u00ad dition of older Zimbabweans rela\u00ad tive to the society as a whole? We used income data from 1988 and 1995 to calculate the percentage of the formal sector minimum wage generated by the elderly (see table). One qualification is that these figures only demonstrate what the elderly respondent gen\u00ad erated and not the income of the entire household. Gathering the latter information from the re\u00ad spondents was not practicable and any results obtained would not, in any case, have been very reliable. However, the data on the elderly people's own income and cash is reasonably accurate. As the table shows, the amount involved is low when compared to the formal sector minimum wage \u00ad and the percentage declined be\u00ad tween 1988 and 1995. Men gener\u00ad ated more than twice as much as women, married people were bet\u00ad ter off than those who were widowed, and urban residents did better than their rural counter\u00ad parts. The most vulnerable group, rural widowed women, generated only 16% of the formal sector minimum wage in 1988, and just 6% in 1995. 7 1% of the 1995 respon\u00ad dents reported that they received most support (cash and in\u00adkind) from their children while 8% in\u00ad dicated that other people (mainly relatives) supported them most. 2 1% received no assistance at all. Support generally came in the form of money, clothing, food, and services. On average, the elderly Zimbabweans surveyed in 1995 subsisted on only one\u00adfifth of the formal sector minimum wage. But there were significant differences by place of residence, gender, and marital status. As we have noted, men did a lot better than women \u00ad mainly because more of them received salaries and pensions. Among females, unmarried wo\u00ad men had far less income than those who were married and un\u00ad married rural women were the least favoured of all. Given that elderly people's income and cash resources are already low, and that there was apparently a drop between 1988 and 1995, any further contraction of the resource base will threaten their survival. The declining trend appears consistent with the eco\u00ad nomic conditions of the country between surveys. During that time, unemployment rose, the Zimbab\u00ad wean dollar fell significantly, and structural adjustment programmes made life even more difficult for the poor. W i th development and modernisation leading to structur\u00ad al changes in the family as an institution, the elderly (particularly rural widowed women), will be increasingly vulnerable. This is true for Zimbabwe and also, more generally, for sub\u00adSaharan Africa. Governments and donor organisa\u00ad tions must be made aware of this phenomenon and of the fact that a devastating situation may devel\u00ad op in the future. Meeting the needs of Africa's elderly should become a priority on everyone's agenda. \u25a0\u25a0 1 the Courier n e 176 \u00ad july\u00adaugust 1999 ",
        "The g e n e r o s i ty a nd u n i v e r s a l i ty of S o u th Africa's social pension system by Dr Monica Ferreira* South Africa and Namibia are the only countries in Africa which operate a uni versal, non-contributory so cial old-age pension system. Namibia inherited its system when it gained indepen dence from South Africa in 1990. The generosity and universality of South Africa's pension system are unique by developing country stan dards. The system is also unusual when compared to arrangements in other coun tries in that prior labour- force participation is not a condition for age-qualified individuals to receive bene fits. Access to the system is determined by eligibility criteria. Males aged 65 and over and females aged 60 and over who pass a test of the level and value assigned to their assets are eligible to receive a monthly pension of R520 ( a p p r o x i m a t e ly US$85). Although low in terms of real income, the benefit is equivalent to three times the World Bank's cutoff for absolute poverty and is 2.6 times the per capita income of black people. The benefit consti tutes a sizeable proportion of median income for black families where the pension is the main source of household cash income. Context and apartheid South Africa had three centuries of colonialism and 46 years of apartheid rule, during which time its people were segre gated according to race. People in different race groups were denied equal opportunities for self-ad vancement. The country also has a legacy of discriminatory, inequi table welfare spending. Although recently emerged from apartheid, \u00bbDirector of the HSRC/UCT Centre for Gerontology, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Cape Town, Observatory 7925, South Africa, e-mail: mf@anat.uct.ac.za income inequality between whites and blacks (and, since the 1994 elections, between blacks) remains very high, while the majority of the population is very poor. The social old-age pension was introduced for whites in 1928 and extended to persons in other race groups (blacks, coloureds - people of mixed ancestry - and Indians) in 1944. Historically, the amount of benefit payable to persons in the different race groups was disproportionate, with whites initially receiving four times the amount paid to blacks. How ever, in the 1980s, the government committed itself to eliminating racial discrimination in social pro grammes and parity in pension levels was achieved in 1993. Dur ing this time, the benefit level for whites declined 40% in real terms, while the real value of the pension available to blacks more than doubled. The public, pay-as-you-go pension system is financed by the government from general reven ues. Its total annual cost to the state is about R10 billion, which is equal to about 1 % of GDP and 8% of government expenditure. Coverage and consumption South Africa's population of 41 million is still fairly youthful due to sustained high fertility in the black population. 35% of South Africans are below the age of 14. 7% (approximately 2.8 mil lion people) are aged 60 and over. However 14.2% of whites fall into the latter age group while the figure for the black population is 6.1%. The breakdown of the 60 and over population is 68% black, 22% white, 8% coloured and 2% Indian. More than 90% of older blacks and 80% of older coloured people receive the old-age pen sion. The figure for Indians is 62% and for whites it is just 16%. The majority of those who do not receive the pension are excluded through eligibility criter ia (the means test), rather than administrative obstructions. Most retired whites previously had for mal sector employment and have private or occupational pensions. Previous generations of black workers were largely excluded from this form of retirement in surance and, as a result, few retired with any private retirement provision. Most black households are so poor that the means test excludes few older people. Among whites, it limits the pension to the poorest. The pension is individually- based. Married couples who meet the eligibility criteria may receive two pensions. The benefits are not transferable to surviving family members on the death of a pen sioner. There is evidence that in black and coloured households, the consumption of the pension is collective. Widespread unem ployment (a rate of about 40% among black people) leads to families regrouping around a pen sion beneficiary and sharing the pension money to survive. House holds in which a pensioner resides are found to have higher average incomes than other households, with the exception of female- headed rural households where adult children are absent (so-called 'skip-generation' households). Since the lifting of the influx control laws in 1988, there has been massive urbanisation, with young black adults flocking to the cities in search of job opportunities. Frequently, grand children are left behind in rural areas to be cared for by grand parents. Invariably, unemployed urban migrants are unable to send remittances to elderly parents in rural areas to augment pension income spent on the care of young children. Pensioners are thus a prin cipal source of cash income for a large number of households. In rural communities, pension income the Courier n\u00b0 176 - july-august 1999 1 ",
        "d o s s i er circulates widely and is crucial in combating poverty and reducing material insecurity. The presence of a pensioner in a household is an important determinant of its well- being. Research into the micro- level effects of the pension shows that in black households, signifi cant proportions of the income are spent on food and on the school ing of grandchildren (school fees, books, uniforms and transport). Black grandmothers are especially keen to foster the education of their grandchildren, so that they may have better opportunities in life than they had. The impact and sustainability of the pension system Not only is the number of older South Africans increasing as life expectancy increases - espe cially in the black population. Coverage of the social pension system has also grown rapidly in recent years, as more individuals have entered the system - espe cially in the rural areas. The high coverage reflects the widespread acceptability of the pension as an entitlement. Rather than accep tance of this type of welfare assistance being stigmatised, the pension enhances the social status of beneficiaries within black fa milies and households. Pensioners are shown increased respect by their families and have greater discretionary spending power within the household. It is even suggested that pensioners are re tained at home by poor families, rather than being cared for in old people's homes, where pension benefits would be used to pay accommodation fees and not shared with the family. However, there is a down side to the pension system and it also raises policy issues. As elig ibility for pension benefits is means tested, applicants are forced to withdraw from the la bour market. The system thus affects work and savings incentives for much of the population. The means test discourages many in dividuals from preserving occupa tional retirement benefits and re taining assets. Some prospective beneficiaries may be persuaded to Black grandmothers are especially keen to foster the education of their grandchildren hand over their assets to children. Some adult children and grand children may exploit and generally abuse a pensioner to obtain the pension income. Although the amount of the benefit is perceived to be low, and its beneficiaries routinely claim that it is insuffi cient to meet their needs, it has been argued that larger pensions will gradually crowd out support for the elderly by family members. Pension coverage has grown so rapidly that growth has exceeded budgetary provision in some of the country's nine pro vinces. Short-term fiscal crises, when no funds were available to pay pensioners, occurred in 1998 in the Eastern Cape and Northern Provinces. The system is also dogged by corruption and fraud, perpetrated by government offi cials, intermediaries and benefici aries alike. Some non-qualified individuals try to obtain pension money by devious means. Ghost pensioners are beneficiaries who have died, but whose deaths are not reported and whose families continue to claim the monthly pension by proxy. Despite such crises and lea kages, the system is probably the most effective programme in tar geting and reaching economically vulnerable groups. Its benefits reach deep into poverty-stricken communities. It has been shown that pensions help substantially to reduce rural poverty. Of course, the system also plays a major role in maintaining a standard of living for the majority of older South Africans. For the present, the gov ernment appears to view it as contributing to family welfare, hu man capital formation and poverty alleviation - and thus improving the distribution of economic well- being, especially that of children (notably in skip-generation house holds). Although the pension is intended for poor older indivi duals, it therefore serves as a vital welfare programme more gener ally, especially as a source of household income maintenance. It is not clear what the long-term fiscal burden of the system on the state will be, nor whether it is sustainable. Some economists believe that it will remain affordable as long as the means test remains in place, elig ibility criteria are enforced, corrup tion and fraud are eliminated, and benefits stabilise around present levels. A mitigating factor is that successive cohorts of older people will be better-educated, better- equipped to accumulate savings, and able to benefit from an occupational pension. Thus, in fu ture, fewer individuals will depend on the government for support in old age, thereby reducing the fiscal cost to the state. However, the country still has a fairly youthful population, and the number of economically- active people available to provide for a rapidly growing older and dependent population is shrinking (due, among other things, to AIDS- related mortality). Given the needs of the young, which the new government regard as a priority, it may be expected that fiscal spending will continue to favour this group and that benefits for the increasing numbers of older people will gradually diminish. e the Courier n\u00b0 176 - july-august 1999 ",
        "Focus on r e f u g ee s i t u a t i o ns The needs of older people are often overlooked by Nyorovai Whande* The decision to flee one's country is fraught with pain, sadness, fear and a host of other disturbing emotions. While each refugee situation is created by unique circum stances, common reasons in clude war, social disorganisa tion, political persecution and natural disasters. The fabric of family life is drama tically altered with serious repercussions for all those involved. Alterations to the family structure and organisation begin in the pre-flight stage and con tinue until repatriation. Through out the process, families are ac tively involved in responding to their changed world. External fac tors, such as refugee camp admin istration policies, affect them and the result is a significant power shift from internal to external control over key life decisions. Disruptions to the family may intensify as a direct result of this loss of autonomy in the camp situation, and this has a particular bearing on older refugees. Little research has been done into family coping strategies in a refugee context. Assumptions have been made about the tre mendous upheaval that individuals face, yet we understand very little of the day-to-day existence of families in the camp setting. General situation of older refugees In many cases, where the middle generation is absent for * Senior Regional Community Social Ser vices Officer, United Nations High Commis sioner for Refugees, branch office for Kenya. This is an abridged version of a speech delivered by Ms Whande at the African Gerontological Society Workshop held in Nairobi in April 1999. some, usually tragic, reason, grandparents can find themselves in sole charge of their grandchil dren. Such families are likely to be living in desperate poverty in the absence of an employable bread winner. The physical and mental strains can be enormous as the grandparent struggles to cope, often neglecting his or her own needs in the process. The problem appears to be widepread in refu gee situations, and this underlines the need for a more family- centred concept of care, rather than one in which specific groups are singled out for special treat ment. Neither UNHCR nor the bulk of its implementing partners have specialist resources in geria tric care. A notable exception is HelpAge International (HAI). UNHCR and HAI are working in partnership to explore ways of making all activities more deliber ately inclusive of the elderly. The hope is that relevant training modules and best practice guide lines can be developed together for dissemination to UNHCR and implementing partner staff. A no table example of the cooperation that already exists is in the con tinued refinement of nutritional guidelines to include older refu gees in special feeding pro grammes. In traditional feeding programmes, children under five and pregnant or nursing mothers have been targeted. But alerted by the incidence of malnutrition among older refugees in the camps of Tanzania, where the frail elderly are unable to collect water or firewood for food preparation, HAI has developed a number of community care projects. The aim is to encourage neighbours to help those who are alone or who are caring for young grandchildren. HAI also worked with UNHCR in developing the criteria to assess an older person's nutritional status and hence their eligibility for special feeding. For young chil dren, simple measurements of weight, height or arm circumfer ence can determine nutritional status. The natural ageing process, with body shrinkage, may disguise the hunger of the old.

        "d o s s i er Refugee settings are char acterised by reduced economic circumstances, greater social mobi lity and more rapid social change - which all have the effect of erod ing traditional community values. The elderly no longer enjoy the same authority, care and attention they had in the past. It is worth noting here that the degree of support and respect afforded to older people is by no means uni form in any case. It depends very much on their social status within the community. In short, not all the elderly are elders. In general, however, the role of older people, especially in rural Africa, is very significant. Their responsibilities may include: - settling conflicts within their family, neighbourhood or commu nity, and also with neighbouring villages/communities; - providing counselling on com munity-orientated planning and development issues; - telling the oral history through stories about the community and making sure that its continuity and stability are maintained; - for the female elderly, helping young women in family-related areas such as the changing role of women in refugee households, issues of pregnancy and delivery and so on. The fact of leaving home and becoming a refugee is prob ably more painful for older people than any other age group. They are very much affected by their loss of status and property, and of the sense of security that came from their extended family. Over all, they experience a feeling of vacuum and a loss of identity or belonging that can lead to a great deal of trauma and despair. It is believed that this causes both physical and mental problems, of ten leading to premature death. How to enhance the role of older refugees The neediest among the elderly are often the least visible, and a proper assessment leading to a well-designed programme requires a targeted effort under the supervision of qualified staff. Well-meaning programmes, with out adequate guidance from com munity service officers, can be come merely a conduit for materi al assistance - without proper follow-up or thought being given to how refugees' self-help at tempts might be better supported. At the other extreme is the situation in the refugee camp where no community service struc ture has been provided. An eva luation by the UNHCR has revealed that, in the absence of refugee consultative and self-help struc tures, the needs of older refugees may be completely overlooked and neglected. Only the voices of the most vocal and active refugees are heard. Securing accurate informa tion about the socio-economic cir cumstances of refugees and their quality of life is a vital by-product of well-managed community ser vices programmes. Such informa tion is notoriously difficult to come by, but it is essential for the proper design of assistance activities in all other sectors, in cluding the enhancement of com munity participation and self-help initiatives. Community services projects are not a luxury but a necessity upon which much else can depend. This must be recog nised by both donors and the UNHCR, bearing in mind the bud get reductions affecting the latter which force it to make difficult choices about essential services. The scope of UNHCR's re sponsibility in providing assistance is always problematic and the extent of its involvement in repa triation and reintegration is cur rently being debated. The difficul ties are most graphically illustrated when it comes to the phasing out of programmes that benefit the elderly, particularly where there is a residual caseload of abandoned older persons with no alternative means of support. In phasing out such programmes, support and long-term care arrangements must be established t h r o u gh local NGOs, relevant government minis tries or in conjunction with the international development agen cies such as WHO, the UNDP and the World Bank. Experience shows that the new arrangements may not be come independently viable unless UNHCR engages with local NGOs early on in a concerted capacity- building effort which goes well beyond the occasional briefing or workshop. National NGOs need to be thoroughly trained in project design and fundraising techniques, and helped in setting up a sound administration and identifying and liaising with potential donors.

        "d o s s i er To assist this process, UNHCR is formulating a strategy to enhance NGO partners' effec\u00ad tiveness. This is a field\u00adup process. Key components include: working with governments on procedures and on setting up and registering NGOs; developing guidelines, tools and training modules; and pairing national and international NGOs to plan individual handover stra\u00ad tegies. The UNHCR's cooperation with social affairs ministries re\u00ad mains limited. This may be because the UN body's main counterpart is often a department dedicated so\u00ad lely to refugee affairs or, as is often the case, because the minis\u00ad try in question is one of the weakest and most underfunded in the national administration. If the UNHCR wants to phase out its actions responsibly, it must ensure that residual case\u00ad loads of needy elderly people become the responsibility of com\u00ad petent government departments. As part of its phase\u00adout strategy, UNHCR should also seek to ensure a successful transition from relief to development in the social assistance sector. For the elderly, whether refugees, retur\u00ad nees or displaced persons, this means that they should have ac\u00ad cess to the same services that are available to locals, and that rele\u00ad vant welfare structures should be helped to develop the capacity needed to cope with any added demands. However, in countries affected by war, economic decline or structural adjustment, welfare provision is usually gravely under\u00ad resourced and generally low prior\u00ad ity. In these circumstances, UNHCR can only hope to influence gov\u00ad ernment policy on welfare provi\u00ad sion and funding if its interven\u00ad tions are closely coordinated with sister agencies that are habitually engaged in offering support and advice in this field \u00ad particularly the World Bank, but also WHO and UNDP. These and other agen\u00ad cies have, in recent years, become closely involved in assisting gov\u00ad ernments to manage health care and welfare reforms, and to set up major poverty alleviation pro\u00ad grammes. The framework for co\u00ad operation between UNHCR and the World Bank of April 1998 is a sound basis for establishing these linkages. In large, complex pro\u00ad grammes, UNHCR's phase\u00adout strategy should be subject to a multi\u00adyear plan in which the gra\u00ad dual withdrawal of services in the social assistance sector is linked to the implementation of govern\u00ad ment welfare reforms and poverty alleviation programmes supported by the World Bank and bilateral and multilateral donors. This re\u00ad quires complex negotiations that need to be initiated well in ad\u00ad vance. The needs and problems of older people in an emergency situation are generally overlooked and not addressed in time. The elderly are physically weaker than the young and are less likely to fight to secure the necessary ac\u00ad commodation, food, ration cards and so on. The UN, NGOs and other actors, including local autho\u00ad rities, should ensure that protec\u00ad tion and assistance are given to older people. Elderly refugees are a minority but they are also an easy group to target for special programmes, or for t a p p i ng knowledge and experience. It is recognised that even if the situation in their home coun\u00ad try is desperate, many older peo\u00ad ple will be unprepared to leave. The environment, though hostile, is at least familiar. Some of those who do leave are unable to with\u00ad stand the rigours of the journey and die en route. And many of those who do make it to the refugee camps become invisible to the camp authorities and hu\u00ad manitarian workers because they may only be registered as part of a family rather than individually. Whenever possible, we should use the positive influence of the elderly to provide calm and control in the otherwise chaotic situation of the refugees during influx and arrival in the border areas. We should help older peo\u00ad ple regain their identity and role, and enhance the normal activities mentioned above as much as pos\u00ad sible. In short, we should help older men and women, as far as possible, to play their positive traditional roles in the refugee camp setting. The way forward UNHCR needs to increase its efforts at improving awareness, policy planning and integrated projects for older refugees. While their plight can be severe, they should not be seen only as passive, dependent recipients of assistance and, therefore, somehow socially redundant. Older refugees can be valuable resources for their com\u00ad munities, transmitting the culture, skills and crafts that are so impor\u00ad tant to reaffirm the tradition of the dispossessed and displaced. They are often highly motivated, and ready to make an active contribution to the well\u00adbeing of their kinfolk \u00ad and only become totally dependent in the final stages of disability or illness. The tragedy of older refu\u00ad gees who have been forcibly dis\u00ad placed is not so much that they have become d e p e n d e nt on others, but they have been robbed of the means to provide for others in the manner they would wish. To address the problem of older refugees, the following stra\u00ad tegies have been identified as most critical to their well\u00adbeing: \u00ad their integration into all aspects of programme planning and im\u00ad plementation; \u00adtargeted community services pro\u00ad jects with competent partners; \u00ad advocacy on behalf of the elderly d u r i ng the crucial phase\u00adout stages. Finally, while the elderly clearly have special problems, there is little to be gained from establishing yet another separate refugee category with a distinct set of guidelines and interven\u00ad tions. Rather, a more targeted inclusion of older refugees in all aspects of programme planning and implementation would help the active elderly to be more self\u00ad supporting and would promote better community care initiatives for the very old. Up to now, training programmes, income\u00adgen\u00ad eration schemes, micro\u00adloan pro\u00ad jects and even community devel\u00ad opment projects have rarely been designed specifically to include older refugees, tap their potential and ensure that their voices are heard. \u25a0 the Courier n\u00b0 176 \u00ad july\u00adaugust 1999 1 ",
        "H e l p A ge I n t e r n a t i o n a l: w o r k i ng to correct a m i s l e a d i ng i m a ge by Mark Gorman To mark 1999 - the Interna tional Year of Older Persons, HelpAge International (HAI) is publishing the first com prehensive report on ageing and development. In a pre view, Mark Gorman, Director of Policy and Development at HAI, looks at the situation of older people in develop ing countries and social pol icy options that can relieve poverty and uphold the rights of the over 60s - the fastest growing section of the world's population. HAI is a global network of organisations working with older people, mostly in less developed countries. In 15 years' experience it has found a huge need for sup port. There is a serious lack of hard information about the situation of older people, particularly in the less-developed world, but that which does exist indicates that they are likely to be living in poverty, often marginalised by their communities and unable to access even the most basic health and social service provision. The world's population is ageing rapidly. In 1996 the num ber of people aged 60 and over rose by about one million each month, with nearly 80% of this increase taking place in the devel oping world. Given this situation, there has been much talk of the old age crisis - the problems which will occur across societies as the proportion of younger people available to support their depen dent elders shrinks to critical le vels. This view subscribes to the commonly-held belief that older people are non-contributors and passive recipients of care and sup port. Yet HAI's work and research with older people has found that this image is misleading. The fact is that older people are very often resourceful survivors, employing a range of strategies to support themselves and other family mem bers; and contributing to their communities in a variety of ways, both economic and social. Many people in the developing world work well into their old age, particularly in countries where the majority do not have access to a pension. Census data in Burundi, for example, indicates that 83% of men and 7 9% of women over 60 are still economic ally active. Other older people undertake domestic work within the family unit, such as child care and home management, which is unpaid, but which frees other family members to take up paid employment outside the home. A recent study by HAI in Ghana found that older people - both men and women - have very clear family responsibilities and that where they are unable to be actively involved in household tasks, they supervise the activities of younger adults. Through its work, HAI has found that supporting older peo ple can be an effective way of reducing poverty in communities as a whole. If a crisis is to be avoided, the skills, experience and contribution of older people must be recognised and developed. For this to happen, there is a need for practical projects which tackle ba sic needs and which enable older people to reach their full poten tial. If these issues are addressed by development agencies and pol icy makers, the ageing of the population can be viewed as an opportunity rather than a crisis. HAI therefore works at a practical level, supporting older people and their communities, at policy level to influence regional, national and international policy, and through its network to support local devel opment and older people's orga nisations. HAI's practical work fo cuses on issues raised by older people themselves, most usually income security and health. It has found that the most effective projects are those which involve older people - during initial needs assessments, in the planning and management of projects and as workers on behalf of themselves and their peers. Most projects are small communit-based initiatives which enable older people to access sei vices they are otherwise frequently denied, such as mobile clinics, health education, and in come generation projects. Older people are generally, for example, excluded from development initia tives such as credit schemes, in the belief that they are unable to participate due to frailty, ill health, and shorter life expectancy. Yet where HAI has provided micro credit for older members of the community, they have proved to be an excellent credit risk, with a high percentage of loans being repaid on time and the establish- HelpAge International (HAI) is a network of development, community based, social service and research organisations, mostly in less developed countries, which works to improve the lives of disadvantaged older people. It is the only network of its kind, combining support for members and partners, direct programme implementation, research and advocacy. Increasingly HAI is involved in the formulation of national and international strategies and legislation on ageing. The network was founded in 1983 as an independent charity by five organisations from different countries. From these original five agencies, it has grown to the present membership of 61 organisations worldwide. It currently works with over 200 partners in 70 countries, targeting the most vulnerable older people.

        "d o s s i er ment of many successful small businesses. Older women have demonstrated particular skills, fre\u00ad quently overcoming problems like illiteracy and prejudice from other family members to generate their new income. In many such credit schemes older people employ younger family members in their businesses, which is particularly welcome in communities where unemployment is high. In emergency situations HAI provides direct support to older people and works with other agencies and local partners to ensure the needs of older popula\u00ad tions are addressed. ECHO is cur\u00ad rently funding HAI to research the situation of older people in emer\u00ad gencies, recommend improve\u00ad ments to general relief pro\u00ad grammes and identify best practice in environments where older peo\u00ad ple are particularly vulnerable. As governments and devel\u00ad opment agencies begin to take wider notice of the issues of age\u00ad ing, HAI has increasingly sup\u00ad ported initiatives which put the case for older people. In Bolivia for example, support was given to a public advocacy campaign which resulted in legislation offering health and social security benefits to older people. In countries such as Cambodia, Ghana and Tanzania, HAI has initiated research pro\u00ad grammes to highlight the contri\u00ad Grandfather and grandson harvesting the crop in Sudan. HAI has found that supporting older people can be an effective way of reducing poverty bution of older people to the development process, and combat the view of them as passive reci\u00ad pients of care. In these situations and elsewhere, the projects have culminated in workshops between government and the NGO sector, examining policy options that re\u00ad spond to the research findings. At an inter\u00adgovernmental level also, ageing is beginning to appear on the agenda, although still as an item low down the priority list. This year, for example, the Organisation of African Unity considered ageing at an inter\u00ad ministerial meeting, with HAI Board members making presenta\u00ad tions. HAI also made a presenta\u00ad tion to the European Parliament Development Committee in April 1999 and has supported the work of the UN Economic and Social Council for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) in bringing together coun\u00ad tries of the Mekong Basin region to consider joint initiatives to ad\u00ad dress issues affecting older people. A start has been made in the area of policy development. However, much remains to be done. Older people are still at the back of the queue of priorities, and progress is sometimes difficult to maintain. In the Bolivian exam\u00ad ple mentioned above, a new gov\u00ad ernment reversed many of the benefits given to older people. (The response has been a conti\u00ad nuation of the campaign by older people's groups.) Despite the an\u00ad nouncement of an International Year of Older Persons by the UN, awareness of older people's issues still remains very low in most countries. So there is still a great need for sustained advocacy work to raise awareness and to address the possibilities for change. One of the most effective ways to ensure change for older people is to develop the capacity of local organisations working with them. HAI therefore works with various organisations, both as members and partners of the net\u00ad work, to help them carry out their work more effectively. As a net\u00ad work, it offers expertise in the areas of training, fund\u00adraising and good governance, and pro\u00ad vides information about a wide range of issues specific to ageing in the less developed world. A new initiative in Africa, for example, is enabling training specialists from all HAI member organisations in the region to meet on a regular basis to further their skills and share them with newer or less\u00ad developed groups with an interest in ageing. Fifty years on from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and eight years since the UN adopted specific principles for older persons covering indepen\u00ad dence, care, participation self\u00adful\u00ad filment and dignity, the basic and recognised rights of older citizens are still denied or restricted. Older people face insidious age discrimi\u00ad nation in the provision of services and access to support. They face persecution and abuse; they are forgotten and made invisible in emergencies; our social support systems are inadequate for their needs; their voice goes unheard or is silenced. Now, in the UN Year of Older Persons and on the thresh\u00ad old of a new millennium, it is more than ever the time to take affirmative action in favour of older people to enable them to take their place as active agents of the development process. \u25a0 the Courier n\u00b0 176 \u00ad july\u00adaugust 1999 1 ",
        "H Old Aids the impact of AIDS on older people by Kathleen Okatcha* HIV/AIDS is the single most devastating issue facing the world today. It has become our 20th century plague. The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimated in July 1997 that of the 30 million people who had been infected with the virus, 90% lived in the develop ing countries. By the year 2000, the figure will have risen to 95%. Africa - particularly sub-Saharan Africa - has a gigantic share, with 65% of the world's HIV/AIDS cases. In 1995, the WHO estimated that 16 million Africans had been infected by HIV. East Africa was worst hit, with more than one-third of the world's infections. By November 1998, the figure for Africa had shot up to 21 million. Demographers estimate that Africa's older population will double in size by 2017. However, AIDS will bedevil improvements in health and living, delay ing this expected increase in longevity. But what about us? Health professionals, educators, researchers and service planners have neglected the considerable impact of the AIDS epidemic on older people in terms of the risk they face from HIV infection, and as carers of children with AIDS. The economic, health and socio-psychologi- cal impact of HIV/AIDS on older persons has thus not been given attention in most prevention and management pro grammes. Distorted views are partly to blame for this. For instance, the assumption that HIV/AIDS is a disease of the younger generation has led to the impression that 'older people do not con tract the virus'. The evidence, however, shows that although older people make up only a small proportion of HIV/AIDS sufferers in many countries, it is a signifi cant one. Because HIV/AIDS is seen as a reproductive issue for the 15-49 age group, education programmes are heavi ly focused on the younger generation. In the wake of recent data show ing that HIV prevalence among adults is growing at an alarming rate, the need to boost awareness has become critical. In Africa, some 90% of all HIV transmission occurs via heterosexual sex. This is almost 100 % preventable but in some Kenyan communities sexually-active older people have remarked, 'a real bull dies with grass in the mouth'. Dr Zewdie, the World Bank's AIDS coor dinator, sends out an appropriate mes sage: 'we need to focus on encouraging prevention, specifically among African youth before they become sexually active.' Information is available in family planning clinics, youth-orientated publi cations, areas frequented by young people and sex education centres. Older people are not likely to come across them and when they do may well feel embarrassed to be seen showing inter est. They thus remain unaware that they too are at risk of contracting the disease and lack information on how to protect themselves. Older people are at risk because: - it is thought that they fall within the low risk category. - it is thought that they are least likely to contract HIV/AIDS, so the symp toms which resemble those of other ail ments can at times go undetected or are wrongly diagnosed under the general camouflage of so-called normal old age disease. -undetected and therefore not appropri ately addressed, the onset of the dis ease and eventual death will be quicker, leaving less time for accurate diagnosis. - medical treatments may be less acces sible to older people, since with limited heaith resources older people are not likely to be considered a priority and if they have a pension at all, it will proba bly be inadequate for their needs. If we continue to refuse to accept that the elderly can be infected by HIV, many older people will not be given ade quate medical treatment or care as they suffer the onslaught of opportunistic dis eases which hasten the onset of AIDS. It is a fact that, while most older people are unaware of the risk of contracting HIV/AIDS, many of them are still sexual ly active. A study in America found that 51% of older women and 92% of older men had an active sex life. However, none had considered the use of a condom, and this in a developed society! In Africa, where the elderly are the guardians of tradition and culture, there may well be strong resistance to the use of any preventive measures. Result Older people with or at risk from HIV/AIDS remain silent sufferers, in an environment in which their plight is not fully understood. The impact of HIV/AIDS on older people is judged on health, eco nomic and socio-psychological criteria. The HIV virus does not differen tiate between ages. Like the rest of the population, older people can contract HIV through sex, through the use of unsterilised medical equipment or through contaminated blood products and fluids. \u00cb the Courier n\" 176 - july-august 1999 ",
        "A case in point 69-year-old Mzee James, sponsored by one of our urban projects in the Rift Valley province of Kenya. When James' wife died in 1996, aged about 55 years, he was told that his wife had died of cancer of the liver. Because Mzee James was born to squatter parents of the former white highlands, he owns no piece of land on which he could bury his wife, so she was buried among her people! The Luhya tradition does not allow this, as the spirit of the deceased may not leave James' family alone. That is why 'I keep on wondering whether these diseases affecting me should be treated by the district hospital doctors or whether I should go back to my people to help me carry out the required cleansing rites so that I can get better.' Until January 1999 James was being treated for malaria, coughs and general weakness, opportunistic dis eases which passed for diabetes. The social worker trained by the Catholic Church Social Work Institute and now working for HelpAge expressed her fears but doubted her suspicions because of her cultural values which do not admit that James could have succumbed to what she suspected! She however was adamant that an HIV/AIDS test be car ried out and, to her shock, he was found positive. 'Now I realise that the myths about older people's sexuality in our society will have to be talked about publicly if they are to be equipped with education to protect themselves'. Until now, society has looked to the elderly for advice and guid ance. Whether the old will accept the teaching of the young is another matter. Economic Impact HIV is expensive in terms of med ical care and lost earning capacity. The most economically-active sector of the population tends to bear the highest infection rate. Older persons are thus unexpectedly forced to resume the role of carer and breadwinner, suffering most from the consequences of the virus. They have to provide medical care, emo tional support and income lost when their children, the wage earners, fall sick. This burden can be especially heavy for older people if they themselves have health problems and are economically depen dent on their family members. True Case History Philomena Omolo (78) of the St.Francis HelpAge Programme, Asumbi. The late Philomena Omolo would not agree to be admitted into hospital as she was the sole bread winner for her four orphaned grand children (Clare, 12, Atieno, 9, Brian, 6 and Faith, 2). She died in February 1999, leaving Clare to shoulder the responsibility. In many African countries particu larly the Great Lake Region the econom ic impact of AIDS on older people is clearly evident as lands formerly tilled by the able-bodied lie fallow, and land is sold to meet the huge costs of medical fees in the hope that the sufferers will get better. For those over 75, the eco nomic impact is more critical when they are unable to assume the role of provider and care thrust upon them because of death of their carers. This situation can be as bad as that of expecting a frail old person to be left in the care of grandchildren after the death of their parents. Young children are unlikely to offer adequate care espe cially if they have to become the family breadwinners as they are likely to migrate in search of jobs, leaving the elderly impoverished and lonely. Socio-Psychological impact Loneliness is one of the main problems of the old, whose families have died of AIDS, leaving them with a tremendous burden of grief and insecurity. The diffi cult realisation that their child is dying may be coupled with problems of accept ing that their child has AIDS. This may entail accepting for the first time that their child has engaged in extra-marital sex. Even if the older person is able to cope with this knowledge, they must still deal with the possibly negative reactions of friends and neighbours. At a time when they most need support, older peo ple may experience a considerable degree of social isolation if they are rejected by friends, or simply if they no longer have as much time to visit and socialise. Indeed, the prejudice against older people as HIV/AIDS victims or carers is most devastating in cultures where older people are highly respected. Since they are not expected to be sexually active, it may be shocking for relatives and com munity members to realise that they have been having sexual relations, espe cially if outside marriage or if the older person has had multiple partners or used commercial sex workers. This leads to loss of face and family honour within the extended family as well as within the community, magnifying the feelings of shame, guilt and depression felt by older people. Similarly, older people who have HIV/AIDS themselves are often isolated by their families, leaving them destitute and traumatised. These problems are exacerbated where, as happens all too often, there is no support or education for the older persons. What can be done? People of all ages are at risk from HIV/AIDS. HIV/AIDS programme strate gists should address all groups of people affected included the elderly, otherwise the expected longevity of older persons might turn out to be a fallacy! Counselling on the socio-psycho- logical impact of HIV/AIDS should be made available within easy reach of the elderly in their own local environments. The 15-49 age range must be educated about prevention of HIV/AIDS but people of 55+ must also be addressed so that they are made aware that they are at risk. Appropriate informa tion and communication materials should be produced for this. the Courier n\u00b0 176 - july-august 1999 S ",
        "Strategies to care for HIV/AIDs- positive orphaned children need to be put in place at community level as the skill of care and magnitude of the prob\u00ad lem can not be left to older people, who are ill-equipped to cope - emotionally, financially and physically. Subsidies should be made avail\u00ad able for carers of orphaned children and policies and laws and systems put in place to protect their rights, especially for property inheritance of both orphans and widows. NGOs in collaboration with National Governments should strive to help the economic plight of older per\u00ad sons through development of income- generating activities to help them deal with the economic demands placed on them by their unfamiliar roles. The HIV/AIDs scourge is the last straw for the crumbling and already over\u00ad burdened traditional system of care and support for older people. National Governments need to address this issue in all planning programmes. Who will care for the elderly when they cannot care for themselves? The elderly cannot and must not be seen as an extension of the popula\u00ad tion pyramid that tapers off to oblivion and is forgotten. They are an integral part of society, with a greater role to play than ever before. * Chief Executive, HelpAge, Kenya. This is an abridged version of a paper presented at the AGES Conference held in Nairobi on 12-16 April, 1999. Facts and Figures About 90% of all HIV transmission in Africa occurs via hetero\u00ad sexual sex; this is 100% preventable. This underscores the need to spread public awareness, a criti\u00ad cal aspect of prevention, to all vulnerable groups. An estimated 87% of the world's children infected with the HIV virus live in Africa. This places the care givers at risk unless they know how to protect themselves AIDS has lowered average life expectancy by as much as \u0399\u039f\u00ad \u0399 7 years in some African countries. Hardest hit is Zimbabwe where AIDS has reduced life expectancy by more than 20 years. The expected increase in life expectancy for older persons due to improved medical services may prove a fallacy if HIV/AIDS programmes on creation awareness do not target all groups at risk. AIDS has overtaken malaria and other diseases as the leading cause of death for adults between the ages of 15-49 Increased Lifetime Risk of Dying from AIDS. The World Bank gives the following statistics: Ethiopia (11%), South Africa (24%), Kenya (31%), Uganda (35%), Tanzania (39%), Malawi (43%), Botswana (44%), Zimbabwe (53%), Zambia (68%). 95% of Africans infected with HIV/AIDS live in abject poverty.

        "Regionally a grim picture exists Africa has some 10% of the world's population, and 63% (21 million) of the world's HIV/AIDS cases. An average of 3,800 adults in Africa are infected daily. No part of Africa is untouched by the disease. About 87% of the world's infected children live in Africa. AIDS has lowered average life expectancy levels by as much as 17 years in some African countries. Zimbabwe is hardest-hit - life expectancy is reduced by more than 20 years. AIDS has overtaken malaria and other diseases as the lead ing cause of death for adults between the ages of 15 - 49. 95% of Africans infected with AIDS live in abject poverty. Implications Resources are already overstretched. Older people are also part of this group. Public awareness is a critical part of prevention and needs a serious boost.

        "W i s d om a nd w i t c h e ry by Kate Forrester Kibuga* Tanzanian newspapers have highlighted a deeply disturb ing trend in certain rural areas involving a rise in the number of 'witchcraft kill ings', the victims being el derly women. The problem is most common in the north of the country. This is not the way it has always been. Older women traditionally hold an important and re spected role in society, as advisors and in ceremonial functions. Many still do to this day. In their advisory role, they guide young girls to make wise decisions and live their lives ac cording to traditional practices. In some communities, there are per iods when adolescent girls go into retreat with older women to pre pare themselves for marriage. Many older women also take part in the traditional councils of el ders, which used to be the main bodies regulating village society. The ceremonial role of old er women has several facets. They organise the traditional pre-mari tal activities including the negotia tions and actual handing over of the dowry. In the Mwanza region, in the north, the oldest woman in the community makes the ceremo nial lupundu cry, to mark the moment when the herd of cattle (the dowry) leaves the groom's homestead. A similar lupundu cry is made by the oldest woman in the bride's community to mark the approach or arrival of the live stock. Many older women also take part in customary rites to maintain harmony in the commu nity and to ensure that favourable weather conditions occur each year. This may, for example, in volve the performance of secret rituals at the graves of stillborn twins whose location is only * Tanzania-based freelance consultant spe cialising in social research, and participatory and gender issues. This is an abridged version of an article submitted by the author. known to the older women of certain clans. It may entail offering selected foodstuffs or livestock (such as milk, bananas, white goats or black hens) at ceremonies on sacred hilltops or under ancient trees. The third role of older women is their day-to-day func tion within the family, which usually involves looking after grandchildren, and in particular, telling them stories when the day's work is done. There is an especially strong bond between Tanzanian grandmothers and their grandchil dren. Older women also take on light household tasks, such as picking through grains, preparing vegetables and weaving mats or baskets. However, it seems that nowadays, the advisory and cere monial roles of elderly women, and even their valued position within the family, are diminishing as society changes. Meanwhile, they are increasingly expected to take on a much more active role. This is connected to a decline in family support, often due to mi gration of younger people from villages, and the increasing diffi culty of meeting basic needs in a new and harsh economic climate. Many older w o m en are now forced to generate income simply to keep themselves alive, and to pay for medical treatment. Others have shouldered the responsibil ities of running a family, having been left with grandchildren by parents who have either departed from the village or died, or by young single mothers who cannot cope with bringing up their chil dren. Older women themselves say that they are now viewed in a different light. Rather than being sought out for advice, their destitution and struggle for day- to-day survival has undermined the respect they once commanded. They report that young people often regard them with scorn and are no longer willing to listen to them or take their advice. The younger generation are said to see the village context and the wisdom of their elders as irrele vant to their aspirations, and feel that they know more about the modern world than their grand mothers. Belief in witchcraft is as old as society itself, but it has always been kept in check, in part by the councils of elders as the collective wisdom of older people. But nowadays, more and more older women are being accused of being witches, and such accusa tions often have grim conse quences. The t y p i c al course of events can be illustrated by the story of Shoma Ngeleka: she lived comfortably with her sons and daughters-in-law in the home where she had moved when she married in the 1950s.

        "had died many years previously, but had ensured that his wife would be provided for in her old age by leaving much of the prop\u00ad erty in her care. She was devoted to her grandchildren and spent much time with them when the other adults were out working in the fields. Then two of the smaller grandchildren became sick. As the days lengthened into weeks, there seemed to be nothing the local traditional healer could do for them, and the children became weaker and weaker. In the end, the family, suspecting witchcraft, went to the village diviner. He pointed the finger at Shoma, sug\u00ad gesting that she was casting an evil spell on the children. Horrified by this news, her oldest son con\u00ad tacted a group of local thugs who were prepared to do anything, for a price. Shoma herself, reviled by the family, fled to a distant hut. One night soon afterwards, two hooded youths broke in and hacked her to death with ma\u00ad chetes. So why is there this alarm\u00ad ing trend in some rural areas? One reason that has been suggested is that the circumstances and appear\u00ad ance of older women conspire against them. Nowadays, many more widows live alone than be\u00ad fore, and if they are not seen much around the village, an air of mystery may grow up around them. They have no support to counter witchcraft accusations. They are weak, vulnerable and usually poor, so do not have the resources to fight. They may often have physical signs which influ\u00ad ence those inclined to believe in witchcraft: for example, bloodshot eyes from cooking over a smoky fire all their lives, and the inescap\u00ad able characteristics of old age any\u00ad where (wrinkles, bags under the eyes, grey hair, twisted limbs and gnarled hands). But this is clearly not the full explanation. We also need to look at the wider picture. It seems likely that the upsurge in killings is also a reaction to sudden changes in Tanzanian life \u00ad social upheaval, frightening new diseases, freak weather conditions which devas\u00ad tate agriculture, and huge in\u00ad creases in living costs. People may be casting around for scapegoats \u00ad and finding them in the form of defenceless older women. There will also be those who are greedy, and impatient to inherit the resources of the elderly. Trumped up accusations of witch\u00ad craft may be one of the easiest ways of getting their hands on the coveted property. Or they may see the trend as offering business opportunities. A diviner who suc\u00ad cessfully identifies witches will at\u00ad tract customers, while the contract The value of older people within the family is under threat as society changes killers (a very small minority, it should be stressed) may find the 'business' more profitable than working the dusty soils of a crop field. It is important to empha\u00ad sise that older women in many communities throughout Tanzania are still held in great respect, are frequently consulted for their wis\u00ad dom and are still asked to carry out the traditional rites. There are a lot of places where witchcraft is not seen as a sinister force and killings do not take place. But the evidence of a rise in witchcraft accusations, mistreatment and kill\u00ad ings is a disturbing trend now seen in various parts of the country. It is a problem, according to older women themselves, to which even the wisdom of the elders has no answer. \u25a0\u25a0 the Courier n\u00b0 176 \u00ad july\u00adaugust 1999 | ",
        "An e i g h t - vo of t he A f ri l u me epic charts t he h i s t o ry n peoples The final volume of the Histoire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l'Afri que ('A general history of Africa') - the HGA - has at last been published. This ambitious project, started by UNESCO in 1964, has taken 35 years to complete. The HGA, in the form of collections of specialised ar ticles, is the impressive result of international intellectual cooperation, and now Africa and the rest of the world have an unrivalled tool at their disposal. The project follows the story of Africa from prehistory to today and offers a fresh standpoint on the history of a continent about which hasty conclu sions have too often been drawn. Members of the interna tional scientific committee responsi ble for overseeing production of the HGA had a specific objective: 'To correct the inaccuracies arising from Africa's having been viewed through the distorting lens of colonial stereo types'. In other words, a different view of Africa had to be promoted and its contributions to mankind's common heritage revealed. It was in 1964 that the UNESCO General Con ference, meeting in Paris, gave the green light for this ambitious pro ject, at a time when UNESCO was anxious to set up an inter-cultural dialogue. Newly independent coun tries in Africa and Asia were keen to confirm their cultural identities to the world and to have them rehabi litated and better known. The con text in which this project was born was that of the creation of the OAU, the World Festival of the Art of Black Nations in Dakar and the International Conference of African Studies in Accra - in short, the backdrop was one of a global re naissance of African culture. The matrix of history is essential to confirming and acknowledging cul tural identity, so, before moving on to aspects of the work's publication, it was necessary to provide the means for research and enquiry into the cultures it was proposed to review. The project developed in a number of stages. Firstly, historians dealt with origins. From 1965 to 1970, research was carried out into sources of African history, i.e. oral, archive-based, archaeological or lin guistic records. Five years were de voted to campaigns of excavations and to drawing up a record of oral traditions, particularly in the valley of the Niger River, where a Centre for Linguistic and Historical Studies Through the Oral Tradition (CELTHO) was set up at Niamey (there is another in Botswana - the EACRO- TANAL - in Gaborone). The second stage, from 1970 to 1980, was given over to composing the work, which consisted of setting up an interna tional scientific committee responsi ble for overseeing the process. The structure of the volumes was mapped out at that time: paste ups/artwork were set up, and authors for the various articles were sought, with a single director re sponsible for each volume. The publication stage began in 1980. Volumes I and II came out in 1980-81 and thereafter as permitted by the work of the directors and their chapter-author colleagues. From 1990 onwards, however, finan cial difficulties, due to the departure of the United States and other Member States from UNESCO, weighed heavily on the organisa tion. A new strategy was set up, allowing the publication of the final volumes through extra-budgetary financial contributions. The eighth and last volume in the series has now been published and the com pletion of the work celebrated at a meeting in Tripoli in May 1999. Volume VIII relates to contemporary Africa, and the director is AH Mazrui, a political historian from Kenya and the co-director is Christophe Wondji, who is responsible for the series at UNESCO. Mr Wondji is unable to conceal his enthusiasm for the pro ject: 'It is essentially an analysis of liberation movements, decolonisa tion, the reconstruction of the con tinent, development problems and international relations'. He has one regret: not having been able to take the 1990s into account, this having been an eventful decade for Africa. He went on to say: 'Each volume is specific, having required an effort of memory in reviewing the heritage of Western historiogra- de l'Afrique phy, which describes civilisations with an oral tradition as being inferior in some way, thereby erect ing barriers between a White, devel oped Africa and a stationary, Black Africa awaiting outside influences'. How is this represented in the text? Before giving a few examples, Chris tophe Wondji points out that the preparatory stages did not discrimi nate between the various scholars. All the world's major specialists working on Africa in their own countries were invited to take part. Even within the 39-strong interna tional committee, one third were non-Africans: Americans, English, Brazilians and specialists from the Caribbean all made a contribution. 'In fact, we took particular care to the Courier n\u00b0 176 - july-august 1999 ",
        "c u l t u re a nd s o c i e ty incorporate data from within Afri can history, thereby systematically refuting the clich\u00e9s of so-called uni versal history'. The HGA principally challenges the thesis according to which Black Africa has no inner dynamic. 'It has always been thought that the State structures of pre-colonial Africa, together with its artistic structures, were due to con tributions from outside, that Blacks were somehow incapable of creating civilisations. On such points as these, we took account of authentic Afri can traditions, demonstrating that these states and kingdoms came into being endogenously, that Africa was creative and not simply a receptacle for civilisations born of Islam or from elsewhere. The use of iron did not come from the Northern hemi sphere, domestication of agriculture from Asia. And then there is the great controversy of ancient Egypt, started by Sheikh Anta Diop, which postulates the earlier presence of Blacks in ancient Egypt - this debate has given rise to a number of controversies, which are covered in Volume II'. Foreign colleagues took part in the debate on the process of 're- focusing' on Africa, and they worked towards the same goal. Account was taken of their view points, and issues on which opinion diverged were clearly indicated in the works in question. To re-cast history is no easy task - there were many points of friction. Some were cleared up, such as those relating to the slave trade. Although it was widely accepted that the number of Blacks exported into slavery was not so large (6 million according to some), that the continent had not been radically depopulated, 'we were able to demonstrate that en ormous numbers of people left, and that, for every Black exported, three to four other people died. We corrected the figures and concluded that the final total is about 40 million Africans'. Publicity and distribution Publication of the last vo lume actually marks the start of a new venture: publicising and distri buting the series. Two editions of the collection have been printed: a main edition in three languages (French, English, Arabic) and five translations (Chinese, Spanish, Japa nese and Portuguese). An abridged edition has been published in French and in English, together with three translations into African languages (haoussa, kiswahili, peul), to pro mote greater awareness of the work I Histoire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l'Afrique Volume I M\u00e9thodologie et pr\u00e9histoire africaine Directeur du volume: J.

Distribution of the series in English does not seem to have posed much of a problem. As re gards the French versions of the main edition, a succession of pub lishing houses has been employed to publish and circulate it, giving rise to production delays, inadequate supplies and nebulously written joint publishing contracts. The sec ond problem relates to the cost of the work for the populations of developing countries: one volume costs?45.73 (CFAF 30 000). This was why the abridged version was pub lished (?12.20 or CFAF 8 000), but it remains inaccessible to teachers, stu dents and intellectuals in poor coun tries. The need now is to define an efficient promotion strategy, be cause 'almost 20 years after its first volume was launched, sales of the HGA represent only 4% of the investment made. Its low level of circulation may be attributed in particular to a failure to target any promotion campaign. UNESCO has its own distri bution circuit: books first go to national commissions, which inform African ministries. Then there are outlets in African capitals, but every thing depends on their selling flair. Sales have been disappointing, so UNESCO is seeking to develop a strategy whereby it would enter into an association with commercial and publishing partners in order to set up a distribution circuit. The inter national scientific committee has made enquiries in Tripoli and has approached a number of govern ments. Certain proposals have al ready been formulated, particularly the organisation of consultations with publishers, media circles and teaching partners, with a view to studying precisely what is involved in promoting and using this work for the purposes of teaching and cultural education (video cassettes, CD ROM, documentaries). Neverthe less, the major challenge is to work out how to incorporate this 'cor rected' history into school books throughout the world. A work of reference, the HGA offers the public at large a different and constructive viewpoint on the history of the African con tinent. Its promoters are aiming higher, however: they want the series to serve as a point of depar ture for the expression of key ideas, so that populations can coexist with out papering over their differences in a climate of mutual understand ing. For Christophe Wondji, this is the only hope of seeing peace spread throughout the world. ^B the Courier n\u00b0 176 - july-august 1999 ",
        "Something for everyone at Harare Festival by ish Mafundikwa* The inaugural Harare Inter\u00ad national Festival of the Arts (HIFA) was held in the Zim\u00ad babwean capital from April 28 to May 2 1999. The five\u00ad day extravaganza, which presented theatre, dance, music and visual arts from Europe, Southern Africa and the Americas, is being hailed as an unqualified success. It may be early days yet, but the event is already being compared to similar festivals such as Grahamstown in South Africa and Edinburgh in Scotland, on which it is modelled. The diversity of the pro\u00ad gramme ensured something for everyone. Sandwiched between the opening choral rendering of Carmi\u00ad na Burana and the closing and uplifting performance by the Lon\u00ad don Community Gospel Choir, festi\u00ad val goers enjoyed an arts and culture cocktail never before experienced in Zimbabwe. The festival is the brainchild of 34 year old Manuel Bagorro, a Zimbabwean classical concert pianist who returned to the country re\u00ad cently after spending 14 years in London. 'We have got so much going on in the arts sector in this country and it has been a dream of mine to showcase it,' said Bagorro. 'Cultural tourism can be a big money earner for the country and once the festival is established, we should have many visitors from abroad going back and spreading the word about the many positive things Zimbabwe has to offer.' Bagorro also highlighted the 'feel good' factor. 'Zimbabwe is currently experiencing hard economic times and a festival of this nature provides a distraction from these problems, albeit tem\u00ad porarily.' Judging by the number of people who turned up for the different shows, the festival accom\u00ad plished this. The streets of central Harare, normally almost deserted after hours, were humming during the festival. 'It's really unique to see * Journalist based in Harare. the people coming out in such large numbers; the ambience is just un\u00ad believable,' said a diplomat whose country was one of the festival's major sponsors. Obtaining funding for an event of this magnitude was the major hurdle in transforming Bagor\u00ad ro's idea into reality. Besides lobby\u00ad ing foreign embassies and donor organisations, he also approached private companies. 'Corporate spon\u00ad sorship is the key to the growth of HIFA and I had to convince compa\u00ad nies that they would get mileage from being financially associated with the festival.' Major firms, which are notorious for penny pinching when it comes to the arts, surpris\u00ad ingly opened their coffers and gave generously to HIFA, making it the biggest sponsored event in Zim\u00ad babwe. 'We got the targeted Z$6m in cash and kind, and some airlines donated tickets for artistes to travel to and from the festival', said Ba\u00ad gorro. While some, including Ste\u00ad ven Chifunyise, secretary at the Ministry of Education, Sports and Culture, are optimistic that the arts will benefit from more corporate sponsorship after the success of HIFA, theatre director Dr Susan Hains is a little more cautious. 'HIFA is a high profile, highly visible event and companies will fall over themselves to be part of it,' she acknowledged. But she pointed out that she had been struggling for more than 13 years to obtain corporate sponsor\u00ad ship for various theatre projects, with very little success. She blames part of this reluctance on the gov\u00ad ernment which offers no tax relief to firms for arts sponsorship or even for donations to charities. Another rea\u00ad son, she noted, is that artistes are not taken seriously. 'Not too many people here view the arts sector as a business or as a serious employer,' she complained. She hopes that events such as HIFA might raise the profile of artistes in Zimbabwe. Besides the entertainment, described by many as of high qual\u00ad ity, local artistes also had the oppor\u00ad tunity to network and experience current trends in other countries. Helge Skoog, a Swedish director, noted that Zimbabwean theatre was, to a great extent, 'one\u00addimen\u00ad sional'. 'I hope when theatre practi\u00ad tioners come to see productions from other countries, they can learn something,' he said. This sentiment was echoed by Susan Hains who argued that Zimbabwean theatre tended to be too pedantic and 'preachy'. 'Most local productions lecture but do not inform or enter\u00ad tain.' One theatrical highlight of the festival was the play 'Ipi Zombi?' by the Third World Bunfight theatre company from South Africa. The play is based on a true story and deals with the collision of cultures and religions in Black South Africa. It is a superb mixture of music, dance and narration. 'You experience the cleansing and healing of theatre in that production,' said Hains. Dance buffs also had more than their share. There was a variety of traditional African dance groups, modern dance from troupes such as the Tumbuka Dance Company and tango from Argentina. Resides Carmina Burana and the London Gospel Choir, other big crowd pullers were Mahube, an ensemble of 12 leading musicians from Zimbabwe, South Africa, Mala\u00ad wi and Mozambique, and the French reggae group Baobab. One of the most voiced criticisms of the festival was the lack of participants from the continent beyond Southern Africa. Bagorro countered this by saying that his initial aim was to put Zimbabwean talent under the spotlight before going further north, 'We have al\u00ad ready made a start with the very talented Mahube. The next festival should see more African countries represented.' With the promotion of Zimbabwean arts and artistes in mind, the festival's media awards were limited to Zimbabwean partici\u00ad pants. Whatever happens, the Zim\u00ad babwean arts and cultural landscape will never be the same again. If the festival organisers are able to build on the lessons of the initial effort, HIFA should, like the Grahamstown festival, grow into one of the big\u00ad gest annual cultural events in sub\u00ad Saharan Africa. \u25a0\u25a0 | the Courier n\u00b0 176 \u00ad july\u00adaugust 1999 ",
        "Banana p r o d u c t i on - f o od security's m a j or economie c h a l l e n ge by Eric Four\u00e9 and Hugues Tezenas du Monteei* 700 million people suffer from malnutrition today. Feeding the world - particu larly the developing coun tries - is one of the major challenges of the next cen tury. Bananas could be part of the answer. They are the fourth most important food crop in the world after rice, wheat and maize, and a staple food in many coun tries. World production stands at 86 million tonnes. Bananas are a food source for over 400 million people in tropical countries and are vital to the peasant farmers who pro duce, consume or sell them at local markets, and also for the most underprivileged populations. For many developing countries, bana na exports are an important source of income. After rice, w h e at and maize, bananas are the most im portant food crop in the world. *CIRAD Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation (CTA) Postbus 380, 6700 AJ Wageningen, Netherlands Tel. Fax E-mail Website: (31) 317 467100 (31) 317 460067 cta@cta.nl www.cta.nl The Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation (CTA) was established in 1983 under the Lom\u00e9 Convention between the ACP (African, Caribbean and Pacific) Group of States and the European Union Member States. CTA's tasks are to develop and provide services that improve access to information for agricultural and rural development, and to strengthen the capacity of ACP countries to produce, acquire, exchange and utilise informa tion in these areas. Ninety per cent of production is consumed locally, particularly in the poorest countries in Africa, Latin America and Asia. More than other food crops, bananas protect such populations against food shortages and have become their basic foodstuff. In some regions, bananas are the main crop. Over 120 countries pro duce bananas, with world produc tion estimated at 85 million tonnes, 30 million tonnes of which is plantains. Of this volume, 98% of bananas and all plantains origi nate from developing countries. The poorest nations supply 42% of total banana production. The production of cooking bana nas (plantains and other bananas) is estimated at 20 million tonnes for the continent of Africa, which produces approximately 50% of the world's plantains (25% coming from South America, 15% from Asia and 10% from Central Amer ica). Per capita consumption varies from country to country: from 2 kg/hab/year in China to 50 kg/hab/year in Oceania and even 250 kg/hab/year in East Africa (Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi), parti cularly in cooked form or as beer. Not just eaten off the tree In some countries, mashed banana is often the first solid food given to infants. Green bananas, which have been dried and pro cessed into flour, are also used in baking. In the Philippines, they produce banana ketchup, and the heart of the pseudo-trunk is greatly valued in India and Ethio pia. In the Far East, the male buds are eaten as a salad vegetable. The pseudo-trunk is used for building dams or for feeding livestock. The fibres are used to make ropes, clothing and fishing nets, and the leaves are also extremely useful as a roofing material. Recognition of the indus try's diversity allows produce to be better utilised and, through pro cessing, new uses for bananas to be identified. Banana trees grow in very different environmental condi tions. The growing methods used, and the harvesting, transport and marketing processes involved in banana production are many, and depend on the final product and the variety or varieties used to meet the needs of the consumer or end-user. The genus Musa is extre mely diverse and individual regio nal characteristics are illustrated by the existence of four highly speci fic sectors: - banana trees in East Africa (for cooking, beer) - banana trees in the Pacific (Popoulou and Maia Maoli) - banana trees in Pisang Berangan (Indonesia) and Saba-Cardaba (Phi lippines) - plantains in West and Central Africa. the Courier n\u00b0 176 - july-august 1999 I ",
        "e t a - b u l l e t in There is also great diversity within the various export sectors, in terms of how these relate to target products and new market oppor tunities: - plantains (regional markets and international trade in Colombia, Cameroon, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic) - Figue sucr\u00e9e, Figue pomme and Pome/Prata (Malaysia, Thailand, Colombia, West Indies, Brazil, Aus tralia) - ecological, biological bananas (Costa Rica, Dominican Republic). Local processing of bana nas for human consumption (flour, crisps, beer, ketchup), animal feed (fruits, leaves) or industrial uses (starch, textiles) is a further de monstration of the industry's great diversity. Organisation of markets and marketing The development of mar kets in terms of organisation, marketing, consumption and sea sonal instability bear witness to the dynamic nature of the sector. The phenomenon most frequently encountered and analysed, con cerning bananas for local con sumption as opposed to dessert bananas for export, is the size of markets in major urban centres. The volume and the nature of the markets vary. In developed, non-producer countries, the mar ket is ethnic in character and is part of the foodstuff-diversity phe nomenon. In producer countries, the size of the market compared with production varies a great deal. There is an uninterrupted range of situations where supply and demand are alternately domi nant, which should lead to differ ent methods of intervention. An in-depth analysis of supply and demand and their variations is still pending. In most countries, it comes up against considerable methodological pro blems. In terms of consumption, v a r i o us analyses s h ow t h at although bananas play a major role in food security for rural households, they also have a flex ible response to the evolution of demand in urban environments. This observation leads one to accord great importance to the Bananas and plantains are grown under very varied systems and highly diverse climatic and soil conditions. sector's current development, char acterised by a dissociation be tween food-security requirements and the solvent demand of urban markets. In all cases, the main con cern of those responsible for mar keting produce is to overcome short- and medium-term varia tions. Traditional systems often work satisfactorily where the State is unable to intervene to any degree. Where the market dom inates production, efficiency is sought in the marketing system as the result of a concern to reduce costs to consumers and/or to strengthen the producers' posi tion. Agricultural research is of ten called upon to support gov ernment action, in the absence of a satisfactory analysis of the situa tion. Above all, it aims at improv ing supply. Market evolution requires socio-economic research to be stepped up, in order to meet both market needs and those of the end-consumer. Production systems It is also interesting to examine systems of production and types of farming, and to analyse the factors in their evolu tion. Bananas and plantains are grown under very varied systems and highly diverse climatic and soil conditions. For example, in Central Africa, plantains are part of food- production systems, but the devel opment of cash crops (coffee, cocoa, etc.) where plantains are present temporarily or perma nently strengthens their position in industrial-type production sys tems. The development of cer tain commercial outlets has also promoted the establishment of mono-specific, often reasonably extensive, plantain crops, after forests have been cleared. At present, production sys tems correspond to more or less advanced diversification strategies and to differing degrees of mar keting for bananas, compared with crops grown solely for con sumption. In order better to identify the constraints on the various types of production, there is a need to draw up diagnoses in Symposium in Douala I The strategic role of bananas and plantains in food security and the diversity of methods of production and consumption became clearly apparent during the 68 scientific presentations at the international symposium on banana production, held in Douala, Cameroon, from 10 to 14 November 1998. Organised by the CRBP (Regional Banana and Plantain Research Centre) and the INIBAP (International Network for the Improvement of Banana and Plantain), in collaboration with the CTA and the CIRAD (International Centre for Agricultural Research for Development) this colloquium, held under the auspices of MINREST (Cameroon's Scientific and Technical Research Ministry) also received support from the European Union, French cooperation arrangements and the FAO. For the first time, this symposium offered a socio-economic clarification of banana production for non-industrial purposes. Bananas are an essential component in terms of food security in many developing countries. The 120 delegates at this conference, from Asia, Latin America, Africa, the Caribbean, the Pacific and Europe, showed great interest in the five topics on the agenda: importance in economic and food terms; diversity and dynamic nature of the industry; organisation of markets and marketing; production systems; and, the response of research to constraints in the industry. The objective of this workshop was to evaluate the size and importance of banana production in each of the world's regions (countries, sub-regions, regions), the general trends surrounding such production and the latter's place in rural development, agricultural policy, economics and society, as well as in food terms. \u00ce the Courier n\u00b0 176 - july-august 1999 ",
        "e t a - b u l l e t in peasant-farmer environments. Such diagnoses require study adapted to the various levels of analysis: the plot of land, the farm, the micro-region and the sector over a whole region. The response of research to constraints in the sector Acknowledgement and un\u00ad derstanding of the dynamics of the various sectors have been tackled in previous workshops. It is important to consider the suit\u00ad ability of the responses proposed by research in light of the princi\u00ad pal existing constraints. Greater industry under\u00ad standing of consumers' and a need to offer producers opportunities for improving production are now of paramount importance. Research should concen\u00ad trate on the four major compo\u00ad nents of food security: supply; marketing and distribution; consu\u00ad mers' access to produce; and use. Supply The role of current re\u00ad search in the field of genetic enhancement (creation of new varieties/hybrids with greater agri\u00ad cultural potential and resistance to various parasites) and of crop protection, for creating sustain\u00ad able crops should be examined. Another top priority is re\u00ad search into soil-fertility problems, to promote sustainable production given the ongoing increase in population and subsequent reduc\u00ad tion in the amount of land avail\u00ad able. Marketing and distribution Accurate and reliable sta\u00ad tistics are needed if the evolution of supply and demand is to be monitored. The d e v e l o p m e nt of watchdog organisations to moni\u00ad tor distribution and marketing networks has been strongly recom\u00ad mended. Indeed, the setting-up of market watchdog organisations (relating to production and con\u00ad sumption) in producer countries and regions should allow im\u00ad proved acquisition of such data. The experience of the CRBP (Re\u00ad gional Banana and Plantain Re\u00ad search Centre) in Cameroon is useful in the exchange of informa\u00ad tion both at regional and interna\u00ad tional level. Consumers' access to produce Access to produce differs, depending on whether the popu\u00ad lation in question is rural or urban. Rural populations always have sa\u00ad tisfactory access to produce, irre\u00ad spective of their degree of poverty. In urban environments, on the other hand, bananas and plantains are still expensive, and it is usually only the better-off who can afford them. Differences in price be\u00ad tween rural and urban markets appear to be due principally to the perishable nature of the fruits and to the large number of middle men involved in the distribution and marketing chain. Better consumer access to produce would thus come about principally through improved road infrastructures, transport and sto\u00ad rage. The cost of the produce in urban environments is not the only constraint imposed on con\u00ad sumers. Types of consumption dif\u00ad fer between rural and urban areas, and other products, such as rice, compete with bananas and plan\u00ad tains on account of their being \"user-friendly\". Research is important in promoting the marketing of pro\u00ad ducts which are more suited to consumers' requirements. Use The creation of new pro\u00ad ducts would help to meet consu\u00ad mers' expectations. Such diversifi\u00ad cation of food and non-food pro\u00ad ducts (fibres, cosmetic products, etc) from banana trees would stimulate production by generat\u00ad ing added value for the product, There also seems to be a need to improve products in terms of qual\u00ad ity and consumer safety. M E.F. & H.T.d.M. CTA information on plantains and bananas I The dominant role of plantains and bananas in the economy and nutrition of many ACP countries was recognised by CTA at the outset of its activities, and in 1987 CTA organised a major seminar in Montpellier, France, on information systems for these two crops. CTA's partner for this event was the International Network for the Improvement of Banana and Plantain (INIBAP), through which CTA continues to support information needs for these crops. In recent years, CTA has supported INIBAP's newsletter Infomusa and the journal Musarama. These publications are produced in both English and French; they are conventional hard copy journals at present, but steps are being taken to facilitate their availability in electronic format. CTA has also supported the \u00ab\u00bbpublication of INIBAP's Technical Guideline series, which is distributed by INIBAP and which addresses the needs of the research community. Support to Musalogue, through which INIBAP will catalogue genetic diversity in the genus Musa, is under active consideration.

The leather industry is based on the valorisation of hides, a product located at the crossroads of breeding and meat production. It is the leather industry's job to maximise the economic po tential of this raw material while minimising waste. Many projects have been set up in Africa since the Sixties, but most of them have not sur vived due to the lack of external financing, except in South Africa, which is a major manufacturing base. Today, the large, often State- owned projects clearly contrast with the private SMEs and their increasing dynamism. A potentially competitive sector One of the major difficul ties encountered in the leather and hides sector in Africa has been and remains the establishment of a sufficiently strong system in which all the key regional actors CDI The Centre for the Development of Industry (CDI) is a joint ACP-EU institution created in the framework of the Lom\u00e9 Convention linking the European Union with the 71 ACP countries (Africa, Caribbean, Pacific). Its objective is to support the creation, expansion and restructuring of industrial companies in ACP countries. To this effect, the Centre promotes partnerships between ACP and European companies. These part nerships may take various forms: financial, technical and commercial partnerships, management contracts, licensing or fran chise agreements, sub-contracting, etc. Editor: Mr. Surendra Sharma Director of the CDI Avenue Herrmann Debroux, 52 B-1160 Brussels, Belgium Tel.: +32 2 679 18 11 Fax: +32 2 675 26 03 e-mail: directorQcdi.be Internet Website: www.cdi.be interact, exchange ideas and re sources, in view of increasing ca pacities. Its development faces var ious problems: although the first phases of leather tanning are correctly mastered by some of the African producers, there is a gen uine lack in the harvesting of hides, a weak link between pro duction and processing and a lack of consistency in the quality of processing operations. That results in the export of products with low quality, a lack of know-how, tech nology, added value, processing installations and pertinent infor mation. Great efforts have been made to provide solutions to these problems which contribute to the commercial weakness of this sector in Africa. The leather sector is one of the fields in which African countries have the possibility to export semi- and manufactured products. Continued economic de regulation in a number of African countries leads to a situation in which the local industries are no longer protected from competi- ln Ethiopia and elsewhere, the quality of raw materials affects the value of more elaborate products tion, and their competitiveness becomes a matter of survival. An important development is the fact that leather is no longer a standard raw material. Rather, it has become a specialised product whose demand is as varied as the market niches it satisfies. In light of this, satisfying the various mar ket demands requires more and more technical know-how, advice in terms of quality and fashion, and the understanding of prefer ences demonstrated by consumers. The most lucrative markets are also the most difficult to pene trate. The obstacles to the ex porting of raw materials and to the importing of products from the leather and hides sector have proliferated over the past decades. They constitute a genuine threat as they provide erroneous indica tions to operators in the sector and contribute to the artificial development of regional produc tion capacities that do not meet the real needs of the global mar- i the Courier n\u00b0 176 - july-august 1999 ",

The lack of market orientation and frenzied production without prior environmental impact studies have led to bottlenecks in the market as well as to serious pollu tion threats. The first ones in danger are those who work in the tanneries themselves. The Leather and Hides Sector in Europe The European tanning in dustry is at the heart of the global leather network. It accounts for nearly 50% of the global raw material imports, 25% of the world production of raw materials and 30% of the global production of finished leather and hide pro ducts. On a national level, Italy alone represents 60% of the Eur opean industry, Spain 12%, France, Germany and Great Britain be tween 4 and 6%. The European companies - more than 3,000 that directly employ some 50,000 per sons and generate annual turnover in the neighbourhood of EURO 9.5 billion - absorb approximately 80% of African exports. Europe plays a major role in the sector's long-term development, not only in terms of trade but also market development, training, research and development and environ mental technology. In this regard, CDI has for a number of years provided substantial assistance to this sector of activity, via ESALIA in Africa and in collaboration with COTANCE in Europe. ESALIA: the African intermediary A successful name in the sector is ESALIA (Eastern and Southern Africa Leather Industries Association). It is an association A data bank I One of ESALIA's accom plishments made possible by CDI is the creation of a Leather and Trade Infor mation Data Bank for Eastern and Southern African countries. Two direc tories - one on raw materials and tanneries, and the other on shoes and other finished products - have been made with CDI financial backing. These publications aim to pro vide information to current and potential buyers of leather products sold by ESALIA pro ducers as well as to potential investors or joint venture part ners. These directories contain useful background information on the countries concerned as well as characteristics of the raw materials, shoes and leather products they offer. created so that national associa tions in the leather and shoe sectors can interact. These associa tions belong to nine countries from Eastern and Southern Africa: the Association of Ethiopian Tan ners, the Association of Kenyan Tanners, the Malawi Leather In dustry, the Namibian Leather and Related Products Industry, the Su danese Leather Association, the Tanzanian Leather Association, the Ugandan Leather and Related Products Industries, the Zambian Leather Association and the Zim babwean Leather Industries. The leather sector plays - directly or indirectly - a major role in the region's economic development. With its 94.5 million head of cattle, 65.53 million sheep and 57.56 goats, the region annually produces 9 million cattle hides, 16 million sheep skins and 16.2 mil lion goat skins. In addition to the labour required in the primary sector, these figures indicate the quantity of raw material available for the production of elaborated articles in the leather and hides sector. Following the success of ESALIA, the sub-regional West African Association of Profes sionals in Leather, Hides and Re lated Products was recently cre ated. It is to be hoped that this French-speaking organisation will function with as much success as ESALIA. Mali, Senegal and Niger have a very interesting raw mate rial potential, both in terms of quantity and quality. COTANCE: the European intermediary The Confederation of Na tional Associations of Tanners the European Union (COTANCE) is the representative body of the Eur opean leather industry.

Created in the form of a non profit association, it aims to inter nationally promote the European interests in the sector. COTANCE also acts as coordinator of GERIC (European Group of Leather Re search Institutes), which included all the European Union's techno logical centres working on re search and development for the leather industry. Among the many results are concerns regarding the respect of the environment in the regions where leather is exploited. COTANCE's strategy for Africa The strategy outlined here after was adopted in Porto on January 20, 1998, during a meet ing organised by the APIC, a Portuguese member of the federa tion. COTANCE and its member associations aim to eliminate all types of protective measures. This goal must guide the efforts made in Europe-Africa relations in the mutual interest of the parties con cerned. COTANCE and its member associations can contribute signifi cantly to the economic integration of the European and African leather industries, the former of fering the latter a valid model in economic and e n v i r o n m e n t al terms. COTANCE feel it imperative to only allow the private sector to organise trade fairs so as to avoid public mismanagement that could perturb normal market operations. Workers at Elico-UAF in Ethiopia That being said, the financing and public support of Euro-African projects must be exploited to the maximum and in a concerted manner in order to obtain the best possible results. Thus, COTANCE is proud that tne Common Fund for Commodities (CFC) in Amsterdam is considering financing a pro gramme aimed at improving the leather and hide classification and pricing system in Kenya, Ethiopia, Zambia and Tanzania. The Eur opean leather industry has ex pressed its interest in taking an active part in the elaboration and implementation of the project. Following the CDI action, the investment bankers at the Consistency in quality is a permanent challenge European and national levels are invited to join their forces with those of COTANCE to maximise the valorisation potential of raw ma terials in Africa, in the great inter est of the international leather community. Related industries - such as accessories and compo nents, chemical products and ma chines - have also been called upon to take part in the initiative. CDI in action CDI provides assistance to ESALIA to help it attain some of its objectives as well as institutional reinforcement; in this case, it gives members the opportunities and means to exchange their points of view on subjects related to the leather industry. ESALIA also wants to promote and protect the inter ests of this industry in the region providing or seeking information on the problems of common inter est and by transmitting these solu tions to members. Other promo tional actions aim to improve the sales of leather industry products inside and outside the region as well as attain and maintain quality standards corresponding to market prices. To help see clearly, market studies and other forms of statis tical and economic research are encouraged to help ESALIA mem bers. Among the development activities assisted by CDI through ESALIA are the participation of companies in known trade fairs, with specific goals in mind: first of all, reinforce and expand the in ternational market share of Afri can leather and related products; next, exhibit the African products to foreign buyers and consumers, products that will improve the overall image of Africa as a sup plier of leather and related pro ducts; last, show as many as pos sible of the African leather pro ducts because numerous European traders have admitted their lack of awareness in the sector. Since 1997 when the colla boration began, African compa nies have taken part in the Line- apelle trade fair in Bologne (Italy) and in the Africa Leather Fair in Johannesburg (South Africa).

        "c d i \u00ad p a r t n e r s h ip I The Lineapelle trade fair in Bologne Organised from May 5 through 7 1999, this semi\u00adannual meeting was highlighted by new records and various hopes. It is estimated that the volume of trade related to the global leather and imitation materials industry amounts to some USD 70 billion with Italy leading the way in the production of equipment, accessories, and semi\u00adfinished and finished products. This year, 1,534 exhibitors from 46 countries and 30,000 buyers from 116 countries took part in the Lineapelle fair. Contrary to other fairs in the same sector, this one was enhanced by an increase in the volume of business handled as well as in the satisfaction of those who took part. This was accomplished in spite of the deterioration of the global market recorded over the past t wo years, including in Italy. The weakness of raw materials and the stagnation of demand have led to rather dim perspectives for 1999 and will necessitate restructuring in the companies if the situation does not improve. Only certain fields have remained sheltered from difficulties, such as leather for upholstery or the automobile sector and the shoe sector. The wealth of new products exhibited at Lineapelle rekindled customer interest. Bright colours are back, associated with shapes inspired by technological research. The fashion presentations reserved for large professionals that will take place on September 28 and 29 at Palazzo Albergati (region of Bologne) will set the tone for the 2000\u00ad 2001 autumn\u00adwinter season.

The trade fairs have enhanced the image of the leather sector in Africa. The Northern and Southern African countries are known to be linked to the Eur\u00ad opean leather sector and do not usually identify themselves with the rest of the continent: the Northern and Southern African leather products have a good \u00a1mage on the international mar\u00ad ket. These trade fairs, through co\u00ad operation w i th COTANCE and UNIC (Italian Tanners Association), have provided other African coun\u00ad tries with opportunities to make themselves more visible on the market. CDI also co\u00adfinanced a visit organised in March 1999 for the members of the Italian Tanners Association with their Ethiopian counterparts. Discussions involved the global situation of the leather sector in Ethiopia, the joint ven\u00ad ture possibilities, matters of qual\u00ad ity, trade and investment regula\u00ad tions (see Partnership Nr. 42). In cooperation with CO\u00ad TANCE, CDI is currently organising an industrial partnership meeting on leather for West African French\u00adspeaking countries and Eur\u00ad opean tanners. It will take place from October 12\u00ad14 1999 in Dakar (Senegal); it will gather the max\u00ad imum number possible of leather and hide producers, West African merchants and tanners, as well as a delegation of European tanners. Seminars, personalised visits and visits to sites in the Dakar region are part of the programme elabo\u00ad rated by CDI and COTANCE. The execution of the project benefits from support provided by the Technical Centre for Leather Shoes and Goods (France) and UNIC (Italian Tanners Association). CDI, COTANCE and UNIC cooperate with the recently created West African Sub\u00adregional Association of Professions in Leather, Hides and Related Products. Among the other activities scheduled or underway is the training programme in leather finishing at Lowveld Leather Pro\u00ad ducts Ltd. in Zimbabwe where a tannery management expert and a leather finishing technician will help reorganise the finishing de\u00ad partment. Elsewhere, a training course on shoe conception in sub\u00ad Saharan regions was organised in June in Durban (South Africa) and in early July in Thika (Kenya) with the participation of entrepreneurs from the region. There is a chance that, in the near future, CDI will evaluate the needs indicated by ten ACP companies that took part in the above trade fairs as a follow\u00adup to CDI actions. CDI is increasingly called upon for various projects and types of actions, a fact that illus\u00ad trates the intense activity in this sector in Africa. Europe is currently fine\u00adtuning its assistance and tech\u00ad nico\u00adfinancial policy in this field.

A West African Re public whose current presi dent is Mr. Alpha Oumar Konar\u00e9, Mali covers an area of 1,241,238 km 2 , or 1/25 of Africa. It is bordered by Mauritania on the north west, Algeria on the north east, Niger on the east south east, Burkina Faso and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire on the south, Guinea on the south west and Senegal on the west. Endowed with an essentially dry and hot Sudano-Sahelian climate, the country has no access to the Atlantic Ocean, but two major rivers cross its territory: the Senegal (669 km in Mali) and the Niger (1,780 km in Mali). The capital is Bamako, the official languages are French and Bambara. The currency is the CFA Franc. The country is in the GMT time zone. In 1998, the population was estimated at 9.8 million resi dents with an annual growth rate of 2%. The north and the centre of the country are in the saharan zone. The main economic activity is noma dic livestock breeding and herding. The less arid south, is more densely populated and more favourable for Evolution of major national production levels 1996-1997 Production Agricultural products Breeding products Mining products F CFA F CFA 138 billion 158.5 billion F CFA F CFA 29 billion 30.7 billion F CFA F CFA 40 billion 117.7 billion varied economic activities. Mali is known, for its cotton (522,000 tons produced in 1998) and wool, its milk industry as well as its leather and hides sector. Construction materials are experiencing growing industrial exploitation. Moreover, fabrics, bask etry, pottery and sculptures are among the country's many export products. Mali agriculture offers a wide variety of products destined for markets throughout the world. Among the main fresh produce are mangoes and green vegetables. Pea nuts, rice, corn and shea nuts are sold on both domestic and foreign markets. Mali has confirmed deposits of gold (with increasingly prosper ous exploitation), iron ore (reserves estimated at more than 1 billion tons), bauxite (reserves estimated at 1.2 billion tons), manganese (re serves estimated at 10 million tons), diamonds, phosphates and marble. Preparation of 'wet blue' at the Tannerie de l'Afrique de l'Ouest SA Strong support of the private sector Since 1980, Mali has been implementing a major reform pro gramme encouraged by the Interna tional Monetary Fund. In addition to the full or partial privatisation of certain companies (telecommunica tions and electricity), the Mali gov ernment has made great efforts to strengthen the private sector, the driving force of all economic devel opment. These efforts involve devel oping the legal and statutory frame work for business. Among these are a new investment code, a new trade code, a new mining code, a new employment code and the creation of a one-stop desk for all investment information, managed by the Na tional Industries Management. An effort to harmonise the national texts with those of the UEMOA is underway. A National Centre for Investment Promotion (NCIP) has been created. With the advent of multi-party politics in March 1991, Mali has resumed economic growth: the annual growth rate for 1998 was 4.6%, compared with 6.7% in 1997, and the average rate of inflation for 1998 was 4.2% (2.8% in 1997). The budget deficit amounted to 7% of GDP compared with 14% in 1994. For 1998, the GDP has been evalu ated at F CFA 1,573 billion. The improvement of the business climate has drawn a significant flow of direct investment: from F CFA 689 million in 1995 to F CFA 6 billion in 1997, excluding investments in the mining sector. The 1997 figures reveal that the major clients for Mali's products are the UEMOA (55.4%), Western Europe (26.9%) and Asia (13.4%). CDI's assistance Over the past three years, CDI assistance, with the support of the NCIP, has made it possible to generate approximately EURO 8 mil lion in new investments, 260 direct jobs and EURO 15 million of turn over. The Centre will concentrate its efforts on the following sectors: meat/milk, leather and hides, con struction materials and textiles. Based on the conclusions of a sector al study on textiles, a partnership meeting for UEMOA countries is scheduled for October or November 1999 in Bamako. ^M CDI Contacts: Hamed Sow and Alioune Badara Ndiaye. the Courier n\u00b0 176 - july-august 1999 ",
        "Maragra Renovation of a large sugar project in Mozambique Nationalised, re\u00adprivatised and re\u00adcapitalised with CDI assistance, the Maragra su\u00ad gar company in Mozambique appears now on the road to major success, both in terms of production volume, turn\u00ad over generated and the quantity of labour involved. It associates investors from Mozambique, Portugal and South Africa. The Maragra pro\u00ad ject involves one of the four renovated sugar refi\u00ad neries in Mozambique working toward regaining annual production of 55,000 tons of sugar. Cre\u00ad ated in 1910 by Portuguese in\u00ad dustrialists, this company began by growing bananas for export to the Transvaal (South Africa). Imposed export restric\u00ad tions to South Africa severely affected the original investors who then turned their attention to sugar cane. A feasibility study illustrates the project's viability. The family business, Marracuene Agricole e Commercial, was re\u00ad structured to form Marracuene Agricole A\u00e7ucareira, 'Maragra' in short. The growing of sugar cane began in 1960; a sugar refinery was built in 1968. Pro\u00ad duction began in 1970 and at\u00ad tained a peak of 44,100 tons in 1973. But in March 1974, the change in government led to the nationalisation of the sugar fields and refinery. Production collapsed and was stopped in 1984. At the end of the eighties, the progressive return to eco\u00ad nomic deregulation enabled Por\u00ad tuguese industrialists to begin negotiations with the Mozambi\u00ad que government. In 1994, all the properties and installations were returned; the renovation of the sugar complex became their new objective. Word was then sent out to potential investors who wished to invest in Maragra and Sugar cane processing to lend their technical and mar\u00ad keting know\u00adhow. CDI interventions A feasibility study co\u00adfi\u00ad nanced in 1995\u00ad96 by CDI, ICEP, FCE and the British sugar group of Tate & Lyle confirmed the economic interest in the project. The project was presented in 1996 by CDI to the European Investment Bank (EIB) in Luxem\u00ad bourg. The same year, the Portu\u00ad guese industrialists entered into negotiations with the large South African sugar group, lllovo Sugar Ltd, which took over from Tate & Lyle. lllovo is specialised in the growing of sugar cane, the pro\u00ad duction of sugar, the refining and packaging. With seven sugar re\u00ad fineries and 44% of the market representing 1.1 million tons of sugar per year, lllovo is the largest sugar producer in South Africa and on the African con\u00ad tinent. A preliminary meeting to finance the project was organised in April 1996 between the EIB, lllovo and the Portuguese promo\u00ad ters. The negotiations finally led, in 1998, to the restructuring of the sugar complex into two enti\u00ad ties: Maragra Acucur (production unit) and Maragra Commercial (marketing unit), lllovo acquired 50% of the capital of Maragra Ac\u00facur. The total amount re\u00ad quired for the renovation of the installations and plantations is estimated at EURO 61 million. In early 1998, the financing was entrusted to Standard Bank of London. The financing plan fore\u00ad sees a EURO 25 million capital contribution by lllovo and a EURO 37 million long\u00adterm credit, underwritten by the major Eur\u00ad opean financing and develop\u00ad ment institutions (EIB, Proparco, DEG) as well as by the World Bank (via the International Finan\u00ad cing Company) and the South African Development Bank. The credit contracts are scheduled to be signed in late June 1999. The actual renovation work on the sugar refinery began in May 1998 and is expected to take eighteen months. Thanks to additional CDI assistance, the op\u00ad erational Mozambique team is trained in sugar refineries in South Africa and Malawi. In the long run, it should replace the expatriates who currently hold key posts because of the shortage of local expertise. Maragra Acu\u00ad cur and Maragra Commercial em\u00ad ploy more than 1,300 workers, including some ten expatriates. The stimulus for the local econo\u00ad my is huge, because the company requires some 3,000 seasonal workers. P r o d u c t i on f or 1999 should reach 19,000 tons and will gradually increase to 55,000 tons \u00ad its current maximum capacity \u00ad by 2001. The entire production is destined for the local market and should be sold in Maputo or neighbouring areas. Mozambique could also benefit from an annual export quota of 15,000 tons to the United States. Negotiations are underway to also obtain an export quota for the European Union. \u25a0 CDI Contact: Jean\u00adMarie Roth the Courier n\" 176 \u00ad july\u00adaugust 1999 | ",

        "In brief Cameroon: success of a poultry project assisted by CDI Robert Jourdain, a well known figure for 45 years in French-speaking Africa for his accomplishments in the poultry field, was recently offi cially given a decoration for his merits. In 1994-95, when Cameroon was going through a very difficult period, this bold entrepreneur took on a challenge that was considered , unworkable by many: against the advice of numerous ex perts and international finan cial organisations, he decided to re-open one of the three I former State poultry com plexes that had been forced to shut down. With the persis tent support of CDI, he won the bet and succeeded in pri vatising and renovating the company. With two increases in capital since 1995 and annual production of more than 2 million chicks, the Mvog-Betsi poultry complex is an increasingly viable concern. The awarding of the Camer oon Knight of Merit on March 23, 1999, by Mr. Hamadjoda Adjoudji, Minister of Breeding, Fishing and Animal Industries, to Mr. Robert Jour dain also honours the efforts made by CDI to develop the poultry sector in Cameroon. HB CDI Contacts: Babs Adenaike and Julien Nahayo Garment manufacturing: Contracting Leipzig From February 13 through 15 1999, CDI sponsored a group of seven Zimbabwe garment manufacturing companies so that they could exhibit their goods at the Leipzig (Germany) trade fair, mainly oriented towards the markets of central, eastern and south ern Europe but also towards the Mid dle East and Far East. Thanks to collaboration between Zimtrade, the Centre of Productivity NPC-NECCI and CDI, the exhibiting companies were prepared and assisted to take part in this event. CDI assistance was part of the framework of a long-term assis tance programme to the Zimbabwe garment manufacturing sector. HB CDI Contact: Jorge Borges Minetime International mining congress The international congress Minetime held from June 9 through 15 1999 in D\u00fcsseldorf (Germany) was organised in the framework of efforts made by CDI to develop the mining sector in ACP countries, with a focus on its interventions in the SADC zone. Minetime is a decennial fair that welcomes more than 2,000 exhibitors. This edition will benefit from rein forced collaboration among the SADC Mining Co-ordination Unit, the GTZ (German Technical Co-operation) and CDI. The sub-sectors targeted encom pass construction materials and both ferrous and non-ferrous exportable ores. Particular emphasis will be placed on the transfers of know-how and technology, export promotion and the environmental management of mining projects. HB CDI Contacts: Sid Boubekeur and Jorges Borges Walloonia-Gabon partnership Following the example of other industrial twinning programmes underway with France, Spain, Portu gal, Austria and Belgium, this proposi tion concerns a similar programme between Walloon and Gabonese en trepreneurs. The general objectives of the programme are numerous. First of all, the programme seeks to develop a selected group of existing companies from the Gabonese industrial sector, with priority being given to the fol lowing fields: metal working and mechanical sub-contracting, agro-in dustry, plastics, wood and construction materials. Criteria have been defined to select the small and medium-size Gabonese companies likely to make the most of the programme. The Walloon companies chosen will be industrial concerns corresponding to the motivational and expertise criteria sought. Prolonging this development effort, it will be necessary to enable the Walloon and Gabonese companies to conceive and carry out multi-fa cetted partnerships. That will be ac complished by bringing companies from the same guilds together, a method known as 'twinning'. This programme is scheduled to be spread over one year. BB CDI Contacts: Georges Tatepo and Orlan do Perez Diaz Guide on dimension stone in Southern Africa The global expansion of the dimension stone sector and related industries encouraged European op erators to search for new resources in ACP countries, particularly in Southern Africa because of its rich variety of marbles and granites.

        "Development NGOs take stock What role will the Develop ment NGOs have in the future? This was the sub ject addressed by delegates to the 25th General Assem bly of the Development NGOs, who met in Brussels from 15 to 16 April 1999 together with their princi pal partner, the European Commission. The 900 Devel opment NGOs from the 15 n a t i o n al p l a t f o r ms re viewed the changes that had taken place over 25 years of cooperation. The C h a i r m an of t he DNGO/EU Liaison Commit tee Mike Aaronson referred in his opening speech to the challenges it had pro mised to take on: redefining the role of the Development NGOs in European development coopera tion; improving working relation ships between the Development NGOs and the Commission; and, finally, influencing the nature of the relationship the EU would have with the development world in the next millennium. However, procedural questions dominated the meeting. Firstly, the NGOs were highly critical of EU-imposed procedures, which they thought too bureaucratic and which, in their opinion, were a handicap to the smooth running of development operations and caused delay in projects. According to the Chairman of the Liaison Committee, a large number of contracts had been blocked be cause of the blanket imposition of bank guarantees on the NGOs. Another problem was 'excessive' prudence in the wake of scandals revealed in the press, leading to an increase in rigorous checks on where EU subsidies ended up and other verification measures. The NGOs stressed the need for a redefinition of the nature of their relationship with the EU. There was also much discussion on matters of transparency and of the accountability of those involved in development - ethics and practice, consistency and relevance of ac tions, and the requirement for transparency also concern donors and sponsors. The role of the DNGO/EU Liaison Committee is to contribute as much as possible to the running and monitoring of the EU's devel opment cooperation, emergency aid and other policies affecting relations between the Union and the southern hemisphere, whilst offering civil societies in that hemisphere a voice in Europe, encouraging a positive and pro gress-oriented European approach to international affairs and striving to improve quality, the field of application and the impact of the EU's cooperation and foreign assis tance. Facing up to His Excellency the Market The implications of world trade were once again examined during the conference entitled 'From the MIA to the Millennium Round' organised at the European Parlia ment by the Green Group on 27 and 28 April 1999. Multilateral trade negotiations concern parti cularly the partners of developing countries who are attempting to devise a common approach before the start of the Seattle cycle (USA), scheduled for November 1999. Participants at this meeting voiced their concerns: according to the Greens, the process of globalisa tion is continuing to intensify social inequalities, to damage the environment and to exacerbate economic insecurity, while finan cial crises continue uninterrupted. Despite this, new economic liberal isation projects are still being launched. The MIA (Multilateral Investment Agreement), which was to be con cluded last year, was finally aban doned by the OECD in December 1998. Riding on the crest of this victory, delegates at the confer ence congratulated themselves on the fact that the resistance move ment formed by the mobilisation of grass roots associations and groupings, trades unions, NGOs, politicians and citizens f r om around the world had ultimately defeated supporters of the MIA. Based on this experience, the international conference orga nised at the European Parliament brought together opponents of ongoing economic and financial deregulation who were seeking alternatives with a view to guar anteeing a better quality of life for the inhabitants of the planet. The method they used was the study of MIA clones, analysing preparations for the WTO Millen nium Round and the Lom\u00e9 reform in order to have all the facts to hand to enable them to draw up alternatives. This international conference fol lowed on from the third P7 con ference (representing the world's seven poorest countries, as op posed to the G7), which focused on negotiation of the Lom\u00e9 ac cords. Those taking part from the southern hemisphere raised the issue of the direct access of civil society in the South to Community funds. First conference of Economic and Finance Ministers from French- speaking countries Investment and i n t e r n a t i o n al trade: these were the subjects on the agenda for the 44 Economic and Finance Ministers from the States and G o v e r n m e n ts of French-speaking countries, who met for the first time in Monaco on 14 and 15 April 1999. In their joint declaration, they stressed the importance of the forthcoming multilateral trade negotiations in Seattle and reaffirmed that the purpose of the WTO (World Trade Organisation) was to receive all members of the international com munity. The Finance Ministers from French-speaking countries intend to step up their collaboration whereby they hope to encourage the international trade system to contribute more to sustainable development and to fulfilling the aspirations of marginalised popu lations. The ministers pledged to take action to promote the crea tion of a stable political and legal environment, favourable to an increase in investment and trade, particularly through the harmoni- I the Courier n\u00b0 176 - july-august 1999 ",

Nigeria In a joint communiqu\u00e9, the Eur opean Commission and Nigeria announced a resumption of devel opment cooperation in the wake of preliminary discussions between the Community's executive, the transitional government and the new Nigerian authorities. Full re sumption of cooperation became effective as of 1 June 1999 and follows on from the coming to power, on 29 May 1999, of Mr Olusegun Obasanjo, the first Ni gerian President to be democrati cally elected after 16 years of military rule, confirming the EU Council's recent decision to lift the last remaining sanctions. By October 1998, the Council had already lifted most of the sanc tions imposed on Nigeria in 1995 on account of human rights viola tions committed by the previous regime of General Abacha. How ever, development cooperation (suspended earlier in the wake of the cancellation of the June 1993 presidential elections and the sei zure of power in November 1993 by General Abacha) continued to be restricted to campaigns sup porting human rights and democ racy and to alleviating poverty by means of decentralised coopera tion. The European Commission an nounced its intention to focus future cooperation on the cam paign to eradicate poverty, the promotion of democracy and good governance, anti-corruption mea sures and full integration of Niger ia into the g l o b al economy through the fostering of trade and investment. The new Nigerian government fully endorsed these objectives. The conditions and de tails of the actions envisaged will be established as part of a forth coming joint agreement within the context of Nigeria's national indicative programme under the Lom\u00e9 Convention. The Nigerian government is sched uled to receive technical assistance in the drafting and implementa tion of projects and programmes financed by the European Devel opment Fund (EDF). A joint study has just been launched into the judicious long-term use of avail able funds to serve the interests of the Nigerian population. 'Contributing to the consolidation of democracy, to good governance and to economic and social devel opment is important not only for the Nigerian people, who have suffered a military dictatorship for too long, but also for Western Africa and Africa as a whole', added Jo\u00e3o de Deus Pinheiro, Commissioner responsible for co operation with the ACP countries. (Agence Europe) Europe against traffic in light weapons in developing countries As part of its development coop eration policy, the EU's Develop ment Council has paved the way for a campaign against the exces sive accumulation and uncon trolled transfer of light weapons (approximately 500 million light weapons are involved). The aim is to help solve this global problem, which is a major obstacle to the economic and social development of countries and regions in crisis and promotes the exploitation of children as soldiers. In point of fact, it is already possible to pur chase light weapons very cheaply. The Council is of the opinion that an integrated, global approach is necessary, at international level, in order appropriately to address the complexity of the problem and its political, economic and social causes and to take account of the security aspect as a fundamental condition for development. Do not neglect the most underprivileged nations The UN Secretary General, Koffi Annan, from Ghana, warned the world's industrialised countries that they should not let the Koso vo situation divert their attention from the global economic crisis which continues to threaten the stability of developing countries. In a letter addressed to German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, Pre sident of the European Council and G8 leader (at the meeting from 18 to 20 June), Koffi Annan stated that, in recent years, pov erty, development aid and external debt had become no longer just a cause for concern but constituted a global disaster. The financial crisis which shook East Asian countries, the Russian Federation and Brazil took only a few months to reverse the eco nomic and social gains achieved over several decades and jeopar dised the political and economic reforms launched by most of those countries. The UN Secretary General also made reference to the quality of life in Asian countries, whose economies had been most sorely tried, asserting that it had cruelly deteriorated, as was the case, also, in Indonesia, South Korea and Thailand. According to recent UN figures, there has been a slowing-down of world growth of approximately 50%, from 3.6% in 1996 to 1.9% in 1998. Predictions are no better for 1999 (1.9%), which led the Secretary General to comment that the objectives of eradicating pov erty and of promoting social pro gress in developing countries that had been adopted by the interna tional community were quite sim ply 'impossible to achieve' while the growth in world production continued at this unsatisfactory level. Aware of the reduction in aid from Western donors, Koffi Annan called for adequate steps to be taken to alleviate the burden of debt on developing countries, principally for the world's 48 least developed countries (LLDCs). For the record, the G8 group consists of the US, Great Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Russia. (IPS) the Courier n\u00b0 176 - july-august 1999 e ",

Its buildings are also testimony to a history of slavery and constant immigration, revealing the legacy of African, Asian and North American styles and techniques. The wealth of the islands' sugar plantations has left behind a tradition of great houses, while inter\u00adEuropean conflict can still be traced in many well\u00adpreserved forts and naval bases.

        "not just for the young Neil Cooper Older people making music in the Caribbean Older people all over the world are getting together to counter the loneliness and isolation that often come with old age. Associations are springing up where senior citizens gather to support one another practically, emotionally and politically. They feel that there is more to old age than just survival, and they have the right to enjoy the rest of their lives. In Jamaica the Memory Bank Project has recorded and performed the music, stories and knowledge of older people. Some 1500 songs have been taped, and ceremonies, celebrations and activities of more than 20 groups have been recorded, photographed or filmed. Projects like this one raise older people's self esteem by making them feel valued in society. The jazz band here shows that it really works. ",
