        "Official Journ al of the E uropean Un ion 14.9.2009 I. whereas the abolition of agricultural subsidies in ACP countries and export oriented subsidies in devel\u00ad oped countries have contributed to a decrease in yields and in agricultural production, resulting in an increase in imports of food products, J. whereas the agricultural sector is hit by increasingly frequent natural disasters, and whereas at the same time the resources allocated for food aid before and after such disasters are decreasing, G20 and the London Summit 1. Endorses the outcome and commitments of the London G20 Meeting of 2 April 2009, in particular ref\u00ad erences to: restoring growth and jobs; strengthening financial supervision and regulation; strengthening global financial institutions; resisting protectionism; promoting global trade and investment; ensuring a fair and sustainable recovery for all; and delivering on aid commitments; 2.

Fully supports the G20\u2019s determination to reform international financial institutions, but considers it impossible to wait until 2011 to give greater voice and representation to developing countries at the level of international finance, especially in the light of the IMF\u2019s new responsibilities, and in this regard asks for improved transparency and accountability and for a new approach to development policy; these gover\u00ad nance reforms need to be agreed at the next World Bank and IMF committee meetings on 25 and 26 April 2009; 7. Calls on the EU and ACP States to take action to eradicate tax evasion and illicit capital flight from devel\u00ad oping countries, which cost these countries an estimated EUR 800 billion per year, in other words over eight times what they receive in aid; 8. Regrets that the G20\u2019s promises on Aid for Trade and ODA were insufficient; stresses that, although the communiqu\u00e9 lists financial measures to increase resources for the developing world through the World Bank and IMF, there was no specific commitment to ensuring that Aid for Trade represents additional funding; 9.
