Takes the view that the forthcoming EU Strategic Framework on Health and Safety at Work post 2020 should further prioritise investments, through EU funds, aimed at prolonging and promoting healthier lives and working lives, and individualised working arrangements, and at supporting recruitment and well-adapted return to work, where desired and where medical conditions allow; considers that an integral part of this strategy is investment in primary and secondary preventative mechanisms through, for example, the provision of e-health technologies; calls on the Commission and the Member States to prioritise the prevention of risks and illnesses at the workplace; 5. Encourages the Member States to engage fully in the forthcoming 2020-2022 EU-wide campaign on the prevention of work- related musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), to find innovative non-legislative solutions and to exchange information and good practices with social partners; calls for the active involvement of the Member States in the dissemination of information provided by the EU- OSHA; reiterates its call on the Commission to submit, without delay, a legal act on MSDs; calls on the Member States to conduct stu - dies \u2013 broken down by gender, age and area of economic activity \u2013 into the incidence of MSDs, with a view to preventing and comba - ting the emergence of such disorders and to developing a comprehensive EU chronic-disease strategy for prevention and early intervention; 6. Calls on the Member States, and on employers, to take a proactive role in integrating the information provided by the EU- OSHA into their workplace policies and programmes; welcomes the recent launch of a section on the EU-OSHA website dedicated to work-related diseases, rehabilitation and return to work, with the aim of providing information about prevention policies and prac - tices; 7. Takes the view that systematic psychosocial risk prevention is a crucial feature of modern workplaces; notes with concern the rise in reported cases of mental health and psychosocial problems over recent years, and the fact that work-related stress is a growing problem for employees and employers; calls on the Member States, and on the social partners, to provide support to businesses in implementing a coherent set of workplace policies and programmes to enhance prevention of these problems, tackle mental health stigma and support individuals facing existing conditions, by enabling access to psychological support; highlights, with a view to fur - ther motivating employers to take action, the benefits \u2013 including the proven return on investment \u2013 of psychosocial risk prevention and health promotion; notes that legislation and recognition of psychosocial risks and mental health problems, such as chronic stress and burnout, vary among Member States; 8. Stresses the importance of updating and providing common health indicators and definitions of work-related diseases, inclu - ding stress at work, and EU-wide statistical data with a view to setting targets to reduce the incidence of occupational diseases; 9. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to develop and implement a programme for systematically monitoring, managing and supporting workers affected by psychosocial risks, including stress, depression and burnout, in order to, inter alia , draw up effective recommendations and guidelines for combating these risks; emphasises that chronic stress at work is recognised as a major obstacle to productivity and to the quality of life; notes that psychosocial risks and work-related stress are often structural pro - blems linked to work organisation, and that preventing and managing these risks is possible; stresses the need to carry out studies, improve prevention and share best practices and tools for reintegrating affected persons in the labour market; ",

Calls for the de-stigmatisation of mental health problems and learning disabilities; encourages initiatives to raise awareness and support change in this regard through the development of psychosocial risk prevention policies and actions at company level; com - mends, in this context, the actions of social partners in the Member States contributing to a positive change; recalls the importance of properly training OSH service providers and labour inspectors in psychosocial risk management practices; calls for closer cooperation among, and revitalisation of, EU initiatives tackling psychosocial risks at work and for prioritising the issue in the upcoming EU OSH strategic framework; 11. Recognises that the reintegration of workers who have suffered from substance abuse problems presents specific challenges for employers; notes, in this regard, the example of the Alna model, run by the Swedish social partners ( 16 ), to support workplaces in taking proactive and early intervention measures, and in assisting in the rehabilitation process of employees who have had problems connected to substance abuse; 12. Welcomes the Healthy Workplaces Manage Stress campaign; emphasises that initiatives for tackling work-related stress must include the gender dimension, taking into account the specific working conditions of women; 13. Stresses the importance of investing more in risk-prevention policies and supporting a culture of prevention; points out that the quality of preventive services is key to supporting companies; calls on the Member States to implement effective policies on healthy diets, on alcohol and tobacco consumption and on air quality, and to promote such policies at the workplace; calls on the Member States, furthermore, to develop integrated health services with social, psychological, work services and occupational medicine; encou - rages Member States to provide workers with adequate access to healthcare to ensure early detection of the onset of physical and men - tal illness and facilitate the reintegration process; recalls that early investment and preventive action can reduce the long-term psychosocial impact on the individual, as well as the overall cost for society in the long term; 14. Requests that reintegration policies should be \u2014 consistent with a lifecycle approach to education, life-long learning, social and employment policies, \u2014 tailor made, targeted and needs-oriented, without placing demands on the participant unlikely to be met owing to his or her condition, \u2014 participative and based on an integrated approach, and \u2014 respectful of the pre-conditions necessary for allowing participation without creating conditions endangering a minimum-living income; 15.

Takes the view that the Member States and employers should take a positive and work-oriented approach to workers with disa - bilities, older workers and those who have suffered a mental or physical illness or injury, including people diagnosed with terminal illness, focusing on early evaluation of the individual\u2019s remaining capacity and readiness to work, and organising psychological, social and employment counselling at an early stage and the adaptation of the workplace, taking into account the person\u2019s occupational pro - file and socio-economic situation as well as the situation of the undertaking; encourages the Member States to improve provisions in their social security systems favouring return to work, provided that it is desired by the employee and that medical conditions allow; 18. Notes the positive role that social enterprises, specifically Work Integration Social Enterprises (WISEs), have played in reinte - grating long-term unemployed people back into the workforce; calls on the Member States to provide necessary recognition and tech - nical support to these enterprises; 19. Encourages, in this regard, references to the UN CRDP and its Optional Protocol (A/RES/61/106), and the use of the World Health Organisation\u2019s (WHO) International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) across all relevant measures and policies; shares the view that disability is a health experience that occurs in a socio-economic context; 20. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to develop and provide guidelines on best practices and coaching, support and advice to employers on how to develop and implement reintegration plans while ensuring a continued dialogue between the social partners, ensuring that employees are made aware of their rights from the beginning of the return-to-work process; further encourages the exchange of good practice within and between Member States, professional communities, social partners, NGOs and policy- makers about the reintegration of workers recovering from illness or injury; 21. Calls on the Member States to cooperate with social partners to provide external support to ensure guidance and technical sup - port for SMEs and micro-enterprises with limited experience in occupational rehabilitation and return-to-work measures; acknowledges the importance of taking into account the situation and specific needs of, and the challenges with compliance facing, not only SMEs and micro- enterprises, but also certain public service sectors, in the context of the implementation of measures at com - pany level; stresses that awareness raising, the exchange of good practices, consultation and online platforms are of utmost impor - tance in helping SMEs and micro-enterprises in this process; calls on the Commission and the Member States to continue developing practical tools and guidelines that can help support SMEs and micro-enterprises with limited experience in occupational rehabilitation and return-to-work measures; recognises the importance of investing in management training; 22. Notes the risk that more imaginative approaches aimed at reintegrating those furthest from the labour market may be deprived of funding in favour of a more narrow approach based on easily quantifiable outcomes; calls, therefore, on the Commission to improve the funding for bottom-up approaches under the Structural Funds, in particular the ESF; 23. Takes note of the success of the case-management approach of reintegration programmes and stresses the need for individually designed and integrated support from social workers or designated counsellors; believes that it is essential for companies to keep in close contact with workers, or with their representatives, during absences due to illness or injury; 24. Believes that return-to-work and reintegration policies should form part of a broader holistic approach to healthy working lives, aimed at ensuring a physically and mentally safe and healthy working environment throughout people\u2019s working life and active and healthy ageing for all workers; stresses the key importance of communication, the help of specialists in management of occupatio - nal rehabilitation (work assistants) and an integrated approach involving all parties concerned in the successful physical and occupa - tional rehabilitation of workers; believes that the workplace should be the central point of focus of return-to-work systems; lauds the success of the non-bureaucratic and practical approach of the Austrian fit2work ( 17 ) programme, with its emphasis on easy communi - cation accessible to all workers (such as the use of simplified language); ( 17 ) \u201cEU-OSHA Case Study on Austria \u2014 Fit2Work programme\u201dhttps://osha.europa.eu/en/tools-and-publications/publications/austria-fit2work/view ",

Calls on the Commission and the Member States to introduce active labour market policies and policy incentives for employers in order to support the employment of persons with disabilities and chronic illnesses, including by making suitable adaptations to, and breaking down barriers in, the workplace to facilitate their reintegration; recalls that it is essential to inform companies and the per - sons concerned about existing incentives and rights; 27. Recognises, in this regard, that flexible, individually tailored and adaptive working arrangements \u2013 such as telework, flexitime, adapted equipment and reduced working hours or workload \u2013 play an important role in returning to work; stresses the importance of encouraging early and/or gradual return to work (if medical conditions allow), which could be accompanied by partial sickness bene - fits to ensure that the individuals concerned do not suffer loss of income from returning to work, while maintaining financial incen - tives for businesses; stresses that such arrangements, including geographical, temporal and functional flexibility, must be feasible for both workers and employers, facilitating the organisation of work management and taking into account variations in production cycles; 28. Commends national programmes and initiatives that have helped facilitate the reintegration into quality employment of people with chronic diseases, such as the German \u201cJob4000\u201d ( 18 ) programme, which uses an integrated approach to improve the stable professional integration of persons with severe disability who face particular difficulties in finding a job, and the establishment of reintegration agencies to help people with chronic diseases find a job that is suited to their situations and abilities ( 19 ); 29. Notes the important psychological benefits and increased productivity associated with high levels of autonomy in the work - place; considers that a degree of workplace autonomy can be essential in easing the process of reintegration of sick and injured wor - kers with disparate conditions and needs; 30. Recognises the value of returning to work in the care process, as work, for many individuals, allows for financial independence and is life-enhancing, which can sometimes be a crucial factor in the recovery process; 31. Calls on the Member States not to withdraw welfare benefits immediately when people with chronic diseases gain employment, thereby helping them avoid the \u201cbenefit trap\u201d; Changing attitudes towards the reintegration of workers 32. Calls on the Commission and the Member States, in cooperation with the social partners, to ensure \u2013 in their communications, guidelines and policies \u2013 that employers see the reintegration process as an opportunity to benefit from workers\u2019skills, competences and experience; takes the view that employers and workers\u2019 representatives are important actors in the return-to-work process from the start, and are part of the decision-making process; ( 18 ) Source: Pathways project deliverable 5.2 \u201cScoping Paper on the Available Evidence on the Effectiveness of Existing Integration and Re-Integration into Work Strategies for Persons with Chronic Conditions\u201d.

Stresses that raising awareness about occupational rehabilitation and return-to-work policies and programmes, and improved company culture, are critical success factors in the return-to-work process and in fighting negative attitudes and tackling prejudices and discrimination; takes the view that teams of experts, such as psychologists and coaches trained in occupational rehabilitation, could effectively be shared among various companies, thereby allowing for smaller companies to benefit from their expertise as well; takes the view that there is also space in this process for support and complementary engagement on the part of NGOs and volunteers; 35. Commends those enterprises that have taken initiatives to support people with health problems, disabilities or changed wor - king capacity by providing, e.g., comprehensive preventative programmes, modification of tasks and training and re-training, or by preparing other employees for the changed abilities of returning workers, thereby helping their reintegration; strongly encourages more enterprises to get involved in this effort and put forward such initiatives; considers it essential that measures facilitating the reintegration of workers within companies is integral to the company culture; 36.
