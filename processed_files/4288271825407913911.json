        "PE-CONS 54/1/17 REV 1 3 EN (5) Giving support to security sector actors in third countries, including, under exceptional circumstances, the military, in a conflict prevention, crisis management or stabilisation context is essential to ensure appropriate conditions for poverty eradication and development. Good governance, effective democratic control and civilian oversight of the security system, including of the military, as well as compliance with human rights and the rule of law principles are essential attributes of a well-functioning State in any context, and should be promoted through a wider security sector reform support to third countries. (6) In its conclusions of 19-20 December 2013 on Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), the European Council emphasised the importance of supporting partner countries and regional organisations, through providing training, advice, equipment and resources where appropriate, so that they can increasingly prevent or manage crises by themselves.

That policy concept brings together CSDP and all other relevant tools of Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) as well as development cooperation instruments, while respecting their respective legal bases, primary objectives and decision-making procedures.
