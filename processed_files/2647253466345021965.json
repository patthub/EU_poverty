        "GDP & Beyond Focus on measuring economic development and well-being 02 2010 SIGMA THE BULLETIN OF EUROPEAN STATISTICS ISSN 1018-5739 ",
        "Editorial 2 SIGMA 02 10 GDP & Beyond The publication of the \u2018Stiglitz Report\u2019 made headlines in the news media last year. This report was the result of work done by the so-called Stiglitz-Sen-Fitoussi Commission, which was created in 2008 by French President Nicolas Sarkozy and chaired by Nobel Prize-winning economist, Professor Joseph E. Stiglitz of Columbia University. This Commission urged a \u2018shift of emphasis from a production-oriented measurement system to one focused on the well-being of current and future generations, towards broader measures of social progress\u2019. In November 2007, the European Commission, European Parliament, Club of Rome, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and the World Wide Fund For Nature hosted the high-level conference \u2018Beyond GDP\u2019, with the objectives of clarifying which indices are most appropriate to measure progress and how these can best be integrated into the decision-making process and taken up by public debate. In August 2009, the European Commission released its Communication GDP and Beyond: Measuring progress in a changing world . The Communication outlines an EU road map with key actions to improve our indicators of progress in ways that meet citizens\u2019 concerns and make the most of new technical and political developments. The starting point in the work of all these initiatives was the view that gross domestic product alone was no longer the best way to measure a country\u2019s progress and needed to be complemented by environmental and social indicators. In particular, statisticians were called upon to find ways of measuring the \u2019quality of life\u2019 of a nation alongside its raw economic growth. Eurostat has been actively involved in this task from the very beginning. However, as is widely known, well-being and happiness are not exactly easy to measure. This is why, in this issue of Sigma , we decided to present a broad range of views on the problem, asking the opinion of a number of prominent international experts and analysts. We hope that their views will not only contribute to the ongoing debate, but also help to find concrete solutions to the challenges international statistics face today and in the years to come. The issue closes with a feature on the Statistics Directorate of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, led by its Chief Statistician, Ms Martine Durand.

        "4 Why is the measurement of well-being important? Citizens rightly consider that the main purpose of political action is to improve their present and future well-being. Increased production is only an intermediate target. Statis- ticians have to provide policymakers and civil society with reliable indicators of well-being which can qualitatively as- sess the present situation and the perspectives for further progress. Could you explain the possible future changes in data collection and analysis following the recommendations of the Report? The main theme of the Stiglitz-Sen-Fitoussi Report is all about moving beyond GDP. Data collection and analysis should shift the emphasis from measuring economic production to measuring people\u2019s well-being in a context of sustainability. The production and creation of value remain important ele- ments. But measuring well-being calls for a plurality of other indicators because several dimensions need to be taken into account. Current well-being has to do with both economic resources, such as income, consumption and wealth, and with non-economic aspects of people\u2019s lives (what they do and what they can do, how they feel, the natural environ- ment in which they live, etc.). Finally, assessing whether current well-being can be sus- tained over time requires looking at resources that will be passed onto future generations. This requires a scoreboard that can assemble indicators of changes in financial, physical and human capital, together with a well-chosen set of envi- ronmental indicators. What will the Report change in the world of official statistics? Will its impact be visible soon? This milestone Report does not necessarily mark a break with the current work of statisticians. It just calls for accelerating Opening a debate \u2013 The Stiglitz Report T he main motive behind setting up the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress, or the Stiglitz Commission, was the increasing gap between the standard measures of growth, in- flation and unemployment, and the way socio-economic trends were perceived by public opinion. \u2018This gap has undermined public confidence in official statistics. The current financial crisis has not helped narrow this gap: statisticians have been accused of not giving sufficiently early warning of unsustainable development. The crisis has increased pressure for a change in statistical production,\u2019 Didier Blanchet, Head of the Department of General Eco- nomic Studies at the French Statistical Office (Insee), as well as rapporteur of the Stiglitz-Sen-Fitoussi Commission, and Claire Plateau, Deputy Head of the Statistical Coordination Department at Insee, told Sigma .

        "\u00a9 I n s e e 5 SIGMA 02 10 changes that were already underway. Statisticians will not have to start from scratch. In many countries a lot of good work has already been done and much \u2018low-hanging fruit\u2019 identified, so that the impact of the Report should be visible soon in the world of official statistics. The first step will be to emphasise the other indicators that have already been produced, but are less visible than GDP. For instance, national accounts will continue publishing GDP, but they will be able to put more emphasis on the household perspective (income and consumption). Average measures of income, consumption and wealth will be supplemented as often as possible by indicators that reflect their distribu- tion. Some new measures should be developed to comple- ment national accounts by taking into consideration non- market domestic production or improving the measurement of in-kind and publicly provided services such as health and education. Both objective and also subjective indicators of well-being should be produced on the basis of household surveys and relevant administrative sources. Concerning sustainability, the proposals put forward in the Report are not new: the capital-based approach to sustain- ability had already been advocated by a Eurostat/OECD/UN- ECE report in 2008, and some important material is already available on existing sustainable development dashboards. What should be the key priorities in regard to the implementation of the Stiglitz Report recommendations for statisticians, politicians and economists? The Report is about opening a discussion rather than closing one. Both national and international bodies should discuss its recommendations in order to identify their limits and see how they can best contribute to its implementation. In our opinion, statisticians should better promote ag- gregate measures of net-adjusted disposable income and actual consumption. This requires better measures of in- kind services produced by governments, in order to avoid artificial discrepancies between countries with different social organisations and different public sector sizes. These improvements will be of particular relevance as regards the provision of free or subsidised services in the fields of health or education. A second idea is that statisticians should further develop the analysis of inequalities to know what is happening at the bottom or at the top of the distribution scales. Household surveys should be used in order to provide macro-economic information on the distribution of income, consumption and wealth. Statisticians should establish a list of objective indi- cators of quality of life and then produce them regularly, on the basis of household surveys and relevant administrative sources. They will also have to carry out surveys to collect reliable data on subjective well-being. Furthermore, they will have to review sustainable development scoreboards by fo- cusing on environmental sustainability. As for politicians, they will have to appropriate this new framework: it is also their responsibility to stop focusing on GDP and to better take into account the broader set of indi- cators produced by statisticians. They will also have to pro- vide the resources needed for all required additions to exist- ing statistical programmes. Lastly, economists must feel more intensively concerned by all these measurement issues. They often disregard statistical questions as purely technical and of secondary importance. However, one should remember that this was not the case when national accounts were first created, when some lead- ing economists were highly involved in the debates of the time. The Commission has enabled a revival of this dialogue between economists and statisticians: we must try to pursue this dialogue. Is the current set of statistical indicators enough to fulfil what the Report suggests? Or will new collections of data be needed? Much of the required information is already available: what the Report recommends is essentially finding new ways to structure this information. Among the domains that remain under-covered, the most problematic ones GDP & Beyond Claire Plateau, Deputy Head of the Statistical Coordination Department at the French Statistical Office, Insee. ",
        "are probably subjective indicators \u2013 indeed some wonder whether it is the role of official statisticians to collect such data \u2013 and environmental indicators. The idea of relying on data produced outside official statistical systems is an open question. What role will productivity measures have in the future? We generally measure productivity as the ratio between GDP and the quantity of labour used for its production, or between GDP and a composite aggregate combining labour, capital and some other production factors, such as energy. The Report suggests ways to improve these measures both on the output and the input side. On the output side, a distinction needs to be made between efficiency in the production of value-added and efficiency in the production of well-being: they do not necessarily go hand-in-hand. On the input side, the Commission invites us to be as exhaus- tive as possible when establishing the list of production factors. An economy can have a very high level of labour productivity, but if it does so through the over-exploitation of natural resources, its performance has to be strongly relativised. Efficiency in generating current well-being must not be at the expense of future well-being. According to you, what role could Eurostat play in measuring economic performance and social progress? The role of Eurostat is essential to implementing the recom- mendations of the Report in the European Statistical System. The adoption of new standards requires harmonisation and coordination. The initiative of Eurostat to lead a \u2018sponsorship group\u2019, along with the French Statistical Office Insee, will contribute to meas- ures such as: establishing priorities among the recommenda- tions, assessing the availability and quality of European statis- tics that could be better analysed and disseminated, steering the implementation of the recommended indicators and sta- tistics, and following up their elaboration up to the dissemina- tion phase, as well as proposing a medium-term strategy to develop the new statistical data required by the Report.

        "SIGMA 02 10 7 GDP & Beyond In the future, do you see a conflict between micro- and macro-models or will they be more interlinked in economic and social analysis? There is no conflict between micro- and macro-levels of analy- sis, both for statistics and for models.

Household surveys should be used in order to provide macro-economic information on the distribution of income, consumption and wealth\u2019, said Ms Plateau and Mr Blanchet. According to them, statisticians should also establish and produce objective indicators of quality of life, as well as carry out surveys to collect reliable data on subjective well-being. Furthermore, sustainable development scoreboards need to be reviewed by focusing on environmental sustainability.

The real challenge is to articulate them better. This is in fact the spirit of one of the main recommendations of the Stiglitz Commission, namely the breaking down of glo- bal households\u2019 accounts by household type. This initiative will be an important means to make macro-data more con- sistent with micro-data. ",
        "SIGMA 02 10 8 T he GDP and Beyond Communication concludes that it is important to complement the current GDP in order answer the political challenges of the 21 st century and to steer EU policies towards green growth and a low-carbon, resource-efficient and inclusive society. \u2018Our quality of life depends on social relations, environmen- tal quality, freedom and safety, accumulated wealth, income and leisure time, risks and ex pectations for the future \u2013 such as fear ing the loss of wealth or income or other elements of good living conditions, e.g. a healthy environment. Therefore, we need to measure personal well- being and societal welfare in addition to measuring the goods and services produced for the market in a given year,\u2019 Mr Mi\u00e8ge said. Environmental and social information needed The Communication argues that envi- ronmental and social outcomes need to be measured and assessed separately from economic output, as the link be- tween economic growth and well-being is not always auto- matic. \u2018We have a strong tradition of looking at economic issues, stemming from the fact that improving our economic situ- ation also improved our social situation in the past. In a European Commission goes beyond GDP I n August 2009, the European Commission adopted a Communication called GDP and Beyond: Measuring progress in a changing world, which outlines a number of actions to improve and complement current growth measure- ments. Sigma spoke to Robin Mi\u00e8ge, Acting Director of the Environment Directorate\u2019s General Strategy Director- ate, and Oliver Zwirner from the Chief Economist, Instruments and Impact Assessment Unit, to find out more about the Commission\u2019s work in the area. \u2018 We have a strong tradition of looking at economic issues, stemming from the fact that improving our economic situation also improved our social situation in the past. In a globalised world with environmental constraints \u2013 soon inhabited by nine billion people \u2013links between economic, social and environmental issues are more complex,\u2019 said Mr Mi\u00e8ge, Acting Strategy Director at the Environment DG. \u00a9 E u r o p e a n U n i o n ",

Complementing GDP with information on environmental and social developments might also be more informative for citizens. \u2018Information on social and income situation of households, on health and education is more easily readable than com- plex macro-economic indicators. One needs quite a specific theoretical background to interpret indicators such as gross domestic product or net national income correctly. The Stiglitz-Commission is rightly pointing to the fact that there is an increasing gap between what is reported by official sta- tistics and what citizens, business or local administrations experience,\u2019 Mr Mi\u00e8ge said. To close that gap, he suggested an intensive producer-user dialogue, which would make statistics better fit for purpose and therefore increase usability and use of data. Environmental Index and Sustainable Development Scoreboard The GDP and Beyond Communication outlines five ac- tions (see box on page 11) to improve the measurement of progress in society. The Environment Directorate-General (DG) is responsible for developing an environmental index and a sustainable development scoreboard. \u2018The environmental index will most likely be an index on pollution or environmental stress in general. Its goal is to complement other macro-indicators, such as GDP or unem- ployment, by providing information on the level of \u2018pressure\u2019 exerted on our environment by the activities taking place in the EU. Therefore, the lower the index, the better our interac- tion with our environment,\u2019 said Mr Zwirner. This index is ultimately aimed at policymakers, journalists and citizens who are also following the development of indi- cators such as GDP and unemployment. The Environment Directorate-General will develop an environmental index and a sustainable development scoreboard. The index aims to complement other macro-indicators, such as GDP or unemployment, by providing information on the level of \u2018pressure\u2019 exerted on our environment by the activities taking place in the EU. The scoreboard aims to inform citizens and politicians about major trends on progress towards sustainable development. ",
        "GDP & Beyond SIGMA 02 10 10 \u2018The analysis of this composite indicator, together with the other two key indicators, would provide a more global pic- ture of the development in society than the sole use of GDP,\u2019 Mr Zwirner said. The sustainable development scoreboard aims to inform cit- izens and politicians in a concise way about the major trends on progress towards sustainable development. \u2018The design of such an easily understandable, but still infor- mation-rich tool puts a considerable challenge to us. One particular point is that many issues related to sustainable development are not yet sufficiently covered by official sta- tistics, e.g. on biodiversity or eco-innovation. Therefore, the inclusion of data from non-official sources will be one impor- tant feature of this scoreboard,\u2019 he continued. The Commission does not believe that the development of another sustainable development measure, besides the ex- isting sustainable development indicators (SDIs), risks confu- sion for users. \u2018Indicators are a communication tool. And communication tools always target a specific audience. The existing SDIs are the monitoring tool for the specific objectives of the EU sus- tainable development strategy. This set was created to assist SD experts in ministries to monitor the achievement of such targets. In addition to that, we need a more communication- oriented tool to inform non-experts about the key issues on sustainable development,\u2019 Mr Zwirner said. Environmental accounts welcome Mr Mi\u00e8ge said that we need to remind ourselves that all eco- nomic activity depends essentially on natural resources. \u2018Not a single business comes to my mind that does not use natural resources. Even such typical service providers as hair- dressers use iron for scissors, water, shampoo either based on mineral or palm oils, energy, etc.,\u2019 he explained. A key issue, according to the GDP and Beyond Communication, is to improve timeliness of social and environmental statistics to the level of key economic indicators. \u00a9 t o m m y S , w w w . p i x e l i o . d e ",
        "SIGMA 02 10 GDP & Beyond 11 GDP and Beyond: Measuring progress in a changing world In August 2009, the European Commission adopted a Communication called GDP and Beyond: Measuring progress in a changing world , which outlines five actions to improve and complement current growth measure- ments: \u2022 highly aggregated indicators on environment and quality of life. A pilot of an environmental index that will assess progress in the main fields of environmen- tal protection will be developed. The index will cover areas such as greenhouse gas emissions, loss of natu- ral landscapes, air pollution, water use and waste gen- eration. In a similar way, an overall quality-of-life index will be tested; \u2022 the Commission will step up efforts to produce envi- ronmental and social data more rapidly. The aim is to develop near-real-time information for decision-mak- ing; \u2022 more accurate reporting on distribution and inequali- ties, which will allow a better definition of policies on social and economic cohesion; \u2022 the Commission will develop a European Sustainable Development Scoreboard to allow an identification of social, economic and environmental trends relevant for a sustainable societal development and a bench- marking of best practices. This scoreboard will be based on the existing set of Sustainable Development Indicators; \u2022 to complement GDP and national accounts with en- vironmental and social accounts. Legislation for en- vironmental accounts was proposed by the Commis- sion in April 2010. certainly support an integrated and balanced approach to solve societal problems,\u2019 Mr Mi\u00e8ge said. \u2018Similarly, better information on distribution and inequalities will foster public decision-making. Most political debates are about fair sharing of efforts and benefits, such as financial reforms or the upcoming transition to a resource-efficient economy. With good data at hand, these discussions can be led in a more rational way,\u2019 he added. \u2018In essence, we might need to understand more and more that spending money on good data and indicators is an in- vestment in a solid information basis for rational and trans- parent democratic decision-making. Good data are quite likely cheaper than flawed public and private decisions,\u2019 Mr Mi\u00e8ge concluded. For further information: www.beyond-gdp.eu One step on the way was the adoption by the Commission of a proposal for a Regulation on Integrated Environmental Economic Accounting in April 2010. The Environment Direc- torate-General (DG) is also happy that steps are taken at UN level to make the integrated environmental economic ac- counting an international statistical standard. Not yet directly mentioned in the Beyond GDP road map, but a related issue emerging from the Europe 2020 strategy adopted in March this year, is the accounting of natural re- sources, including eco-system services and indicators on the resource efficiency of the economy. The full elaboration of wealth or asset accounts could contribute to an adequate basis for this endeavour. \u2018However, we cannot wait a decade before first decisions on the transition to a resource-efficient economy are taken. Therefore, a kind of fast-track implementation of broad measurement concepts to provide first orientation points for this journey would be most useful for policymaking,\u2019 said Mr Mi\u00e8ge. Reuse and data linking one way forward According to the Commission, existing data sources need to be analysed and information linked and reused. Data from national accounts and social surveys could be combined to give new insights into social and economic inequalities. \u2018Trade data could, for example, provide information on po- tential environmental degradation and use of natural re- sources in other countries,\u2019 Mr Zwirner said. \u2018We could also explore the use of new technologies, such as remote sensing, in order to get more information on some environmental issues, such as land-use change or marine pollution. We might also explore new cooperation between the public and private sectors for issues that are hard to grab for official statistics, such as the quality of nature, including biodiversity, venture capital invested in eco-innovation and market penetration of eco-efficient products,\u2019 he continued. \u2018Spending money on good data is an investment\u2019 Another key issue, according to the Communication, is to im- prove timeliness of social and environmental statistics to the level of key economic indicators. \u2018The application of now-casting techniques could contribute towards overcoming the current restrictions. Only if comple- mentary data on the social, economic and environmental situation are available at the same time, will they be taken up by the media, public debate and policy analysis. This will ",
        "SIGMA 02 10 12 G rowth has delivered its benefits, at best, unequally. A fifth of the world\u2019s population earns just 2% of global income. Inequality is higher in the OECD nations than it was 20 years ago. Far from improving the lives of those who most needed it, growth let much of the world\u2019s popula- tion down. Wealth trickled up to the lucky few. Fairness (or the lack of it) is just one of several reasons to question growth. As the economy expands, so do its eco- logical impacts. In the last quarter of a century, an estimated 60% of the world\u2019s ecosystems have been degraded. Global carbon emissions have risen by 40% since 1990. Significant scarcity in key resources \u2013 such as oil \u2013 may be less than a decade away. On the other hand, when growth stalls, things go quickly from bad to worse. Firms go out of business, people lose their jobs and a government that fails to respond appropri- ately will soon find itself out of office. In short, we find our- selves locked between the horns of an uncomfortable and deep-seated dilemma: growth may be unsustainable, but \u2018de-growth\u2019 \u2013 a contraction in economic output \u2013 appears to be unstable. Questioning growth in these circumstances is deemed to be the act of lunatics, fanatics or idealists. The prevailing wisdom calls instead for a \u2018decoupling\u2019 of economic activity from material throughput. And since effi- ciency is one of the things that modern capitalist economies are good at, decoupling has a clear appeal as a solution to the dilemma of growth. And at first sight, this logic fits the evidence. Global carbon intensity fell almost 25% in the last couple of decades, for instance. In search of alternative growth models But efficiency improvements are continually offset by in- creases in scale. Global carbon emissions rose by 40% even as the carbon intensity fell. We need to be decoupling much, much faster. In a world of nine billion people, all aspiring to ever-increasing western incomes, carbon intensities would have to fall by over 11% per year to stabilise the climate, 16 times faster than they have done since 1990. By 2050, the global carbon intensity would need to be only 6 grams per dollar of output, 130 times lower than it is today. In this context, it is fanciful to suppose that \u2018deep\u2019 resource and emission cuts can be achieved simply by appealing to capitalism\u2019s propensity for efficiency and without confront- ing the underlying structure of market economies. A much deeper re-examination is called for. In particular, we\u2019re drawn inevitably towards the role of two interrelated features of modern economic life that together drive the growth dy- namic. On the one hand, the profit motive stimulates a continual search by producers for newer, better or cheaper products and services. This process of \u2018creative destruction\u2019, according to the economist Joseph Schumpeter, is what drives eco- nomic growth forwards. For the individual firm, the ability to adapt and to innovate \u2013 to design, produce and market not Prosperity without growth E conomic growth is supposed to deliver prosperity. Higher incomes should mean better choices, rich- er lives, an improved quality of life for us all. That, at least, is the conventional wisdom. But things haven\u2019t always turned out that way.

Production of novelty But the continual production of novelty would be of little value to firms if there were no market for the consumption of novelty in households. Recognising the existence and un- derstanding the nature of this social logic is essential. Novelty plays an absolutely central role in our lives for a variety of rea- sons. In particular, it has always carried important information about status. But it also allows us to explore our aspirations for ourselves and our family, and our dreams of the good life. Perhaps the most telling point of all is the almost perfect fit between the continual consumption production of nov- elty by firms and the continuous consumption of novelty in households. The restless desire of the consumer is the per- fect complement for the restless innovation of the entrepre- neur. Taken together, these two self-reinforcing processes are exactly what is needed to drive growth forwards. Despite this fit, or perhaps because of it, the relentless pur- suit of novelty creates an anxiety that can undermine social well-being. Individuals are at the mercy of social comparison. Firms must innovate or die. Institutions are skewed towards the pursuit of a materialistic consumerism. The economy itself is dependent on consumption growth for its very survival. The \u2018iron cage of consumerism\u2019 is a system in which no-one is free. Government itself is conflicted here. On the one hand, it has a role in \u2018securing the future\u2019 \u2013 protecting long-term social and ecological goods. On the other, government holds a key re- sponsibility for macro-economic stability. For as long as macro- economic stability depends on economic growth, governments will find themselves calling for consumption growth even when the instinct of people is to save, because spending is what\u2019s needed to boost high-street sales and stimulate recovery. Consumerism versus prosperity Conversely though, freeing the macro-economy from a struc- tural requirement for growth will simultaneously free govern- ment to play its proper role in delivering social and ecological goals and protecting long-term interests. First and foremost, this means developing a resilient and sustainable macro-econ- omy that is no longer predicated on relentless consumerism. For at the end of the day, prosperity goes beyond mat- erial pleasures. It transcends material concerns. It resides in the health and happiness of our families. It is present in the strength of our relationships and our trust in the community. It is evidenced by our satisfaction at work and our sense of shared meaning and purpose. It hangs on our potential to participate fully in the life of society. Prosperity consists in our ability to flourish as human beings \u2013 within the ecological limits of a finite planet.

Due to the link be- tween economic growth and aspects of quality of life such as employment and consumption, GDP is partly re- garded as a proxy indicator of progress and well-being,\u2019 said Walter Radermacher, Director-General of Eurostat. \u2018 H owever, GDP was never intended to measure, and does not measure, well-being. Neither do GDP es- timates include measures of clean environment, sustainability, social cohesion or how happy people are. This means that GDP alone is not enough to properly measure the progress of our society,\u2019 he continued. \u2018And a general ques- tion for a professional statistician is whether a single figure can truly reflect a complex phenomenon such as progress\u2019. The European Commission Communication, GDP and Be- yond, and the Stiglitz Report focus on how to better meas- ure progress. The statistics they recommend partly overlap with the needs of the Europe 2020 strategy, which focuses on smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. \u2018How to best complement GDP to provide a more nuanced and accurate understanding of the growth and progress of society has been on the agenda of statisticians for some years, but now there is political momentum and the statisti- cal world needs to deliver,\u2019 he said. Mr Radermacher said actions include developments in the fields of national accounts, environmental and social statis- tics. \u2018What is required is a systematic approach, showing the links between the economy and environmental and social sustainability aspects, in order to better inform decision- makers,\u2019 he added. Complementing averages with distribution According to the Stiglitz Report and the European Commis- sion Communication on GDP and Beyond, it is important that statisticians further analyse social sustainability, especially the distribution of income, consumption and the wealth of households. \u2018Household surveys need to provide micro-economic in- formation on the distribution of income, consumption and wealth. The averages or medians of these statistics are meaningful, but they do not tell the whole story about living standards,\u2019 said Jean-Louis Mercy, Head of the Living Condi- tions and Social Protection Unit at Eurostat. He gave the example of a rise in average income, which is a positive phenomenon, but which may be unequally spread across income groups, leaving some households relatively worse off than others. Thus, average measures of income, consumption and wealth need to be accompanied by indi- Clockwise from top left, Jean-Louis Mercy, Head of the Living Conditions and Social Protection Unit, Gallo Gueye, Head of the National Accounts Methodology, Statistics for Own Resources Unit, Gilles Decand, Head of the Environmental Statistics and Accounts Unit, and Vincent Tronet in Eurostat\u2019s Key Indicators for European Policies Unit at Eurostat. \u00a9 E u r o p e a n U n i o n ",

It would give a better picture of how well off households are,\u2019 said Mr Mercy. The good news is that plenty of data are available on distri- bution in Eurostat\u2019s databases \u2013 primarily in the Labour Force Survey (LFS) and in the EU Survey on Income and Living Con- ditions (EU-SILC). \u2018EU-SILC includes both micro-data and longitudinal informa- tion, which means we can see the evolution over time for households. We can, for example, study the chances of get- ting out of poverty once someone has ended up in this situa- tion. We can also study transitions, for instance in the labour market, and its impact on welfare,\u2019 said Mr Mercy. Improving national accounts data The not so good news is that EU-SILC and the LFS do not cover everything. They need to be extended and data from these two surveys need to be linked to other surveys, such as the Household Budget Survey and the European Central Bank\u2019s survey on wealth. Furthermore, social data need to be reconciled with national accounts data to increase socio- economic breakdowns in national accounts. There are several actions in this field. In spring 2010, Eurostat published real household disposable income figures for the first time, which give a fuller picture of the economic welfare of households than the traditional GDP figure alone. \u2018The data on real household disposable income clearly dem- onstrate how the economic turndown has taken its toll on Real growth of household gross disposable income and final consumption expenditure (euro area) -2% -1% 0% 1% 2% Q 1 Q 2 Q 3 Q 4 Q 1 Q 2 Q 3 Q 4 Q 1 Q 2 Q 3 Q 4 Q 1 Q 2 Q 3 Q 4 Q 1 Q 2 Q 3 Q 4 Q 1 Q 2 Q 3 Q 4 Q 1 Q 2 Q 3 Q 4 Q 1 Q 2 Q 3 Q 4 Q 1 Q 2 Q 3 Q 4 Q 1 Q 2 Q 3 Q 4 Q 1 Q 2 Q 3 Q 4 Q 1 Q 2 Q 3 Q 4 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 -2% -1% 0% 1% 2% Gross disposable income in real terms Final consumption expenditure in real terms Source: Eurostat In spring 2010, Eurostat published real household disposable income figures for the first time, which give a fuller picture of the economic welfare of households than the traditional GDP figure alone. \u2018The data on real household disposable income clearly demonstrate how the economic turndown has taken its toll on household incomes since the fourth quarter of 2008, while showing the stabilising effect of taxes and social contributions and benefits,\u2019 said Denis Leythienne, in charge of the Quarterly Sector Accounts Team at Eurostat.

        "16 SIGMA 02 10 GDP & Beyond household incomes since the fourth quarter of 2008, while showing the stabilising effect of taxes and social contribu- tions and benefits,\u2019 said Denis Leythienne, in charge of the Quarterly Sector Accounts Team at Eurostat. Later this year, Eurostat will publish an analysis of the dis- tribution (survey data) and the evolution (national accounts data) of household finances. \u2018In fact, data on income, consumption and wealth of house- holds exist in national accounts, but we need to further im- prove their availability with respect to non-financial assets and we need to communicate better and deliver information which supports policymaking in the best possible way,\u2019 said Gallo Gueye, Head of Eurostat\u2019s National Accounts Method- ology, Statistics for Own Resources Unit. A longer-term project is to compile full balance-sheet ac- counts of households. Such accounts would give a better picture of the financial status of the whole economy \u2013 just as a balance sheet is a vital indicator of a company\u2019s financial situation. \u2018Measures of wealth are also central to analysing distribu- tional aspects and sustainability. What is carried over into the future necessarily has to be expressed as stocks. The cor- rect valuation of produced and non-produced assets, as well as financial assets, plays a crucial role,\u2019 he continued. Measuring quality of life Complementing GDP with social indicators related to quality of life and well-being is particularly important according to the Commission Communication and the Stiglitz Report. Key dimensions are material living standards; health; education; personal activities \u2013 including work; political voice and gov- ernance; social connections and relationships, environment, as well as physical and economic security. These dimensions should be analysed simultaneously. \u2018Eurostat has carried out a feasibility study on well-being in- dicators. This study shows that data at EU level are available for most of the drivers of well-being. About one third of the data are collected by Eurostat (mostly through EU-SILC) and one other third comes from the European Social Survey,\u2019 said Vincent Tronet from Eurostat\u2019s Key Indicators for European Policies Unit. \u2018In some areas, there is still a need to improve data timeli- ness, availability and comparability. It is also necessary to invest in areas where indicators are missing \u2013 for example, when it comes to access to green spaces or suffering from harassment. Well-being indicators also have to be policy rel- evant \u2013 policymakers should have the possibility to influence them and they should have a high communication value,\u2019 he continued. Another factor is that there is a subjective and an objective side of well-being. Some statisticians are not so keen on sub- jective indicators. They argue that these indicators may be influenced by cultural aspects and by events of the moment, such as if a country has just won the football world cup, and therefore would not be reliable. Harmonisation of these sta- tistics between countries is also a challenge \u2013 for instance, the sequence order of subjective questions in a survey may have an influence on the answers. \u2018Recent research shows that it is possible to collect meaning- ful and reliable data on subjective well-being that include di- mensions such as happiness, joy or pride, and negative emo- tions such as pain and worry. The Stiglitz Report also stresses the importance of both objective and subjective drivers of well-being. Therefore, questions on subjective well-being should be incorporated in standard surveys to capture peo- ple\u2019s satisfaction with life and their evaluation of hedonic ex- periences,\u2019 Mr Tronet said. \u2018Even if data would not always seem fully comparable be- tween countries, it could be valuable to see trends in a coun- try and to study the links between subjective and objective well-being. The idea is not only to deliver good measures of people\u2019s quality of life, but also to help understand its deter- minants,\u2019 he continued. Another important issue, according to the European Com- mission Communication on GDP and Beyond, is that the timeliness of social statistics needs to improve. \u2018We need, indeed, to find a better balance between quality and timeliness, especially for data on income and living con- ditions. This might require a revision of the legislation which is from 2003, but not yet fully implemented in all Member It is important that statisticians further analyse social sustainability, especially the distribution of income, consumption and the wealth of households. This is because a rise in average income, which is a positive phenomenon, may be unequally spread across income groups, leaving some households relatively worse-off than others. Thus, average measures of income, consumption and wealth need to be accompanied by indicators that reflect their distribution across persons or households. \u00a9 M a r t i n S c h e m m , w w w . p i x e l i o . d e ",
        "GDP & Beyond 17 SIGMA 02 10 States. Right now we are in the middle of a discussion with the Member States and the scientific community on which direction to choose,\u2019 said Mr Mercy. Growth and environment Both the GDP and Beyond, and the Stiglitz Report underline the importance of better measuring the environmental di- mensions of growth and progress. Several of the European Commission\u2019s actions focus on the environment: an envi- ronmental index will be developed and the Commission will explore the possibility of developing a sustainable develop- ment scoreboard that would be complementary to the cur- rent set of sustainable development indicators. Furthermore, national accounts will be extended to cover environmental issues by increasing the coverage in the already existing en- vironmental accounts (See article on p. 8) Eurostat has been working on setting up environmental ac- counts since the 1990s. However, there is only partial infor- mation in the system, as countries are not obliged to provide data. Therefore, an EU law, to be adopted in 2011, has been developed, which will focus on three modules \u2013 material flow accounts, environmental taxes and air emission accounts. \u2018These are the three areas, which we have identified, togeth- er with the Member States, as being the most \u2018mature\u2019. We have had common guidelines for some time and many coun- tries have well-developed data,\u2019 said Gilles Decand, Head of Eurostat\u2019s Environmental Statistics and Accounts Unit. \u2018At the same time, we have started discussions with the Mem- ber States on which modules we should include in the sec- ond wave of environmental accounts legislation. Areas such as environmental goods and services \u2013 due to their links with green jobs, energy accounts \u2013 to analyse energy productiv- ity, and environmental protection expenditure accounts are the favourite candidates.\u2019 \u2018Possible modules in the longer term are forest, water and waste accounts,\u2019 he added. Sustainable development indicators Since 2005, Eurostat has produced a monitoring report of the European Union sustainable development strategy. The re- port is based on a selection of around 100 sustainable devel- opment indicators (SDI), of which eleven are called \u2018headline indicators\u2019. The headline indicators intend to give an overall picture of whether the EU has achieved progress towards the objectives and targets defined in the EU\u2019s sustainable devel- opment strategy. The sustainable development indicators are structured according to ten themes: socio-economic development, climate change and energy, sustainable transport, sustain- able consumption and production, natural resources, public health, social inclusion, demographic changes, global part- nership and good governance. They are accessible directly from the homepage of the Eurostat website. Eurostat\u2019s role Eurostat\u2019s role in the area of GDP and Beyond is to coordinate all activities within the European Commission and the Eu- ropean Statistical System (ESS). Within the European Com- mission, Eurostat co-chairs the work with the Directorate General for Environment, and in the ESS, Eurostat shares the coordination with the French Statistical Office, Insee, in the so-called Sponsorship group on measuring progress, well- being and sustainable development . The idea of the Sponsorship is to coordinate actions within the ESS and to propose a strategy to prioritise and imple- ment the recommendations of the GDP and Beyond, and the Stiglitz Report. Around 18 national statistical offices have volunteered to participate. In the Sponsorship\u2019s first meeting in spring 2010, it was de- cided to create three task forces. The first one focuses on en- vironmental sustainability and is co-chaired by Slovenia and Eurostat. The second one deals with the multi-dimensional measures of quality of life and is co-chaired by Eurostat and France (see article on p. 24). The third one focuses on house- hold perspective and distributional aspects of income con- sumption and wealth and is co-chaired by Eurostat and the Netherlands. These aspects will also be discussed by all Directors-General at their annual conference, DGINS, at the end of September in Sofia, Bulgaria. \u2018Multi-dimensional measurement of sustainable develop- ment is a challenge for the ESS, and therefore an important topic for the Directors-General. We all need to work hard to better measure progress, well-being and sustainable devel- opment,\u2019 Mr Radermacher concluded. \u00a9 H e i n r i c h L a n g e , w w w . p i x e l i o . d e Eurostat is setting up environmental accounts, together with the Member States. In 2011, new legislation will be adopted which will focus on material flow accounts, environmental taxes and air emission accounts. ",
        "SIGMA 02 10 18 Reading the present to prepare the future O ver 150 participants, including national accountants, statisticians, economists, bankers and journalists, at- tended the one-day conference on national accounts organised by Eurostat in Brussels in September 2009. By bringing together different experts, the organisers wanted to obtain a review of recent developments in the field of national accounts at a time of ongoing global economic crisis. Furthermore, the participants explored the changes that official statistics, and in particular national accounts, are facing today. Maria Helena Figueira, then Acting Director of the National and European Accounts Directorate at Eurostat, said that the GDP and Beyond Communication , and the Stiglitz-Sen-Fitoussi Report, released a few days before the conference, led towards a brainstorming session on the future of national accounts, their current limits with respect to a complex and evolving society and the opportunities that they offer with their coherent and integrated framework. In the photo, Ms Figueira is pictured with Roberto Barcellan, Head of Eurostat\u2019s National Accounts Unit. \u00a9 E u r o p e a n U n i o n I n 2008 and 2009, official statistics were hit by the conse- quences of the financial and economic crisis, which high- lighted both the existence and availability of suitable in- dicators and, at the same time, the need to strengthen the flexibility of official statistics with respect to the continuous- ly evolving environment. The 2010 crisis, generated by the worsening of public finances in most European countries, further stressed the role of official statistics as a monitoring instrument, but also as a reference collection framework of essential information for economic, financial and budget- ",

The NA 2009 conference successfully identified ways to deal with the new challenges which of- ficial statistics are already facing. Indeed, the conference be- came, at the end of summer 2009, a forward-looking forum for debating the issues that have been a statistical reality since winter 2009-2010. Maria Helena Figueira, then Acting Director of the National and European Accounts Directorate at Eurostat, told Sigma that most of the initiatives currently leading the develop- ments of national accounts were debated during the confer- ence. \u2018The GDP and Beyond, and the Stiglitz-Sen-Fitoussi Re- port, released a few days before the conference, led towards a brainstorming session on the future of national accounts, their current limits with respect to a complex and evolving society and the opportunities that they offer with their co- herent and integrated framework,\u2019 Ms Figueira said. The three-fold dimensions of the crisis (financial-economic- social) have emphasised the relevance of the household sec- tor and of its behaviour, and called upon European statisti- cians to launch several relevant initiatives in this field (e.g. the newly established Sponsorship on measuring progress, well-being and sustainable development). On the other hand, the recording of rescue operations by governments in the context of the financial crisis has opened At the conference, Eurostat\u2019s Director-General, Walter Radermacher, presented a set of forward-looking destination messages for the European Statistical System.

Finally, the trade-off between timeliness, flexibility and reliability has once again highlight- ed the dilemma of rapid estimates. Opening messages In her welcome note at the conference, Ms Figueira expressed her hope that in the course of the conference debates, priori- ties and challenges, as well as solutions to existing problems, would be identified, which would lead to further improve- ments in the quality of national accounts. In a video address, Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, the then European Com- missioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, stressed the im- portance of national accounts for economic and political deci- sion-makers. He said that the ongoing economic crisis exposed many new challenges to national accounting. The crisis originat- ed in the financial system, while national accounting was prima- rily devised to measure the economy, and as such, was not best suited to monitor developments in the financial sector. As a result, it was extremely important to find ways of improv- ing the integration of financial issues into the system of nation- al accounts. Commissioner Almunia went on to say that the system of national accounts was frequently criticised for not providing enough information on the environment, natural resources and social issues. As these topics were closely con- nected to developments in the economy, further development of the corresponding satellite accounts should be considered. Commissioner Almunia said that a system of global national accounts would prove very helpful in identifying imbalances between different regions in the world. However, this re- quired enhanced cooperation between major international organisations, among them Eurostat, and the combined effort of specialists from many areas, such as the economy, banking, environment and experts on social issues. Roberto Barcellan, Head of Eurostat\u2019s National Accounts Unit and one of the conference organisers, told Sigma that the issues referred to by Commissioner Almunia \u2018are today ad- dressed by the Commission as part of the economic, budget- ary and structural surveillance, as defined in the Commission Communication from 30 June 2010.\u2019 Identifying strengths and weaknesses Mr Radermacher, Director-General of Eurostat, spoke about the strengths and weaknesses of the current national ac- counting model. He said that an overwhelming advantage of the current model was the reliability of its data, which meet the high-quality standards of official statistics as defined by the European Statistical System\u2019s Code of Practice and other international quality frameworks. However, Mr Radermacher also said that the current national accounts system was not fully fit to cope with many prob- lems. He quoted the ongoing, global demographic changes and the shift towards knowledge societies in the West and asked whether the present national accounting paradigm should not be extended to include those phenomena, even though they might at first seem difficult to measure. Mr Radermacher proposed several ways of dealing with ac- counting problems, including a revision of core accounts, further development of satellite accounts and a clear rec- ognition of the existence of different user groups and their specific needs by national accountants. He also presented various aspects of the revision of the System of National Ac- counts (SNA) and the European System of Accounts (ESA). Outlining the long-term directions for the development of national accounts, Mr Radermacher stressed the importance of reliability, relevance and timeliness of data gathered by national accountants. This required use of appropriate quali- ty-assurance systems with reliable external validation tools. Finally, Mr Radermacher stressed the need for a closer coor- dination and exchange of data and metadata at international level, which would greatly help to develop global economic accounts. \u2018Mr Radermacher presented a set of forward-looking des- tination messages for the European Statistical System,\u2019 said Mr Barcellan. \u2018They underlie the current development of the national accounts framework and will represent the corner- stone of an economic and social set of indicators for Europe in the next ten years, in line with the Europe 2020 strategy of the European Commission.\u2019 Three plenary sessions The conference was divided into three plenary sessions and ended with a panel discussion. The first session, entitled \u2018Awakening from the financial and economic crisis\u2019, focused on the \u2018old and new challenges for statistics in a dynamic, global and fast-evolving economy\u2019. It was moderated by Martti Hetem\u00e4ki, Permanent Under- Secretary at the Finnish Ministry of Finance, member of the Economic and Finance Committee and Chairman of the EFC Sub-Committee on statistics. The second plenary session, \u2018GDP: Media hype?\u2019, moderated by Steven Keuning, then Director-General Statistics at the European Central Bank, debated the \u2018pitfalls in communicat- ing and interpreting national accounts\u2019.

        "22 SIGMA 02 10 22 EU statistics on income and living conditions \u2013 Helping to fulfil data needs of the 21st century I nna Steinbuka, Director of the Social and Informa- tion Society Statistics Directorate at Eurostat, heads an international task force dealing with the \u2018multi- dimensional measurement of the quality of life\u2019. The task force, part of the newly formed Sponsorship on Measur- ing Progress, Well-being and Sustainable Development is jointly chaired by Eurostat and the French Statistical Office, Insee. Sigma spoke to Ms Steinbuka to find out more about the work of the task force. Inna Steinbuka is Director of Social and Information Society Statistics at Eurostat. \u00a9 E u r o p e a n U n i o n \u2018Our work directly reflects the requirements of today \u2013 the need to modify statistical systems and develop ways of measuring growth, taking into account social well-being,\u2019 said Ms Stein- buka. \u2018The development in recent years of the EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) is a major step in that direction.\u2019 EU-SILC is a survey of private households. It was launched in 2003 on the basis of a gentlemen\u2019s agreement between Eurostat and six EU Member States (Austria, Belgium, Den- mark, Greece, Ireland, Luxembourg) and Norway, and for- mally launched in 2004 following a European Commission regulation in 15 countries. In 2005, the survey was expanded to cover all of the then EU-25 Member States, together with Norway and Iceland. Bulgaria launched EU SILC in 2006, while Romania, Switzerland and Turkey introduced the sur- vey in 2007. \u2018Future data gathering, adapted to follow the recommenda- tions of the Stiglitz Commission and the Communication, GDP and Beyond, will mean reliance on a combination of different data sources and the creation of a number of new indicators,\u2019 said Ms Steinbuka. \u2018EU-SILC, which well reflects developments in the social situation in Europe, will play an important role in this process. The Sponsorship task force will use the experi- ence gathered in the development of EU-SILC in its work on future indicators to measure the quality of life of a society.\u2019 Warsaw conference An international conference on EU-SILC, held in Warsaw last March brought together data producers, institutional users of statistics and members of the academic community. The meeting allowed a unique insight into the state of play of social statistics in Europe. During the conference, Professor Anthony B. Atkinson, a lead- ing expert in the area of micro-economics and economics of income distribution and poverty, as well as a member of the European Statistical Governance Advisory Board, described the harmonised EU-SILC database as a \u2018valuable source\u2019 in the development of new indicators in line with the recom- mendations of the Stiglitz Commission and the Commission Communication, GDP and Beyond . \u2018I agree with Prof. Atkinson that the potential of our survey for future research cannot be overestimated,\u2019 said Ms Stein- buka. \u2018EU-SILC is very helpful to policymakers in their analysis and monitoring of the problems affecting a large proportion of the European population as, among other things, it pro- ",

It will also enable comparisons between the EU Member States in an area where demand for fresh \u2018 EU-SILC is very helpful to policymakers in their analysis and monitoring of the problems affecting a large proportion of the European population as, among other things, it provides information on the levels of poverty, deprivation and social exclusion on our continent,\u2019 said Ms Steinbuka. \u00a9 E u r o p e a n U n i o n statistical information is growing rapidly. \u2018Our task force is working hard to develop modern indicators which will allow a better description of the situation of this vulnerable part of the society and let us compare it with the rest of the popula- tion in the EU Member States.\u2019 Future steps Ms Steinbuka said that the task force hopes to soon be able to describe the vulnerable groups in greater detail. \u2018Once we have the scores for the entire and vulnerable populations, we will be able to go further, bring more precision into our research, i.e. describe the vulnerable groups by age, sex, ed- ucation and income,\u2019 she said. Despite persisting challenges, such as problems with data comparability and timeliness, Ms Steinbuka remains optimis- tic. \u2018I am convinced that we will get there, largely thanks to the EU-SILC database, which today features the full statistical coverage and time series for 29 European countries,\u2019 she said. \u2018We have come a long way since 2003, when the first EU-SILC figures were collected. There is a growing need for reliable and detailed data on the quality of life in the European Union states. These figures will only gain in importance as EU policy- makers go about implementing the Europe 2020 strategy\u2019. ",
        "24 SIGMA 02 10 24 \u2018This is just the beginning\u2019 \u2013 Insee leads the way in the measurement of well-being J ean-Philippe Cotis, Head of the French Statistical Office, Insee, was a member of the select group of experts be- hind the Stiglitz Report. In Paris, he spoke to Sigma about measuring the well-being of French society, as well as the work of the Stiglitz Commission. Two years ago the French Statistical Office, Insee, started analysing the composition of the disposable income of French households. They saw marked differences in spending and saving behaviour, depending on their income. Mr Cotis, Head of the French Statistical Office, said that Insee would further expand its consumer surveys in the future to include new themes, such as the use of time at home and the levels of contentment with different leisure activities. \u00a9 I n s e e \u2018The desire to find ways of measuring societal well-being alongside economic growth is not new,\u2019 Mr Cotis said. \u2018It is widely agreed that while GDP figures reflect the overall economic output of a country, they tell us nothing about the levels of happiness of its citizens.\u2019 Neglected housework Mr Cotis said that weaknesses in current statistical account- ing, which had to be urgently addressed, included, for in- stance, housework. \u2018When you are not working profession- ally and instead raising your children, your daily \u2019output\u2019, or housework, is not measured at the moment,\u2019 he explained. \u2018Giving your children music lessons or art classes after school can be considered as educational work. Equally, more \u2019do- mestic\u2019 activities, such as ironing shirts or hoovering your flat, should also be measured statistically, the logic being that someone else could be hired by you to do this work for money. If you paid them for their services, you would be in- creasing your country\u2019s GDP. This needs to be noted.\u2019 In addition, Mr Cotis observed: \u2018If we look at the way educa- tion systems function in different settings, we soon realise that often the same type of schooling is public in Europe, and private, meaning that it has to be paid for, in the US. If the education sector in the US makes money, it means that it can be listed as contributing extra value added to the US GDP, whereas in Europe this is not the case. This demonstrates present difficulties in measuring GDP in various countries.\u2019 Pioneering work In order to fill these gaps, Insee started analysing the com- position of the disposable income of French households two years ago. It designed an evaluation system based on the framework of national accounts. \u2018We broke households down into five income groups by the so-called quintiles, ",
        "GDP & Beyond 25 SIGMA 02 10 according to their gross income,\u2019 Mr Cotis explained. \u2018Each quintile represents 20% or one fifth of all households. This system helped us to better understand their consumption and income patterns. What we saw were marked differences in the spending and saving behaviour of the French people.\u2019 Mr Cotis continued: \u2018When you are poor, your whole income is extremely important to you, every euro counts. However, when you make 10 000 euros a month, a single euro hardly matters. This mechanism holds for a society as a whole as well: past a certain level of GDP per capita, levels of happi- ness are increasing less and less markedly. Affluent Western societies may rate lower in some polls than poorer counter- parts elsewhere in the world.\u2019 Mr Cotis said that Insee would further expand its consumer surveys in the future to include new themes, such as the use of time at home and the levels of contentment with different leisure activities. \u2018The shift in the way we produce statistics should also entail better measurement of people\u2019s levels of satisfaction and the way they spend their time,\u2019 he explained. According to Mr Cotis, measuring subjective well-being is not easy, but first attempts were proving that it could be done. People are able to rate various experiences according to satisfaction derived from them. Stiglitz work brings new impetus Referring to his involvement in the work of the Stiglitz Com- mission, Mr Cotis said that Insee\u2019s ground-breaking experi- ence in the field of social statistics prepared him well for his participation in the Stiglitz group. He said: \u2018Many of the issues discussed by the Commission were not brand new. The real importance of our work lay in the fact that top international scientists and experts got together to systematise the existing knowledge in the field, identify new opportunities and draw useful conclusions. We did not try to re-invent the wheel. All we set out to do was to offer fresh insights into the way international statistics op- erate today and suggest a more structured approach in ad- dressing mounting challenges for statisticians.\u2019 Mr Cotis said that the Commission did not seek ways to re- place GDP figures, only to complement them with an array of new indicators. \u2018Everyone agreed that mere measurement of raw economic growth is not enough any more; that we need to rely on a new set of indicators taking into account social well-being. Our final Report recommends that GDP should be used to measure economic activity and that it should be combined with data allowing for well-being factors such as environmental health, safety and education,\u2019 he explained. More to come \u2018 This is just the beginning. In the future, statistics will include the measurements of inequality between genders, as well as age and social groups. Our data will allow policymakers to evaluate levels of well-being in their societies and make plans to act accordingly,\u2019 said Mr Cotis. Concluding, Mr Cotis pointed to another positive aspect of the Commission\u2019s work. He said that the fact that statisticians were now dealing with an expanded range of social issues might help dispel the degree of mistrust among certain seg- ments of European societies. \u2018Polls show that there are many people out there who do not trust official statistics, whose perception is that we do not measure things that really mat- ter or that our figures are somehow being manipulated. By addressing concrete issues closer to the heart of an average citizen, we will be fighting this erroneous perception as well,\u2019 he said. Mr Cotis said that weaknesses in current statistical accounting, which had to be urgently addressed, included, for instance, housework. Another area is education. \u2018Often the same type of schooling is public in Europe, and private, meaning it has to be paid for, in the US. If the education sector in the US makes money, it means that it can be listed as contributing extra value added to the US GDP, whereas in Europe this is not the case. This demonstrates present difficulties in measuring GDP in various countries.\u2019 \u00a9 P h o v o i r ",
        "26 SIGMA 02 10 26 On the right track \u2013 Sustainability and quality of life high on the agenda of Statistics Netherlands I n recent years, Statistics Netherlands has been actively engaged in efforts to measure sustainable development and the quality of life in the country. In fact, in the Netherlands, intensive work in this field was started years before the publication of the Stiglitz Report, as Gosse van der Veen, Director-General of Statistics Netherlands, told Sigma . Gosse van der Veen , Head of Statistics Netherlands, said that sustainability and quality of life were already high on the agenda in his country, but became even more prominent after the Stiglitz Report was published in 2009. \u00a9 C B S Could you give your view as to why the Stiglitz Report is important? The Stiglitz Commission Report has gained a great deal of at- tention from economists, social scientists, policymakers and statisticians because of the potential impact on the measure- ment of (social) welfare, well-being and sustainable develop- ment. It is important because it demonstrates an impressive overview of the literature that has accumulated over the last few decades and even centuries. The strength of the Report is that, under the guidance of a number of very influential scientists, it is convincingly argued that these different disci- plines are all related to the measurement of \u2018progress\u2019 in the broadest sense of the word. For Statistics Netherlands, the following passage of the Stiglitz Report is very important: \u2018 The assessment of sustain- ability is complementary to the question of current well-being or economic performance and must be examined separately\u2026 Both pieces of information are critical and need to be displayed in distinct, clearly visible areas of the dashboard\u2019. Statistics Netherlands also subscribes to these very fundamental prin- ciples. In the upcoming sustainability monitor, a separate dashboard for the quality of life and a separate dashboard for sustainable development will be provided. However, we have added a third dashboard, which covers the impact of the Netherlands on other countries. We feel that that was given too little attention in the Stiglitz Report. Has Statistics Netherlands already launched any projects which could be considered as first steps in the implementation of the Stiglitz Report? Statistics Netherlands started work on the sustainability monitor in the summer of 2007, well before the Stiglitz Re- port was published. However, the history of Statistics Neth- erlands in this field goes much further back. Notable contri- butions were the Green National Income by Roefie Hueting (in the 1970s) and the pioneering work on Environmental Accounting by Mark de Haan and Steven Keuning. ",
        "GDP & Beyond 27 SIGMA 02 10 It is therefore fair to say that Statistics Netherlands has a long tradition in this field. Since a lot of our recent work on the Sustainability Monitor is also based on the same lit- erature which the Stiglitz Report cites, it came as no sur- prise that the Report confirmed that we were \u2018on the right track\u2019. It would therefore not be entirely accurate to say that the work at Statistics Netherlands is a direct result of the Report. What is however incontrovertible is that our work obtained a considerable boost after the Report was pub- lished. Sustainability and quality of life were already high on the agenda, but became even more prominent after September 2009. Already in 2008, Statistics Netherlands had started a pro- gramme for statistics on sustainable development. Cur- rently, over 12 full-time equivalents (FTE) are assigned to the development of the Sustainability Monitor, as well as new statistics on environmental accounts, energy statistics, time use, human capital accounts and social capital, to name but a few. Fortunately, given the level of interest in the field, we have been able to start certain projects through government programmes and Eurostat grants (for which we are very grateful). All in all, this means that about a third of the 12 FTE are financed through external sources. To me, this is further proof of the importance that society places on this topic. The most important task for Statistics Netherlands is to create dashboards to measure the \u2018progress\u2019 of the society. There will be three separate ones on the quality of life, intergenerational sustainability and the international dimension, which will be published in spring 2011. Pictured is a painting of Dutch painter August Macke, Promenade from 1913. \u00a9 N e t h e r l a n d s B o a r d o f T o u r i s m & C o n v e n t i o n s ",
        "28 SIGMA 02 10 GDP & Beyond What are Statistics Netherlands\u2019 key priorities in regard to the implementation of the Stiglitz Report recommendations? And what projects do you envisage in short and longer terms? Statistics Netherlands subscribes to almost all of the recom- mendations of the Stiglitz Commission. In fact, many of the recommendations were already in place when the Report came out. In some cases, the Stiglitz Report convinced us to intensify or scale down certain areas of our statistical pro- gramme. Clearly the most important task is to create dashboards to measure the \u2018progress\u2019 of societies. Through the Sustainabili- ty Monitor, we have now created three separate dashboards: quality of life, intergenerational sustainability and the inter- national dimension. Our results will be published in March of 2011 (also in English). However, there is also a lot of work to do in terms of the underlying statistical base of our indicator system. We are Statistics Netherlands is also working on the statistical base to measure, amongst others, social capital and the \u2019international dimension\u2019 of sustainable development. \u2018The Stiglitz Report said very little about the international relationships between countries. Nevertheless, through trade and other interactions, (western) countries have great impact on the sustainability in other countries,\u2019 Mr van der Veen said. \u00a9 K i r s t e n W o l l m e r , w w w . p i x e l i o . d e ",
        "GDP & Beyond 29 SIGMA 02 10 developing in many different directions, but I would like to single out the following: 1) social capital. It is now generally accepted that social capi- tal is a true capital stock. What is however undeniable is that it is very hard to measure. I am pleased to say that we are making good progress in the conceptual and practical implementation of social capital; 2) international dimension. The Stiglitz Report said very little about the international relationships between countries. Nevertheless, through trade and other interactions, (west- ern) countries have great impact on the sustainability in other countries. We are developing statistics and methods to create indicators for this dimension. We are also work- ing closely together with the World Input-Output Database (WIOD) project which bundles official statistics for eco- nomic, environmental and trade statistics for the world; 3) satellite accounting. The national accounts system is prob- ably one of the most successful statistical systems to date. As the Stiglitz Commission rightly pointed out, the system is far broader than the calculation of GDP. There is also an extensive set of satellite accounts which provide an excel- lent basis for further measurement of progress. We already have an extensive system of environmental, labour, tour- ism and growth accounts, but are expanding them with time use, human capital and social capital. These satellite accounts have the benefit of producing indicators that are comparable to GDP, but can also serve as a data source for sustainability modelling (by the policy institutes); 4) long time series. Progress, and particularly sustainable de- velopment, are phenomena which manifest themselves over long time periods. Although business cycles influ- ence both in the short term, true structural changes man- ifest themselves over the long term. It is therefore very important that we create long time series for a number of key indictors of progress. These are goals which we wish to achieve by the end of 2011. However, there are also possibilities for some spin-offs of our work for the longer term. An example is the issue of inequal- ity in societal developments, which is also an important component of the Stiglitz Report. A pilot project has already started for this issue. Another example is the use of our sys- tem for sustainability reporting by companies. What are the challenges ahead as far as the implementation goes? Statistics Netherlands considers two topics forthcoming from the recommendations as priority challenges: 1) we intend to work more on the visualisation of our work. The Dutch indicator set of quality of life and sustainable development included a great number of indicators. The large amount of information is needed to address this is- sue properly. However, special visualisation techniques are needed in order to summarise the main implications of our work in such a way that policymakers and society will be able to identify the main trends by looking at one, simple summary table; 2) in cooperation with other government agencies, we plan to develop a set of policy indicators. Monitoring (i.e. giv- ing a summary of the \u2018state of the nation\u2019 in terms of its sustainability) is one thing, but giving policymakers an idea as to how certain negative trends can be overcome is an issue which needs to be tackled. This can only be done if Statistics Netherlands, policy institutes, as well as cer- tain Ministries (Environmental Affairs, Economic Affairs, Finance and Foreign Affairs) work together. \u00a9 N e t h e r l a n d s B o a r d o f T o u r i s m & C o n v e n t i o n s To analyse sustainability, well-being and welfare, it is very important that results and indicators can be compared with those of other countries. Therefore, Mr van der Veen believes that a common dashboard should be developed. Another important issue is the harmonisation and collection of data. ",
        "30 SIGMA 02 10 GDP & Beyond Could you explain possible changes in data collection and analysis following the recommendations of the Stiglitz Report? One potential, but ambitious goal would be to harmonise the data collection on objective and subjective indicators. There is an increasing call for data on \u2018gross national happiness\u2019; how- ever, if we follow this road we end up with a one-dimensional indicator which, in the end, might not be very useful. We would rather like to break down perception indicators (on life satisfac- tion) into different social domains (such as health, education, income) and make a systematic comparison between objec- tive indicators (how healthy are the people?) and subjective in- dicators (how satisfied are we with our health status?). This will enable us (a) to find out which aspects of life contribute most to the life satisfaction (and therefore welfare) of people and (b) to make it possible to track down the extent to which percep- tions are based on actual changes (for example, often we see that people feel increasingly unsafe in society, whereas actual indicators on the number of crimes show improvement). If you had to attach priorities to different statistical developments in the coming years, what are the areas in which you would invest? Measuring Sustainability and Quality of Life is clearly one of the key challenges of our time. Nevertheless, society also de- mands other information. To make sure that Statistics Neth- erlands is in tune with the most recent demands of society, we have adopted a number of statistical programmes. Re- sources are made available to produce new additions to our statistical portfolio. Examples include: the housing market, productivity, knowledge economy, social dynamics, social cohesion, an ageing society, globalisation and security. How important is it to have a common approach at ESS level to the work in this field? For the analysis of sustainability, well-being and welfare, it is very important that results and indicators can be compared with those of other countries. Two steps are required in the harmonisation process: 1) adoption of a common dashboard. At the moment, coun- tries and institutes all have very divergent methods to measure progress. Although it will be difficult, we believe it is important that a common framework is adopted and implemented by all countries. The Task Force for Measur- ing Sustainable Development (TFSD) and Sponsorship Group for Progress should be the prime bodies in which this harmonisation takes place; 2) collection and harmonisation of data. The necessary data need to be collected, and even more importantly, need to be harmonised in order to make proper inter- national comparisons possible. Of course, Eurostat is already doing a lot of work in this field. What is particu- larly important is the work which is done on the \u2018quality profiles\u2019 of the indicators so that users have a clear view of the limitations in the data. More could be done on the collection of data on satellite accounts and input- output tables. Any specifically Dutch issues and challenges? In the Dutch context we see three challenges: 1) it seems good to invest more in the contacts with different actors in the field of sustainable development. Employees of statistical bureaus are of course used to working with people at ministries and other government institutes, but in this case, the importance of this interaction is even greater; 2) we would like to stimulate other government agencies or universities to use our indicators for models on which pol- icy forecasting can be based. This will enhance the useful- ness of our measurement system; 3) a problem in the international setting may be the frag- mentation of this topic. Many task forces, working groups, initiatives and sponsorship groups by many dif- ferent institutions have been created to tackle this prob- lem. On the one hand, this is positive because it again proves that we are doing important work. On the other hand, it is far from optimal in terms of coherence and ef- ficiency. Statistics Netherlands will do its bit to search for means of cooperation which will improve this situation. There may be an important role for Eurostat to play in this coordination. ",
        "31 SIGMA 02 10 31 A coordinated European approach is needed for Destatis G ermany has had a national sustainability strategy in place since 2002 and progress is monitored every two years by indicators mostly produced by the German Federal Statistical Office, Destatis. \u2018Largely, the German Indicator Report on Sustainable Development matches several recommendations of the Stiglitz-Sen-Fitoussi Commission, but more work needs to be done, particularly on issues such as measuring quality of life,\u2019 said Albert Braakmann, Head of Destatis\u2019 National Income, Sector Accounts and Labour Market Division, to Sigma . Albert Braakmann, Head of National Income, Sector Accounts, Labour Market Division at the German Statistical Office. \u00a9 D e s t a t i s A ccording to Mr Braakmann, the Stiglitz Report initi- ated an important discussion on how to further de- velop official statistics to create a sustainable and rel- evant basis for analyses. \u2018The Stiglitz Report looks ahead and makes recommenda- tions on how social, economic and environmental issues should be reported statistically to enable official statistics to retain their credibility and provide a basis for political action,\u2019 he said. \u2018The Report draws attention to the fact that economic fac- tors do not fully explain social progress and that statistics need to focus more strongly on quality of life, in all its various aspects,\u2019 Mr Braakmann continued. \u2018It also stresses that information about sustainability and the environment is an essential part of modern statistics.\u2019 Room for improvement As far as implementing the proposals of the Stiglitz Commis- sion, Destatis has already made considerable progress when it comes to creating an environmental accounting system. The data and indicators are, for example, used to monitor Germany\u2019s sustainability strategy. \u2018Reporting with indicators that are integrated in environ- mental accounting helps to improve the way in which po- tential political measures are assessed and therefore also subsequently monitored,\u2019 said Mr Braakmann. As far as improving economic indicators, Destatis is working on calculating the distribution of income by type of house- hold. The office is also planning another time use survey, which was last conducted in 2001/2002. When it comes to measuring quality of life, German statisti- cians are working on an inventory of data available concern- ing the seven aspects of quality of life recommended by the Report, of both a subjective and an objective nature. The main challenge is to specify the quality of life indicators at technical level and then to consider how various infor- mation might reasonably be aggregated. At the same time, questions of data availability and how any data gaps might be filled need to be taken into consideration. \u2018Although a large amount of data is available in some cases, we consider that there is considerable room for further de- velopment,\u2019 said Mr Braakmann. ",
        "32 SIGMA 02 10 GDP & Beyond Resources \u2013 an issue In general, German users are in agreement with Destatis\u2019 \u2018Stiglitz\u2019 priorities. The Statistical Committee, in which their most important users are represented, recently confirmed Destatis\u2019 plans regarding personal income distribution and the need for another time-use survey. It also welcomed the further consolidation of environmental accounting and sus- tainability reporting. However, there is of course a discussion about resources for implementing the recommendations. \u2018In view of the current drastic cuts in the federal budget, it is not a very good time to significantly extend the official sta- tistical programme. Nevertheless, we would like to invest in areas where further development is necessary for us to be able to provide high-quality data on topics which are rele- vant to our users,\u2019 said Mr Braakmann. \u2018If our users consider implementation of the recommenda- tions of the Stiglitz Commission to be a priority, the neces- sary resources must also be provided to permit investment in implementation. This may take the form of additional funding or of cutting down or eliminating lower-priority tasks,\u2019 he continued. Mr Braakmann also underlined that users need to take into ac- count that setting up new statistical surveys or changing exist- ing ones requires legislation in Germany. This means a certain amount of time would need to be set aside for this purpose. \u2018Furthermore, Germany is a federal country in which surveys are decentralised, in principle, which means that more coor- dination is needed than in countries in which statistics are managed by a central body,\u2019 Mr Braakmann said. Comparison with other countries increasingly important In Mr Braakmann\u2019s view, the recommendations of the Stiglitz Commission could, in principle, be implemented on a purely national basis, but the European perspective, which specifi- cally means comparing the situation in one\u2019s own country with the situation in other countries, is becoming increas- ingly important. \u2018It is therefore necessary to discuss and jointly determine def- initions and indicators at EU level to avoid comparing totally different things. A further advantage of a common approach is that it enables the experience of individual Member States to be shared. There is no need to reinvent the wheel; on the contrary, we can learn from the experience of others and de- velop common procedures as best practice,\u2019 Mr Braakmann concluded. \u00a9 A n g e l i k a W o l t e r , w w w . p i x e l i o . d e Destatis has already made considerable progress when it comes to creating an environmental accounting system.

        "33 SIGMA 02 10 33 Time for Member States to start debates on well-being E nrico Giovannini, President of the Italian Statistical Institute, is experienced in high-level discussions on how to improve the measurement of economic and social progress. In the wake of the Stiglitz Report, he says that it is about time the EU Member States took action and launched broad debates to identify the factors most important for well-being. Enrico Giovannini, President of the Italian Statistical Institute and member of the Stiglitz Commission. \u00a9 I S T A T \u2018This i s primarily not a statistical problem. It is a political question and it is impor- tant for the government of a modern society. We need to improve existing democratic institutions, engage people in round-table discussions on measures of societal progress and statistical measurement standards,\u2019 said Mr Giovannini. Already in 2004, Mr Giovannini, then Chief Statistician of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), organised the first OECD World Forum on Statistics, Knowledge and Policy with the intention of promoting in- ternational research and information sharing and to allow countries to compare how they measure \u2018progress\u2019 in their societies. Three years later, after the second OECD World Forum had at- tracted 1 200 participants from 130 countries, Mr Giovannini realised that new measures of societal progress were of glo- bal concern, and the OECD established the \u2019Global Project on Measuring the Progress of Societies\u2019. Later that year, Mr Giovannini met with French authorities to discuss the establishment of an international commission to improve statistical information in this area. The result of this meeting was the creation of the Stiglitz Commission, of which Mr Giovannini was also a member. Defining indicators of well-being at a national level The starting point for the Stiglitz Report, the European Com- mission Communication on GDP and Beyond, as well as the third OECD World Forum, was an awareness of the need to complement GDP with measures of equitability and sustain- ability, and of the fact that all dimensions of well-being were not covered by GDP. Together, these initiatives contributed to last year\u2019s intense debate on how to measure well-being and social progress. The Stiglitz Report identified eight \u2018key dimensions\u2019 which shape people\u2019s well-being. These concern material living standards, health, education, personal activities, political voice, social connections, environment, as well as economic and physical vulnerability. Many of these dimensions are not included in conventional income measures. \u2018The European Statistical System (ESS) is well advanced in most of these domains, except for political voice and social connections. But there are cross-cutting issues, such as equi- tability, sustainability and vulnerability that need to be de- veloped further. It is also important that we have both sub- jective and objective indicators. We must start asking people how they perceive things,\u2019 said Mr Giovannini. ",
        "34 SIGMA 02 10 GDP & Beyond Mr Giovannini believes that the domains that influence well- being are to a large extent identical in most developed coun- tries. Nevertheless, he thinks, it is important that the discus- sion leading up to the identification of such domains and the selection of the appropriate indicators start in the Member States and not at EU level. \u2018In order to gain trust and legitimacy from the citizens of Eu- rope, it is better to go ahead with indicators decided at nation- al level than with indicators approved at EU level that people do not trust. The ESS has done an incredible job in improv- ing the comparability of indicators, but there\u2019s still a problem with credibility. According to a Euro-barometer, more than 40% of Europeans don\u2019t trust official statistics. They think that they are being manipulated,\u2019 said Mr Giovannini. Round-table discussions The round tables, which should host the discussions, already exist in several countries. Well-known examples are the \u2018State of the USA\u2019 and the \u2018Canadian Institute of Well-being\u2019. In or- der to improve their legitimacy, these round tables ought to include representatives from different parts of society, not least the private sector. \u2018During these discussions, statisticians should keep the round tables informed about progress made in domains of interest to the discussions. Statisticians, as stated in the Stiglitz Report, should not refrain from difficulties, but push ahead also in domains where results are difficult to measure,\u2019 said Mr Giovannini. The starting point for the Stiglitz Report, the European Commission Communication GDP and Beyond, as well as the third OECD World Forum, was an awareness of the need to complement GDP with measures of equitability and sustainability, and of the fact that all dimensions of well-being were not covered by GDP.

        "GDP & Beyond 35 SIGMA 02 10 Mr Giovannini believes that Member States should identify the domains that define well-being and that the ESS should establish a common research framework and standards to facilitate and harmonise the measurement of the phenomena which have not been measured before. The result of these activities would be a set of reliable indicators that reveals the factors behind well-being and societal progress. \u00a9 I S T A T Improving measurement of social progress and well-being is not only a question of identifying and developing new in- dicators, but also of using existing statistics and combining information from different domains into a coherent system. An important building block in this context is the existing framework of national accounts around GDP. \u2018Within national accounts, we already have a lot of data to address the issue of well-being. In national accounts, we need a common unit and that is money. Several statistical domains or aspects of well-being cannot be measured with money. However, we should try to expand national accounts as much as possible, for example with data on social matters, such as income distribution and the satellite account for en- vironment,\u2019 said Mr Giovannini. Mr Giovannini believes that as the Member States identify the domains that define well-being, the ESS should establish a common research framework and standards to facilitate and harmonise the measurement of the phenomena which have not been measured before. The result of these activities would be a set of reliable indicators that reveals the factors behind well-being and societal progress. \u2018Finally, when national round tables have identified the rel- evant domains and the best indicators have been selected, we will have to make citizens aware of these indicators. Then we will have a good starting point for a public debate on so- cietal progress and well-being. This is very important for the democratic process in the information age,\u2019 concluded Mr Giovannini. ",

Sigma asked Mr Hetem\u00e4ki about his views on national accounts data and economic policies, and their relation to the debate around GDP and Beyond, and the Stiglitz Report. Martti Hetem\u00e4ki said that it is clear that GDP, or its growth, does not give us information on all aspects of well-being and development. This has brought out the need to improve available data and to develop additional indicators to be used in the public debate and policymaking.

Very important. Economic policymaking is based on na- tional accounts data in every country. In the EU, the role of national accounts data is even more important because so many of the EU\u2019s policies, starting from the revenue side of the EU budget, are based on national accounts.

In many cases, it has also been used as a proxy for overall progress and pros- perity. However, it is clear that GDP or its growth does not give us information on all aspects of well-being and devel- opment. This has brought out the need to improve available data and to develop additional indicators to be used in the public debate and policymaking. The Commission\u2019s GDP and Beyond initiative, and the Stiglitz Report are very important steps in this work. Is the current set of economic statistical indicators enough to fulfil the needs of policymakers or does it need to be complemented with other data/ indicators? Most importantly, and as a first step, we need to make bet- ter use of the data that are already available. That means combining data from different sources and improving the M ",

How important are complementary data that give information on environmental and social developments? It is important to assess complementary data on environ- mental and social developments. However, much can be done, simply by exploring and combining the data that are already collected in different statistical branches. What challenges and data needs has the financial and economic crisis triggered? The financial and economic crisis has highlighted the im- portance of timely and reliable statistics. The crisis started as financial crisis, but turned into a global economic crisis. It showed how important it is to analyse simultaneously fi- nancial and non-financial accounts and to monitor the inter- linkages between them. One also has to consider how to interpret short-term data in order to better predict turning points in economic devel- opment. The Principal European Economic Indicators (PEEIs) have proved to be the main tool for monitoring short-term changes such as economic crisis and to provide comparable and readily available key information complementing mon- etary and financial indicators. What should be the main areas for further improvement? My list of areas for further improvement can be summarised in four words: reliability, reality, relevance and resources. Reliability is critical. If the public and the policymakers can- not rely on statistics, we are lost. The trust in official statistics is surprisingly low in many countries. The popular perception about unreliable official statistics is not without reasons. The need to improve data reliability concerns many EU countries, not just Greece. Reality is evolving fast with a technology which is based more on intangible capital, an economy that is more global and production that is more service-based. National accounts are evolving with these changes, but this is not an easy process. Relevance relates to what I have said earlier about GDP and Beyond, and the Stiglitz Report initiatives. Resources available for producing statistics need to be used more efficiently. This stems from the need to continue devel- oping statistics, as well as delivering more relevant statistical information, while available resources to do the work are not increasing. In fact, in many countries, resources in the NSIs have been decreased. It is a huge challenge to produce more reliable and relevant statistics that adequately take into account the rapidly evolv- ing economic reality with very limited resources. I think that there is only one solution to this challenge. That solution is a high professional capacity and the integrity of statisti- cians. Mr Hetem\u00e4ki said that, as a first step, better use needs to be made of statistics that are already available \u2013 combining data from different sources and improving inter-linkages between economic, social and environmental statistics. \u2018We also need to prioritise \u2013 adding new statistical requirements means that some of the old, less-needed requirements may have to be cut down.\u2019 Pictured is a lake in northern Finland. \u00a9 V i s i t F i n l a n d ",

Sigma asked Mr Codogno his opinion on how to improve the measurement of societal development and well-being. Lorenzo Codogno, Director-General of the Economic and Financial Analysis and Planning Department of the Italian Treasury, and President of the Economic and Policy Committee. \u00a9 M i n i s t r y o f E c o n o m y a n d F i n a n c e , I t a l y Why are national accounts data important for the work of the Economic Policy Committee? National accounts data are extremely important for the work of the Economic Policy Committee (EPC). The EPC and its working groups provide economic analyses, opinions, meth- odologies and draft conclusions for economic policymaking by the Council. The EPC relies very much on sound and con- sistent national statistics. For instance, the national accounts are particularly important for the EPC when developing analy sis and policy consensus on key issues, including re- sponding to globalisation, strengthening the single market and promoting greater coherence between macro-economic, structural and employment policies. National statistics are also very relevant for our work on pub- lic finances, where the EPC has particular responsibilities re- garding quality and sustainability. Finally, GDP growth and its possible modification/additions due to the Stiglitz Com- mission\u2019s work are key targets for policymaking and thus for the EPC support to policymaking. It should be emphasised that it is not only national accounts data that are essential for the work of the EPC. For example, the structural indicators, other sectoral data, and social and employment indicators compiled by Eurostat are extensively used by the Committee and its working groups, as well as any additional data from sources such as the World Bank or the OECD. Both the Stiglitz Report and the Commission\u2019s Communication, GDP and Beyond have found a need to complement the current GDP figures with other dimensions such as well-being and sustainability. What do you think? GDP is the best known measure of economic activity that we have. It is a standard measure used by all policymakers and is based on a clear, accepted methodology that is constantly ",
        "GDP & Beyond 39 SIGMA 02 10 being improved and allows for relatively reliable compari- sons both over time and between countries. Hence, the GDP measure has many advantages and can hardly be replaced as a measurement of economic output. At the same time, it has its limitations. While GDP measures economic activity, it does not capture social progress, health status or social inclusion; nor does it provide information about how well we are using our resources by measuring environmental sustainability. These limitations explain why the perception of people in general may sometimes deviate from what GDP developments suggest. While GDP may be increasing, inequalities, pollution and congestion may also be increasing, leading people to feel worse off. In view of the limitations of the GDP measure and, notably, the climate change challenge, we need additional measures that better reflect the social progress and better capture the development towards low-carbon and more resource-effi- cient economies. We also need indicators that better consid- er social and environmental achievements and losses. How- ever, this is not about replacing GDP with other measures, but complementing it with additional indicators to obtain a more complete picture of our economies and societies. Can we measure well-being and sustainability in an efficient manner with the current set of statistical indicators? GDP has for a very long time been the most common indi- cator for macro-economic development. In the absence of more accurate measures, it has also been seen as a proxy for prosperity and well-being. We have been aware of the limi- tations of GDP as a measure of societal progress for quite a Mr Codogno said that in view of the limitations of the GDP measure and the climate change challenge, additional measures were needed which would better reflect social progress and the development towards low-carbon and more resource-efficient economies. Indicators that better consider social and environmental achievements and losses were also needed, not to replace GDP, but to complement it, in order to obtain a more complete picture of our economies and societies. \u00a9 M o n i q u e L o o s ",
        "40 SIGMA 02 10 GDP & Beyond while, especially of the fact that it does not give a complete picture of the many dimensions of well-being. Nevertheless, only recently, the efforts to address these weaknesses have gathered momentum. Therefore, new sta- tistics and indicators are being developed. For instance, a comprehensive environmental index has been proposed by the European Commission that would bring together various dimensions of environmental policy, such as climate change and energy use, nature and biodiversity, air pollution and health impacts, water use and pollution, waste generation and use of resources. Another strand of research relates to indicators on quality of life and well-being. The Commission Communication GDP and Beyond, the Stiglitz Report and the OECD project on measuring the progress of societies are cru- cial initiatives in this respect. At the same time, we need to be aware of the wealth of data on various aspects of prosperity and well-being which al- ready exist. We need to better exploit these data, together with the newly developed indicators, and use them in the public debate and policymaking. Mr Codogno said that while statisticians needed to better exploit existing data, new statistics and indicators were being developed. For instance, a comprehensive environmental index has been proposed by the European Commission that would bring together various dimensions of environmental policy, such as climate change and energy use, nature and biodiversity, air pollution and health impacts, water use and pollution, waste generation and use of resources.

        "GDP & Beyond 41 SIGMA 02 10 The Economic and Policy Committee The Economic and Policy Committee (EPC) was set up by a Council decision in 1974 to provide advice and to contribute to the work of the Ecofin Council and the Commission. The core business of the Committee is structured around the following two interacting pillars: \u2022 an economic policy pillar, which essentially refers to the Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs. The Committee plays a critical role in developing analysis and policy consensus on key issues, including responding to globalisation, strength- ening the single market and promoting greater coherence between macro-economic, structural and employment policies; \u2022 a public finance pillar, where the EPC has particular responsibilities regarding quality and sustainability. Given the current economic situation, the EPC\u2019s focus is more than ever on growth and jobs, in particular those reforms supporting competitiveness and adjustment capacity, as well as ensuring the sustainability of public finances. The EPC also monitors progress of the Member States towards meeting the targets and objectives of the Lisbon strategy and the consistency of short-term responses to the current crisis with long-term structural reform objectives. For further information: http://europa.eu/epc/index_en.htm What are the most urgent measures to be taken by Eurostat and the European Statistical System in order to complement the current GDP measure with other dimensions such as well-being and sustainability? For the time being, while taking under serious consideration the new developments (for instance GDP and Beyond) and assessing their viability, a first urgent step, and this relates to my previous answer, would be to make a more efficient use of the statistics already available. As regards the efforts to in- troduce new official statistical requirements, we should take into account the limited resources for collecting the required data and the time required to construct and test these new statistics. However, we can improve our practice now, since some social and environmental statistics exist, but need to be better linked with economic data. Therefore, the first ef- fort should be to assess the use of all available complemen- tary statistics. Has the financial crisis changed your opinion about data needed to correctly analyse and forecast the economy for economic and monetary policy purposes? In my view, the crisis has clearly demonstrated the need for timely, accurate and reliable statistics, indicators and infor- mation in general. In particular, there have been areas where the effort of statistical offices has been insufficient and others where timely and reliable data were simply missing. It is, in addition, crucial that appropriate monitoring and assessment frameworks are in place to provide an early warning of problems arising. The lack of such frameworks was clearly a weakness in the context of the financial and economic crisis. For instance, one area where the efforts of statistical offices and central banks were insufficient was sta- tistics related to financial products and leverage by house- holds. Macro-economic surveillance at European level was excessively biased towards government deficit and debt while not having paid enough attention to fiscal balances and debt of the financial sector and those of households. All this calls for a much more comprehensive approach to sur- veillance and closer monitoring of economic and financial developments both at macro- and micro-levels. This can only be achieved through the availability of robust and reliable statistics and their proper use. In the future, we will probably have to pay more atten- tion to these more basic statistical issues. For assessing our economies and defining the appropriate ways out of the cri- sis, we also need to enhance our monitoring methods and build commonly accepted assessment frameworks. In other words, accurate and reliable statistics are essential, but not sufficient. We need to complement them with a common understanding on how to use these statistics and on how to draw policy conclusions from them. ",

In his daily reports, he relies on the figures released by the European Commission. Sigma asked Mr Strupczewski what data were most useful for him as an analyst of the European economic situation and what his future expectations were, following the publication of the Stiglitz Report recommendations. Jan Strupczewski is the economic correspondent for the Thomson Reuters news agency in Brussels. \u00a9 T h o m s o n R e u t e r s T homson Reuters is one of the largest providers of fi- nancial news worldwide. On a daily basis, the agency supplies thousands of its clients with figures, news analyses and commentaries, thereby shaping the financial policies of some of the world\u2019s largest institutions and busi- nesses. Mr Strupczewski\u2019s articles are followed by both financial market participants, such as traders, brokers, bankers, econ- omists, analysts, investors and fund managers, and the in- ternational news media. This includes the newsrooms of all major European newspapers, as well as television and radio stations. \u2018Government institutions, such as finance ministries, central banks and all sorts of commercial financial institu- tions also subscribe to Reuters news feeds,\u2019 Mr Strupczewski explained. European Commission primary source of data Mr Strupczewski said that the European Commission data released by Eurostat and other Directorates-General cov- ered most of his statistical needs. \u2018I primarily work with the European Commission figures, as they are reliable and harmonised. Sometimes, I will use data from other sources, such as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and De- velopment. However, their methodology often seems to dif- fer from that of the Commission, which makes it difficult for me to use their figures in comparisons,\u2019 he said. For his reporting, Mr Strupczewski uses all of Eurostat\u2019s news releases on Gross Domestic Product (GDP), consumer and producer price inflation, industrial production and new or- ders, unemployment and quarterly employment and labour cost growth, as well as retail and foreign trade. \u2018As a rule, Reuters will report the month-on-month figure as well as the year-on-year one,\u2019 Mr Strupczewski explained. Asked about the importance of the recommendations of the Stiglitz Commission for his work, Mr Strupczewski said that more statistics from new domains which relate directly to the daily lives of European consumers would certainly be welcome. Interesting statistics good for reporters \u2018 Both our readers and the news media are always interested in statistics which touch directly upon people\u2019s daily lives, are ",
        "GDP & Beyond 43 SIGMA 02 10 easily understandable and not too technical. This is the case, for instance, with relative price levels of food and beverages across Europe, already released by Eurostat on a regular ba- sis,\u2019 Mr Strupczewski explained. \u2018Everyone likes to check if a bottle of beer or wine costs more in their country than in a neighbouring one or if they are charged more for a packet of cigarettes than is the EU average.\u2019 Mr Strupczewski continued: \u2018I am not a bank analyst who spends long days in front of a computer screen studying graphs and analysing financial sheets in Excel. I write about problems concerning real people, so more varied data would add a more \u2019juicy\u2019 or interesting angle to my reporting. Natu- rally, I would be delighted if statisticians found a way to re- liably measure so-called well-being, the levels of happiness in a society. In fact, it would expand the statistics regularly released by the Commission\u2019s Directorate-General for Eco- nomic and Financial Affairs in their consumer confidence surveys.\u2019 In the current business and consumer surveys, people are asked to give an assessment of their financial situation, judge whether it has deteriorated or improved as compared with the same period a year earlier and voice their opinion regarding their economic prospects for the future. The surveys enquire about the shopping plans for the next 12 months and the saving habits of the population. Mr Strupczewski said that those statistics reflected a direct link between the confidence of a society and its economic development. \u2018When people are worried about their future, their pensions, their retirement age, they stop spending money. In a time when European economies are haunted by a major economic crisis, consumer confidence is the primary driver for a potential recovery,\u2019 said Mr Strupczewski. \u2018If we could scientifically gauge the mood and the levels of contentment of a society, take into account its quality of life, the environment and education, it would be a major step towards an entirely different way of measuring the success of a Western economy, away from the current focus on GDP. Understandably, this would be extremely interesting for both policymakers and journalists alike,\u2019 Mr Strupczewski concluded. Mr Strupczewski said that more statistics from new domains which relate directly to the daily lives of European consumers would certainly be welcome for his work. He would also be delighted if statisticians found a way to reliably measure so-called well-being, the levels of happiness in a society. \u00a9 P h o v o i r ",

The Organisation\u2019s Statistics Directorate plays a crucial role in this mission, as Martine Durand, OECD\u2019s Chief Statistician and Head of the Statistics Directorate told Sigma in Paris. Martine Durand is the OECD\u2019s Chief Statistician and Head of the Statistics Directorate. \u00a9 O E C D \u2018 The OECD is one of the world\u2019s largest sourc- es of internationally comparable statis- tics, not only collecting and disseminat- ing data, but also offering high-quality analyses and fore- casts,\u2019 said Ms Durand. \u2018Not many people know that we are an extremely decentralised organisation, which in terms of data collection means that individual OECD directorates are at liberty to develop their own indicators. One of the roles of our directorate is to coordinate the work in terms of method- ology, joint processes and quality framework.\u2019 Ms Durand explained that the Statistics Directorate of the OECD is directly responsible for the collection of macro- and micro-data, national accounts and prices, trade statistics and short-term statistics. It also has responsibility for data dis- semination and communication with the media. Young, multi-skilled staff \u2018 Our directorate currently employs around 85 people, whose average age is thirty- something. We have a great variety of ex- perts from different fields and countries, statisticians, economists and social scien- tists,\u2019 said Ms Durand. \u2018The directorate is split into four divisions. The first one deals with national accounts, financial statistics and prices, the second division is in charge of trade, business and globalisation indicators. All IT-related issues and data dissemination are in the competence of the third division.\u2019 \u2018A fourth division has just been created to deal with the challenges posed by the measurement of well-being and progress of societies and to work on households and labour- related data and indicators\u2019 Ms Durand said.

We meet on an almost-weekly basis in numerous joint task forces, work groups, and inter- national meetings and conferences.\u2019 Ms Durand quoted recent joint work in the field of national accounts, trade statistics, the Purchasing Power Parities and the development of the SDMX data-transfer system as just a few areas of close cooperation between her directorate and Eurostat. Ms Durand said that in the past couple of years, the OECD has started to collect data from emerging economies such as Brazil, China, India, Russia, Indonesia and South Africa. She said that this cooperation had proven beneficial to eve- ryone. \u2018We get straight access to their statistics. They, in turn, get our technical expertise. We train their experts, organise international workshops, put together manuals and hand- books,\u2019 she explained. \u2018Although this system greatly enriches our statistical database, it also means a lot of extra work for us under very tight budget constraints.\u2019 Data dissemination Ms Durand explained that main data users include govern- ment officials in OECD member and partner countries, as well as international policymakers, analysts, local adminis- trations, members of the academic community and, increas- ingly, the public. The best way to access OECD statistics is via its comprehen- sive website, which offers a full range of statistical databases in combination with analytical and policy publications. Ms Durand explained: \u2018A collection of tables and extracts from datasets drawn from across the full range of OECD statisti- cal products, the so-called Key Tables, are available free of charge, as are the OECD Facts and Figures. At present, com- plete databases are reserved for OECD member countries and its partners, and are available to others by subscription, but there are continued discussions about free dissemina- tion of all data.\u2019 The OECD is also behind a range of statistical publications, such as the popular \u2019At a Glance\u2026 \u2019 series. \u2018We noted a de- mand for well researched, informative publications which Most of OECD\u2019s data on Europe come from Eurostat, but some also come directly from the national statistical institutes. \u2018Data relating to the non-EU economies are delivered by their statistical offices directly,\u2019 Ms Durand said. \u00a9 P h o v o i r ",
