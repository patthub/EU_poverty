        "The heroines of science Today, women are in the mainstream of science and many of the world\u2019s top scientists are women. In fact, the face of modern science would be unrecognisable without the major contributions made by women, including more than a dozen Nobel laureates, not to mention those pioneers who missed out on the accolades and recognition their work deserved. The legal parity with men that women now enjoy \u2013 and for which they fought for so long \u2013 has empowered them to fulfil more of their potential and enabled society to tap into the talents and abilities of this long-neglected half of society. Despite the gains that have been made, invisible glass ceilings still hinder the progress of bright women. Europe still underutilises women scientists in the research domain, particularly in the so-called \u2018hard sciences\u2019 and in leadership positions, and the scientific community remains male-dominated. This situation cannot be allowed to persist. In principle, women and men are equals and hence deserve equal opportunities. But it is not just about gender equality \u2013 providing women with greater access to the scientific frontiers is good for society and the economy as a whole. Europe is facing numerous economic and social challenges, including increased global competition, recession, climate change and an ageing population. These will require all of its reserves of creativity and innovation to overcome. Introduction ",
        "This book does not claim to list all the women scientists throughout history. The profiled women cover a broad sweep of history \u2013 from Hellenic times right up to the present, although no living scientists have been included in this selection. Through their experiences and eyes, the reader can also trace the progress of female emancipation: from the middle ages, when science and many other fields were almost exclusively the preserve of men, to the 19th century when women began to make major inroads, to more recent decades when women achieved equality \u2013 at least, in principle. The inspirational women featured in this book \u2013 who come from right across Europe: east and west, north and south \u2013 span a broad range of disciplines, from the stargazers of astronomy to the atom gazers of nuclear physics. Their personal struggles for recognition and the sacrifices they made for their science are moving testimonies to human will-power, resourcefulness and perseverance. The stories of these women who came from all backgrounds and walks of life are touching, moving and sometimes tragic. This book provides clear proof that women scientists, even when the odds are stacked against them, are the equal of men. Celebrating the achievements of the women of yesteryear can provide young women today with role models and examples to aspire to in their quest for scientific excellence. ",

        "(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:7) H Y P A T I A O F A L E X A N D R I A A Greek triumph and tragedy Hypatia was born some time between 350 and 370 AD in Alexandria, Egypt, which, with its celebrated library, was the leading Hellenistic centre of learning. She was both the daughter and student of Theon, the last-known mathematician associated with the Museum of Alexandria, which comprised the famous library and a number of independent institutes of learning. Growing up in such learned surroundings was to fuel her lifelong passion for knowledge and free inquiry. \u201cReserve your right to think. For even to think wrong- ly is better than not to think at all,\u201d her father advised her. During her studies, she travelled to other parts of the Roman empire. Love and hate As the first notable female Neo-Platonist philosopher and mathematician, Hypatia was widely admired and respected, both within her native city and beyond \u2013 which gave her considerable political influence. In keeping with her status, she dressed in scholarly robes and moved around town freely in her chariot \u2013 flouting the accepted norms of women\u2019s behaviour at the time. Nevertheless, she was a controversial figure, both for her \u201cpagan\u201d beliefs and probably also her gender. Living during the painful and violent transition from the classical to the Christian era, Hypatia paid for her philosophy dearly, despite the fact that many of her students were Christians. Possibly spurred on by the animos- ity expressed towards Hypatia by the city\u2019s bishop, Cyril of Alexandria, one day in 415 AD, an angry Christian mob set upon her and killed her brutally. Ahead of her time Hypatia\u2019s first teacher was her father, Theon. In addition to tutoring her in mathematics and other branches of philosophy, he devised a rigorous physical training programme for her. She also travelled to Greece and Rome to study. ",

Platonic love of knowledge By around 400 AD, Hypatia had become the head of Alexandria\u2019s Neo-Platonist school, where she taught astronomy, mathematics and philosophy, especially the works of Plato and Aristotle. In fact, so immersed was she in her passion for learn- ing that she, like other ancient Greek scholars, toured the town centre publicly interpreting the works of any philosopher to those who wished to hear her. \u201c[She] made such attainments in literature and science, as to far surpass all the philosophers of her own time,\u201d was the verdict of her contemporary, the Christian historiographer Socrates Scholasticus.

(cid:3)(cid:4) Socrates Scholasticus Scientific achievements Either alone or in collaboration with her father, Hypatia left humanity with a profound scientific legacy. She is credited by some sources with inventing the plane astrolabe, which is an ancient navigating instrument; the graduated brass hydrometer, which was used to determine the relative density of liquids; as well as the hydroscope, a device for looking under water. One of her disciples, Synesius of Cyrene, even credited her with the invention of a water- distilling device. The Alexandrian scholar authored numerous mathematical treatises, most of which were lost when the library of Alexandria was destroyed. She also wrote a number of commentaries, including on the Arithematica by Diophantus of Alexandria, and one On the conics of Apolloniu s, the ancient Greek geometer from Perga. Hypatia edited several of her father\u2019s works, too, including his commentaries on the Roman mathematician Ptolemy\u2019s Almagest , and the Greek mathemat- ician, Euclid of Alexandria\u2019s Elements .

The multifaceted abbess was a physician, philosopher, naturalist, composer, poet, author and linguist. She was a mystic in the medieval tradition. Although she was only ever beatified, she is still referred to as a saint. A medieval visionary Hildegard von Bingen ",
        "(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:8)(cid:11) Divine intervention Hildegard von Bingen was born into a noble German family in 1098. She was the tenth child and was sickly for much of her childhood. Being pious, Hildegard\u2019s parents gave her up to the Church as a tithe when she was eight years old. Although this kind of abandonment seems harsh by modern standards, it was a sign of the times \u2013 her birth coincided with the First Crusade which reached Jerusalem in 1099 \u2013 and it appears to have suited the earnest young child\u2019s disposition. In later life, Hildegard expressed gratitude that she had been given to the Church at a time when \u201cthe religious began to grow sluggish and turn to vacillation\u201d. Like a dream The abbess claimed to have had visions from a very early age, which continued throughout her life. Her role as a conduit for the divine partly explains how she was able to get around the medieval Church\u2019s restrictions on women preaching and getting involved in philosophy and the sciences. In fact, most of Hildegard\u2019s works are presented in the form of visions. In 1141, at the age of 42, she received a vision \u2013 which she believed to be a direct instruc- tion from God \u2013 to \u201cwrite down that which you see and hear\u201d. Second to nun Hildegard rose rapidly through the ranks of the Church. In 1136, she was un- animously elected a magistra (Latin for female \u2018teacher\u2019 or \u2018mistress\u2019) by her fellow nuns and went so far as to convince the Church to take the unusual step of allow- ing her to found two monasteries in 1150 and 1165. The abbess was also an accomplished composer. Still popular today, between 70 and 80 of her musical compositions have survived, which is one of the largest repertoires among medieval composers. One of her works, the Ordo Virtutum (Play of the Virtues) , is an early example of liturgical drama. In addition, Hildegard wrote theological, botanical and medicinal texts, as well as letters and poems, and supervised brilliant miniature illuminations. H I L D E G A R D V O N B I N G E N ",

Hildegard wrote Physica , a text on the natural sciences, as well as the medical treatise Causae et Curae . In both texts, she describes the natural world and displays particular interest in the healing properties of plants, animals, and stones. The Physica is a bulky nine-volume work which mainly deals with the medicinal uses of plants, the elements (earth, water and air but not fire), trees, jewels and precious stones, fish, birds, animals, reptiles and metals. As an example, the entry on the plant Dornella (tormentil) describes it as \u201ccold, and that coldness is good and healthy and useful against fever that arises from bad food\u201d. The five-volume Causae et Curae is also essentially a treatise on medicine, mix- ing Greek and Christian influences. Alongside the far-fetched remedies \u2013 such as dunking a bitch in water and using the water to wipe your forehead as a hangover cure \u2013 there are some that appear quite sensible. These include the rudimentary advice on how to keep your teeth healthy and firm, or the strength- ening of diet for women who fail to menstruate \u2013 which at the time was often caused by malnutrition.

In addition, at a time when women were generally banned from social par- ticipation and interpreting scripture, she communicated with popes, including Eugene III and Anastasius IV; statesmen; German emperors, such as Frederick I Barbarossa; and other notable figures, such as St. Bernard of Clairvaux. Although she was very much a product of her age and entertained some dim views on sex, she was well ahead of her time in her appreciation and rec- ognition of the importance of sexual gratification for women. Despite pre- suambly being a virgin herself, she may well be the first European to de- scribe the female orgasm. ",

        "(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:8)(cid:15) Grey matter in motion Margaret Lucas was the youngest of eight children born to a wealthy fam- ily near Colchester, England. She received a rudimentary education at home from an elderly lady, and showed a very early interest in writing. The close- knit royalist family scattered when King Charles I was exiled to Oxford, and Margaret became maid-of-honour to Queen Henrietta Maria. In 1644, when royalist forces were defeated, she fled to France with the Queen and a few other attendants. In 1645, Margaret met and married the 52-year-old nobleman William Cavendish in France. The two moved from Paris to Antwerp where Margaret was introduced to science in an informal salon society of other exiles dubbed the \u2018Newcastle Circle\u2019. Thomas Hobbes, Ren\u00e9 Descartes, and Pierre Gassendi were part of this circle in which Margaret learned about the newly popular \u2018mechan ical philosophy\u2019 and atomism, which explained all natural phenomena as being matter in motion. At the same time, she was also given private lessons in science and philosophy by her husband and his brother. Margaret visited England in 1651 and quickly gained a reputation for extra- vagant dress and eccentricity. The following year, she began to write her own works on natural philosophy. The Cavendish family returned from exile in 1660 when the monarchy was restored. A most insistent voice On her return to England, Margaret began to study the works of other natural phil osophers (the term \u2018scientist\u2019 had not yet been coined) and continued to write. In 1663, she published Philosophical and Physical Opinions , wherein she reasoned that if atoms were animated matter then they would have free will and liberty, and thus would be unable to co-operate in the creation of complex organisms. The following year, she published another work in which she challenged the ideas ex- pressed by contemporary natural philosophers. She had the two books dispatched by special messenger to the most celebrated scholars of the day. In 1666, Margaret published her Observations upon Natural Philosophy , which strongly criticised the shortcomings of the new science. \u201cThe dusty motion of atoms\u201d could not be used to explain all natural phenomena, she argued, and so M A R G A R E T ( L U C A S ) C A V E N D I S H ",

She also claimed that the newly invented microscope distorted nature and led to false observations of the world. Scientific high society In 1660, the Royal Society of London was founded, inspiring the creation of a network of societies across Europe. Until then, natural philosophers had for the most part discussed their revolutionary ideas on science in people\u2019s homes which, to a certain extent, had allowed some women to learn about the latest debates. As few people generally and still fewer women were educated at the time, the members of these new societies were small in number and mainly composed of men. They distanced themselves from the classical tradition of academic learning, and were often ridiculed for their experiments. Margaret wanted more than anything to be recognised by the scientific commu- nity. In 1667, she enjoyed a personal triumph when she was the first woman to be invited to visit the Royal Society. Her visit was one of the best attended in the Society\u2019s history. She and her entourage watched a programme of experiments staged by the respected scholars Robert Boyle and Robert Hooke. Afterwards, the society officially banned women. The ban held until 1945. A tempered view The year after her famous visit to the Royal Society, Margaret published a book that was more modest in tone and scope than her previous works. In it, she retracted some of her more extravagant claims. ",

She had been proud of her writing and unashamed of her lack of education; she demanded a voice on public matters and sought fame. It is perhaps for these reasons that, in the 19th century, she was given the insulting nickname \u2018Mad Madge\u2019, although she was certainly not considered mad by the standards of her own day. Scientific achievements Lady Margaret Cavendish was a prolific writer who was inspired by the ideas that emerged during the scientific revolution. Despite being mocked, many found reading her works irresistible and she managed to popularise the discussion of many new ways of thinking. The tributes to his wife published by her husband after her death contain letters of gratitude from the Universities of Leiden, Cambridge and Oxford, from the Bodleian Library, St John\u2019s and Trinity Colleges at Cambridge, and from numerous recognised men of learning. She published 23 books, and explained that she wrote \"since all heroic actions\" and \"public employments... are denied our sex in this age\". In addition to her prose, she wrote plays and poems contemplating atomic theory, Aristotelian philosophy and Harvey\u2019s theory of the circulation of the blood. As she was recognised in England as a natural philosopher, her case argued strongly for the education of women. Her memoirs are considered to be the first major secular autobiography written by a woman. ",

        "(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:10)(cid:8) Daughter of Venice Born into Venetian aristocracy, Elena Piscopia shone at an early age. Her birth- place Venice had been a major centre of the Renaissance and Piscopia carried on the tradition started by her male predecessors, such as Leonardo Da Vinci, of being a polymath. Her enlightened father, Giovanni Baptista Cornaro-Piscopia, who held the high office of Procurator of St Mark\u2018s, was to play a pivotal role in cultivating Piscopia\u2019s genius, mainly by providing her with the best learning opportunities available at the time and advocating her cause in the male-dominated corridors of academia. As a child, her proficiency at languages and her multilingualism earned her the honorific title \u2018Oraculum Septilingue\u2019, and from early on, she exhibited extraordinary reasoning powers. The young genius was also a talented musician, mastering the harpsichord, the clavichord, the harp, and the violin. She also composed music. Nun\u2019s habit or doctor\u2019s robes? Before turning 20, her passion for theology and philosophy led her to want to join the Benedictine order, but she only took its habit without ever becoming a nun. Instead, her father persuaded her to go to the University of Padua in 1672, the third oldest university in Italy, which was established in 1222, where she became the first European woman to earn a doctorate. This singular achievement earned her respect and adulation throughout Europe. Passionate about learning and helping the poor, she rejected numerous suitors to focus on these pursuits. In fact, she devoted the last years of her life exclusively to study and charity. She died in 1684 and was buried in the church of Santa Giustina at Padua. A statue of her was erected in the university grounds and the university issued a medal in her honour. Piscopia\u2019s example has inspired generations of women \u2013 and men \u2013 throughout the ages. One recent example of Piscopia\u2019s lasting influence was a book entitled The Lady Cornaro: Pride and Prodigy of Venice , by Jane Howard Guernsey, which was published in 1999. It was the first in-depth study of her life. E L E N A L U C R E Z I A C O R N A R O P I S C O P I A ",

Aged seven, she began her classical education with the study of Latin and Greek, as well as grammar and music, under distinguished instructors. She quickly mastered these two languages, as well as Spanish, French, Arabic and Hebrew. Her later studies included mathematics, philosophy, and theology. At the University of Padua, she excelled and her brilliance became apparent to every- one who encountered her. Given her strong interest in theological matters, she applied and re-applied for a doctorate in theology. Thorny theological questions However, conferring the title of doctor of theology on Piscopia would have granted her the automatic right to preach which went against the church\u2019s accepted position of the time that women had to \u201clearn in silence with all subjection\u201d, according to Timothy I: 11-12. This naturally led to confusion and resistance among the clergy. A compromise was formulated which would present her with \u201ca book closed and open, in order to meditate on and describe the divine mysteries\u201d, instead of \u201ca book closed and open, with the right of interpreting, expounding, glossing, preaching, and opening the divine mysteries\u201d. But this proved insufficient to still the concerns of the clerics and so she was offered the chance to apply for a doctorate in philosophy instead. ",

The young prodigy\u2019s performance amazed and awed her examiners and she breezed through to gain her doctorate, in 1678, at the age of 32. Her professor awarded her the insignia of the doctorate, placing a laurel wreath on her head and placed the Doctor\u2019s Ring on her finger. Piscopia became a member of various academies and societies throughout Europe, and was visited regularly by foreign scholars. Scientific achievements Elena Piscopia\u2019s greatest single scientific achievement was to prove that women could be accomplished academics and polymaths by receiving the first ever doctorate awarded to a woman. The same year she received her doctorate, the young woman became a lecturer in mathematics at the University of Padua.

        "(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:10)(cid:13) Lasting brushstrokes Maria Sibylla Merian, born in 1647 in Frankfurt, was the daughter of Swiss en- graver and publisher Matth\u00e4us Merian the Elder who died when Maria was only three. In 1651, shortly after her natural father\u2019s death, her mother married still-life painter Jacob Marrel who encouraged her to draw and paint. This interest in painting, combined with her fascination with the natural world, led her to create her first images of insects and plants \u2013 from specimens she had captured \u2013 at the age of 13. In 1665, around the age of 18, Maria married Marrel\u2019s apprentice, Johann Andreas Graff, with whom she eventually had two daughters. She and her hus- band moved to Nuremberg in 1667, where she met with her first professional success. In 1681, her stepfather died and the family returned to Frankfurt two years later to handle the estate. Continental shifts After two decades of marriage, Maria, who was then 38, left her husband in 1685 (1692, according to some sources) because of his \u201cshameful vices\u201d, according to contemporary newspaper reports. At that time, divorce and sepa- ration were not as uncommon as we might think. Accompanied by her mother and daughters, she joined the Labadists \u2013 a form of puritanical Protestantism \u2013 commune in Friesland in the Netherlands. During her time there, she developed a fascination for the tropical plants her fellow Labadists brought back from their Surinam plantations. In 1691, she moved to Amsterdam where her fame as a naturalist, artist and expert on insects provided her with access to the tropical collections of influential families which eventually led her to travel to Surinam. In 1715, Maria suffered a stroke and was partially paralysed. The intrepid artist and scientist died in Amsterdam in 1717. A beautiful metamorphosis Like the insects she painted so exquisitely, Maria Merian also underwent an impressive metamorphosis from craftswoman to artist and scientist. Maria, whose education was typical of a guild master\u2019s daughter, trained as an apprentice at home. In addition, being the stepdaughter of a prominent master painter helped hone her skills considerably. \u201cIn my youth, I spent my time investigating insects,\u201d she explained in one of her books, because she noticed that \u201ccaterpillars produced beautiful butterflies or moths\u201d. This sparked in her a fascination bordering on obsession: \u201cI withdrew from human society and engaged exclusively in these investigations.\u201d M A R I A S I B Y L L A M E R I A N ",

She also took on many female students from wealthy families which provided her with access to the finest gardens. Her investigations there led to the publication of her first book in 1675 entitled Neues Blumenbuch (New book of flowers) . With this book, she hoped to cash in on the flower craze sweeping across Europe at the time \u2013 for instance, one tulip bulb could cost about 2 000 Dutch florins (the average an- nual income in 1620 was 150 florins). Her second book on caterpillars and their metamorphosis appeared in 1679. The fascination she developed in the Netherlands for tropical flora and fauna led her to embark on a demanding expedition to Surinam in 1699, where she ob- served and painted the local animals and plants, described their local uses and even gave them their native names. However, the state of affairs that prevailed in the Dutch colony distressed her. She noted that the settlers \u201cmock me because I am interested in something other than sugar\u201d, and expressed horror at the plight of slaves. She wrote that they used a local plant to induce abortion \u201cso that their children will not become slaves like they are\u201d. Malaria forced her to return to the Netherlands in 1701. Four years later, she published her seminal work Metamorphosis Insectorum Surinamensium about the insects of Surinam. ",

(cid:3) M A R I A S I B Y L L A M E R I A N Scientific achievements In early modern science, women often worked as observers and illustrators, so Maria Merian\u2019s training in the arts and crafts proved to be her passport into the world of science. Her painstaking observation skills were to prove handy in counteracting the general belief at the time in the Aristotelian idea that insects came from a \u201cspontaneous generation of rotting mud\u201d. During her career, Maria described the life cycles of 186 insect spe- cies. Through her thorough empirical research, she helped put the study of insects \u2013 entomology \u2013 on to a more scientific footing. Her works, which were published in German as opposed to Latin, helped raise awareness of metamorphosis among ordinary people (albeit high society), but were shunned by many scientists because she did not use Latin, the language of learning at the time. So popular were her three books that 19 editions appeared between 1665 and 1771. Russia\u2019s Tsar Peter I, a great admirer of her work, hung a portrait of Maria in his study. The celebrated German writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe marvelled at how her paintings combined both art and science. In recent years, Maria has been rediscovered and recognised. Prior to the intro- duction of the euro, her portrait adorned the 500 Deutschmark note. Her portrait has also appeared on stamps and many schools are named after her. In 2005, a modern research vessel bearing her name was launched in Germany. ",

As \u201cassistant\u201d to her husband and later to her son, she contributed to establishing the Berlin Academy of Science as a major centre of astronomy. Maria Margarethe Winkelmann-Kirch ",
        "(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:10)(cid:7) Star-struck lover Maria Margarethe Winkelmann was born in Leipzig, in the German state of Lower Saxony. Her father, a Lutheran minister, believed in education for women and began teaching her from an early age. When her father died, her uncle continued to teach her. She showed an early interest in astronomy. To pursue this interest, Maria became the student, apprentice and assistant of Christopher Arnold, a self-taught astronomer who worked as a farmer \u2013 eventually moving in with him and his family. Married to the stars Through Arnold, Maria met one of the most famous German astronomers of the time, Gottfried Kirch. Despite a three-decade age gap, they married in 1692, and embarked on a joint career in astronomy. In 1700, at the foundation of the Berlin Academy of Science, he was appointed the Academy\u2019s astronomer where she would serve as his unofficial but appreciated assistant. Their marriage also produced four children, all of whom followed in their parents\u2018 footsteps and studied astronomy. Both during her husband\u2019s life and after he died, Maria devoted herself to the pursuit of astronomy. While she was rewarded with a certain measure of fame and respect, including an offer of work from the Russian Tsar Peter the Great, she paid a heavy price in terms of adversity, ridicule and even periods of poverty. Master in an apprentice\u2019s garb Despite the fact that her gender excluded her from studying at university, many astronomers of the age were not university educated, and most of the actual practice of the discipline took place outside these formal institutions. In fact, astronomy at that time was structured more along the lines of traditional guilds than the professional academic discipline we know it as today. This is reflected in the fact that neither Christopher Arnold nor Gottfried Kirch had ever studied at a university. Following their marriage, Kirch took over where Arnold had left off and continued Maria\u2019s instruction \u2013 but the apprentice soon became at least the equal of the master. The sky\u2019s the limit At the Berlin Academy of Science, Maria and Gottfried worked closely together, though only he held the official position of astronomer. In Berlin, Maria was in the habit of observing the heavens every evening from 9pm. Often she and her M A R I A M A R G A R E T H E W I N K E L M A N N - K I R C H ",

Using their observations of the night skies, they performed calculations to produce calendars and almanacs, with information on the phases of the moon, the setting of the sun, eclipses, and the position of the sun and other planets. This was a real money-spinner for the Academy, which derived much of its income from the royal monopoly granted it on the sale of calendars, which was a lucrative trade. This meant that astronomers, despite lacking the highbrow prestige of other scholars, were a valuable asset. Starting in 1697, the couple also began recording weather information. The couple also struggled to improve the Academy\u2019s astronomical facilities. The active role Maria played in this being is testified to in letters to the Academy\u2019s president Gottfried von Leibniz. Tail of a comet In 1702, Maria became the first woman to discover a previously unknown comet, \u2018Comet of 1702\u2019 (C/1702 H1). However, the comet\u2019s discovery was published by Gottfried, who did not credit Maria in his tract, probably because he feared that as the Academy\u2019s official astronomer he could not acknowledge his wife\u2019s contributions openly. In any event, Gottfried made up for this, in 1710, by revealing the true discoverer of the comet as \u2018my wife\u2019, but it was not renamed. Despite this major oversight, Maria\u2019s skill and accomplishments were widely recognised \u2013 albeit informally. In a 1709 letter of introduction to the Prussian court, where she was to give a talk on sunspots, the Academy\u2019s president Leibniz, a great admirer of her work, wrote: \u201cHer achievement is not in literature or rhetoric but in the most profound doctrine of astronomy\u2026 I do not believe that this woman easily finds her equal in the science in which she excels.\u201d Maria Margarethe Winkelmann-Kirch The eclipse of a star astronomer ",

Her request for her son to be appointed astronomer and she only his assistant was turned down by the Academy, which did not wish to set a precedent and feared ridicule from other institutions. Leibniz was the lone voice defending her. She spent the following 18 months petitioning the royal court for the position, and received a final rejection in 1712. Expressing her disappointment, she said: \u201cNow I go through a severe desert, and because\u2026 water is scarce\u2026 the taste is bitter.\u201d It was about this time that she wrote in the preface to one of her publications that a woman could become \u201cas skilled as a man at observing and understanding the skies\u201d. Written in the tsars The position would not just have been an honour, but it would have helped support her four children who were now left without a breadwinner. Unemployed and unappreciated, Maria went to work until 1714 at the private observatory of family friend and keen amateur astronomer Baron Bernhard Frederick von Krosigk. In 1716, she received an offer to work for Russian tsar, Peter the Great, but preferred to remain in Berlin where she continued to calculate calendars. Ironically, her son, Christfried, did eventually become director of the Academy\u2019s observatory and took his mother and sisters in as his assistants. But the high profile Maria kept led the Academy\u2019s council to force her to leave. She continued to work in private but conditions eventually forced her to abandon astronomy. Scientific achievements Maria Winkelmann-Kirch was not only one of the foremost and best-known astronomers of her age, but she was also the first woman to discover a comet. Despite the disappointments she experienced during her career in the shadows, her publications brought her some recognition during her lifetime and were an enduring contribution to astronomy. They included her observations on the Aurora Borealis (1707), a pamphlet on the conjunction of the sun with Saturn and Venus (1709), and a well-received pamphlet in which she predicted a new comet (1711). // Coloured engraving of Isaac Newton\u2018s reflecting telescope // Maria became the first woman to discover a previously unknown comet (cid:2) I do not believe that this woman easily finds her equal in the science in which she excels.

However, one woman not only illuminated the Enlightenment through her writings, but also made her own lasting contributions to the quest for reason and science.

Later known simply as \u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet, she was the daughter of Louis Nicolas le Tonnelier de Breteuil, King Louis XIV\u2019s principal secretary. Her father\u2019s position gave the family some standing and provided \u00c9milie with access to France\u2019s aristocratic and intellectual elites early in life. Recognising \u00c9milie\u2019s brilliance from a young age, her father \u2013 unusually for the times \u2013 arranged training for her from early childhood in physical activities, such as fencing and riding. As she grew older, he brought tutors to the house who educated her in mathematics, literature and science. In addition, Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle, who wrote popular text books on astronomy which took the form of a conversation between a teacher and a (female) student, schooled her in astronomy when she was ten. \u00c9milie\u2019s mother, Gabrielle-Anne de Froulay, who was brought up and educated in a convent, did not approve of her daughter\u2019s intellectual pursuits, but the invest- ment paid off. By the time she was 12, \u00c9milie was fluent in Greek, Latin, Italian and German. She was not just an intellectual but also a \u2018party animal\u2019. She liked to dance, could play the harpsichord, sang opera, was an amateur actress and a \u2018calculated gambler\u2019. Traditional husbands, enlightened lovers Despite her unconventional mind and lifestyle, \u00c9milie settled for a convention- al aristocratic marriage. In 1725, she married the Marquis Florent-Claude du Chastellet (or Ch\u00e2telet). After the birth of their two sons and daughter, \u00c9milie and her husband made an agreement \u2013 common among the French aristocracy at the time \u2013 to live separate lives, including taking lovers, while still maintaining one household. At the age of 25, in 1730, \u00c9milie kicked off her affairs with the Duc de Richelieu (grand-nephew of the famous cardinal of the same name) who was drawn by Du Ch\u00e2telet\u2019s passion for literature and philosophy. But her most well-known lover was the fourth, in an affair which began in 1733. It was with Voltaire, the famous Enlightenment writer, who used to frequent her father\u2019s salons when she was younger. \u00c9milie sheltered Voltaire, who was being pursued by the authorities for his controversial political views, in her country estate. For 15 years, the couple lived together in a passionate meeting of minds and hearts.

During \u00c9milie\u2019s last love affair she fell pregnant and puerpural fevers led to the death of her and her newborn days after the birth, in 1749. She was just 42. The nature of intellectual light Due to the constraints imposed on women by French society at the time, \u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet was unable to follow a similar education to her male counterparts. However, her genius, resourcefulness, voracious appetite for knowledge acquisi- tion, and her father\u2019s early enlightened assistance helped her to overcome these challenges. \u00c9milie considered her marital responsibilities fulfilled once her third child was born. Thereafter, she dedicated herself to the pursuit of knowledge and romance. In 1737, she published a paper on the nature of fire in which she described what we call today infrared radiation, as well as reflecting on the nature of light. In 1738, she and Voltaire published their successful joint work, Elements of Newton\u2018s philosophy . Their co-operation led Voltaire to recognise \u00c9milie\u2019s supe- rior intellect, especially when it came to physics. A decade after the book was published, he confided: \u201cI used to teach myself with you, but now you have flown up where I can no longer follow.\u201d Energetic works Two years later, in 1740, she published Institutions de physique (Lessons in phys- ics).

She showed that the energy of a moving object is proportional not to its velocity, as had previ- ously been believed, but to the square of its velocity. The final year of her life coincided with the completion of what is widely re- garded as her opus magnum : her translation into French and commentary on Newton\u2019s Principia Mathematica . She even managed to extrapolate from Newton\u2019s principles of mechanics the notion of the conservation of energy. Scientific achievements \u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet can rightly be re- garded as one of the principal illumi- nators of the Enlightenment. Her works helped disseminate the new physics, mathematics and general philosophy of the age. In addition, she made some significant discoveries and developed a number of important concepts in her own right, such as infrared radiation and energy conservation. Despite the admiration and esteem she was held in by major intellectual figures of the time, her gender elicited ridicule among otherwise enlight- ened men. The German philosopher Immanuel Kant admired her intellect, yet saw fit to comment that a woman \u201cwho conducts learned controversies on mechanics like the Marquise du Ch\u00e2telet might as well have a beard\u201d. For her part, \u00c9milie urged the world to \u201cjudge me for my merits\u201d, and not her sex. In wider society, it was not just the fact that she was a woman that was the subject of controversy \u2013 the Enlightenment ideas she propagated, including Newtonian natural philosophy, were still regarded as philosophical heresies in many quarters.

In 1732, another Italian woman, Laura Maria Caterina Bassi (1711-1778), became the second to be awarded a doctorate and went on to be the first woman to teach in a European university.

        "(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:11)(cid:15) A recognisable talent Born in Bologna on 31 October 1711, Laura Maria Caterina Bassi was the only one of her parent\u2019s children to survive into adulthood. The family was a wealthy one and Bassi\u2019s lawyer father paid for his daughter to be privately educated. Between the ages of 13 and 20, Bassi was tutored by Gaetano Tacconi, the family\u2019s physician and a professor at the University of Bologna, who taught her philosophy and metaphysics. Tacconi recognised her prodigious talent and de- cided to promote it in Bologna\u2019s academic circles. Bassi quickly came to be noticed by Cardinal Prospero Lambertini (later Pope Benedict XIV) who had returned to the city of his birth in 1731 as Archbishop of Bologna. The Cardinal, who had himself studied science in his youth, encour- aged Bassi in her scientific work and became her most influential patron. In 1732, Lambertini persuaded Bassi to participate in public debates and cast her in the role of symbol for the scientific and cultural regeneration of the city. The first female professor At the age of only 20, Bassi was given a teaching position at the University of Bologna, the oldest university in Europe. This was a radical step as it made her the first woman to officially teach at a European university. Her doctorate, only the second ever awarded to a woman, was conferred on her at a lavish public ceremony, at which she was also presented with an ermine cape, a jewel- encrusted silver crown of laurels and a ring. A commemorative medal was struck in her honour. Despite this public veneration and her appointment to a chair of philosophy two years later, Bassi\u2019s teaching opportunities were few at this stage in her career. It was deemed improper for her to teach a room full of male students and so she gave only occasional lec- tures at public events to which women were invited. Electric marriage In 1738, Bassi married her fellow scientist Giuseppe Veratti and the couple went on to have at least eight children, five of whom survived into adulthood. The marriage meant that Bassi could now lecture regularly in her home as she wished. With the help of her powerful patrons, she was able to persuade the university to give her more responsibility and a higher salary so that she could purchase her own equipment. This enabled her to furnish a laboratory in her home, where Bassi and her husband collaborated on experiments to study elec- tricity. By 1760, her salary of 1 200 lire was higher than that of any other science professor at the university. L A U R A M A R I A C A T E R I N A B A S S I ",

Her correspondents included the French philosopher Voltaire and during 1744-5 she helped him to become a member of the Bologna Academy of Science. At around the same time, Pope Benedict XIV established an elite group of 25 scholars, known as the Benedettini (the Benedictines, named after the Pope). Bassi lobbied fervently to be appointed a member of the group, whose members greeted this with mixed reactions. Eventually, her efforts paid off and the Pope admitted her. This not only supplemented her income, but expanded her oppor- tunities for collaboration and to share her work: from 1746 until two years before her death, Bassi gave annual presentations to the Benedictine academy. During the second half of her life, Bassi was renowned in scientific circles for her ability to teach experimental physics and for her work in areas including mechanics, hydrometry, elasticity and other properties of gases. She also con- tinued to contribute to debates on electricity. In 1776, at the age of 65, Bassi was appointed to the chair in experimental physics by the Institute of Sciences, with her husband as her official teaching assistant. She died two years later, on 20 February 1778, bringing to a close a lifelong career in physics which was groundbreaking for women in academia.

Her main interest was in the work of the English physicist and mathematician Isaac Newton and she was one of the first scholars to teach Newtonian natural philosophy in Italy. This world-view holds that the forces of nature obey natural laws that can be quantified, predicted and, at times, controlled, as opposed to the view that nature is subject to supernatural forces. Bassi taught courses on Newtonian physics for 28 years, a pursuit which made her a key figure in intro- ducing Newton\u2019s ideas of physics and natural philosophy to Italy. Throughout her career, Bassi conducted research in a variety of scientific fields. She published 28 papers in all, the vast majority of which were on physics and hydraulics. Whilst none of her scientific works brought significant new advances, her career was important for the positions and respect she attained. As Gabriella Berti Logan wrote in the American Historical Review , \u201cWhat made Bassi unique was that she made use of rewards, that would normally have remained symbolic, to carve out a position for herself in the scientific community of her town and to contribute to its intellectual life through her research and teaching.\u201d L A U R A M A R I A C A T E R I N A B A S S I ",

But her father had other ideas for her and encouraged the development of her skills as a linguist, mathematician and philosopher.

As she grew up, Agnesi was to play the combined role of housekeeper and tutor to her brothers and sisters and Pietro depended upon her steadying influence. The family was a wealthy one, having made its fortune in the silk trade, and Pietro was able to provide tutors of the highest calibre \u2013 young men of learning from the church \u2013 for Maria Gaetana and her siblings. Agnesi excelled as a linguist from a young age; at only nine years old she published a translation into Latin of an elaborate discourse defending the right of women to access higher education and, by the age of 13, she had also mas- tered Greek, Hebrew, French, Spanish and German. Neither ugly nor pretty When Agnesi was around 15 years old, her father began to host gatherings in their home of the most learned men of the day. Although naturally reticent, Agnesi addressed these audiences, expounding on difficult philosophical ques- tions. These meetings were recorded by the French writer, Charles de Brosses, in his Lettres sur l\u2019Italie , describing Agnesi as \u201ca girl of about 20 years of age, neither ugly nor pretty, with a very simple and sweet manner\u201d. He went on to state that she expressed a particular interest in the work of Isaac Newton, but that she did not enjoy public discussion of this nature, \u201cwhere for every one that was amused, 20 were bored to death\u201d. At about this time, Agnesi made it clear to her horrified father that she wished to enter a convent. He refused and begged her to stay at home. She eventually agreed to continue living in his house and care for him on three conditions: that she be allowed to go to church whenever she wished, that she could dress sim- ply and humbly, and that she no longer had to attend balls, theatres and other \u201cprofane amusements\u201d. A publishing success Although Agnesi\u2019s wish to join a convent was not granted, from the age of 20 she began to live as if it had been. She shut herself away, avoiding society and devoting herself entirely to the study of mathematics and religious books. ",

He encouraged Agnesi to write a book on differential calculus. She was enthusiastic about the idea and thought that such a work could be used as a textbook by her younger siblings. However, the resulting work would develop into much more. Instituzioni analitiche ad uso della giovent\u00f9 italiana was published in Milan in 1748; it went on to be translated into French and English and brought Agnesi widespread fame. Papal recognition In 1750, Pope Benedict XIV read Agnesi\u2019s work and was prompted to write to its author, say- ing that such a work would bring credit to Italy. Soon after this, the Pope went further, appoint- ing her to the position of honorary reader at the University of Bologna. It is likely that Agnesi neither accepted nor rejected this offer \u2013 her name was added to the statutes of the uni- versity and remained there for 45 years, but it is thought that she never visited the city, or university, of Bologna.

Agnesi became the director of the Hospice Trivulzio and was able to devote herself to the study of theology and to charitable acts. Later, she would achieve her dream of joining the sisterhood of the \u2018Azure\u2019 nuns.

The work is considered to be the first book to discuss both differential and integral calculus. It gave a clear summary of the state of knowledge at the time in mathematical analysis, bringing together examples from the works of a number of mathematicians in a systematic manner with Agnesi\u2019s own analysis. Agnesi\u2019s work gained popularity for its clarity of style and it was translated into French (1778) and English (1810). In the book, she discussed the cubic curve that has come to be known as the \u201cwitch of Agnesi\u201d. Although this curve had been discussed before her time, it bears her name to this day, albeit, as a result of a mistake in the English translation, with this rather curious title. ",

His wife, Anna Ilse, had other ideas for their two daughters and wanted Caroline to become a seamstress and to look after the family home. Despite con- tracting typhus at the age of ten, which permanently stunted her growth, Caroline managed to combine her musical studies with carrying out her domestic chores. Five years after her father\u2019s death in 1767, the opportunity to escape house- hold drudgery came with an invitation from her elder brother Friedrich Wilhelm (known as William in England) to join him in Bath, where he was installed as an organist and conductor. Although nominally there as his housekeeper, Caroline began to appear in her brother\u2019s concerts as a soloist and she soon became first singer, receiving offers to perform in other cities. Had she not become fascinated by her brother\u2019s hobby of astronomy, it is probable that Caroline would have gone on to an impressive musical career. Surveying the skies Alongside his successes in the music profession, William Herschel was fas- cinated by the observation of the night sky and produced reflecting telescopes to allow him to see deep into the solar system. Caroline began to help him in this work, grinding and polishing the mirrors, a task requiring absolute accuracy. At the same time, she set about studying astronomical theory, mastering the algebra and formulae required for calculation and conversion as a basis for observing the stars and measuring astronomical distances. Royal recognition In 1781, William discovered the planet Uranus, crediting Caroline for her help. That same year, he was appointed \u2018The King\u2019s Astronomer\u2019 at the royal court in Windsor.

Caroline spent the daytime evaluating the nocturnal notes and recalcu- lating them, before starting on a catalogue of star clusters and nebular patches. When she had time, Caroline worked on her own astronomical research. In 1783, she found three new nebulae (hazy clouds where stars form), and be- tween 1786 and 1797 discovered eight comets, including one which now bears her name \u2013 35P/Herschel-Rigollet. In recognition of her efforts, Caroline was given a salary of 50 pounds, making her the first woman in England with a paid government appointment. A catalogue of success In 1788, William married a wealthy widow, Mary Pitt, with whom he had one child, John. At first, Caroline was cool towards the newly-weds, moving out of her brother\u2019s home, but she later warmed to her sister-in-law and became very close to her nephew, who would himself become a prominent astronomer and mathematician. William\u2019s marriage meant he spent less time in the observatory, but Caroline con- tinued to devote herself to astronomical study. Her work included the updating and reorganisation of a catalogue of stars compiled by John Flamsteed earlier in the 18 th century. Her revised directory was published by the Royal Society in 1798. In later life, Caroline also collaborated with her nephew on a catalogue of nebulae. ",

Her achievements included the discovery of comets and nebulae, and she is credited with helping her brother William to identify Uranus as a planet. Caroline\u2019s activities in catalogu- ing the features of the night sky left a lasting legacy for anyone interested in the subject. Her remarkable work brought her numerous accolades, both during her life and posthumously. In 1828, she was awarded the gold medal of the Royal Astronomical Society and, seven years later, Caroline Herschel and Mary Somerville were made the first female members of the Society. Herschel was also appointed a member of the Royal Irish Academy of Sciences and, on her 96 th birthday, the King of Prussia awarded her the gold medal of the Prussian Academy of Sciences. Even after her death, Caroline was remembered with the naming of astronomical features in her honour.

Following the storming of the Bastille in July 1789, in order to avoid the mayhem engulfing the streets of Paris, Sophie was forbidden from leaving the house. Escaping the boredom of being housebound, she delved into her father\u2019s extensive library. Her interest in mathematics was piqued upon reading the tale of how the Ancient Greek mathematician Archimedes was killed whilst engrossed in a geometric co- nundrum during the Roman invasion of Syracuse. A subject that could so distract someone must be truly fascinating, Germain thought, and she decided to devote herself to the study of mathematics. Studying under the covers Alongside her mathematical enquiries, Germain also taught herself Latin and Greek so that she could read classical texts on the subject. Germain\u2019s par- ents were disapproving of their daughter\u2019s new-found interest so, to avoid their censure, she began to study at night. Upon discovering this, her parents did everything they could think of to stop it: removing her candles, forbidding fires at night, even taking away her clothes. However, nothing could deter the young mathematician, who found ways to continue her nocturnal learning, such as smuggling in candles and wrapping herself in her bedclothes. Eventually, her parents gave in to their daughter\u2019s obvious determination. Germain never married and continued to live in the family home, supported financially by her father, throughout her career. The mysterious Monsieur le Blanc Having exhausted the mathematical knowledge in her father\u2019s collection of books, Germain craved ways of furthering her education. The problem was that, in 18 th century France, women were not normally accepted by universities, includ- ing the famous \u00c9cole Polytechnique, founded in 1894 to educate middle-class boys in \u2018practical\u2019 knowledge, such as natural sciences and engineering.

Under the name of M. le Blanc, she was able to get hold of the lecture notes of the mathematician Joseph-Louis Lagrange and began to send comments to the professors, including her own original notes on mathematical problems. Lagrange was so amazed by the re- markable observations of this M. le Blanc that he requested to meet with \u201chim\u201d. Germain was thus forced to reveal her true identity. Lagrange was astonished, but impressed, and went on to become her mentor and friend. Quite extraordinary talents Fascinated by number theory, Germain had also begun to correspond with the German Carl Friedrich Gauss, the greatest mathematician of the day. She put to him her novel approach to finding a proof for Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem, which had troubled mathematicians for more than a century. Although Germain\u2019s proposal did not lead to a definitive solution to the problem, it was the greatest break- through made on the subject until the 1960s. Gauss, of course, believed that the idea had been that of M. le Blanc and it might have gone done in history as such, had it not been for the Napoleonic Wars.

Gauss was understandably confused, having never heard of Germain, but in her next letter she reluctantly revealed her identity. Gauss was delighted, saying that to overcome the difficulties of being a woman \u201cshe must have the noblest courage, quite extraordinary talents and superior genius\u201d. Good vibrations The correspondence between Gauss and Germain ended abruptly in 1808 when he became a Professor of Astronomy and turned his interests away from number theory. Germain too changed her field of study to focus on physics, becoming particularly interested in so-called Chladni figures \u2013 the patterns pro- duced by vibrations of elastic surfaces. In 1811, the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences launched a competition on the mathemati- cal law underlying Chladni\u2019s study on vibrations of elastic surfaces. By the dead- line in 1813, Germain\u2019s was the only paper to have been entered. The judges found errors and it was clear that the paper\u2019s author lacked a formal scientific ed- ucation, so they extended the closing date. With the help of Lagrange, Germain reworked her thesis and was finally awarded the prize on 8 January 1816. The prize catapulted Germain into the ranks of the day\u2019s prominent mathemati- cians and she continued to work on the elasticity theory. The Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences allowed her to be the first woman not related to a member to attend its sessions, and she was praised by the Acad\u00e9mie\u2019s over-arching body, the Institut de France, whose members invited her to their meetings. Scientific achievements Germain is best remembered for her advances in number theory, particularly the progress she made on finding a proof for Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem. Her work on Chladni numbers laid the foundations for the applied mathematics used today in the construction of tall buildings, and which proved important at the time in the new field of mathematical physics, especially the study of acoustics and elasticity. Once her true identity had been revealed, Germain found acceptance in the scientific community and was granted access to the world of academia that no French woman had previously achieved. Shortly before her death in 1831, Gauss (with whom she had regained contact) convinced the University of G\u00f6ttingen to award Germain an honorary degree. Sadly, she died before she could accept it. n 4 + 4 m 4 = ( n 2 + 2 m 2 + 2 mn ) ( n 2 + 2 m 2 - 2 mn ) ",

Mary\u2019s father, later Vice-Admiral Sir William George Fairfax, was away at sea at the time, as he would be for much of her childhood. With an absent father and a mother whose only demands were that she learnt to read the Bible and say her prayers, Mary was, in her own words, \u201callowed to grow up a wild creature\u201d. As was often the case for girls in the 18 th century, Mary\u2019s education was hap- hazard and limited. Her only formal schooling was a year at a boarding school for girls in Musselburgh, near Edinburgh, during which she was deeply unhappy. Mary first studied arithmetic at the age of 13 and came across algebra, by ac- cident, when reading an article in a women\u2019s magazine. She persuaded her brother\u2019s tutor to purchase some literature on the subject for her, enabling her to develop her interest further. Two weddings and a funeral In 1804, Mary married her cousin, Captain Samuel Greig, the Russian consul in London. Greig had no interest in mathematics or science and held intel- lectual women in low regard, but he did not interfere with his wife\u2019s study. The couple had two sons, Woronzow and William George, before Samuel\u2019s death in 1807. Widowhood and a sizeable inheritance offered Mary independence, allowing her to study as she wished. She achieved a solid grounding in mathematics and began to take an interest in astronomy. In 1812, Mary remarried. Her second hus- band, Dr William Somerville, was inspector of the Army Medical Board. Being a scientist himself, he was actively supportive of his wife\u2019s endeavours, serving as her secretary and editor, as well as introducing her to fellow scientists. Their so- cial circle in London included such prominent scholars as Charles Babbage and the Herschel family. Mary and William went on to have four children together.

She was born on 25 September 1794, at a time when France had been ravaged by revolution and Robespierre\u2019s Reign of Terror was sending thousands to the guillotine. However, growing up deep in the countryside, Jeanne had a quiet childhood. Her education was basic, learning little more than how to read and write. Dressing for success Jeanne left home at the age of 18 and went to Paris on foot, covering a distance of over 400 kilometres. Once in the French capital, she became the assistant of a society dressmaker. From this lowly position, Jeanne went on to find fame when she created the wedding outfit for the future Duchesse de Berry, a Sicilian princess who married the nephew of the French king in 1816. It was through this commission that Jeanne met a rich English nobleman and merchant named James Power. The couple were married in 1818 in Messina, Sicily, and went on to live on the island for more than 20 years. A place by the sea Soon after her marriage, Jeanne began to take an interest in natural history. Entirely self-taught, she travelled around Sicily recording and describing its flora and fauna, collecting specimens of minerals, fossils, butterflies and shells. Jeanne was fascinated by living things, however, and was not content to look at dead samples. Drawn particularly to aquatic creatures, she sought ways to view them more closely. Jeanne and the Argonauts Jeanne focused her studies on molluscs and her work on the pelagic octopus Argonauta argo , or greater Argonaut, brought her widespread renown. She was the first person to discover how the creature makes a sort of shell casing around itself and how it reproduces.

In 1995, the Historical Society of Messina republished the work for the enjoyment of a modern audience. As well as describing the nature of the island, Jeanne made some suggestions for preserving it.

Born into English nobility, she was the only legitimate daughter of the legendary Romantic poet Lord Byron, although she never knew her \u201cmad, bad and dangerous to know\u201d father, who moved to mainland Europe a few months after she was born, where he died in 1824. Her mother, Anne Isabella Milbanke, was keen to ensure that her daughter did not turn out to be like her erratic, absent father. She introduced Ada to mathemat- ics at an early age as a means of rooting out the insanity of which she accused Lord Byron. Ada\u2019s life was to prove to be a struggle between emotion and reason, poetics and mathematics, ill health and bursts of energy. This complex interplay manifested itself as early as 1828, when Ada mixed romanticism with science to produce a design for a flying machine. Numerical advantage Despite her passion for mathematics and obscure learning, Ada was a \u201cdainty\u201d socialite. At court, she danced often and was able to charm many people, including Charles Babbage, the inventor of the programmable computer, who called her the \u201cenchantress of numbers\u201d. In 1835, she married William King, the Earl of Lovelace, with whom she had three children. ` Throughout her childhood and beyond, Ada suffered from poor health. For in- stance, in 1829, a bout of measles left her paralysed for months. Interestingly, Ada herself interpreted her illnesses as a prerequisite for her mathematical powers. To some extent, she even viewed her own body as a \u2018molecular labora- tory\u2019 that produced a \u2018calculus of the nervous system\u2019. In part, this may have been a reaction to the paradox of the woman scientist. She died in 1852 of uterine cancer and, in an interesting parallel with her father (next to whom she is buried), it is blood letting by surgeons, in combination with a mixture of opium, wine, chloroform and cannabis, which is believed to have killed her. The world\u2019s first software guru In the early 19 th century, science was not yet a profession and was regarded largely as a \u201cgentlemanly\u201d pursuit. Although Ada Lovelace was not a \u201cgentleman\u201d, her access to elite London society served her well. One of her acquaintances ",

This marked the start of a long and valuable friendship and scientific partner- ship. In 1822, Babbage had proposed what he called the Difference Engine, a rudimentary, mechanical calculator. The British government initially financed the project, but withdrew funding when Babbage repeatedly asked for more money while making no apparent progress on building the machine. By 1837, Babbage\u2019s thinking had evolved towards a more general purpose computer called the Analytical Engine which was also to become the victim of a lack of political will. Digital dreams Ada was one of the few people who understood Babbage\u2019s idea and de- veloped an incredibly prescient vision of its potential. In a bid to galvanise support for the Analytical Engine, Ada worked furiously for nine months between 1842 and 1843 translating and commenting on Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea\u2019s memoir on the machine. In fact, her notes were longer than the memoir. In them, she explained the differ- ence between the Difference Engine, which required a human operator to set the initial values that had been computed and set into columns, and the Analytical Engine which used \u201coperation cards\u201d to perform mathematical operations on numerical data as well as to respond to symbols representing data. She also outlined a detailed method for calculating Bernoulli numbers with the Engine, which is now recognised as the world\u2018s first computer program. ",

She not only demonstrated the Analytical Engine\u2019s mathematical potential, but also foresaw the capability of computers to go beyond mere calculation at a time when most experts, including Babbage himself, focused only on these number-crunching capacities.

Like all of her siblings, she was educated at home by her mother, Sarah, an intelligent woman and artist who took the education of her children very seriously. Eleanor helped her brothers in their scientific explorations, which gave her experi- ence of using a microscope and introduced her to the basics of anatomy and classification. She spent a lot of time exploring both the family library and the grounds of their 800-acre estate. She loved to look at flowers, study insects and write. However, her father did not approve and insisted that she keep her \u201chobby\u201d to herself. Once, someone gave her six of the pond\u2018s grubs in a glass of water. She watched while five of the grubs destroyed the sixth, and told her family about it. They did not understand her fascination, but the event marked the beginning of Eleanor\u2018s lifelong passion for entomology. Collecting on the family farm Eleanor began to study entomology seriously in 1852, and for 16 years col- lected and studied privately. But when the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) invited the public to contribute to its collection of insect pests in 1868, Eleanor responded immediately. She collected specimens from all over the estate, with the help of her family\u2018s farm labourers and the local children. Her contributions to the project were substantial and, in 1872, she was awarded the Society\u2019s Flora medal. During the same period that Eleanor was collecting for the RHS, she had also been given the responsibility of running the family\u2018s estate. This was an essen- tial part of her education, as it gave her an opportunity to learn, not only about insects and agriculture, but about the needs of farmers and landowners. A new beginning In 1873, Eleanor\u2018s father died, leaving the estate to one of his sons. The fam- ily went their separate ways and Eleanor settled at St Albans with her sister Georgiana. As soon as the two were established in their new home, Eleanor began to pursue her career openly, publishing her first article that year. ",

The house sparrows must go In 1885, Eleanor wrote to The Times calling for the extermination of the house sparrow, which devours seeds and drives off insect-eating birds. While agricul- turalists appreciated her remarks, she became very unpopular among the more urban, sparrow-loving set. Four years later she was devastated by the death of Georgiana. But she kept working and in 1900 the University of Edinburgh awarded her an honorary Doctorate of Laws. In 1901, she received the Victoria Medal of Honour in Horticulture from the RHS.

Her father participated in the roy- alist uprising of 1832, after which the family was exiled to Switzerland. When Cl\u00e9mence was ten years old, she was sent to a convent school where she experienced severe psychological strain and was forced to leave. After that, she was largely responsible for her own education, although her father helped her with mathematics. In 1849, he died and Cl\u00e9mence looked for a teaching job. She prepared her- self to teach music, French and maths and, in 1853, went to Wales to teach at a girls\u2018 boarding school. There, she learned English and was exposed to Protestantism. On her return to France a year later, she studied the works of Enlightenment philosophers such as Voltaire, Rousseau and Diderot and expe- rienced a kind of non-religious conversion. In 1856, she broke with her family and moved to Switzerland where she eventually settled on her own in Paz-Perez, near Lausanne. Royer spent the next two years living in relative isolation, studying in the public library and supporting herself by selling her needlework. Keenly aware of her ig- norance, she began to devour texts on almost every subject: philosophy, physics, anthropology, economics, mathematics, geology, law and natural history. She came to believe that reason, and not religion, mattered most.

In 1865, three years after she translated Darwin, Royer and Duprat moved to Italy to live together openly and she gave birth to their son, Ren\u00e9. She continued to lecture and publish and, in 1870, the family returned to Paris. When Duprat died, Royer was left with very little income. With the help of friends, she moved into a boarding house in the suburbs of Paris, where she continued her work. In 1902, she died in Neuilly-sur-Seine. ",

Two years later she offered a salon series for women entitled \u2018Course on the philosophy of nature and history in 40 lessons\u2019, which proved very popular. She expanded her course to other Swiss cities and eventually to Italy. Royer became interested in the works of Lamarck, whose view that all species adapt to their environment over time was unpopular. When she discovered the works of Charles Darwin she was eager to write the French translation, believing his ideas vindicated those of Lamarck. Shattered windows Royer\u2018s translation of Charles Darwin\u2019s The origin of species was published in 1862, the year she also published a two-volume work on economics (an essay of hers on taxation and social inequality had received a prize in 1860). Her translation included notes and a lengthy preface in which she offered a personal analysis of Darwin\u2018s ideas. She wrote about the potential consequences of his hypotheses, and followed his ideas to their natural conclusion. French anthropologist Charles Letourneau said that her translation had \u201cshattered the windows\u201d; her comments could not have failed to influence the way French scientists viewed Darwin\u2018s theories. Royer took particular exception to Darwin\u2018s view that women were naturally inferior to men, and commented: \"Woman is the one animal in all creation about which man knows the least\". Darwin was shocked by her daring but called her \u201cthe oddest and cleverest woman in France\u201d.

Anthropology and feminism In 1870, Royer was the first woman to be invited to join the Anthropological Society of Paris. Her election as a member caused an uproar, but she contrib- uted several important papers and discussions over the years. In the late 1880s, the society invited her to lecture on mental evolution in its new series of confer- ences on evolution. Throughout the 1880s and 1890s, she contributed to economics journals, anthropology reviews, encyclopaedias and the feminist newspaper La Fronde , which she helped found. By 1897, she had become a major figure in the feminist movement and was awarded the Legion d\u2018Honneur in 1900. Scientific achievements Cl\u00e9mence Royer did not have a scientific speciality. She was an autodidact whose lectures and publications strived for a synthesis of ideas across topics. She made no distinction between science and philosophy; she believed that sci- ence should be the fundamental basis for philosophy, and that it should be used to guide society. She is best known today for her French translation of Darwin\u2018s The origin of species, which included her personal interpretation of his ideas. But she also made important contributions to anthropology and was celebrated twice in her lifetime by the feminist and scientific communities. ",

Born in Skibbereen, Ireland on 10 February 1842, Clerke grew up in a family devoted to scientific study. Her father, John Willis Clerke, was a keen amateur scientist and he encouraged all of his children \u2013 Agnes, Ellen and Aubrey St John \u2013 to take an active interest. The Clerkes conducted chemistry experiments in a makeshift laboratory and kept a telescope mounted in the garden. All of the Clerke children were educated at home, studying Latin, Greek, math- ematics and astronomy. It was the last of these that most attracted Agnes and she began writing a history of the subject at the tender age of 15. Warmer climes From 1867, Agnes, Ellen and their mother began to spend their winters in Florence, Italy. The sisters, who shared an interest in astronomy, moved there in 1873 and stayed for the next four years. Agnes spent much of her time in the city\u2019s impressive libraries, indulging her passion for scientific knowledge. An astronomical achievement The Clerke family relocated to London in 1877 and, that same year, Agnes had her first important article published. Entitled \u2018Copernicus in Italy\u2019, it appeared in the Edinburgh Review . Agnes went on to become a regular contributor to the periodical, which printed 55 of her articles during her lifetime. Although astronomy was her passion, Agnes never carried out any observational work of her own. Instead, she devoted all her time to writing about the subject, collating, interpreting and summarising the results of astronomical research car- ried out by others.

Her later books included The system of the stars (1890), which dealt with the make-up of the visible universe; Problems in astrophysics (1903), which detailed the current sta- tus of work in that field; and Modern cosmogonies (1905), an account of theories on the evolution of the universe.

She was educated at a girls\u2018 high school, Marinskaia in St Petersburg. Although her parents did not expect her to continue her studies, some of the teachers at her school were proponents of higher education for women. Elizaveta was drawn to the philosophy of nihilism, which was popular among segments of the Russian intelligentsia in the 1860s. The movement centred on the idea that values are social constructs and that natural sciences are a progressive force in society. It also strongly advocated the equality of women. Like many people, Elizaveta came to believe that Russian universities would soon be opening their doors to women. Hoping to gain entry Although Elizaveta learned more at Marinskaia than she would at a finishing school, standards were much lower than in boys\u2018 schools and she would have been ill-prepared for a university entrance exam. To catch up, she studied privately with the mathematician Strannoliubskii, who had tutored her friend Sophia Kovalevskaya. Elizaveta was active in the nihilist women\u2018s network and helped others prepare for university. The network had the support of many professors, and in 1870 she received a certificate of competency. Eventually, it became clear that the government did not have any plans to allow women into universities. Many Russian women left for Europe, and a sizeable diaspora of female students grew up around the university in Zurich. Despite the objections of her parents Elizaveta intended to go to Zurich, but her husband (whom she married in 1866) would not agree to her leaving Russia; she needed his permission to obtain a passport. Defying the decree In 1872, after Elizaveta was widowed, she obtained a passport and left for Zurich.

She spent many years teaching the lower grades in a girls\u2018 school at an hourly rate, but was eventually allowed to teach the higher grades. During the Russian Revolution, having retired from teaching she went to live with her sister in the country. She is assumed to have died in the famine of 1919, at the age of 74. A career cut short When Elizaveta joined her fellow Russian students in Zurich, she was the only woman in her classes at the Polytechnic Institute. She earned the respect of her teachers, who encouraged her to complete her studies despite political pressure. The Tsar\u2018s June 1873 decree stated that failure to return to Russia would result in exclusion from any higher education institutions in Russia (should they be opened to women), from any civil service post (should any be open to women) and from any official teaching position. Most of the women complied but Elizaveta and a few others took their chances, hoping that the decree held empty threats. Elizaveta completed her baccalaureate and went on to study function theory at Bern. She received a doctoral degree in mathematics, with highest honours, from the University of Bern in 1878. This was the first to be awarded to a woman based on a regular course of study. When Elizaveta returned to Russia, she could neither hold an official teaching post nor work in mathematics. She was not permitted to take the exam for teaching at university level, and could not participate in the new Higher Women\u2018s Courses in St Petersburg. Her career as a mathematician was effectively over. She ended up teaching young children at a secondary school for girls. Elizaveta Fedorovna Litvinova Defying a dreadful decree ",

But she threw herself into her new role, becoming the first Russian woman allowed to teach mathematics for the higher grades and making substantial contributions to mathematical pedagogy in Russia. She published over 70 articles on the subject. Her philosophy and practical methods for teaching promoted alternative approaches to proofs and advocated the use of word problems. To supplement her meagre earnings, Elizaveta wrote a series of biographies of mathematicians and philosophers. Her biography of Sofia Kovalevskaya provided unique insight into the experience of women scientists of the time. She was active in the European women\u2018s movement, contributed to the Bulletin de l\u2018union universelle des femmes and was one of four Russian delegates to the International Women\u2018s Congress in Brussels in 1897. Scientific achievements Elizaveta Litvinova\u2018s career as a promising researcher in mathematics was cut short, but she became one of the most respected pedagogues in Russia. Her modern, practical methods and philosophy of teaching mathematics urged the use of word problems and offered alternative ways to completing equations. She was an inspiration to her students, and many of them went on to pursue careers in science. In an era of heavy censorship, she managed to work information about social issues into her popular series of biographies.

Educated at home, she read everything on hand and learned several European languages at a very early age. But what really caught her attention were the chemistry texts. Her family did not understand her intense interest but they supported her by hiring private tutors. When she was 22, Iulia applied for the Petrovskaya Agricultural Academy, which had a strong chemistry programme. Despite having the support of several of the academy\u2019s professors, Iulia\u2019s application, like those of all female applicants, was turned down. The beginning of a lifelong friendship Following this disappointment, her cousin introduced her to Sofia Kovalevskaya, a mathematician and feminist who was making plans to leave Russia and con- tinue her studies in Germany. This friendship was pivotal to Iulia\u2019s career. Kovalevskaya helped to persuade Iulia\u2019s reluctant parents to allow her to leave Russia for Heidelberg, where the two would have a chance to continue their studies. Once there, in 1869, Sofia managed to convince the university authori- ties to allow both of them to attend lectures. She also managed to persuade the notorious misogynist Robert Bunsen (of Bunsen burner fame) to let Iulia work in his lab. Iulia\u2019s work in Heidelberg focused on the separation of platinum met- als, although when she moved to Berlin in 1871 her interests shifted to organic chemistry. In Berlin, she was not formally allowed to attend lec- tures or work in the labs. Nevertheless, she took private lessons, worked in the laboratory of the chemist A.W. Hofmann and published her first sci- entific paper in 1872. Two years later, she went to G\u00f6ttingen and success- fully completed and defended her dissertation, receiving highest honours. The triumphal return That same year, aged 28, she moved back to Russia and was welcomed by some of that country\u2019s foremost chemists, including Dmitri Mendelehyev who established the periodic table of the elements.

Oil rush When Iulia contracted typhus in 1877, Sophia visited and nursed her back to health. That same year, Iulia\u2019s father died, so she returned to Moscow and stayed. She had decided to stay near Sophia, who was now like family to her, and \u2013 much to the disappointment of her colleagues \u2013 turned down an oppor- tunity to teach at the new \u2018Higher Women\u2019s Courses\u2019, the first Russian institution for women\u2019s higher education. In 1880, Iulia began studying petroleum and focused on separating out the different components of crude oil. Her experiments were the first to prove that oil produces lighting gas of higher quality than coal, making it better for use in industry. She also invented an original device for the continuous distillation of petroleum, which was widely praised. Making cheese and raising Fufa Iulia\u2019s petroleum research brought her much acclaim, but in 1886 she walked away from her successful career in chemistry to live a quieter life in the coun- tryside. She had never held an official post. At the age of 39 she moved to the family estate in the Pskov province and turned her attention to scientific agriculture: improving the soil, breeding fish and cattle, and making cheeses that were successful in Russia and the Ukraine.

Born in Moscow on 15 January 1850, Sofia was also sometimes known as Sonya and, in her professional life, used the masculine form of her husband\u2019s surname to avoid revealing her gender in publications. Attracted to mathematics at a young age, Sofia was educated by tutors and governesses at the family\u2019s estate, Palabino, and later in St Petersburg. She was greatly influenced by her uncle, Pyotr Vasilievich Krokovsky, who had a keen interest in mathematics and often spoke to Sofia on the subject. At the age of 11, Sofia papered the walls of her room with pages of lecture notes on differential and integral analysis, which provided the young mathematician with an introduc- tion to calculus. From Russia with love Upon finishing her schooling, Sofia\u2019s ambition was to study mathematics at uni- versity. Knowing that this was impossible for a woman in Russia, she formulated a plan to travel to western Europe. As young, unmarried girls were not allowed to travel alone without permission from their father, Sofia entered a marriage of convenience with Vladimir Kovalevsky, then a young palaeontology student. In 1869, they left Russia and travelled to Heidelberg, Germany, where Sofia hoped to study mathematics and natural sciences. On arrival, she was informed that women were not allowed to enrol in courses, but she lobbied the university\u2019s authorities who eventually permitted her to attend lectures and seminars in phys- ics and mathematics. In 1871, Sofia moved to Berlin where she studied privately with the great cal- culus expert Karl Weierstrass. By the spring of 1874, she had completed three papers, all of which Weierstrass considered worthy of a doctorate. Later that year, on Weierstrass\u2019 initiative, the University of G\u00f6ttingen awarded her (in her ",

Sofia began to look for an academic post but was informed that the best she could do would be teaching arithmetic to schoolgirls. Returning to Russia, the situation was no better and, disillusioned, Sofia abandoned her mathematical work for six years. During this time, the marriage of Sofia and Vladimir turned into love, and they had a daughter, also called Sofia. Moreover, they became involved in various business ventures. When these schemes collapsed, in 1883, Vladimir committed suicide. The lady professor By the time of Vladimir\u2019s death, Sofia had resumed her mathematical work on a private basis. She presented a paper on Abelian integrals at a scientific confer- ence in 1880, which was very well received. In 1882, Sofia began to work on the refraction of light, writing three articles on the topic. The following year, she got the break she needed to get into the academic world when she received an invitation from a mathematician who had met her at the conference in 1880, G\u00f6sta Mittag-Leffler, to lecture at the University of Stockholm on a temporary basis. During her time in Sweden, Sofia taught courses on the latest topics in analysis and carried out important research. After five years, she was appointed as a professor, making her the first woman since Laura Bassi and Maria Gaetana Agnesi, in the 18 th century, to hold a chair at a European university. ",

(cid:3) The body mathematic Whilst at the University of Stockholm, Sofia was appointed editor of a new jour- nal, Acta Mathematica , and also became involved in the organisation of inter- national conferences. Her greatest triumph came in 1888 when her paper \u2018On the rotation of a solid body about a fixed point\u2019 won the prestigious Prix Bordin, organised by the French Academy of Sciences. So impressed was the Academy by the work that they increased the prize money from 3 000 to 5 000 francs. Her work was particularly innovative because existing solutions for the motion of a rigid body around a fixed point had been developed for cases where the body is symmetric; Sofia\u2019s paper developed a theory for an unsymmetrical body, where the centre of mass is not on an axis in the body. In 1888 she began a \u2018scandalous\u2019 affair with Maxim Kovalevsky, the nephew of Vladimir, and in 1891 she travelled to Paris to meet him. Whilst there she contract- ed influenza, complicated by pneumonia, which led to her death on 10 February. Scientific achievements Although her life was cut short, Sofia Kovalevskaya\u2019s career was a remarkable one. Although she published only ten papers on mathematics and mathematical physics, many of these included ground- breaking theories or the impetus for future discoveries. Her early work on the theory of dif- ferential equations was a particularly valuable contribution to mathematics and led to what is now known as the Cauchy-Kovalevsky theorem for analytic partial differential equations. Kovalevskaya\u2019s other great breakthrough was her paper on the rotation of an unsymmetrical solid body around a fixed point, now known as the Kovalevsky top. Her further research on the topic won her a prize from the Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1889. Sofia was able to overcome the gen- eral objections to women in science by demonstrating her intelligence and her groundbreaking work in mathematics. She was rewarded with a professorship and a role editing a mathematical journal. Perhaps her most lasting influence, however, was the example she set for other women trying to enter academia. ",

The agnostic and vivacious Hertha maintained her mother\u2018s values of generosity and self-sufficiency throughout her life. Hertha went to London when she was nine to be educated by her aunt. She aspired to a university education but needed to support herself \u2013 and help her family \u2013 by tutoring and doing embroidery work. Her dream was finally made financially possible in 1876 by one of the founders of the University of Cambridge\u2018s Girton College, Barbara Leigh Smith Bodichon, a passionate sup- porter of women in higher education. She received her BSc from the University of London because the University of Cambridge did not give degrees to women at the time. Engineering a brighter future After graduating, Hertha supported herself by teaching maths, although her real passion lay in experimental mathematics and engineering. In 1884, she invented a device that could divide a line into any number of equal parts, which was to prove very useful for architects, engineers and surveyors. With renewed confi- dence and financial backing from Bodichon, she continued her studies at the Technical College in Finsbury. The field of electricity caught Hertha\u2018s interest, and she decided to study under William Edward Ayrton, who was a supporter of women\u2018s rights. They de- veloped a strong relationship and married in 1885, after which Hertha continued to experiment with and lecture on electricity. But the pressures of poor health and increasing domestic responsibilities at home left her with little time for research. ",

Over the next few years, Hertha made a number of important discoveries about the nature of the electric arc, and published a series of papers that she incorp- orated into a book in 1902. In 1899, she read her own paper on the hissing arc at the Institution of Electrical Engineers and became their first female member. In that same year, she made several presentations and demonstrations, notably at the International Electric Congress in Paris. Ripples in the sand William Ayrton\u2018s health failed, and the couple were obliged to spend a lot of time by the sea during his convalescence. Ever curious, Hertha spent her free time addressing one of the more long-standing questions of mathematics by analysing ripple patterns in sand. When they returned home, she set up large tanks in the house to continue her studies of hydrodynamics. At the same time, she patented a number of works related to searchlight carbons commissioned by the British Admiralty. Hertha was the first woman to read her own paper at the Royal Society, and in 1906 the organisation awarded her the Hughes Medal for her scientific investigations into the electric arc and sand ripples. However, her application for membership of the Royal Society, supported by eight members, was turned down because she was a married woman. ",

(cid:3) Toxic winds of war During World War I, poisonous, clear chlorine gas was the cause of death or lingering torture to soldiers in the trenches. In 1915, Ayrton drew on her knowledge of air vortices to invent a simple fan that could dispel the gas from the trenches. She campaigned strongly for its use and invented an adapted ver- sion in 1917 that was even better. Despite the demonstrable effectiveness of the device and her well-known personal charms, Hertha was unable to convince the wartime bureaucrats to put the Ayrton fan into general use. Scientific achievements Hertha\u2018s work on the electric arc preceded the emergence of the field of plasma physics. Direct-current arcs, which at the time were a commercially important source of lighting, break down gas and produce a continuous plasma discharge; the arc is generated between two carbon electrodes that are then consumed. The problem was that because of this, the length of the arc was continually changing. Also, the heat generated by the arc melted most materials. Ayrton\u2018s work illuminated the relationship between power supply, current and arc length and determined that the shape and size of the positive carbon electrode were among the most important factors in the arc\u2019s behaviour. Her findings led directly to improvements in searchlight carbons and in lamp houses for cinema projectors. She also produced original works on hydrodynamics and, based on her knowledge of air vortices, invented the Ayrton fan, a cheap and simple device that could be used to clear poisonous gas from trenches.

Her mother had tuberculosis but ran a prestigious boarding school for girls. During the Russian occupation of Poland, Russians replaced Polish teachers and life became very difficult for the family. Marya\u2018s mother and older sister died by the time she was 11. Marya graduated at the top of her class in 1883, and supported herself and her sister Bronya by working as a governess for six years. She continued her educa- tion via letters with her father and using the technical library in her employer\u2018s factory. She and Bronya made plans to move Paris and to take turns supporting one another through university. In 1891, she moved to Paris, changed her name to Marie and enrolled at the University of Paris. She lived in a primitive garret and completed a master-level degree in physics, chemistry and mathematics. One of very few women at the university, she came top in her class. During her periodic visits home, Marie par- ticipated in Warsaw\u2019s clandestine Flying University, an ongoing series of secret lectures that were open to women. A perfect partnership Marie met Pierre Curie in 1894. A physicist teaching at a technical school, he shared her passion for science. They married in 1895 and spent the next 14 years building a family and conducting ground-breaking research. They had two daughters: Ir\u00e8ne and Eve. While Marie worked, Pierre\u2018s widowed father looked after the children. In choosing a doctoral thesis, Marie looked for something completely new: a topic that would let her conduct laboratory experiments rather than simply library research. She chose to focus on Henri Becquerel\u2018s discovery of radioactivity. Marie and Pierre conducted most of their experiments in an unventilated shed, and the two suffered physically. But their work led to their sharing a Nobel Prize with Bequerel for their work on radiation, and Marie received another for her discovery of radium. Pierre died in a tragic accident in 1906. To say that Marie was devastated by his death would be an understatement. The university gave her a professorship and, after a couple of years, Pierre\u2018s position as chair of the physics department.

Marie had largely ignored the growing evidence of the health effects of radia- tion, despite having lost many of her laboratory workers to leukaemia and anae- mia. In 1934, she died of leukaemia in Passy, France. A radiant intellect Marie studied museum samples of two uranium ores, and realised that they must contain other substances more radioactive than uranium. Recognising the impor- tance of her experiments, Pierre dropped his own work on crystals and joined her. The two spent years working in their ramshackle, leaky laboratory develop- ing new ways to separate out different elements from mineral ores. In 1898, they published their discoveries of radium and polonium, which are many times more radioactive than uranium. Marie concluded that radioactivity originates from atoms themselves, a finding which hailed a whole new era in science. Pierre Curie and Henri Bequerel were nominated alone for their work, but Pierre made it clear that he would not accept the Prize if his wife were not included. The three were awarded the Nobel Prize for physics for their work on radiation. Marie\u2018s original findings were well documented, and her ownership of the ideas undisputable. Nevertheless, she struggled throughout her career against accusa- tions that the work was wholly Pierre\u2019s. Fortunately, she published her findings quickly and recorded everything.

After her husband died, Marie was given an assistant professorship by the University of Paris and became the university\u2018s first female professor in 1908. The Curie laboratory welcomed many visiting scientists, including several women who made important contributions to radiation research. In 1911, amidst public scandal over her candidacy for the French Academy of Sciences and supposed liaison with a fellow scientist, she was awarded a Nobel Prize in chemistry for her discovery of radium. Although they had spent years developing a process to isolate pure radium, the Curies did not patent it in their belief that science should advance unhindered. In the 1920s, Marie carried out two successful fundraising campaigns in the US in order to set up the new Radium Institute in France (now the Institut Curie) and the Warsaw Radium Institute. By this point, she had changed her mind about scientists patenting their inventions. Scientific achievements Marie Curie-Sk\u0142odowska found that the strength of radiation depends only on the amount of uranium or thorium in a given amount of ore, and deduced that radioactivity originates from atoms themselves. At the time, many scientists thought of atoms as being unchangeable. Her revelation that radioactivity was a property of atoms, and not a result of the way they are arranged in molecules, was astounding. Marie discovered radium and polonium, and was awarded Nobel Prizes for her contributions to physics and to chemistry. She also directed a large amount or research into the potential uses of radiation in medicine, and developed separa- tion processes that made the study of radium possible. ",

After graduating in 1892, the budding scientist enrolled at Det Kongelige Frederiks Universitet (now the University of Oslo) to read medicine. She quickly realised that her true interests lay elsewhere \u2013 in the animal kingdom \u2013 and changed her focus to zoology, specialising in marine life. An international education Whilst still an undergraduate, Bonnevie published a study of ascidiae (sea squirts) and hydriodea (worm tubes) specimens collected by the Norwegian North Sea expedition. Continuing her studies abroad, she was taught cytology (the study of cells) by specialists in Switzerland and Germany from 1898-1901. In 1900, she was appointed curator of the university\u2019s Zoological Museum. Throughout this period she continued to work on her PhD thesis on the develop- ment of germ cells in parasitic snails. Published in 1906, \u2018Studies on the germ cells of Enteroxenos \u00f8stergreni \u2019 was the first of Bonnevie\u2018s many contributions to the study of chromosomal structure and function. That same year, she crossed the Atlantic to train at Columbia University in New York, where she focused on sex chromosomes in sea snakes. Mixing work with pleasure Her love of nature and fascination with animal life was such that she even de- voted her leisure time to their study. Holidaying at biological stations along the Norwegian coast, she claimed that she loved these tours \u201cwhere work and pleasure are so tightly interwoven that you cannot tell where the one ends and the other begins\u201d. A profile published in the magazine Folkebladet, when she became a professor, said that \u201cIt is only during the holidays that Dr Bonnevie can work on her scientific studies\u201d. ",

The following spring, the Stortinget (Norwegian parliament) gave women access to academic office and Bonnevie was made extraordinary Professor of Zoology. In 1919, she was elevated to ordinary professor. She remained a dedicated lecturer and writer of popular science throughout her career. She was well liked as a teacher, and gave inspiring lectures. One former student described how she spent hours before a lecture putting dotted lines on the black- board (invisible to the students) so that, during the lectures, with the help of coloured chalk, organs and structures began to appear. A human interest story Although her passion for nature never left her (she remained head of the zoologi- cal laboratory until 1938), Bonnevie began to turn her attention to the study of human genetics. In 1912, she launched a large-scale study of heritability, which would lead to a number of important discoveries. To facilitate these studies, in 1916, alongside three other professors, Bonnevie founded the University Institute for Research on Heredity (later Genetics). Her work would lead to advances in our understanding of inherited characteristics. Mother to all her students Bonnevie cared about the welfare of her students. She was responsible for setting up homes to accom- modate female students and, during World War I, organised food and shelter for students from other parts of the country, even renting land where they could grow potatoes. In 1920, she was rewarded with the Royal Gold Medal of Merit. Similarly devoted in World War II, Bonnevie organised food supplies for the resistance and her students, distributing food pack- ages from her apartment after the university was closed by the Nazis in 1943. For this, she was made a Knight, First Class, of the Order of St Olav in 1946. Moreover, Bonnevie was interested in promoting the interests of women scientists. In 1920, she was one of the founders of the Norwegian Association of University Women and became its first president. In that capacity she hosted the Third International Conference of the International Federation of University Women in Oslo in 1924. Bonnevie also held official political office, serving as a representative on the City Council of Kristiania from 1908-1919 and as a deputy in the Stortinget from 1916-1918. Between 1920 and 1924, she was a member of the Norwegian delegation to the first five assemblies of the League of Nations in Geneva. ",

(cid:3) Scientific achievements Bonnevie published a number of important studies, some of which had an instant impact and others which were only later acknowledged. In 1908, she published an article describing the structure of chromosomes, but it took 25 years before her interpretation could be proven. Her research led to the naming of a chromo- somal disorder found in some females who lack all or part of one X chromosome as Bonnevie-Ulrich syndrome. From 1912 onwards, Bonnevie focused much of her research on hereditary characteristics, resulting in two ground-breaking studies. One considered the occurrence of dwarfism, polydactism (having extra digits on the hands or feet) and multiple births in isolated mountainous and fjord regions. This led to the publication in 1926 of a study showing the genetic predisposition of dizygotic (non-identical) twins. Two years earlier, Bonnevie had published a ground-break- ing study of fingerprint patterns, identifying the three basic elements that make up fingerprint patterns and showing that a tendency towards certain pattern types was hereditary. After her death, the academic Bj\u00f8rn F\u00f8yn gave a eulogy quoting her personal philosophy, saying: \u201cAge and death follow as natural parts of the life of each subject \u2013 in the same way as the plants wither at the end of their flowering period. The individual has done its deed, and life is at an end. But if they have succeeded during their lifetime in arriving at some of the goals of the ethics of Nature, to live according to the best in their characters, then their lives will, without doubt, leave some marks behind among their fellows and relatives.\" Bonnevie\u2019s life and work left a mark that reached beyond those who knew her.

When her father died, young Tatyana was raised by an uncle and aunt in St Petersburg. In the imperial capital, as in all Russian territory, women were not permitted to attend universities or other prestigious institutions. Instead, Tatyana completed her education at a women\u2019s school where she was trained as a teacher and took some science-related courses. In her mid-20s, she decided to leave Russia and continue her studies in G\u00f6ttingen, Germany which, at that time, was a major centre for mathematics and physics. There, Afanasyeva met Austrian physicist and mathematician Paul Ehrenfest. Paul wondered why Tatyana did not come to the mathematics club meetings, and when he discovered that it was because women were not allowed to attend, he battled to get the rule changed. The friendship that developed between Tatyana and Paul led to their marriage in 1904. Over the years, the partnership enabled the scientific talents of both to flourish. Faith no more In 1907 the couple returned to St Petersburg where, under Russian law, a union between two people of different religious persuasions could not be sanctioned. As a Jew, Ehrenfest could not live with his wife, who was a Russian Orthodox, unless the two declared they were not affiliated to any religion. They both officially renounced their religions so that they could live in Tatyana\u2018s homeland. During that time Tatyana began to develop a new approach to teaching geom- etry and mathematics. In 1912, Ehrenfest was given a professorship at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands, and the couple moved again. They might have gone from there to Prague, where Albert Einstein invited Ehrenfest to succeed him as Professor of Theoretical Physics, but at the time it was not possible for professors without religious faith to be appointed to universities in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The two remained in the Netherlands throughout their career. Explaining the fundamentals After the untimely death of physicist Ludwig Boltzmann in 1906, the editor of the Encyclopaedia of Mathematical Sciences asked Ehrenfest to write a review of statistical mechanics based on Boltzmann\u2018s work. Boltzmann had been one of the key supporters of atomic theory (a controversial topic at the time); the importance of his work may have been overlooked without the efforts of Tatyana ",

Together, the duo spent several years writing the piece and com- pleted their classic review, The conceptual foundations of the statistical approach in mechanics , in 1911. The Ehrenfest-Afanasyeva review detailed the work of the Austrian physicist and his school, explaining statistical thermodynamics and irreversibility, and highlighting some fundamental contributions to statistical mechanics. This field of physics uses probabil- ity to predict the behaviour of a complex system. Statistical mechanics paved the way for the development of mathematical models that are used today to understand the behaviour of complex systems. The review added significant value to Boltzmann\u2018s original work, and was widely praised for its clear style. Tatyana and her husband explained the principles of statis- tical mechanics using well-chosen examples, and combined a logical analysis of the key theories with a full breakdown of the unresolved issues. The couple\u2018s ability to communicate these complex ideas so succinctly made the information more acces- sible to scientists, and contributed in no small part to advances in the field. Influence on the home front and beyond Ehrenfest-Afanasyeva had a unique and rigorous approach to examining fundamental issues, and was mainly interested in questions of entropy and chance. Knowledgeable, quick-thinking and with a critical mind, Tatyana was passionate about reforming mathematical pedagogy. She organised a series of workshops for teachers, and in 1924 published an elaborate didactic method for teaching geometry that received significant attention. Between 1926 and 1933, she set out a program for teaching geometry and mathematics in Russia. ",

The couple had two sons, one of whom, Wassik, had Down\u2018s syndrome, and two daughters. Tragically, Paul ended his life in 1933, first shooting their son Wassik before turning the gun on himself. Two of the children followed in their parents\u2018 scientific footsteps: their son Pavlik became a physicist and daughter Tatyana followed a career in mathematics. The younger Tatyana studied both in Leiden and G\u00f6ttingen, and received her PhD from the University of Leiden in 1931; she is credited with having made significant contributions to mathematics. Scientific achievements Tatyana Ehrenfest-Afanasyeva worked closely with her husband, Paul Ehrenfest, to write the famous review of the work of Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann and his school. She also conducted widespread research on the science of teaching, randomness and entropy, and substantially influenced the work of her husband throughout his productive career. Ehrenfest-Afanasyeva\u2019s contribution to science is documented in monographs and articles she published in Russian, Dutch and German. Her work in mathematical pedagogy, which was originally met with much criticism, laid the foundations for the world-renowned mathematics teaching reform that gained popularity during the 1970s. ",

Her scientific curiosity was first piqued as a child when she tried to figure out why it was that a puddle of water with a bit of oil in it was filled with colours. As a teenager, she longed for new challenges. She summed up this restlessness as: \u201cLife need not be easy, provided only that it is not empty.\u201d Her life as a nuclear physicist was to prove neither easy nor empty. After completing the period of education allowed to girls, Meitner struggled for nine years to enter the halls of academia \u2013 this period (1892-1901) she later dubbed the \u201clost years\u201d. After earning a teaching certificate, she began prepa- rations for the university entrance exam with a private tutor \u2013 squeezing eight years of study into two in order to make up for lost time. In 1901, she enrolled at Vienna University. Germany\u2019s Madame Curie Over the coming decades, Meitner was to establish a reputation for herself as one of the world\u2019s foremost nuclear physicists, working alongside some of the best scientists of the age, including Max Planck, the founder of quantum theory, and Otto Hahn, the renowned nuclear chemist. Albert Einstein called her \u201cour Madame Curie\u201d. Despite all her scientific triumphs, Meitner\u2019s later life was marred by personal tragedy. After some three decades of accomplished academic work in Berlin, Meitner was forced to flee Nazi Germany in 1938, five years after Adolf Hitler came to power. After short stays in the Netherlands and Denmark, she ended up in Stockholm, a relative scientific backwater at the time. \u201cI have none of my scientific equipment. For me, this is harder than anything else,\u201d she wrote to her lifelong partner in science, Hahn. The nucleus of a great idea Lise Meitner\u2019s scientific career truly took off when she entered Vienna University in 1901. Fascinated by reports of Marie and Pierre Curie\u2019s discovery of radium, she began investigating radioactivity \u2013 an early step on the road to her becoming a nuclear physicist. ",

There, Max Planck \u2013 whom she grew to adore for his \u201crare honesty of mind\u201d \u2013 allowed her to attend his lectures and, in 1913, granted her an assistantship. Fission impossible At about the same time, her longstanding scientific partnership with Otto Hahn began. In their first years together, they discovered several new isotopes. She finally gained a salaried position at the newly established Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut (which was later renamed after Max Planck) shortly before World War I broke out in 1914. There, she was not allowed to use the front door and began her work in a wooden shed instead of the laboratory. During the war, she served as an X-ray nurse, as Marie Curie did on the other side of the front line. In 1926, Meitner became Germany\u2019s first female physics professor (albeit an extraordinarius ) and she and Hahn were nominated frequently for the Nobel Prize. With the discovery of the neutron in the early 1930s, speculation began that it might be possible to create elements heavier than uranium in the laboratory. However, no one suspected that the atom could be split into lighter elements, a process now known as fission, which she discovered while in exile with her nephew Otto Frisch and in correspondence with Hahn and her former team in Berlin. This marked the birth of the nuclear age. ",

Meitner\u2019s crowning achievement was the discovery of nuclear fission. While others searched for heavier elements than uranium, she was probably the first to realise that in these experiments the atom was actually being split. There is a general consensus among physicists and historians of science that Meitner should have been awarded the Nobel Prize for her explanation of fission. \u201cWhat does it matter that Lise Meitner did not take direct part in the \u2018dis- covery\u2019\u2026 [she] was the intellectual leader of our team,\u201d argued Fritz Strassmann, a key member of Meitner and Hahn\u2019s research group. Rewriting the laws of physics The unprecedented energy the fission process unlocked was to mark the birth of the nuclear age, with all the good and evil this entailed. Despite moving to a relative scientific backwater after her escape from Germany, Meitner turned down an Allied offer to work on the Atomic Bomb. \u201cIt is an unfortunate accident that this discovery came about in time of war. I myself have not in any way worked on the smashing of the atom with the idea of producing death-dealing weapons,\u201d she said in a newspaper interview. In recognition of Meitner\u2019s contribution to science, she received numerous awards. A German research group even gave her name to a new element, meitnerium, in 1992. \u201c[Meitner] should be honoured as the most significant woman scientist of this century,\u201d believed Peter Armbruster, the physicist leading the team.

Her mother was a highly intelligent musician and artist who believed strongly in human rights. When she finished school, the young Gertrud was keen to continue her studies. Unfortunately, her father had other ideas and sent her to Erfurt in Germany \u2013 where her uncle was chief physician in a hospital \u2013 to learn to cook. Undeterred, Gertrud studied mathematics secretly at night with the brother of a fellow student. Burn out Leading a double life proved to be an exhausting business and Gertrud fell ill. Her doctor uncle diagnosed her with chlorosis, a form of anaemia, and prescribed a course of iron tablets. Back in Switzerland, Gertrud went for treat- ment to the first woman doctor to practise in Berne. The doctor, who knew from her own experience how hard some women had to fight for their right to study, quickly realised that her young patient was suffering from fatigue. Gertrud\u2018s wish to study was finally granted, and she went on to obtain her PhD and school teaching qualification in chemistry, physics and botany from the University of Berne. An initiator of interdisciplinary research In an age when clear boundaries demarcated the different scientific disciplines, Gertrud Woker advocated an interdisciplinary approach to research. Her prin- ciple areas of interest were physical chemistry, toxicology, pharmacology and biology. In 1907, she gained her qualification to teach at university and was granted permission to lecture in Berne. As World War I raged around neutral Switzerland, Woker was horrified by the widespread use of poison gas in the trenches. She believed strongly that researchers had a responsibility to ensure that their science was not misused for war. ",

At its historic meeting in The Hague in 1915, the fledgling organisation came up with a list of 20 resolutions calling on the warring nations to lay down their arms and find peaceful means of settling their differences. The resolutions also called for disarma- ment and equal rights for women. During World War I they were communicated in person to the governments of both warring and neutral countries; Gertrud was re- sponsible for getting the message through to the Swiss government. The resolutions eventually reached the desk of US President Woodrow Wilson, who later used them as inspiration for some of his own peace proposals (the \u201814 points\u2018). In the aftermath of the war, the WILPF continued to campaign vigorously against the use of poison gas in warfare and Gertrud, with her expertise in toxicology, coupled with her ability to explain complex subjects to the public, was at the forefront of this work. Digging graves In 1924, Gertrud co-founded the International Committee Against Scientific Warfare. In the same year she published a leaflet entitled The next war, a war of poison gas , which set out the different kinds of gas that could be used in war- fare, explained how they could be distributed and vividly described their horrific impacts on their victims. \u201cBut a few instances are enough to make us conscious of the deadly peril that lies in the use and development of poison gas,\u201d Woker warns.

Meanwhile, her research continued, and in 1933 she was made a professor of biochemistry at the University of Berne, following interventions from pacifist colleagues around the world. In 1951, she published a monumental, two-volume work called The chemistry of the natural alkaloids , which was roundly praised in chemical, biological, pharma ceutical and medical journals. Even in old age, Woker\u2018s enthusiasm for the pacifist cause was undimmed, and she remained an active member of the WILPF well into her 80s.

Learning before all else Born in Norway in 1879, Ellen was the oldest of 11 children. Her father, a natural history teacher, and her mother, an intellectual and advocate of women\u2019s rights, made sure that their children were all exposed to cultural, musical, and natural activities in addition to their regular schooling. Supported by a family that valued education above all else, Ellen became valedictorian of her high-school class in southern Norway. She then went on to train as a pharmacologist in the northern city of Troms\u00f8 in 1902. (The first woman had entered university in Norway in 1882.) In 1903, Gleditsch was invited to study in the laboratory of chemist Eyvind B\u00f8dtker at the University of Oslo and soon became his assistant. In 1905, she passed the university\u2019s entrance exam and, at the suggestion and with the sup- port of B\u00f8dtker, continued her investigations in Paris in the laboratory of Marie Curie-Sk\u0142odowska in 1907. (Curie had earned a Nobel Prize for her work in radioactivity only a few years earlier.) This proved to be an important decision, as Ellen contributed in no small way to the cutting-edge science produced by that small group. Science underground In the 1930s, Ellen helped to plan and eventually directed, a radiochemistry laboratory in Norway. When the Nazis came to power in Germany, she offered the laboratory as a \u2018safe-house\u2019 for scientists fleeing persecution. During the oc- cupation in the 1940s, she continued her experiments and worked underground, hiding people in her home and going undercover as a needle worker to relay messages about the movement. Following a raid on her laboratory in 1943, during which all of the men were arrested, Ellen and the other women scientists cleared the lab of valuable radioactive minerals. She hid them in a suitcase under her bed. ",

Ellen received a Licenci\u00e9e en sciences degree from the Sorbonne in 1911 and that same year was awarded a teaching fellowship at the University of Oslo. After a year in the Norwegian capital, she won a scholarship from the American- Scandinavian Foundation (the first such scholarship given to a woman) to study in the United States, and she jumped at the chance. She wrote to two prestigious scientists in the US asking to work in their laboratories but was turned down, in one case on the basis of her gender.

She spent a year completing her research into the half-life of radium (the amount of time it takes for half of the radioactive atoms in a sample of radium to decay) and established it as 1 686 years, which remained the standard for many years before being corrected to 1 620 years. Ellen\u2018s measurement paved the way for several important discoveries, as the half-life of radium could be used as a benchmark for studying the radiochemistry of other elements. The scientists who had turned her down changed their minds about having women in their laboratories, and one of them became co-author of two of her articles. In June 1914, she received an honorary doctorate for her work in radioactivity from Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts. Supporting her fellow scientists Ellen returned to the University of Oslo in 1914, and in 1917 became the se cond woman to be elected to Oslo\u2018s Academy of Science.

A fervent supporter of women in science throughout her career, she co-founded the Norwegian Women Academics Association in 1919 and, from 1926 to 1929, served as president of the International Federation of University Women, a position that allowed her to travel and lecture extensively. Ellen was charming and pleasant, and made friends easily. She built up an impressive network of international contacts, both professional and personal, during the course of her career. During her retirement, Ellen continued to publish papers and to advise students. Following her death from a stroke in 1968, the Ellen Gleditsch Scholarship Foundation was established in Norway to support aspiring scientists. Scientific achievements Ellen Gleditsch is regarded as an important link between several prominent groups in radioactivity in Europe and the US. Her most celebrated scientific achievement was her work on the half-life of radium. But she also played a major role in confirming the existence of isotopes (types of atoms of the same element that have different atomic mass). When a British chemist\u2018s claim that an element\u2018s atoms could have different atomic weights was largely dismissed, Ellen, along with many researchers, sent a sample of lead that she had purified to a leading researcher in the United States. Her sample was the only one pure enough to prove the existence of isotopes. ",

When she lectured, she would become very animated, reaching into her blouse for a handkerchief to wave around, losing hairpins and generally ending up in a state of disarray as she followed one creative line of thought after another. She often walked and talked with her small group of dedicated students through all kinds of weather, chatting loudly and excitedly about elegant, ab- stract concepts. Emmy shared her ideas freely with her students, and promoted their work. She published 44 papers, but most of her ideas are featured in the publications of others, including the influential 1931 publication Modern Algebra . She was con- sidered to be one of the leading mathematical thinkers in Germany. A mathematical life Even as a child, Emmy, the daughter of a respected mathematician, always had a knack for solving puzzles. Although she expected to teach languages at a finishing school, the University of Erlangen, where her father taught, would only admit her as a course auditor, rather than as a student. So at the age of 18 she became one of two women auditors among nearly a thousand male students. In 1903, Emmy passed a university entrance exam and enrolled as a student at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. Finally, in 1904, she was enrolled in the University of Erlangen as one of only 80 full-time women students in the whole of Germany. In 1907, she was awarded the highest honours for her PhD thesis. Although it was impossible for a woman to become Privatdozent at Erlangen University, Emmy nevertheless lectured in her father\u2019s place from time to time and A M E L I E E M M Y N O E T H E R ",

A woman lecturer? Never Emmy\u2018s original ideas were much admired by her contemporaries, and in 1915 she was invited by fellow mathematicians to join their department at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. However, objections were again raised from within the establish- ment over the inclusion of women in academic life. The biggest obstacle was a Prussian law, passed in 1908, prohibiting female university lecturers. In spite of this, Emmy underwent the qualification exam and the maths faculty announced their wish to hire her, at a very low rank. This sparked enormous controversy, as it opened the doors for a woman to eventually sit on the university\u2018s Senate. One academic complained, \"What will our soldiers think when they return to the university and find that they are required to learn at the feet of a woman?\" The Prussian ministry would not grant an exception for Emmy, but allowed her to lecture under a male colleague\u2018s name, unpaid. It was made clear that she would not be allowed any formal academic title anywhere in Germany. ",

In 1922, the Prussian ministry conferred on her the title \u2018 nicht beamteter ausserordentlicher Professor\u2018 (\u2018unofficial, extraordinary professor\u2018), granting her an extremely low salary. She was one of two women among 235 male faculty members at the university; G\u00f6ttingen never made her a \u2018real\u2019 professor. Emmy Noether was the only person invited to give a plenary address at the 1932 International Congress of Mathematicians in Z\u00fcrich. This was seen by many as the high point of her career. The following year she was forced to leave her job and country when the Nazis rose to power and dismissed all Jews from university positions. Her last years were spent teaching at Bryn Mawr College in the US. In 1935, at the height of her creative powers, she died from a post- operative infection at the age of 53. Scientific achievements In her lifetime, Emmy Noether helped to turn algebra in a completely new direc- tion and changed the current thinking on mathematics. She was an authority on invariants, which concern things that remain constant in a changing environment and are an important concept in relativity. Her work formed the basis of many famous publications and theories, and \u2018Noether\u2018s Theorem\u2018, which proves that the laws of physics are independent of time or place, laid the foundations for quantum physics. At her death she was publicly remembered by Einstein, among others. ",

The daughter of a doctor, she grew up in an intellectually stimulating, medical and artistic milieu. Johanna attended a girls\u2019 secondary school in Amsterdam, which she completed in 1900. Her subsequent studies and career took her to Germany, Switzerland and as far away as Indonesia, Japan and the United States. A woman\u2019s woman Throughout her life, the Netherlands\u2019 first woman professor was well-known for being warm and hospitable, a great lover of music and a \u2018party animal\u2019. She never described herself as a feminist, but the cause of other women scientists was always close to her heart. For instance, in the United States in 1915, she criticised the way in which female colleagues were restricted in their professional activities there. She was also ac- tive in national and international unions for women academics. Between 1932 and 1936, she was the president of the International Federation of University Women. By 1958, she had retired from the various positions she held. Soon after, Johanna was diagnosed with arteriosclerosis. She died in Baarn, the Netherlands in 1961. Purveyor of culture For a Dutch woman with her kind of education, going abroad was the only way to earn a postgraduate degree. After gaining a qualification to teach plant and animal science at secondary school, Johanna Westerdijk moved to Munich in 1904, not to teach, but to conduct research on moss. A year later, she moved to Zurich where she studied moss regeneration, earning her PhD cum laude in 1906. That same year, Westerdijk became the director of the small and private Amsterdam-based Phytopathological Laboratory Willie Commelin Scholten. In 1907, she received the fungus collection of the International Association of Botanists. She was to nurture this into a world-leading repository which, in 1932, ",

Under her steward- ship over nearly half a century, the CBS\u2019s collection grew from just 80 sample cultures to some 11 000. In 1913, Westerdijk went on a study trip to Indonesia, Japan and the United States during which she made a lot of important connections, not least among colonial entrepreneurs, that would help in her work. Later in her career, she also visited South Africa where she helped found a similar laboratory at the University of Pretoria. Westerdijk was appointed professor extraordinarius of plant path- ology at the University of Utrecht in 1916 \u2013 a second professorship followed in 1930 at the University of Amsterdam. In 1936, she received an honorary doctor- ate from the University of Coimbra in Portugal. Golden mould In 1920, Utrecht University was given a large private garden (the Canton park) in Baarn (near Utrecht) that was turned into a hortus botanicus . When a neighbour- ing villa was put on the market, Westerdijk convinced the board of the laboratory that the botanical garden\u2019s future success depended on buying the property. Soon after, the laboratory and the fungus collection, as well as the related re- search facilities, moved there. Under her direction, a large research programme began on parasitic fungi and other subjects. A total of 56 botanists received their PhDs under Westerdijk, including 25 women. One of her first doctoral students discovered the cause of elm disease, which is why it is known today as \u2018Dutch elm disease\u2019. ",

(cid:3) Research at the laboratory and bureau gradually became more fundamental in nature. It focused on the life cycles of pathogenic fungi and on the redefining of the species concept, based on both their pathogenic behaviour on host plants and their appearance in pure culture. Today, the CBS maintains over 50 000 strains of micro- organisms, making it the most diverse reference centre for mycological research. Scientific achievements Johanna Westerdijk is remembered as the first woman to gain tenure as a profes- sor in the Netherlands. This trailblazing achievement paved the way for future generations of her countrywomen to enter the hallowed chambers of academia\u2019s upper echelons. Despite her refusal to define herself as a feminist, throughout her career she took many practical steps to further the cause of female researchers and academics. Scientifically, Westerdijk created what has become an internationally renowned laboratory. In addition, she brought together the world\u2019s greatest collection of fungus cultures, which has advanced our understanding of botany and helped uncover treatments for plant fungal diseases, such as Dutch elm disease. Independent of Alexander Fleming\u2019s discovery of penicillin, the Willie Commelin Scholten lab tested the antagonism of Penicillium Expansum on several bacteria. In the 1940s and 1950s, the medical applications of fungi were to grow in im- portance. In 1952, she became the second woman to be admitted to the Royal Dutch Academy of Arts and Sciences. ",

She grew up in scenic Kauhajoki, a small and sparsely populated town in western Finland. Karin complained that Agnes was a \u201cstrange child\u201d \u2013 and compared with the expectations of how \u201cgood girls\u201d were supposed to behave, she was. From the age of four, her mother would have to dress her earlier than her siblings to enable her to go out on the farm with her father. In the 1890s, her family established a school of animal husbandry in their estate\u2019s main building and little Agnes sat among the students and listened. At the age of ten, she attended anatomy classes and studied the organs of slaughtered calves. This marked the birth of her fascination with the animal world. Dreams on ice Agnes asked the teacher whether a girl could become a veterinary surgeon and he told her that it was an impossible idea. When she heard this, she rushed into the ice house, sat on a block of ice and wept bitterly. Despite this discourage- ment, she resolved not to put her dream on ice and to become a vet when she grew up. This steely determination and vigour were to drive and motivate her throughout her life to surmount the obstacles that stood in the way of her dream. In order to gain an education and pursue a career as a veterinary surgeon, she had to over- come the objections of her parents, travel abroad, scrimp and save, and deal with the prejudices of the faculty and colleagues. On top of all that, she raised her two sons alone following the break-up of her short-lived marriage. Galloping towards success As a child, Agnes Sj\u00f6berg attended the Swedish-language girls\u2019 school in Vaasa on the west coast of Finland. When she expressed a desire to continue learning, her father objected on the grounds that when she got married she would not need an education to look after her husband and family. Instead, she was forced to go to a sort of finishing school to teach her how to manage a household. Only after finishing her studies there and having taken care of her family\u2018s household for three years, did her father let her enter upper secondary school. In 1911, Agnes completed her matriculation examination as a private student at a Swedish-language co-educational school in Kuopio, eastern Finland. Meanwhile, she went to work in Pori on the west coast of Finland for a vet called Engdahl \u2013 who later admitted that he had only taken her on for a joke. ",

However, Finland was part of the Russian empire at the time and Switzerland had imposed restrictions on travel from there in a bid to prevent Russian Nihilists from entering its territory. Opening the stable door Instead, that same year she moved to Dresden in Germany in the hope of finding a university place there. The confused rector of the city\u2019s College of Veterinary Medicine consented to admitting Agnes as a \u201ctest case\u201d. She became the first female student at the school, among 300 male students: \u201cAfter all, a female veterinary surgeon is well suited to handle small domestic animals,\u201d the rector reasoned. However, Agnes preferred horses. The following year, in 1912, Agnes transferred to the Veterinary College in Berlin. The professors there recognised her talent and she was praised for her scientific thinking. Nevertheless, her research was published in her supervisor\u2019s name. Despite her family\u2019s initial reservations about her further education, it was only with their financial support that she was able to travel abroad to pursue her dreams. However, she struggled to make ends meet, and even went hungry on occasions, particularly during World War I. ",

After the war, Agnes returned to Finland to pursue a career as a municipal vet- erinary surgeon in western Finland.

Attitudes towards her began to change in 1921 when she became the first vet to artificially inseminate a horse. In 1938, she started her own practice in Sein\u00e4joki, western Finland, which she was to run until 1955. She also made study and research trips abroad. In 1923, she toured faculties of veterinary science in the USA and the UK. In 1925, she spent 18 months in Vienna studying parasites.

Her father, Oscar Hertwig, was a renowned anatomist and biologist, and her uncle, Richard Hertwig, is known as the founder of experimental zoology. Together, they developed the germ-layer theory which proposes that all organs and tissues are based on three basic tissue layers. Her brother G\u00fcnther was also a biologist. Paula\u2018s father encouraged her interest in evolutionary biology and genetics from an early age. She studied zoology, botany and chemistry at the Friedrich Wilhelms University (now Humboldt University) in Berlin, and became the first woman to gain a postdoctoral degree (\u2018habilitation\u2018) allowing her to apply for a professorship at her university. However, her decision to embark on a career in research came at a price: at that time, German law stipulated that female employees in state institutions who married had to give up their position. Paula remained single throughout her life. Sibling alliances Paula\u2018s older brother G\u00fcnther studied medicine at university and, like his sister, pursued a career in research. They were extremely close and lived and worked together for much of their lives; in 1946, he accepted a professorship and the two moved to Martin Luther University of Halle in East Germany. By the time she retired, Paula was a recognised expert in radiation genetics. Crucially, she was one of the first people to identify the damaging effects of radiation, in particular on the offspring of those exposed to radiation. After the death of her beloved brother in 1970, Paula moved to Villingen in southern West Germany, where she died on 31 March 1983. Embryonic ideas Paula\u2018s passion was investigating the effect of radiation on eggs and sperm and on embryonic development. During her early career, she worked closely with her father at the Anatomical-Biological Institute in Berlin, and was awarded her doctorate from Friedrich Wilhelms University (FWU) in Berlin in 1916. Until then, no woman had been granted a \u2018habilitation\u2018 from the university; a 1908 law excluded women from holding university faculty positions. However, Paula had a strong ally in her mentor, the zoologist Karl Heider, who had a positive attitude towards women in science and worked hard to allow their admittance to the faculty. In a letter to the dean of the university in 1919, he argued his wider case for the habilitation of women, and described Paula as ready for the step. \u201cI consider her to be knowledgeable, thoughtful, with good critical skills and the ability to express herself clearly,\u201d he wrote.

She was the first woman to do so, and one of only four before the 1908 ban was repealed in 1920. But she was allowed to apply only in principle; no woman scientist was to become a full professor in Germany until the 1950s. A talented teacher In 1921, Paula moved to the heredity and husbandry department of the Agricultural College and was given the title of assistant. She also lectured at FWU teach- ing heredity as part of the medical faculty between 1927 and 1945, having been granted the unpensioned position of \u2018unofficial, extraordinary professor\u2018. Her strong teaching skills and ability to explain complex issues in a simple way soon won her the admiration of her colleagues. When the agricultural college was incorporated into the university faculty in 1935, she was paid as an assistant for its Institute for Heredity. Throughout this period, Paula continued to investigate the effects of radiation in living creatures. In the course of her experiments on mice, she isolated mutant strains that would go on to serve as models of human ear, nose, throat and eye diseases. Paula\u2018s research was vital in demonstrating the link between radiation of the genital area and health problems in the offspring. With the help of the German Society for Heredity Research, she worked hard to communicate her findings to the medical community. Yet despite Paula\u2018s ongoing scientific achievements and hard-earned qualification, many were reluctant to grant her a full professorship. ",

In 1920, they graduated and got married, with Gerty converting to Catholicism. A career on two continents During their first year of marriage, the Coris collaborated on a study of the immune bodies in blood. They both accepted positions at the University of Vienna and Gerty subsequently spent two years at the Karolinen-Kinderspital der Stadt Wien, working on the problem of temperature regulation in congenital myxoedema before and after thyroid therapy. The Coris soon began to realise that, in terms of both political stability and their careers, the situation was better in the United States. Defying the detractors Crossing the Atlantic in 1922, they took up posts at the New York Institute for the Study of Malignant Diseases (later the Roswell Park Memorial Institute) in Buffalo, New York State. Carl was advised by his colleagues and employers not to continue to collaborate with his wife, as it would be detrimental to his career. ",

During their time at the Institute, they jointly published 50 papers and Gerty published 11 on her own. Having become naturalised US citizens in 1928, the following year the Coris put forward the theory that would later win them the Nobel Prize and which bears their name. The Cori cycle explains the movement of energy in the body \u2013 from muscle to the liver and then back to the muscle \u2013 showing the role of lactic acid in the conversion of glucose to glycogen. A Nobel ending As the Roswell Institute was not the right place to pursue their particular research interest, the Coris decided to find a new working environment. Nepotism rules, however, prevented the hiring of a couple, which meant that several universities refused to appoint them both and were only willing to take Carl. Finally, in 1931, the Coris moved to the medical school at Washington University in St Louis, Missouri, where Carl was made chair of the department of pharmacology. Gerty was hired as a research associate on a token salary, but at least they could continue their co-operative work on glycogen. It was not until Carl was appointed chair of the new biochemistry department, only a few months before the Coris received the Nobel Prize, in 1947, that Gerty was given a full faculty appointment as a professor of biochemistry. That same year, she began to show signs of myelofibrosis, a rare blood disease affecting bone marrow. She fought the disease for ten years, refusing to give up her research activities until the last few months of her life. On 26 October 1957, Gerty died of kidney failure. ",

(cid:3) Scientific achievements Gerty and her husband were awarded numerous accolades for their ground- breaking work, including having a crater on the moon named in their honour. The greatest of these honours, however, was the Nobel Prize for Medicine or Physiology, which the Coris shared with the Argentinean Bernardo Houssay in 1947. The award recognised their work on how glycogen (a derivative of glucose) is broken down and resynthesised in the body for storage and as a source of energy. The Coris are also remembered for the discovery and isolation of the molecule glucose-1 phosphate (later called cori ester). Working on her own, Gerty developed the conceptual classification of glycogen-storage diseases in children and she was the first scientist to demonstrate that a defect in an enzyme was the cause of a human genetic disease. This discovery was described in 1958 as \u201can unmatched scientific achievement\u201d. Taken as a whole, the work that the Coris carried out on carbohydrate metabolism contributed greatly to the understanding and treatment of diabetes and other metabolic diseases. The couple also played an important role in scientific history with their struggle to have Gerty\u2019s contribution to their co-operative work fully recognised. ",

Rather than sending their children for formal schooling, the Curies and their friends banded together to form \u2018The Co-operative\u2019, which brought together many of France\u2019s foremost academics to teach each other\u2019s children. Ir\u00e8ne was taught in this manner until 1912 when she went to the Coll\u00e8ge S\u00e9vign\u00e9 to take her baccalaureate. In 1914, she enrolled at the Sorbonne\u2019s Faculty of Science, but her studies were soon interrupted by the outbreak of World War I. In love and war During the war, Ir\u00e8ne served as a nurse radiographer, working with her mother in mobile field hospitals. They used primitive X-ray equipment, made possible by the work of Pierre and Marie Curie. These machines were a huge help to doctors in locating shrapnel in wounded soldiers, but exposed both Ir\u00e8ne and her mother to large doses of radiation. As an uneasy peace broke out across Europe, Ir\u00e8ne returned to Paris and her studies. Her doctoral thesis, completed in 1925, focused on the alpha rays of polonium, the second element discovered by her parents. Ir\u00e8ne carried out her research at the Radium Institute (now the Curie Institute), founded by her mother. It was here that she met a young scientist named Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Joliot who said of Ir\u00e8ne: \u201cWith her cold appearance, her forgetting to say hello, she didn\u2018t always cre- ate sympathy around her at the laboratory. In observing her, I discovered in this young woman, that others saw as a little brutish, an extraordinary, poetic and sensitive being.\u201d The pair married in 1926. The following year, their daughter H\u00e9l\u00e8ne was born, and in 1932 they had a son, Pierre. A nuclear alliance The Joliot-Curies forged a strong partnership both inside and out of the research laboratory. They worked together on natural and artificial radioactivity, trans- mutation of elements and nuclear physics. Their greatest breakthrough came in 1934 when the couple managed to generate the first artificial radioactivity from stable elements. This was achieved by using alpha particles to bombard aluminium, magnesium and boron, in separate experiments. From the aluminium, they were able to produce radioactive phosphorus, from the boron, a radio- active form of nitrogen, and from the magnesium, silicon. This work led to Ir\u00e8ne and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric being awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry. ",

She continued to work on the actions of neutrons on the heavy elements, making advances that were to prove an important step in the discovery of nuclear fission. At the same time, she had developed an interest in politics, having been appointed Under-secretary of State for Scientific Research in 1936. In particular, Ir\u00e8ne was devoted to furthering the advancement of women both socially and educationally. She was a member of the National Committee of the French Women\u2019s Union and of the World Peace Council. A Swiss interlude In 1939, war broke out once again. Fearing the impact of their work falling into the wrong hands, the Joliot-Curies locked away their research on nuclear fission in the vaults of the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences, where it remained for a decade. During World War II, Ir\u00e8ne fell ill with tuberculosis and was forced to go to Switzerland to convalesce, leaving her family in Paris. Missing them dreadfully, she risked the dangerous journey to France several times in order to see them. More than once this meant detention by German troops at the border. ",

Ir\u00e8ne never saw the comple- tion of this project as, on 17 March 1956, she died from leukaemia, caused by exposure to radioactive elements in the course of her work.

Prior to this, no one had ever succeeded in creating artificial radio- active materials and the advance meant that radioactive materials, increasingly used in medicine, could be produced quickly, cheaply and in large quantities. The Joliot-Curies were rewarded for their efforts with the Nobel Prize for chem- istry in 1935. Ir\u00e8ne\u2019s later work on nuclear particles represented an important step towards the achievement of nuclear fission.

Elizaveta spent most of her childhood in Vienna, until the family moved to the Bulgarian capital Sofia in 1909, where her father was eventually to become one of the country\u2019s best-known surgeons. He organised the construction of the city\u2019s Red Cross hospital and became its unpaid director. With a musician for a mother and a famous artist for an aunt, Elizaveta grew up in an environment that was both artistic and scientific. In 1917, Elizaveta moved back to Vienna where she started her university life. From then on, her career was to take her backwards and forwards between Austria and Bulgaria, as well as to England, where she conducted research at the top nuclear institutes in these countries In the red Despite her formidable intellect and scientific stature, Elizaveta was an unassum- ing and friendly person who fraternised with her students and was respected and loved by them. She disliked intensely the political currents sweeping across her country during the Second World War. \u201c[Elizaveta] was violently anti-com- munist, had a horror of gunfire, and used to come out in spots about every three weeks after her experiments,\u201d recalled Mary Cartwright, a fellow scientist at Cambridge. This political aversion was to cost her dearly following the Soviet invasion of Bulgaria in 1944. The Communist party undertook a purge of the entire educa- tional system to weed out \u201cfascist\u201d sympathisers. Elizaveta was not removed but her name appeared on the extended list of \u201cunreliable scientists\u201d. Numerous fur- ther attempts to sideline her were made during her life and the ban on her travel- ling abroad made her unable to interact and collaborate with fellow scientists. Elizaveta\u2019s fears of the effects of radiation were well-founded and she, like many of her contemporaries, died of cancer in 1968. ",

Her thesis on \u201celectric figures on different mate- rials\u201d earned her a PhD in 1920. She conducted research in radio-luminescence at the Radium Institute in Vienna. In 1923, she returned to Bulgaria where she worked as a \u2018guest fellow\u2019 at Sofia University because there were no tenured positions available. There, she started her research in a small attic at the University\u2019s Physics Institute. However, the lack of facilities and her inability to advance prompted her return to Vienna. As Elizaveta was not Austrian, she could not be taken on as a research assistant and worked on a temporary contract. When her position was terminated in 1933, she was almost forced to abandon her research but was able to support herself through private tuition while she continued her lab work unpaid. In 1935, after more than a decade without tenure, Elizaveta\u2019s talents and contribution finally gained recognition. She was awarded a Yarrow Scientific Research Fellowship \u2013 set up to enable gifted women scientists to carry out research \u2013 at Cambridge University\u2019s Cavendish Laboratory, one of the world\u2019s leading nuclear research institutes at the time.

Unfortunately, her efforts to set up her department from scratch co- incided with the outbreak of World War II. This led her to donate her own equipment to the university and many instruments had to be hand-built, while her office was transformed into a makeshift lab. After the war, a separate chair in atomic physics was created and Elizaveta was its first occupant. In the early 1950s, several attempts were made to strip her of her position. Official documents from that period describe her as an \u201cenemy of the regime\u201d. Fortunately, two physicists, Georgi Nadjakov and Hristo Hristov, defended her with the respective authorities. As a result, she kept her position but was forced to move to the Institute of Physics at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. This suspicion cast a shadow over her until her death.

Her father Edward Payne was a lawyer, historian and musician who had married late in life and died when Cecilia was only four years old. His wife Elena was left widowed with three young children, but she was determined that they should receive a good education. A theological problem Cecilia was sent to a religious school which prized divinity far more than science, seeing the two to be at odds. But Bible study and daily visits to church were not what the budding scientist wanted and Cecilia took to faking fainting spells to get out of prayer. She resolved to teach herself the subjects she craved with the help of books. One teacher, however, noticed Cecilia\u2019s desire to learn and set about teaching her botany and chemistry. When she was 17, Cecilia was allowed to transfer to St Paul\u2019s Girls\u2019 School in London, where she was able to concentrate on scientific study. Botany eclipsed In 1919, Cecilia went up to the all-female Newnham College, Cambridge to read natural sciences. Her initial interest was in botany, but this soon made way for astronomy. The turning point came when she attended a lecture given by the astrophysicist Arthur Stanley Eddington, in which he described his expedition to Africa to observe a solar eclipse and test Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity. Cecilia transcribed the address verbatim. At this time, the University of Cambridge did not grant degrees to women. So, when Cecilia completed her studies in 1922, she left empty-handed. Going stellar Having faced such discrimination in the UK, Cecilia decided that more opportunities would be open to her in the United States. She had met Harlow Shapley, the director of the Harvard College Observatory, when he visited Cambridge, and wrote to him about the possibility of studying under him. She arrived in the other Cambridge (Massachusetts) in September 1923. Shapley encouraged Cecilia to start work on a PhD, even though at that stage the astronomy department did not have a doctorate programme. In only two years, she completed Stellar Atmospheres, which the astronomer Otto Struve would later describe as \u201cthe most brilliant PhD thesis ever written in astronomy\u201d.

The astronomer Henry Norris Russell persuaded Cecilia not to include this conclusion in her thesis, because it was so far-removed from the held view that stars had the same composition as the Earth. Four years later, however, Russell arrived at the same supposition via a different route. Publishing it, he made perfunctory reference to Payne\u2019s work and thus it is he who is often remembered for the discovery. Not-so star-crossed lovers After the publication of her thesis, Cecilia moved on to study stars of high lumi- nosity (stars that radiate high levels of energy) in order to learn more about the structure of the Milky Way. Despite her achievements, she was not given an official faculty post and instead worked as Shapley\u2019s assistant. In 1931, Cecilia became an American citizen. She returned to Europe in 1933 and embarked on a tour of observatories. Whilst visiting G\u00f6ttingen in Germany, she met fellow astronomer Sergei Gaposchkin, a Russian exile, whose job security was threatened under the new Nazi re- gime. Cecilia helped him to get visa and a research position at the Harvard Observatory, which brought him to America in November 1933. Not long after that, the pair decided to marry. They went on to have three children: Edward, Katherine and Peter. Galaxies far, far away For most of the rest of their lives, Cecilia and Sergei worked together on astro- nomical problems, though Cecilia was clearly, as the director of the Observatory ",

This data was used to determine the path of stellar evolution, which was described in Cecilia\u2019s books Variable Stars and Galactic Structure (1954) and The Galactic Novae (1957). Wide horizons Cecilia\u2019s impressive work had not gone unnoticed. In 1938, she was given a faculty position and, in 1956, was made a full professor and head of the astron- omy department. This made her the first woman to run a Harvard department. Cecilia had not devoted herself to her work in search of recognition, however, and late in her life she advised young scientists: \u201cDo not undertake a scientific career in quest of fame or money. There are easier and better ways to reach them. Undertake it only if nothing else will satisfy you; for nothing else is probably what you will receive. Your reward will be the widening of the horizon as you climb. And if you achieve that reward you will ask no other.\u201d Having broadened her horizon and that of those around her, Cecilia died on 7 December 1979 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Scientific achievements In 1977, Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin was awarded the highest honour of the American Astronomical Society, the Henry Norris Russell lectureship. In her speech, she said: \u201cThe reward of the young scientist is the emotional thrill of being the first person in the history of the world to see something or to understand something. Nothing can compare with that experience... The reward of the old scientist is the sense of having seen a vague sketch grow into a masterly landscape.\u201d In the course of her career, Cecilia was the first person to see and understand many things, most notably the composition of the sun and the other stars in the universe. Cecilia wrote a number of books on astronomy and received numerous awards during her lifetime. Whilst still a student, she was made a member of the Royal Astronomical Society and went on to become a member of many more such academies. Her success also served as an incentive to bud- ding female astronomers and Cecilia nurtured the talents of many of them at the Harvard Observatory. ",

The city, the second largest in Estonia, has long been considered the intellectual and cultural capital of the country and Elise would retain a deep affection for Tartu throughout her life.

(cid:3) In 1925, at a meeting of the Society of Estonian Women Students, the young K\u00e4er mooted the idea of setting up an Estonian Association of University Women (EAN\u00dc). The suggestion proved popular and the new organisation held its first meeting in Tartu in May 1926. Elise was vice-chair of the fledgling association between 1925 and 1936, when she became chair of its medical committee. In that role, she influenced the drafting of a new law on childcare, among other things. In the 1930s, K\u00e4er- Kingisepp was also instrumental in organising protests by female academics against plans to cut the number of women students. These plans were part of a wider discussion in the country on how to deal with the \u201coverproduction of intellectuals\u201d. A historian Elise K\u00e4er-Kingisepp was fascinated by the history of medicine, a subject she threw herself into later in life when she had stopped teaching. K\u00e4er-Kingisepp died in her beloved home town of Tartu on 10 February 1989. Scientific achievements K\u00e4er-Kingisepp was one of the first women to obtain her doctorate in Estonia, and went on to become professor and Chair of Physiology and Biological Chemistry at the University of Tartu. She played a central role in ensuring that the university excelled in sports medicine, an area of science that had seen major advances during the course of her career. A scholar totally engaged in social debates, she organised her fellow women academics to defend their right to participate fully in higher education. ",

By the time she left Maria Terezia Girls\u2019 School in 1922, the empire had crumbled and Hungary was in political turmoil. Like many of her compatriots with German- sounding names, R\u00f3zsa changed hers to a more traditional Hungarian surname. Inspired by numbers The young R\u00f3zsa had been fascinated by science at school and so she enrolled at the oldest and largest university in Hungary, the P\u00e1zm\u00e1ny P\u00e9ter University (renamed E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University in 1950) to study chemistry. She soon found that her passion lay elsewhere, in the field of mathematics, and switched degree course to pursue this. R\u00f3zsa was taught by some of the most eminent mathematicians of the day, including Lip\u00f3t Fej\u00e9r and J\u00f3sef K\u00fcrsch\u00e1k. Whilst at university, she also met L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kalm\u00e1r, with whom she would collaborate for years to come. \u201cMathematics is beautiful\u201d Graduating in 1927, R\u00f3zsa was unable to find a permanent position, so she took jobs tutoring students privately and teaching in high schools. At the same time, she began her graduate studies, initially focusing on number theory. R\u00f3zsa became disheartened when she found that her results had already been proven by someone else. For a while, she turned her interests elsewhere, including to writing poetry, before her friend Kalm\u00e1r convinced her to resume mathematical endeavour. He encouraged her to look at the work of Kurt G\u00f6del, the Austrian- American mathematician, on the subject of incompleteness. A new field R\u00f3zsa focused on G\u00f6del\u2019s studies of recursive functions. She made her own, different proofs and, in 1932, she presented a paper at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Zurich, Switzerland. For this research, R\u00f3zsa was awarded her PhD summa cum laude in 1935. The work also helped to found the modern field of recursive function theory as a separate area of mathematical research and her later book, Recursive Functions (1951) was the first book devoted exclusively to the topic. History has largely overlooked this contribution, however, and R\u00f3zsa has been denied the recognition she deserves. ",

In 1937, she was appointed as contributing editor of the Journal of Symbolic Logic . Just as her career was beginning to take off, a setback materialised in the form of politics. In 1939, Hungary\u2019s pro-Nazi government passed anti-Jewish laws that forbade R\u00f3zsa from teaching and which led to her being briefly confined to a Budapest ghetto. Undeterred, R\u00f3zsa continued her research work throughout the Second World War. It was during this period that she wrote her work Playing with infinity , which discussed the fields of number theory and logic in terms accessible to the lay reader. Aunt R\u00f3zsa When the war ended in 1945, R\u00f3zsa was granted her first full-time teaching position when she joined the faculty of the Budapest Teachers\u2019 Training College. In 1952, she was the first Hungarian woman to be made an Academic Doctor of Mathematics. She taught at the college for a decade, until it closed in 1955, at which point she was made a full professor at E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University. A popular lecturer, she was known as \u2018Aunt R\u00f3zsa\u2019 to her students and carried on teaching until the age of 70. Even after her retirement, R\u00f3zsa continued her mathematical work, and her final book Recursive functions in computer theory was published in 1976, the year before her death. ",

She was active in promoting the teaching of mathematics in schools, particularly for girls and young women, and gave lectures on how \u201cmathematics is beautiful\u201d. Her own research work in the field of recursive function theory broke new ground and helped to establish it as a separate mathematical field. Although largely forgotten since her death, R\u00f3zsa was feted in her own lifetime. Amongst the prizes awarded to her were the Kossuth Prize, given by the Hungarian government in 1951 for her work Recursive Functions ; the Mano Beke Prize from the Janos Bolyai Mathematical Society in 1953; and the State Prize, Silver Degree (1970) and Gold Degree (1973). In 1973, she was also elected the first female mathematician to become a member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. P\u00e9ter also found success with some of her published works, most notably Playing with infinity (1943), which was translated into at least 14 languages, and Recursive functions in computer theory (1976), which was only the second Hungarian mathematical book to be published in the Soviet Union \u2013 its subject matter is considered indispensable to the theory of computers. // Mass roll call of SA, SS, and NSKK troops (Nuremberg, 1935) // View of Budapest (the parliament) (cid:2) No other field can offer, to such an extent as mathematics, the joy of discovery, which is perhaps the greatest human joy.

She was the only child of Friedrich and Maria Goeppert. Her father, whom Maria idolised, was a sixth- generation university professor and he expected Maria to follow suit. He advised her to \u201cnever become just a woman\u201d, i.e. a housewife, as was still generally the norm at the time. Later in her life, she recalled: \u201cEver since I was a very small child, I knew that when I grew up, I was expected to acquire some training or education which would enable me to earn a living so that I would not be dependent on marriage.\u201d In 1910, the family moved to G\u00f6ttingen, Lower Saxony, where her father be- came professor of paediatrics at the town\u2019s university. He was also director of a children\u2019s hospital and founded a day-care centre for the children of working mothers. He loved and was loved by children. As a sign of this dedication, the family, despite their prosperity, dined on turnip soup and pigs\u2019 ears during the hyperinflation of the early 1920s to save food for the children at Friedrich\u2019s clinic. Brain gain Not only was her home life infused with learning, but she was surrounded by intelligence. Her young mind was exposed to the brilliance of some of the best brains of the time, including future Nobel laureates Enrico Fermi, Werner Heisenberg and Wolfgang Pauli. The university town, where academics \u2013 among the best-paid and most admired professions in Germany at the time \u2013 were like royalty, had a buzzing social scene. The parties thrown by Maria\u2019s mother in G\u00f6ttingen set the standard for hospitality, and the daughter \u2013 admired for her mix of beauty and brains \u2013 in herited her mother\u2019s socialising and entertaining finesse. In 1930, Maria married Joseph Edward Mayer, an American Rockefeller fellow who was working in G\u00f6ttingen and became a lodger in their house after her father died. Joseph was the assistant of James Franck, the Nobel Prize-winning physicist who regarded Maria as \u201cat least a niece\u201d. That same year, the couple moved to the United States, where they were to build their academic careers and have two children. In 1933, the year Adolf Hitler came to power, Maria acquired American citizenship. Over the coming decades, Maria would work as a physicist in some of America\u2019s top universities, but mostly as a volunteer. In 1972, the coma she had succumbed to in the previous year finally claimed her life. ",

The only privately endowed school which prepared girls for the abitur , the entrance examination for university, shut its doors during the hyperinflation of the early 1920s. The teachers, however, continued to instruct their pupils voluntarily. That is why in 1924, Maria was able to take the abitur examination in Hanover and begin her studies at G\u00f6ttingen University. The Nobel laureate Max Born, who played a pivotal role in establishing quantum mechanics, became her men- tor. \u201cShe went through all my courses with great industry and conscientiousness\u201d, he recalled, \u201cyet remained a gay and witty member of \u2018G\u00f6ttingen society\u2019.\u201d The year 1930 was to prove momentous for her. She earned her doctorate in theoretical physics, married and moved to the United States. Her arrival in America coincided with the Depression, when few universities were hiring. In addition, the strict rules against nepotism meant that the fact that she was a professor\u2019s wife did not help her prospects, nor did the US\u2019 late recognition of quantum mechanics. But her fascination with physics and the encouragement of her husband, who was viewed as more of a feminist than Maria, led her to work as a volunteer. \u201cI worked for a number of years without pay just for the fun of doing physics,\u201d she reminisced. From 1931 to 1939, she volunteered at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, where she managed to produce ten papers and a textbook. Between 1940 and 1946, she was at Columbia University. ",

She also worked on uranium isotope separation under Harold Urey and others who helped develop the atom bomb. The University of Chicago, to which she moved in 1946, was the first place she was greeted with open arms. There, she became a professor in the Physics Department and at the Institute for Nuclear Studies, as well the Argonne National Laboratory. It was in Chicago that she carried out the work for which she would earn a Nobel Prize in 1963: she developed a model for the nuclear shell struc- ture. She also collaborated on a book on the subject with a German scientist, Hans Jensen, who worked in the same field and was a co-winner of the Nobel Prize. In 1960, Maria finally became a full professor at the University of California, San Diego. Although suffering a stroke shortly after arriving, she continued to teach and conduct research there for many years. Scientific achievements Maria Goeppert-Mayer was the second woman to win a Nobel Prize in physics after Marie Curie. The fact that she worked for three decades in three fields for three different universities as a volunteer is unparalleled in the annals of Nobel history. She only gained paid tenure at the age of 53! Her model for the structure of the nuclear shell explained the baffling \u201cmagic numbers\u201d of nucleons in the nucleus of an atom which cause an atom to be extremely stable. She argued that the nucleus is like a series of closed shells, and pairs of neutrons and protons like to couple together in what is called spin orbit coupling. After receiving her Nobel, she admitted that: \u201cWinning the prize wasn\u2018t half as exciting as doing the work.\u201d Following her death, an award in her name was set up by the American Physical Society to honour young female physicists.

Not long after her birth, the family moved to Sudan where her father became the director of both education and antiquities. In fact, he so loved ar- chaeology that he became a keen archaeologist after his retirement. Her mother was also an enthusiast and became an authority on early weaving techniques. Despite Dorothy\u2019s love of chemistry, this passion for antiquity was transferred to their daughter and, just before going to university, she considered taking up archaeology full time after attending a dig with her parents in Jordan. Fortunately for physics and chemistry, she utilised her archaeologist\u2019s bent for digging deep under the surface to piece together the structure of biological molecules. Runs in the family In 1937, by which time she was an established research fellow, Dorothy married the historian Thomas Hodgkin who was a bohemian, bon vivant and political activist. Like her, he had a passion for history and, with his interest in Africa and the Arab world, he spent time in such places as Palestine and Ghana. The couple had three children. Their daughter also inherited the history gene and went off to Zambia to teach the subject. One of Dorothy\u2019s greatest scientific and political mentors was fellow chemist Professor John Desmond Bernal who was a communist (until 1956), and greatly influenced her life both scientifically and politically. Both unassuming and passionate, Dorothy cared greatly about issues of social inequalities and peace. ",

Large stretches of her childhood were spent apart from her parents who sent their children to school in the UK while they remained in Africa. In 1921, she entered the Sir John Leman Grammar School in Beccles, Suffolk, travelling abroad fre- quently to visit her parents in Cairo and Khartoum. From 1928 to 1932, Dorothy studied at Somerville College, which was also known as \u201cbluestockings college\u201d, at Oxford University. After attending a special course on crystallography, i.e. the study of the arrangement of atoms in solids, she decided to specialise in the emerging use of X-rays in this field. For that reason, she went to Cambridge in 1932, to study with J.D. Bernal. From 1934 onwards, she spent her entire research career at Somerville College, Oxford. In 1956, she became University Reader in X- ray Chrystallography. High-protein science Dorothy dedicated most of her research career to mapping the structure of proteins and other biological substances. Insulin was her toughest and most rewarding challenge. The complex and multifaceted hormone captured her imagination be- cause of the intricate and wide-ranging effect it has on the body. It took her and her team 35 years, between 1934 and 1969, to improve X-ray crystallography sufficiently to map out the complexity of this hormone. \u201cI used to say the evening that I developed the first X-ray photograph I took of insulin in 1935 was the most exciting moment of my life,\u201d she wrote in the British Medical Journal in 1971. \u201cBut the Saturday afternoon in late July 1969, when ",

Scientific achievements There was a time when there were plenty of theories about the structure and function of microscopic molecules, but few hard facts. It is difficult to understand what you cannot see, and that explains why Dorothy Crowfoot dedicated her life to unlocking the complex structures of molecules at the atomic level. She was not only a trailblazer in X-ray crystallography \u2013 which was critical in determining the structure of DNA and other bio- logical molecules \u2013 but she also created the field of protein crystallography. In fact, she is widely seen as being the sci- entist who most transformed crystallography from an art form into an indispensable scientific tool. Among her most influential discoveries were her confirmation of the theoretical structure of penicillin. Her decades-long pursuit of insulin must count as one of the most dogged quests in modern science. For her description of the structure of the vitamin B12, she received the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1964. ",

Her father was a prominent merchant banker and her extended family counted her uncle Herbert Samuel, who was Home Secretary (Minister of the Interior) in 1916, and her aunt Helen Franklin, a trade union and women\u2019s suffrage activist. Members of her family were also active in settling Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi persecution. Family holidays were often walking tours, and Franklin developed an enduring passion for hiking, as well as foreign travel. As a reflection of this interest, she learnt to speak excellent French, good Italian and some German. Rays of knowledge Science was a lifelong passion and, as her mother recalled: \u201cAll her life, Rosalind knew exactly where she was going.\u201d Franklin started her education at an inde- pendent girls\u2019 school in London and attended Cambridge University where she eventually gained a PhD in chemistry. She then went on to pursue a successful research career as a biophysicist who contributed to our understanding of the structure of several large molecules, in- cluding DNA, coal and viruses, until her life was cut tragically short by cancer, possibly due to excessive exposure to the X-ray radiation she used in her research. In January 1958, she died at the age of 37. X-ray vision Franklin was educated at St Paul\u2019s Girls School, an independent school in London which focused on preparing girls for careers. There, she excelled in science, Latin and sport. In 1938, Franklin went to Cambridge University where she studied chemistry. When she graduated in 1941, she only received a \u201ctitular\u201d degree because the university had not yet begun to award full degrees to women. \u201cScience and everyday life cannot and should not be separated,\u201d she wrote in a letter to her father in the summer of 1940. Following her own advice, Franklin began her research career by focusing on topics relevant to the war effort at the British Coal Utilisation Research Association. There, she focused on the porosity of coal which became the basis for her PhD thesis which she completed in 1945. After that, she turned her attention to organic molecules. ",

In 1951, Franklin moved back to Britain to work at King\u2019s College London, where she began her pioneering work on DNA, which was to become her most endur- ing legacy. Deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA as it is most commonly known, is often described as the blueprint or code of all living organisms. At the time, the genetic significance of DNA was widely recognised but no one knew what it looked like at the molecular level \u2013 and Franklin\u2019s research was to lay the groundwork for identifying the distinct double-helix structure of the DNA mol ecule. Her X-ray photographs, including the famous \u2018Photo 51\u2019, were to prove invaluable to the work of Francis Crick and James Watson who were awarded \u2013 along with Maurice Wilkins \u2013 a joint Nobel Prize for describing the structure of DNA. Scientific achievements Despite her untimely death, Rosalind Franklin\u2019s life was replete with scientific achievements, although she was under-recognised during her own life. Her major contribution was to help advance our understanding of microscopic structures. Her investigations into the porosity of coal sparked the idea of high-strength carbon fibres, such as modern composite materials. In her later career, Franklin concentrated on the little-understood microscopic world of viruses. She focused on the tobacco-mosaic and polio viruses. But it is her pioneering work on DNA which has been her most notable legacy. ",

Some accuse her peers at King\u2019s College, including Wilkins, of sexism and seeking to undermine Franklin and rob her of recognition by allowing Crick and Watson access to her work. Others contend that the sharing of such information at the time was not unusual. What is clearer is that there is a general consensus that Franklin deserved a Nobel Prize. In fact, Watson himself has suggested that she should have been co-awarded the chemistry prize, while he and Crick should have got the medi- cine prize. However, the significance of the discovery of the structure of DNA was not generally understood until after Franklin\u2019s death, and Nobel Prizes are never awarded posthumously. Whether she would have been awarded one had she lived or whether she would have fallen victim to institutionalised sexism is a question we will never be able to answer. Franklin received numerous posthumous recognitions and awards, including the naming of a US university after her, as well as halls and residences at the institutions where she had worked or studied.

        "Today, women are actively participating in science, while the number of women among the world\u2019s top scientists is growing. In fact, the face of modern science would be unrecognisable without the major contributions made by women. Women still face a lot of obstacles in science which can be summed up using metaphors such as the glass ceiling, the sticky floor and the glass cliff. The role of women in research excellence is still an issue, as well as their low numbers in top positions. That is why policy changes are needed to tap women\u2019s talents and resources to the full. For much of history, women were officially excluded from the scientific realm. Moreover, they often encountered loving parents who tried to discourage their passions for \u2018unfeminine subjects\u2019 such as geology or mathematics. The lucky few had fathers, mothers, husbands or distant admirers who encouraged their scientific ambitions. This volume shows that, despite the invisibility of women in the historical narrative of mainstream science, it does not mean that science was always exclusively a man\u2019s world. Throughout the centuries, many women managed to overcome their marginalisation and excel in their chosen field, making vital additions to the sum of human knowledge. This book tells the compelling stories of these heroines of European science \u2013 some sung but many unsung \u2013 and, through their narratives, it enriches and completes the history of human knowledge by highlighting the role of women.
