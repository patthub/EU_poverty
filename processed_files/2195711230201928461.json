        "Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee on \u2018 Taking into account the needs of older people \u2019 (2009/C 77/26) On 18 February 2008 the Commission decided to consult the European Economic and Social Committee, under Article 262 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, on Taking into account the needs of older people. The Section for Employment, Social Affairs and Citizenship, which was responsible for preparing the Committee's work on the subject, adopted its opinion on 11 September 2008. The rapporteur was Ms Heinisch. At its 447th plenary session, held on 17 and 18 September 2008 (meeting of 18 September), the European Economic and Social Committee adopted the following opinion by 106 votes to 32 with 20 abstentions. 1. Summary and recommendations 1.1 Justification 1.1.1 The demographic changes that are taking place in Europe are hallmarked by sharp rises in the number of older people, while overall population numbers are falling ( 1 ). The Council has made a number of statements on ageing. This trend varies from region to region. The European Union is thus facing some major social challenges ( 2 ). The Commission will adopt a communication by the end of 2008 offering proposals on how best to take into account the needs of an ageing population with support from the Structural Funds. 1.1.2 This opinion places special emphasis on the acknowledgement and appreciation of older people, as well as preventing discrimination against them and preserving their dignity. It must be recognised that older people are not a homo- genous group in terms of ability, financial security or health and social needs, so that policies and services should reflect that \u2018 one size fits all \u2019 or age segmentation are not appropriate. 1.1.3 Therefore, this opinion touches upon the spectrum of issues which affect individuals from formal retirement into very old age. This of course includes \u2014 without it being reiterated on every occasion \u2014 men and women, older disabled people and older people with an immigrant background. 1.1.4 This document does not examine the requirements associated with older workers and dependent, older people needing care because a large number of proposals have already been drawn up on these matters ( 3 ). However, the EESC would stress the importance of the \u2018 life cycle \u2019 approach to an ageing society to prevent discrimination and stereotyping and the need for integrated policies across the generations. 1.1.5 In order for older people to continue to participate in society and to live a decent life, it is essential that they have financial security and voluntary access to opportunities for meaningful activities, including lifelong learning, employment and voluntary work and the use of new technologies. In addi- tion, transport, energy, housing and health care should be avail- able, affordable and accessible. 1.2 Recommendations 1.2.1 In order to ensure that the growing numbers of older people living in urban and rural areas have sustainable living conditions and access to activities at a time of changing circum- stances, the Committee calls for the following measures: \u2014 regular drafting of national and regional situation reports ; \u2014 compiling and disseminating of examples of best prac- tices of Member States; \u2014 promoting a new image of old age , which acknowledges the lifelong achievements of older people (including those of migrants) and respect for old age in politics, business and society; \u2014 media campaigns on active ageing ; 31.3.2009 C 77/115 Official Journal of the European Union EN ( 1 ) See the information report of the Section for Employment, Social Affairs and Citizenship CES 930/99 final; SEC (2007) 638 Commission Staff Working Document \u2018 Europe's Demographic Future: Facts and Figures \u2019 .

        "\u2014 measures should be taken, particularly with regard to services of general interest, infrastructure, the supply of goods and services, financing, housing, health care services, the organisation of the end of life and participation in social life. Target group: Member States, European Parliament, Committee of the Regions, European Economic and Social Committee. \u2014 establishment of an additional Expert Group on Old Age within the framework of the European Commission's expert group on demographic issues ( 4 ); \u2014 establishment of a European Alliance for an active life in old age along the lines of the European Alliance for Families ( 5 ), which among other things organises workshops and conferences; \u2014 establishment of a European Centre for Age Research to process, collate and exchange information, to ascertain a need for more extensive research and to promote research in this area; \u2014 incorporation of an interdisciplinary focus on older people with its own budget in the 8th research framework programme; \u2014 creation of a European internet portal providing the public with information from all directorates-general on initiatives relating to old age; \u2014 creation of local, regional and national internet portals along the lines of the European internet portal; \u2014 support for a Demography Fund ( 6 ) as part of the Struc- tural Funds to provide financial compensation for regions which are taking active steps to deal with demographic change (e.g. active family policy); \u2014 inclusion of new priorities in the Lifelong Learning Programme to train support workers to assist with the tran- sition between various stages of life. Target group: EU council presidencies, European Parliament, European Commission . 1.2.2 In order to achieve this, an approach to sustainable management must be pursued which is also capable of contri- buting to the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy for economic growth and jobs. 2. General observations 2.1 This exploratory opinion focuses on the need for action in European regions. A redistribution of available resources is necessary in all countries ( 7 ), which will increase the burden on citizens living in urban and rural areas. At the same time, local infrastructure will be faced with significant demands to adapt ( 8 ). Innovative and integrated approaches are especially needed to ensure that regions and communes are able to respond to demographic changes. 3. The areas in need of action Several fundamental requirements have to be met in order to ensure that older people have a secure, healthy and active life. These relate to the following areas: 3.1 Services of general interest 3.1.1 Services of general interest are an essential means of ensuring respect for human dignity and they safeguard the indi- vidual's right to comprehensive protection of his or her basic rights. They enable citizens to exercise their rights in practice. In concrete terms, these services affect, among other things, spatial planning and the environment ( 9 ), especially municipal infra- structures. Shrinking population numbers, especially in rural areas ( 10 ), mean that for economic reasons essential services will in future no longer be available or affordable, will be completely abolished or will be unable to meet new requirements. This is a question of providing basic services and ensuring that the whole population has access to them, while specifically taking account of the particular requirements of older people and those needing care. This concerns: \u2014 energy supplies, in particular electricity, gas and heating; \u2014 water management, waste management and prevention; \u2014 safety and cleanliness of public spaces; \u2014 public services administration. 31.3.2009 C 77/116 Official Journal of the European Union EN ( 4 ) Commission decision 2007/397/EC.

        "3.1.2 Transport infrastructures and the supply of goods and services to cover everyday needs Independence and mobility are key requirements for quality of life and activity in old age ( 11 ) ( 12 ). For this the following are necessary: \u2014 shops that can be easily reached offering unfettered access and selling affordable goods for everyday needs as well as accessibility of key places such as the post office, the bank, pharmacy, cemetery, and public buildings and facilities, espe- cially those of local and regional authorities which enable older people to participate in society, such as local authority offices, citizens' advice bureaux, etc.; \u2014 availability, accessibility and affordability of (local) public transport; \u2014 transport, especially in areas with low population density; \u2014 availability and accessibility of public spaces (footpaths, places to sit, street lighting, transport safety, etc.). 3.1.3 Housing The current housing supply may not meet the needs of an ageing population in Europe with the emphasis on continued independence in their own home. The design and standards for new-build housing need to take into account the loss of physical, sensory or mental abilities and to use energy and tech- nologically efficient systems (e.g. Ambient Assisted Living ) to enable continued independence. Such an approach would also be advantageous across the generations. The authorities in Member States responsible for meeting housing needs should ensure that there are services in place to assist in adapting current houses as well as promoting new concepts in housing design and community living, including appropriate financial and legal measures. 3.1.4 Health services Reliable health care located close to home and geared to older people's requirements becomes increasingly important as people get older ( 13 ). Such health care is seriously under threat in rural and/or remote regions with low population density as a result of a further decline in the population coupled with the fact that many of the doctors still practising are themselves ageing. There is an urgent need to further develop comprehensive medical care, with good regional coverage. This entails (including protec- tion of the rights of the older people as patients ( 14 )): \u2014 medical, especially geriatric care and rehabilitation by doctors and service providers trained in gerontology and geriatrics; \u2014 out-patient care services and basic assistance through outreach services; \u2014 palliative care and psychological support services to families; \u2014 advice and information on patient rights and support options; \u2014 advice and information services and facilities and incentives for prevention (enabling people to learn about healthy diet, physical exercise, preventing falls, and healthy lifestyles asso- ciated with special bonuses); \u2014 technical assistance resources and support systems without replacing human assistance (see section on access to ICT); \u2014 promotion or creation of formal and informal social support systems, including citizens' advice bureaux, self-help groups, groups for family carers and neighbourhood help arrangements. Tried and tested models for such support systems already exist in various Member States ( 15 ). 3.2 Arrangements for emergencies and a dignified end to life 3.2.1 Emergencies Precautions must be taken so that older people who are not able to help themselves can be offered timely assistance in the event of an emergency, such as a flood, prolonged heatwave or disaster. 31.3.2009 C 77/117 Official Journal of the European Union EN ( 11 ) See EESC opinion of 29.5.2008 on the Green paper: Towards a new culture for urban mobility , rapporteur: Mr Hern\u00e1ndez Bataller, co-rappor- teur: Mr Barbadillo L\u00f3pez (OJ C 224, 30.8.2008), the opinion of AGE \u2014 the European Platform of Older People \u2014 on this Green Paper (COM 2007) 551 final); http://ec.europa.eu/transport/clean/green_pa- per_urban_transport/index_en.htm); or Mollenkopf et al.

        "3.2.2 End of life The way in which people die is a controversial issue and subject to different rules in the various Member States (active and passive euthanasia). Legal certainty must be ensured here so that older people's wishes can be taken into consideration even in the event of progressive cognitive problems, such as cases invol- ving use of life-prolonging measures. Advance directives may be one solution, but the especially vulnerable must be protected. Palliative medicine and the hospice movement play an impor- tant role here. In short, dignity to the last must be the guiding principle. In a Union in which 25 % of the population is aged 60 or over, a framework needs to be put in place to encourage the Member States to enact national law measures providing the legal security needed to enable people to prepare for the end of their lives in a composed way. The EESC would therefore encourage a debate amongst the Member States on the potential of developing a framework around end of life issues which might lead to the development of legal measures in the Member States. 3.3 Social integration and participation in society Social integration and participation in society are basic human needs which concern various aspects of older people's lives. The most important of these include family and friends, gainful employment, voluntary work and meaningful activities as well as lifelong education and participation in cultural and social life. 3.3.1 Social integration via family and friends Older people's social environment is changing dramatically ( 16 ). The number of older people living alone is rising. In cities, this proportion is sometimes 50 % of households. As a consequence, social policy and/or organisational measures are needed as well as technical innovations for: \u2014 supporting family and non-family networks, by means of appropriate measures to improve the work-life balance of those caring for older people ( 17 ); \u2014 in this connection the EESC notes the work being carried out by the Commission in the context of the renewed social agenda, and by the European social partners as regards reconciliation of professional and private life; \u2014 contributing to cross-generational activities ( 18 ); \u2014 people's own initiatives and civic commitment generally; and \u2014 promoting the construction of multi-generational housing. 3.3.2 Integration and participation through mean- ingful activities Both paid employment and voluntary work can help people to integrate and become involved in society. There is therefore a need for action in both areas if people are to remain socially active for as long as possible: 3.3.2.1 Participation through paid employment In order to make this type of participation through work possible for people wishing to follow this course after retire- ment (for the target group see point 1.1.3), whether for financial reasons or for professional fulfilment, changes such as the following could be made: \u2014 in accordance with the Employment Equality Directive ( 19 ), strengthening the ability of individuals to make the transi- tion from work to retirement more flexible, with appro- priate adjustment of pension and tax systems as part of a jobs strategy covering all generations of adults ( 20 ), and securing compliance with the principle of equal pay. In prin- ciple, age limits in the Member States should only refer to the right to stop working, and not be construed as a ban on voluntary continuation of employment; \u2014 gearing jobs and the working environment to older people, by reducing the physical demands and improving health, safety and working time patterns and arrangements; \u2014 applying and, if necessary, adapting techniques for making working procedures easier and more ergonomic; 31.3.2009 C 77/118 Official Journal of the European Union EN ( 16 ) See EESC opinion of 15.9.2004 on Research needs in the area of demo- graphic change , rapporteur: Ms Heinisch (OJ C 74, 23.3.2005); also EESC opinion of 16.12.2004 on Relations between the generations , rapporteur: Mr Bloch-Lain\u00e9 (OJ C 157, 28.6.2005), EESC opinion of 14.3.2007 on The family and demographic change , rapporteur: Mr Buffetaut (OJ C 161, 13.7.2007); EESC opinion of 11.7.2007 on The role of the social partners in reconciling working, family and private life , rapporteur: Mr Clever (OJ C 256, 27.10.2007), and EESC opinion of 13.12.2007 on Promoting solidarity between the generations , rapporteur: Mr Jahier (OJ C 120, 16.5.2008).

        "\u2014 dealing with potential obstacles and promoting new forms of contract relating to the transition period between pre and post-retirement life, and offering legal security, to ensure that they do not create new forms of insecurity; \u2014 cultural change in business geared towards a comprehensive jobs strategy which specifically promotes individual skills regardless of age ( 21 ). 3.3.2.2 Participation through voluntary commitments and meaningful activities In order to make more effective use of older peoples' potential, and at the same time to provide them with meaningful activities that match their various skills, it will be necessary to: \u2014 compile and safeguard knowledge acquired through experi- ence, including knowledge about social behaviour and special handicraft and artistic skills; \u2014 promote innovative forms of knowledge transfer, including support for other generations ( 22 ); \u2014 facilitate a flexible transition between employment and retirement or enable older people to engage in a mix of paid and voluntary work without any financial loss and on a voluntary basis; \u2014 support voluntary activities in an honorary capacity ( 23 ) through further education and involvement in local and supra-regional projects; \u2014 open up institutions to enable older people to carry out more voluntary work without replacing paid jobs. 3.4 Education and moves to keep people involved in society Key prerequisites for older people participating in society and being actively involved are education and lifelong learning and involvement in projects geared to the needs of older people. To this end, the range of activities on offer at local, regional and supra-regional level should be adjusted accordingly: \u2014 lifelong training to maintain the skills of older workers. Busi- nesses should facilitate and support relevant measures here. At the same time, incentives must be put in place (e.g. tax incentives); \u2014 general further education opportunities ( 24 ) throughout life at all levels (from readily-accessible options to university education); \u2014 quality assessment and quality assurance of training courses; \u2014 EU-wide recognition of qualifications ( 25 ), skills and compe- tences obtained also in old age in order to facilitate cross- border mobility ( 26 ), and appreciation of knowledge acquired through informal channels; \u2014 training courses to help people prepare for retirement; \u2014 training of support workers to help older people prepare for a new stage in their lives ( 27 ); \u2014 studies directed at all generations, not divided along age lines (mutual give and take); \u2014 training courses to promote inter-generational involvement (e.g. services provided by grandparents); \u2014 training in basic financial and legal matters ( 28 ) (to protect the interests of older people, especially with regard to Internet commerce); \u2014 training courses on new information and communications technologies; \u2014 availability and accessibility of information (newspapers, radio, TV, Internet); \u2014 variety of sport opportunities to suit different abilities and interests; \u2014 leisure activities and tourism ( 29 ) taking into account specific cultural needs ( 30 ). 3.5 Older people as consumers Older people have a variety of needs, relating both to the provi- sion of everyday goods (see 3.2.1) and durable consumer goods, and to technical help and assistance (see 3.6) as well as services of all kinds, which should open up new job prospects for younger people. 31.3.2009 C 77/119 Official Journal of the European Union EN ( 21 ) See Naegele, G. & Walker, A.

        "To this end, the following is required: \u2014 a general product design along the lines of \u2018 Universal Design \u2019 and \u2018 Design for All \u2019 ( 31 ) with readable and compre- hensible instructions; \u2014 prevention of discrimination on grounds of age and disability concerning the access to services, in particular financial services ( 32 ); \u2014 enforcement of consumer rights also for older people; \u2014 the profile of retirement migrants has changed over the years. Many find themselves with fewer retirement resources and may have health and social care needs for which current health and welfare systems make little provision. Retirement migrants fall between the gap of national entitlements being no longer covered by their home country's policy and not covered by the host country. There needs to be a greater understanding and debate about this issue across the EU to effect change, for which the European level is relevant and beneficial for citizens. 3.6 Access to information and communication technologies (ICT) As regards housing, health, participation in society and educa- tion, as well as access to e-government, the use of new technol- ogies is increasingly becoming the key to living an independent, active life in old age. The same is true of services of general interest aimed at older people themselves and of related economic development activities at regional and supraregional level ( 33 ). Key to this are: \u2014 moves to work at a very early stage of development on soft- ware to ensure maximum accessibility and on hardware to ensure optimum use of the functions of machines by people who are not (or are no longer) familiar with them; \u2014 available and accessible information and communication technologies, including Ambient Assisted Living systems, technologies for e-learning, e-health, e-care and e-rehabilita- tion. Technologies can help without substituting personal contact ( 34 ); \u2014 simpler access and use of relevant technical equipment and networks given the growing complexity of systems and adjustment to the specific needs of older people (e.g. sight problems, problems with sense of touch); \u2014 considering the needs of older users and measures to boost interest in using such tools; \u2014 involving all stakeholders and respecting ethical and legal points of view especially when it comes to the use of elec- tronic monitoring systems in cases of dementia; \u2014 accompanying measures such as integrated advisory, installa- tion and maintenance services, as well as social services; \u2014 considering the knock-on effects of social change and the new experiences and interests of the next generations. 3.7 Financial security It is important to urge the Member States to create the condi- tions for the security and dignity of older people, whether they are contributing to the life of society or not, throughout their retirement. Structural changes, the current reform of pension and social systems and rising living costs coupled with falling purchasing power mean that the proportion of people at risk of poverty in old age is increasing. It is predominantly older woman and those with a history of long-term unemployment who are living in poverty in certain Member States. In order to ensure the long-term viability of social protection systems, the Member States must encourage people still in work to make use of collective or individual pension arrangements, and ensure that private operators active in this area are solvent. They must also guarantee a minimum level of income for all, enabling every older person to lead a decent life, whatever his or her personal circumstances. 31.3.2009 C 77/120 Official Journal of the European Union EN ( 31 ) See the European Design for All e-Accessibility Network (EDeAN; http://www.edean.org/).

        "4. Specific comments and recommendations The Committee calls for measures to be taken both within Member States and at European level to create a solidly- grounded basis for the restructuring and innovation strategies needed: 4.1 Measures within Member States 4.1.1 Compilation of national and regional situation reports What is needed first and foremost is a precise analysis of the regional situations. The Committee urges the Commission to compile regular situation reports on the individual Member States accordingly, including information on the activity poten- tial of older people. 4.1.2 Preparation and provision of information The Committee believes it is vital that relevant information, knowledge and experience including previous research findings as well as newly acquired knowledge be made available to specialist committees, stakeholders and older people themselves. In particular, there should be better communication of research findings between the worlds of research, politics and users (older people and their representatives). 4.1.3 Processing and collating experience to date in the Member States The Committee calls for regional best practice to be collated, compared and assessed to see whether it ties in with other areas and is transferable to other regions. The aim is to compile a list of Best Practices to be made available to others ( 35 ). 4.1.4 Promoting a new image of old age In an ageing society people can no longer be viewed as \u2018 inactive \u2019 as soon as they stop work. A rethink at all levels (politics, economy, society) is required here. Countries and regions are particularly well-placed to undertake regular campaigns on promoting active aging . 4.1.5 The Committee proposes a European media campaign to promote an image of old age that acknowledges the lifelong contribution of older people to the life of society (including older migrants) and respect for old age. 4.2 Measures at European level 4.2.1 Establishment of an additional Expert Group on Old Age within the framework of the European Commission's expert group on demographic issues. 4.2.2 Establishment of a European Alliance for an active life in old age along the lines of the European Alliance for Families ( 36 ) with the goal of providing incentives for leading an active life in old age through the exchange of experience among Member States and promoting cooperation and mutual learning in the European Union. This alliance would be well-placed to organise European conferences and workshops. 4.2.3 Establishment of a European Centre for Age Research Situation and experience reports will show which aspects and regional features require further research ( 37 ). Findings from earlier research framework programmes and statistical data also need to be put together and disseminated more widely and incorporated into policy and practice ( 38 ). A European Centre for Age Research along the lines of the US National Institute on Ageing would be a particularly appropriate means of consoli- dating, integrating and further developing bodies of statistical and other relevant information already available 4.2.4 Incorporation of an interdisciplinary focus on older people in the 8th research framework programme The incorporation of an interdisciplinary focus on older people in the 8th research framework programme would bring together research activities. 4.2.5 Creation of a common European Internet portal An internet portal of this kind should make available to the public and especially older people all measures taken by indivi- dual directorate-generals relating to old age. The information should be retrievable via special links. 31.3.2009 C 77/121 Official Journal of the European Union EN ( 35 ) For example, in Wales there is a statutory Commissioner for Older People, building on the experience of the Children's Commissioner, who monitors policy and legislation and advocates and commissions research.

        "4.2.6 Creation of local, regional and national internet portals along the lines of the European Internet portal 4.2.7 Support for a demography fund as part of the Structural Funds ( 39 ) In view of the particularly precarious situation of regions with dwindling populations, the European demography fund should benefit rural regions and regions with below-average growth in particular and promote good initiatives. 4.2.8 Inclusion of new priorities in the Lifelong Learning Programme to facilitate the training of support workers to assist with the transition between various stages of life. 4.3 On the basis of the proposed measures, appropriate concepts can be devised for recommended courses of action and political measures. The EESC calls on the Commission to take account of these proposals in the planned communication. Brussels, 18 September 2008.
