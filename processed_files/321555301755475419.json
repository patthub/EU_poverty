        "C. whereas the WTO Ministerial Talks to conclude the Doha Round stalled at the end of July 2008; D. whereas there were advances in the negotiations at the beginning of 2011, as reflected in the reports of the negotiating chairs presented on 21 April 2011, but through the same reports it also became apparent that it will be very difficult to reach an agreement during 2011, as previously discussed in the Trade Negotiations Committee; E. whereas the Eighth WTO Ministerial Conference (MC 8) will take place in Geneva on 15\u201317 December 2011; whereas the Chairman of the General Council stated on 27 July 2011 that \u2018there is a general sense that the MC should not avoid addressing the DDA\u2019 and that \u2018development issues should remain central at MC 8, and LDCs\u2019 issues in particular\u2019; 1. Reiterates its full commitment to the multilateral trading system and the WTO as the guarantor of a rules-based trade system; believes that the WTO has a key role to play in ensuring better management of globalisation, more equitable distribution of its benefits and well balanced economic growth; reaffirms its full commitment to a balanced and fair conclusion of the DDA, which would be an important sign of political confidence in the future of a rule-based and equitable global trade system; 2. Points out that the DDA negotiations should focus primarily on the needs of the least-developed, countries; considers that the outcome of the DDA should contribute to the eradication of poverty and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals; 3. Is fully aware of the difficulties surrounding the principle of the single undertaking; 4. Regrets that it will not be possible to reach an agreement on the outstanding issues under the Doha Development Agenda at the Eighth Ministerial Conference in Geneva on 15\u201317 December 2011; stresses the importance of nevertheless being able to deliver results and tangible progress, in order not to undermine the multilateral trading system and its rule-making role; 5. Reaffirms its strong support for placing development at the heart of the DDA, and calls on the WTO Members to deliver on the goals set out in the 2001 Doha Ministerial Declaration and the commitments made in the WTO Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong in 2005; firmly believes that the Eighth WTO Ministerial Conference needs to deliver at least in favour of the LDCs; 6. Considers that an agreement for the earliest possible implementation, in line with the provisions of paragraph 47 of Doha Ministerial Declaration, should at a minimum include a comprehensive package for LDCs and developing countries consisting of: (a) duty- and quota-free market access for LDC products for at least 97 % of all tariff lines, as agreed in Hong Kong in 2005; (b) elimination by developed countries of export subsidies for cotton in line with previous agreements, as well as concrete commitments to expeditiously and specifically reducing domestic trade-distorting subsidies for cotton; (c) special and differential treatment in line with previous agreements, including a services waiver and a Special and Differential Treatment Monitoring Mechanism; EN 22.2.2013 Official Journal of the European Union C 51 E/85 Wednesday 14 September 2011 ",
        "(d) improved preferential rules of origin applicable to imports from LDCs in order to ensure that they are transparent and simple, and contribute to facilitating market access; 7. Calls on all developed and advanced developing countries to follow the model of the EU\u2019s \u2018everything but arms\u2019 initiative in guaranteeing 100 % duty- and quota-free market access for LDCs, as the tariff lines left out in the Hong Kong agreement cover some crucial products for the poor countries, and therefore substantially reduce the benefits for the LDCs; 8. Recalls the major differences in national economic growth worldwide as well as the ongoing shift in international trade flows; urges the emerging economies to assume their responsibilities as global economic players and to make concessions commensurate with their level of development and competitiveness; 9. Considers, furthermore, that the progress achieved so far in the negotiations on trade facilitation would make it possible to reach an early agreement in this area, as an improvement in the WTO rules on trade facilitation would benefit all WTO Members by enhancing legal certainty, lowering the costs of trade transactions and preventing abuse; 10. Reiterates the importance of improving access to green goods and technologies to achieve sustainable development objectives; 11. Considers, due to the persistent deadlock in the original architecture and objectives of the DDA, that it is now more necessary than ever to resume the debate on the future functioning of the WTO with a possible reform of the new multilateral trading system; calls on the Commission to consult proactively with Parliament on a shared vision of the architecture of a future global trading system; in the current context of the economic and social crises, and even if the DDA is not concluded, urges the WTO, along with other international organisations, to consistently and urgently tackle new global challenges in which trade plays a part, such as food security, energy, sustainable development and Aid for Trade; 12. Is absolutely convinced that the WTO, as part of a global system of economic governance, is vitally important to the world; urges all WTO members to further contribute to a comprehensive, ambitious and balanced development of the WTO in order to ensure economic growth and poverty eradication worldwide; 13. Stresses that it is necessary to analyse whether the changed circumstances since the beginning of the Doha Round, with particular reference to the role played in the world economy by the BRIC countries, do not render the original objectives of the Doha Round impossible to attain; 14. Urges developed and advanced developing countries to support the capacity of the least developed countries, to participate fully in this process of reflection on the DDA and in any roadmap for the remaining negotiations, and to ensure that their interests are upheld; 15. Stresses that recent fluctuations in food prices make it necessary for the rules governing international trade to promote greater food security; 16. Regrets that many countries apply export restrictions to natural resources which are in limited supply; considers it necessary for international trade rules to regulate these export restrictions comprehen\u00ad sively; EN C 51 E/86 Official Journal of the European Union 22.2.2013 Wednesday 14 September 2011 ",
        "17. Urges the WTO members to support the establishment of strong institutional links between the WTO and other international organisations such as the ILO, FAO, UNCTAD, UNFCCC and other UN organisations; 18. Is disappointed that, to date, it has not proved possible to take account of aspects such as climate protection and environmental protection in multilateral trade talks; 19.
