        "2 EU citizens\u2019 views on development, cooperation and aid November - December 2016 Report Special Eurobarometer 455 INTRODUCTION Issues surrounding development and development aid have been in increased focus in Europe in the past two years. 2015 was the European Year for Development, putting the spotlight on how EU development aid works, as well as how and where development money is spent. The European Union and its Member States are the biggest global donors of official development aid, contributing 58.2 billion euros in 2014 1 . Later in 2015, the UN adopted the Sustainable Development Goals, designed to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all 2 . These Goals are at the core of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which the EU has had an important role in shaping. This agenda is also at the heart of the proposed European Commission consensus on development \u201cOur world, our dignity, our future\u201d 3 . In addition to this agenda, the European Commission has proposed a new European External Investment Plan (EIP) to encourage investment in the EU Neighbourhood and in Africa, designed to help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals 4 . In 2015, the escalating migrant and refugee crisis in Europe also further highlighted development aid and issues of developing countries. Although the flow of migrants has slowed in 2016, due to the agreement between Turkey and the EU made in March 2016 5 , the impact of the ongoing refugee influx continues to be felt across Europe. This survey follows on from previous ones on the topic, including those conducted annually since 2009 6 . The objectives of the current survey are to: \uf0a7 Investigate Europeans\u2019 level of information about development aid in general; \uf0a7 Assess the attitudes of Europeans towards the importance of helping people in developing countries, challenges for the future of these countries, and the effectiveness of measures to reduce poverty in developing countries; \uf0a7 Assess the personal involvement of Europeans in helping developing countries; \uf0a7 Measure awareness of the international community\u2019s commitment to sustainable development. This survey was carried out by TNS Opinion and Social network, in the 28 Member States of the European Union, between 26th November and 5th December 2016. A total of 27,929 respondents from different social and demographic groups were interviewed face to face at home in their mother tongue on behalf of the Directorate-General for International Cooperation and Development (DG DEVCO). The methodology used is that of Eurobarometer surveys as carried out by the Directorate-General for Communication (\u201cStrategic Communication\u201d) 7 . A technical note on the manner in which interviews were conducted by the Institutes within the TNS Opinion & Social network is appended as an annex to this report. Also included are the interview methods and confidence intervals. 1 https://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/sites/devco/files/2015-annual-report-web_en.pdf 2 http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/ 3 https://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/sites/devco/files/communication-proposal-new-consensus-development-20161122_en.pdf 4 http://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/news-and-events/state-union-2016-european-external-investment-plan_en 5 http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-16-1664_en.htm 6 For the most recent report (2015) see http://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/special-eurobarometer-441-european-year-development-citizens- viewson-development-cooperation-and-aid_en 7 http://ec.europa.eu/COMMFrontOffice/publicopinion/index.cfm ",

        "4 EU citizens\u2019 views on development, cooperation and aid November - December 2016 Report Special Eurobarometer 455 KEY FINDINGS Most think it is important to help people in developing countries, and consider tackling poverty in these countries to have positive outcomes for the EU and the world \uf0a7 Almost nine in ten respondents think it is important to help people in developing countries (89%), and at least three quarters of respondents in each Member State think this way. \uf0a7 Although at EU level the proportion who think it is important to help people in developing countries has been stable since 2015, it has increased in 21 Member States. \uf0a7 More than two thirds (68%) agree tackling poverty in developing countries should be one of the main priorities of the EU, while 51% agree tackling poverty in developing countries should be one of the main priorities of their national government. \uf0a7 Almost three quarters agree tackling poverty in developing countries has a positive influence on EU citizens as well (74%), and 82% agree tackling poverty in developing countries is in the EU\u2019s best interest. \uf0a7 More than three quarters of respondents agree tackling poverty in developing countries is a moral obligation for the EU (78%). \uf0a7 Almost three quarters agree aid for developing countries contributes to a more peaceful and fair world (72%). \uf0a7 The majority of respondents agree providing financial assistance to developing countries is an effective way to address irregular migration (68%), although this represents a decline of 5 points since 2015. \uf0a7 Just over seven in ten (71%) agree providing financial assistance to developing countries is an effective way to tackle poverty in developing countries. The majority think EU and national actions are effective, and most think aid spending should either continue as it is, or be increased \uf0a7 More than six in ten (61%) think EU and Member States\u2019 actions \u2013 in terms of their development policy and financial assistance \u2013 are effective in helping to reduce poverty in developing countries. \uf0a7 Just over half (52%) think financial assistance to developing countries should continue as it is currently, while just over one in five (22%) think the EU and Member States should spend more money in support of developing countries. \uf0a7 The most pressing challenges for the future of developing countries are education, peace and security (both 38%), health (33%), water and sanitation (31%) and food security and agriculture (26%).

        "5 EU citizens\u2019 views on development, cooperation and aid November - December 2016 Report Special Eurobarometer 455 Corruption is perceived to be the main obstacle to successful development in developing countries \uf0a7 The most mentioned obstacles that could prevent successful development in developing countries are corruption (54%), bad policies of governments in developing countries (43%), conflicts (41%), bad policies of governments and organisations that support developing countries (25%) and a lack of financial resources (24%). Almost half of all respondents state they are personally involved in helping developing countries, and most think individual engagement is effective in reducing poverty in these countries \uf0a7 Just over half of all respondents agree that as individuals they can play a role in tackling poverty in developing countries (54%). Overall agreement has increased by two points since the last survey in 2015, and is now at its highest level since the survey began. \uf0a7 Respondents are even more likely to say individual engagement in the form of political action, donation and so on, is effective in reducing poverty in developing countries (61%). \uf0a7 Across the EU, 46% of respondents are personally involved in helping developing countries, with the most common actions giving money to an organisation such as an NGO or charity (27%), and making ethical choices when they shop for groceries, clothes and so on (22%). Reported awareness of the Sustainable Development Goals has increased since 2015 \uf0a7 Just over four in ten (41%) have heard of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), although respondents are more likely to have heard of them but do not really know what they are (29%) than to say they know what they are (12%). \uf0a7 Overall awareness of the SDGs, as reported by respondents, has increased by five points since 2015.

        "6 EU citizens\u2019 views on development, cooperation and aid November - December 2016 Report Special Eurobarometer 455 KEY SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHIC FINDINGS Gender Men and women generally have similar attitudes towards, and opinions about development aid, although women are more likely to be personally involved in helping developing countries (49% vs. 43% of men). Men, on the other hand, are more likely to have heard of the Sustainable Development Goals (44% vs. 37% of women). Age The younger the respondent, the more likely they are to be positive about development aid. Those aged 15-24 are more likely to agree tackling poverty in developing countries should be one of the main priorities of the EU or their national governments (72% vs. 67%-68% and 55% vs. 50%-51%, respectively), and they are more likely to say EU and Member States\u2019 actions are effective in helping to reduce poverty in developing countries (67% vs. 58% of those aged 55+). They are the most likely to agree providing financial assistance to developing countries is an effective way to tackle poverty (76% vs. 70%-71%), and the most likely to agree financial assistance to developing countries should increase (27% vs. 19% of those aged 55+). Younger respondents are also more optimistic about the role of the individual: 62% of them agree that as an individual they can play a role in tackling poverty in developing countries, compared to 47% of those aged 55+. Younger respondents are also more positive that individual engagement is effective in helping to reduce poverty in developing countries (66% vs. 56% of those aged 55+). Education Higher education levels are generally associated with more positive opinions about development aid, and the potential for individuals to have an impact. Those with the highest education levels are the most likely to agree it is important to help people in developing countries (93% vs. 86%-88% with lower education levels), that this has a positive impact on EU citizens (78% vs. 67%-72%) and that it is in the EU\u2019s own interest (85% vs. 75%-80%). Those who completed their education aged 20 or older are the most likely to think financial assistance to developing countries should increase (26% vs. 15% of those who completed their education aged 15 or younger). They are also the most likely to be positive about the impact individuals can have: 62% say as an individual, they can play a role in tackling poverty in developing countries, compared to 44% of those with the lowest education levels. In addition, the longer a respondent remained in education, the more likely they are to think individual engagement is effective in helping to reduce poverty in developing countries (67% vs. 53%-59%), and the more likely they are to be personally involved. Indeed, more than six in ten (62%) of those with the highest education levels are personally involved in helping developing countries, compared to 40% who completed education aged 16-19, and 34% who completed school aged 15 or younger.

        "7 EU citizens\u2019 views on development, cooperation and aid November - December 2016 Report Special Eurobarometer 455 Difficulties in paying bills Respondents who experience the most difficulty in paying bills are generally less positive about development aid issues. They are less likely to think helping people in developing countries is important (85% vs. 88%-91% of those with fewer difficulties), and are less optimistic about the positive impact this could have on the EU (76% vs. 80%-82%) or EU citizens (69% vs. 74%-75%). Respondents who experience the most difficulty paying bills are the least likely to agree providing financial assistance to developing countries is an effective way to address irregular migration, or to tackle poverty in developing countries (61% vs. 68%-71% and 65% vs. 71%-72%, respectively). They are also the least likely to think financial assistance to developing countries should remain the same (44% vs. 51%-54%), and the most likely to say spending should decrease (27% vs. 14%- 18%). Those with the most financial difficulty are the most negative about the role individuals can play in tackling poverty in developing countries (46% vs. 55%-56%), and about the effectiveness of individual engagement (51% vs. 59%-62%). They are also the least likely to be personally involved in helping developing countries (33% vs. 39%-50%). Political orientation The results highlight that the further to the left respondents place themselves on the political spectrum, the more likely they are to be positive about the importance of helping people in developing countries (94% versus 85%-90% of those who place themselves at the centre or the right), and the effectiveness of development aid to address irregular migration (74% vs. 64%-69%) or to tackle poverty (77% vs. 63%-72%). Those on the left are also the most likely to be in favour of increased spending on financial assistance for developing countries: 30% on the left say spending should increase, compared to 21% of those in the centre and 19% of those on the right. Those on the left are the most optimistic about the impact individuals can have: 63% agree they as individuals can have an impact, compared to 56% of those in the centre and 48% on the right. Those on the left are also the most positive about the impact of individual engagement (67% vs. 55%-63%), and they are the most likely to be personally involved in helping developing countries (55% vs. 43%-48%). Finally, those on the left of the political spectrum are the most likely to have heard of the SDGs (50% vs. 40%-42%). EU image In some areas, opinions about development aid also vary according to a respondents\u2019 image of the EU. For instance, those with a positive image of the EU are much more likely to say it is important to help people in developing countries (96%), compared to those with a negative image (78%). Those with a positive image are also more likely to say helping people in developing countries has a positive impact on both EU citizens (84% vs. 59% of those with a negative image) and on the EU (89% vs. 69%). Those with a positive image of the EU are much more likely to think EU and Member States\u2019 actions are effective in helping to reduce poverty in developing countries (74%), compared to those with a neutral (60%) or negative image (42%). In line with these views, respondents with a positive image of the EU are the most likely to think financial assistance to developing countries should increase (28%), and the least likely to think it should decrease \u2013 particularly compared to those with a negative view (9% vs. 31%).

        "8 EU citizens\u2019 views on development, cooperation and aid November - December 2016 Report Special Eurobarometer 455 I. IMPORTANCE OF DEVELOPMENT AID This section considers a number of opinions about the importance of development aid. Firstly, the importance placed on helping people in developing countries, and whether tackling poverty in developing countries should be one of the main priorities for EU or national governments will be discussed. Whether respondents think tacking poverty in developing countries is in the EU\u2019s own interest, whether it has a positive impact on EU citizens, and whether it is a moral obligation for the EU or not will also be reviewed. Finally, the extent to which respondents agree development aid contributes to a more peaceful and equal world, and whether such aid is a way to combat irregular migration, or to alleviate poverty will be considered. 1 Perceived importance of development aid Almost nine in ten respondents think it is important to help people in developing countries A large majority of respondents say it is important to help people in developing countries (89%), with 42% saying it is \u2018very important\u2019 8 . These results are the same as the previous survey in 2015. The proportion who says helping people in developing countries is not important has dropped by one point to 9%. Despite this overall stability, it is worth noting that in 21 Member States there has been an increase in the proportion of respondents who say it is important. 8 QC1.

Almost all respondents in Sweden (98%), Cyprus and Luxembourg (both 97%) think this way, compared to 75% in Bulgaria, 77% in Latvia and 78% in Estonia and the Czech Republic. In eight Member States, more than half of respondents say it is \u2018very important\u2019 to help people in developing countries: Sweden (75%), Cyprus (69%), Ireland (62%), Luxembourg (60%), Denmark (58%), Germany (57%), the United Kingdom (56%) and the Netherlands (53%). This is also the most common response in Malta (49%) and Finland (48%). In 21 Member States, respondents are more positive about the importance of helping people in developing countries than they were in 2015. This is particularly the case amongst those in Lithuania (+13 percentage points), Latvia and Hungary (both +10 pp). In fact, Italy (-3 pp), Romania, Austria and Germany (all -1 pp) are the only countries where respondents are now less likely to say helping people in developing countries is important.

There are also differences based on household financial situation: those who experience the most financial difficulties are the least likely to say helping people in developing countries is important (85%), particularly compared to those who experience the least difficulties (91%). However, these differences based on education and income are relatively small. Respondents who identify as being on the left (94%) or centre (90%) of the political spectrum are more likely than those on the right (85%) to say helping people in developing countries is important.

        "17 EU citizens\u2019 views on development, cooperation and aid November - December 2016 Report Special Eurobarometer 455 As was the case in 2015, respondents in each Member State are much more likely to agree tackling poverty in developing countries should be one of the main priorities of the EU, than they are to agree it should be one of the main priorities of their national government. In many cases, the margin is considerable. The largest differences are observed in Cyprus (39 percentage points), Greece (38 pp), Malta (33 pp) and Croatia (31 pp). This compares to the United Kingdom, which had the smallest gap (11 pp). Socio-demographic analysis shows the youngest respondents are the most likely to agree tackling poverty in developing countries should be one of the main priorities for EU or national governments. For example, 72% of those aged 15-24 think this should be one of the main priorities of the EU, compared to 67% of those aged 40+. Household financial situation is also influential, but only in the case of national governments: those with the most difficulties paying bills are the least likely to say this should be one of the main priorities of the national government (44% vs. 52% of those with fewer difficulties). Respondents who identify as being on the left of the political spectrum are the most likely to agree tackling poverty in developing countries should be one of the main priorities of EU and national governments \u2013 and this is particularly the case for national governments (left: 60%, centre: 52%, right: 44%). Attitudes to development aid also have an impact on opinion: respondents who think helping people in developing countries is important are more likely to agree tackling poverty in developing countries should be one of the main priorities of the EU or national government. For instance, 73% of those who think it is important to help people in developing countries agree tackling poverty in developing countries should be one of the main priorities of the EU, compared to 24% of respondents who say helping is not important. Finally, respondents who agree tackling poverty in developing countries should be one of the main priorities for the EU are more likely to also agree this should be one of the main priorities of their national government (69% vs. 13%).

Those in Sweden (82%), Luxembourg (81%) and Finland (76%) are the most likely to be personally involved in some way, while those in Bulgaria (11%), Romania (12%) and Latvia (15%) the least likely to be involved. The country analysis for the current results shows that in 18 countries respondents are most likely to say they are not involved in helping developing countries , with those in Romania (86%), Latvia (83%) and Bulgaria (78%) the most likely to do so. At the other end of the scale, 16% in Luxembourg, 17% in Sweden and 24% in Finland say the same. In nine Member States, respondents are most likely to say they give money to an organisation , with those in Sweden (62%), the Netherlands (61%) and Malta (57%) the most likely to do so. This compares to 3% in Bulgaria and 4% in Estonia and Romania. Austria is the only country where respondents are most likely to say they make ethical choices when they shop (35%), although this action is widely mentioned by those in Sweden (58%), Luxembourg (49%), Finland and Belgium (both 41%). Respondents in Romania (4%), Bulgaria and Latvia (both 7%) are the last likely to take this action. Respondents in Luxembourg (20%), the Netherlands (15%), Belgium and Cyprus (both 14%) are the most likely to do individual voluntary work, while those in Romania, Latvia and Estonia are the least likely to do so (all 2%). At least one in five respondents in Luxembourg (29%), Sweden (28%) and the Netherlands (20%) give money directly to projects , while just 1% in Bulgaria also do this.

One-third (33%) of those with the most difficulties are personally involved, compared to 50% of those with the least difficulties. Respondents who place themselves on the left of the political spectrum (55%) are more likely to be personally involved in helping developing countries than those in the centre (48%) or to the right (43%). It is not surprising that respondents who think it is important to help people in developing countries are more likely to be personally involved (49% vs. 21% who think it is not important), or that those who think they as individuals can play a role in tackling poverty are more likely to be involved in helping developing countries (58% vs. 31%).

AWARENESS OF UNITED NATIONS\u2019 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS In 2000, international leaders committed to achieve a set of Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015. These anti-poverty targets included eradication of extreme poverty and hunger, universal primary education and health improvements 31,32 . These MDGs formed the groundwork for the broader UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The agenda includes 17 Sustainable Development Goals and 169 associated targets that provide a framework to eliminate poverty and achieve sustainable development that works for everyone 33 . More than four in ten say they have heard of the Sustainable Development Goals, although awareness varies widely across Member States Overall, 41% say they have heard of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), although respondents are more likely to say they have heard of them but do not really know what they are (29%) than to say they know what they are (12%) 34 . Reported awareness of the SDGs has increased by five points since 2015, with a two-point increase in those who know what they are, and a three-point increase in those who have heard of them but don\u2019t really know what they are.

        "82 EU citizens\u2019 views on development, cooperation and aid November - December 2016 Report Special Eurobarometer 455 CONCLUSION This Eurobarometer survey is part of a series on development aid, and follows previous surveys that have been conducted annually since 2009. The results from this latest edition show respondents are overwhelmingly of the opinion that it is important to help people in developing countries. In fact, in 14 Member States at least nine out of ten agree this is important. The majority of respondents think tackling poverty in developing countries should be one of the main priorities of the EU. In fact, a large majority considers this a moral obligation, and sees benefits for both citizens and the EU in taking action in this area. More than seven in ten see financial assistance as an effective way to tackle poverty, and the majority think aid spending should either remain as it is, or be increased. Respondents are less certain than they were in 2015 that financial assistance to developing countries is an effective way to address irregular migration, but even so more than two thirds agree this kind of action is effective. Respondents in every Member State are most likely to agree with this idea, although in some countries, including the Netherlands, Estonia, the Czech Republic, Romania, Portugal and Germany this view is much less widely held than it was in 2015. Just over half of all respondents agree individuals can play a role in tackling poverty in developing countries, while more than six in ten think individual actions are effective in this area. More than four in ten are taking personal actions to help developing countries, with donating and making ethical choices when shopping the most common. Respondents are also positive about the efficacy of the EU and Member States\u2019 actions in helping to reduce poverty in developing countries. Across Europe, there has been an increased focus on development in the past two years, not only because of the refugee and migrant crisis, but also as a result of the European Year for Development, and the EU\u2019s involvement in shaping the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This focus seems to have had an impact. In particular, awareness of the SDGs is higher than it was in 2015. Generally speaking, there are no consistent variations in opinions about development aid by clear geographic clusters, with the most positive respondents about development issues scattered across the EU in countries including Sweden, Cyprus, Malta, Portugal, Spain and Ireland. Since the last survey in 2015, respondents in Lithuania, Hungary and Poland have become more positive in their attitudes to development aid, while those in Italy have become less positive. There are, however, clear patterns in socio-demographics terms. In particular, respondents with higher education levels, and those with the least financial difficulties are the most positive about the importance of supporting developing countries. They are also more likely to be taking individual action, and to be optimistic about the effect individual actions can have. In addition to these socio-demographic variations, attitudes also tend to occur in clusters. Respondents who believe it is important to help those in developing countries are more positive about the impact of aid, more optimistic about an individual\u2019s ability to make a difference, are more likely to be personally involved in helping developing countries. The results of this survey show that Europeans remain positive about the importance of helping people in developing countries, and supportive of EU actions and the current level of spending in this area. They are also optimistic about the impact both individual and national/EU level actions can have when tackling poverty in developing countries. ",
