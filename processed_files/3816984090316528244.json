        "The nature of conflicts D. stressing that peace and security as well as good and effective governance are essential for sustainable development and for achieving the Millennium Development Goals, E. whereas conflicts have regional and global dimensions, whereas neither their causes nor their conse- quences are delimited by national borders, and whereas they are best addressed through a regional and global approach, F. stressing that conflict prevention strategies have to depend on understanding and addressing the root causes of conflict, and on building cultures of peace by promoting mechanisms for bridging dividing lines between different sections of the society in question, G. whereas mining commodities and other natural resources, for example diamonds, titanium, cobalt, oil, gas and timber, have been used by rebel groups and by non-elected governments to finance the illegal purchase of weapons and have thus made civil wars possible and contributed to the loss of many lives and to destruction, H. whereas the causes of conflicts also include the impact of natural disasters, the shrinking amount of arable and grazing land, the shortage of water and desertification, which greatly reduce the land avail- able for both people and animals, The United Nations' global framework I. whereas in July 2005 the UN Secretary-General called for \u2018a common vision of a global architecture of peace and security with interlocking capacities based on the comparative advantages of global and regional institutions\u2019, J. whereas the UN is currently in the process of developing a global security mechanism based on further cooperation with those \u2018regional arrangements\u2019 which meet the criteria set out in Chapter VIII of the UN Charter ( 1 ), K. whereas the UN Security Council has clearly called for the strengthening of regional organisations' capacities, especially for conflict prevention, L. whereas a UN standing committee has been established, whereby each regional organisation desig- nates a permanent representative to the UN, M. stressing that establishing regional cooperation areas \u2014 at the same time eliminating tariffs and corruption \u2014 is necessary for long-term economic growth and development and, by extension, stabi- lity and peace, Regional organisations in conflict prevention, management and resolution N. underlining that regional organisations have a comparative advantage, in that their experience on the ground gives them a thorough knowledge of local political, historical, cultural, social, legal, tribal and spiritual structures, so that they can usually count on a greater level of trust and acknowledgement from the local population and parties to conflicts than external actors would be able to muster, O. stressing that regional organisations have become essential partners of the United Nations in promoting international peace and security, P. whereas regional organisations can play an important role in tackling the underlying causes of many conflicts, and whereas justice for everyone and the sentencing and punishment of the authors of crimes are measures which can contribute greatly to re-establishing the truth, fostering reconciliation and encouraging people to play an active part in society, 15.12.2006 C 307/19 Official Journal of the European Union EN ( 1 ) \u2018Organisations of a permanent nature, a grouping in a given geographical area several countries which, by reason of their proximity, community of interest or cultural, linguistic, historical spiritual affinities make themselves jointly responsible for peaceful settlement of any disputes which may arise.\u2019 ",
        "Q. recalling that regional and sub-regional organisations in ACP countries, such as the African Union in Darfur, the West African peacekeeping and intervention force, ECOMOG, the SADC peace-keeping deployment in the DRC, the IGAD in Somalia and Sudan, the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI) and the CARICOM intervention in Haiti, have been emerging as legitimate conflict managers, R. whereas these interventions were improvised rather than being based on long-term policies, commit- ment and coordination on the part of regional organisations and other levels (national, local) of governance, S. whereas at the same time regional organisations still lack the critical mass of sustained expertise and capacity for conflict prevention, management, resolution, peace-building and peace-keeping; whereas their human and institutional capacities are not adequate to fulfil their broader mandates, T. whereas the European Union and other European organisations ( 1 ) must consider ACP regional orga- nisations ( 2 ) as their equal partners, Role of regional organisations 1. Calls for development policy to be used as a tool for addressing the root causes of insecurity and for it not to be subordinated to security policy; 2. Urges that the concept of security should not be too narrowly defined, but that the consequences of natural disasters, the scarcity of natural resources, land use and the destruction of the environment should also be seen as security risks; conflict resolution strategies should be designed accordingly; 3. Urges regional organisations, in conjunction with their member states, to develop conflict prevention strategies rather than simply reacting once violence has already erupted; 4. Calls on all the parties concerned to initiate as soon as possible a process of political dialogue in keeping with the spirit of the Cotonou Partnership Agreement, with a view to preventing violent situations; 5. Calls on the ACP Group to transform the existing annual meeting between the ACP Secretariat and the Heads of ACP regional organisations into, inter alia, an institutionalised Coordination Forum on Peace and Security in order to facilitate dialogue, cooperation and coordination between them; 6. Calls on the above Coordination Forum to propose and develop structures to facilitate ACP participa- tion in the new UN regional and global security mechanism and to cooperate in promoting peace and security at ACP, regional and sub-regional levels; 7. Calls for targeted support for capacity building and the training of non-state actors, representatives of regional organisations and parliamentarians in order to increase their participation in the conflict prevention and resolution process and political dialogue; 8. Calls on regional organisations to engage and facilitate the participation of non-state actors in conflict prevention and resolution and post-conflict rehabilitation processes and to create conditions whereby displaced persons and refugees can return to a dignified living environment; 9. Urges regional organisations to pay special attention to the problems of the most vulnerable social groups in armed conflicts, such as children, women, the elderly and the disabled, and to facilitate the Demobilisation, Disarmament and Reintegration (DDR) process, with a special focus on former child soldiers; 15.12.2006 C 307/20 Official Journal of the European Union EN ( 1 ) Council of Europe (CoE), Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), Western European Union (WEU).

        "10. Stresses the need to involve women in all conflict management and rehabilitation measures on an equal footing, since the challenges of coping with everyday life rest mainly on their shoulders; 11. Calls on regional organisations to step up their involvement in post-conflict reconstruction in order to prevent wars from flaring up again, in particular through support for an effective UN Peace- Building Commission, for the consolidation of institutions in former failed states, and for measures to prevent the collapse of fragile states; 12. Encourages support for the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM) as an effective tool to contribute to regional peace and security, through country-level \u2018self-assessment\u2019 and learning across countries; calls on more African ACP states to participate in it; and further calls on the ACP Group to investigate the scope for developing an all-ACP peer review mechanism, especially for conflict prevention and resolution; 13. Calls on regional organisations to set up a strategy to coordinate donor support in the area of conflict prevention; 14. Points out that the organisation of meetings at regional or sub-regional level pursuant to Article 17(3) of the Cotonou Agreement should enter the active implementation phase; stresses the importance of these regional meetings for addressing conflict prevention and resolution issues and invites the parlia- mentary assemblies of ACP sub-regions to take the initiative in proposing that these regional meetings be held as soon as possible; The importance of political dialogue in conflict prevention 15. Asks to be involved in political dialogue, which has a preventive role and can foster mutual trust before a crisis breaks out, through consultation, as required under Articles 96 and 97 of the Cotonou Agreement; 16. Calls on the ACP and EU Member States to inform it of any new crises or (re-) emerging conflicts in order to find solutions through political dialogue; encourages the ACP Parliamentary Assembly, the Pan-African Parliament and other regional and sub-regional parliaments in the ACP, as well as the European Parliament, to promote exchanges of information with a view to strengthening the role of parliaments, and calls on the Commission to make the necessary funding available for such exchanges; Role of the international community 17. Calls on the international community to increase substantially its support for capacity building for the African Union and other regional organisations, especially their capacities in the areas of conflict prevention, management and resolution, peace-building and peace-keeping, and their human, institu- tional and logistical resources, including through the provision of training for the police, legal officers and military staff and equipment; 18. Calls on international donors and the Commission to support capacity building for regional organisa- tions, especially as regards strategies and programmes to prevent conflicts; 19. Calls on the Brussels-based Peer Group of the ACP Committee of Ambassadors to initiate conflict prevention and resolution strategies, and further urges the Peer Group to explore joint strategies with the EU; 20. Calls for further funding for the strengthening of regional early-warning and early-response mechan- isms which have already been successfully established, such as the ECOWAS Early-Warning Mechanism and the IGAD Early-Warning and Early-Response Mechanism (CEWARN); 21. Calls on the EU to support the creation of a Peace Facility for all ACP countries and provide funding for its effective functioning; 15.12.2006 C 307/21 Official Journal of the European Union EN ",
        "22. Calls on the ACP States and regional organisations and the European Commission to incorporate peace and security components \u2014 especially conflict prevention and human security promotion programmes \u2014 into Regional and National Strategy Papers and Indicative Programmes; 23. Expects, in the event that violent conflicts cannot be prevented, consistent action on the part of regional and international organisations and regional civil society organisations working towards peaceful solutions to prosecute and punish crimes against humanity, including rape and sexual exploi- tation, in order to encourage local reconciliation processes, thereby restoring people's confidence that authorities are acting in conformity with the rule of law; these organisations should encourage respect for human rights in the process of community (re)building; 24. Expects, likewise, a responsible and transparent approach to be adopted in dealing with natural resources such as gold, diamonds and oil, and resolute action to be taken in the event of misuse and illegal trading, with the backing of regional and international organisations, the European Commission and the institutions of ACP-EU cooperation; 25.

Calls for opt-out clauses for the ACP countries if they, at any time, consider that the fishery agree- ments are harmful to their social, political, environmental or economic interests; 5. Calls for national marine and inland resources fishing policies to be adopted by all countries; further calls for regional integration of these policies; 6. Welcomes recent EU-funded regional cooperation initiatives taken by southern African countries towards joint fisheries surveillance using both vessels and satellite surveillance; calls for identical initia- tives to be planned by other regional organisations; 7. Calls for measures to be taken to prevent coastal communities' traditional fisheries being edged out by other, alien practices; therefore insists that all agreements should contain measures to protect small- scale indigenous fisheries, to promote the landing of the fish locally and to require access to be depen- dent on the use of selective fishing methods; 8. Calls for action to encourage the participation of local community organisations based on traditional forms of association in all policy-setting and decision-making related to fisheries and fish-related activ- ities, and for due attention to be paid to the role played by women in the processing and marketing of sea and aquaculture products; for this purpose calls for national policies to include measures fostering the creation of associative, cooperative or other micro, small and medium enterprises or other forms of social and economic organisations; 9. Calls on ACP-EU development cooperation policy to step up dialogue at regional, national and local level between the industrial and artisanal fisheries sectors with a view to promoting sustainable devel- opment of fishery resources; 10.

Calls for training and capacity-building programmes for local communities dependent on fisheries to be included in national policies; further calls for primary and secondary education curricula to include general awareness and technical subjects addressed to children living in areas where fishing is the dominant activity; 26. Calls for the provision of scientific and professional training programmes for local fishermen in the CSPs, thus allowing them to apply for jobs in the EU fleet; 27. Calls for the creation of alternative programmes for generating income for families having to abandon traditional fisheries, for instance in tourism, rural development or other activities; 28. Calls for special EU support as part of EU development aid for inhabitants of remote ACP States of the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans that are heavily dependent on subsistence fisheries for income generation, so as to improve their families' health, balanced diet and the education of their children, especially girls; 29. Urges ACP fishing nations to include mechanisms in their national policy frameworks to avoid or minimise the negative effects on families caused by fishermen that must work for months or years away from home without returning to their native countries; these effects may lead to family break- ups, often causing hardship and long-lasting negative implications for the children left with their mothers, especially for girls and very young children; 15.12.2006 C 307/32 Official Journal of the European Union EN ",
        "30. Recognises that diversifying fisheries activities, increased local processing of production and other value-added activities, especially through micro-project types in ACP countries, could lead to wider participation, job creation and other employment opportunities for young people and women, thus redistributing wealth in the community; therefore encourages the European Commission to pay equal attention to this sector as to every other sector; 31. Calls on the ACP States and the EU to fully recognise that fisheries can potentially contribute to food security, are fundamental in food relief programmes in times of disasters and help to reduce famine in ACP countries; therefore urges the European Commission and the World Food Programme to allocate resources for island states with large fisheries potential to participate, in line with accepted standards, in food relief initiatives that are also important for the local economies, and further calls on the ACP island states included in this programme to give special customs consideration as is usual during relief works; 32. Calls on the ACP States and the EU to pay special attention to traditional and cultural values and prac- tices attached to fishing or in use in some island states; 33. Urges ACP and EU fishing nations to strengthen their national policy frameworks and regional coop- eration strategies against the use of fishing boats or the fishing industry to disguise illegal immigration and drug trafficking within or between ACP States or between ACP States and the EU Member States; Economic and financial aspects 34. Proposes the encouragement at local level, in the ACP countries, of transfers of technology, scientific know-how etc. in an investment-friendly form; 35. Calls for efforts by national and regional authorities to promote the creation of joint enterprises with preferential access to the EU market, provided such joint action does not contribute to over-fishing; 36. Urges that discriminatory measures are not taken within the WTO to reduce customs duties for canned tuna from some Asian developing countries, measures that may be harmful to the ACP coun- tries, and calls on the Commission to consider the use of a \u2018carve-out\u2019 clause in the WTO tariff reduc- tion formula in the DDA in order to maintain an effective level of preference for ACP canned tuna exports to the EU; otherwise their entire tuna canning industry may be devastated with serious socioe- conomic consequences; 37. Calls on the EU to make every effort at the WTO tariff negotiations under way to maintain the current regime regulating the import of canned tuna from third countries; 38. Urges ACP countries to implement the WTO Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosa- nitary Measures (SPS Agreement); asks therefore that EU financial assistance be used for the improve- ment of export facilities, thus bringing them into line with international SPS requests; 39. Stresses the principle of the exclusive competence of the recipient country to spend at its discretion the contribution it receives in exchange for granting fishing rights to the EU; nevertheless recognises that earmarking part of the financial contribution for the development of the local fishing industry or the adoption of targeted measures, preferably in agreement with a national policy for marine resources, should be envisaged; 40. Considers that a clear separation must be made between compensation paid for access to fishing and any more general sustainable development aid included in the agreement as targeted measures, for instance for monitoring, surveillance, control or infrastructure development, or for direct support to communities dependent on fisheries; 15.12.2006 C 307/33 Official Journal of the European Union EN ",
        "41. Calls for the implementation of micro-credit programmes aimed at promoting locally and regionally coherent fisheries; recognises the important role micro-credit plays as a decentralised cooperation tool; calls, in this context, on EU-ACP cooperation to include fiscal, administrative and technical capa- city-building that could lead to further local and regional investment in the fisheries sector; 42. Urges the negotiators of the EPAs and other stakeholders such as economic interest groups, civil society and citizens of the ACP and EU in general to take cognisance of the messages expressed herein, both prior to and during the negotiation process, in order to enable an appropriate and proportionate response to this resolution by the relevant ACP countries; and further calls on the Commission to examine seriously the ACP proposal for the conclusion of a Regional Fisheries Frame- work Agreement in the context of future EPAs, as appropriate; Environmental aspects 43. Calls for special programmes designed for fisheries in inland waters to be adopted; 44. Recognises the contribution inland fisheries can make to rural development, as many people \u2014 including women and children \u2014 engage in casual fishing, for instance in flood plains, making a significant additional contribution to the high-grade animal protein available to households; 45. Calls for coordinated policies and measures for fisheries in inland waters shared by two or more coun- tries; further calls for EU technical help to the countries involved in setting up these policies and measures; 46. Calls on the EU to finance measures by ACP States involved in internal fisheries aimed at combating the disappearance through sand encroachment of lakes and waterways, at maintaining their fish stocks in the long term and at modernising fishing techniques with a view to making them more viable and sustainable; 47. Calls on the ACP States of the African continent to strengthen their national policy frameworks or regional cooperation strategies against abuse, overuse or pollution of rivers or lakes on which more than one country is dependent for fishing, aquaculture or other fisheries-related activity; 48. Urges a ban in all ACP and EU waters on any fishing boat from those countries fishing any endan- gered species (fish or sea mammal) as specified by CITES and a total ban on the practice of shark finning, except where this is a by-product of fishing shark for meat; 49. Calls for a focus on decentralised production, using environmentally friendly, low-cost sustainable aquaculture methods; 50. Urges that precautions be taken to ensure that aquaculture does not lead to a loss of biodiversity as a result of interaction between escaped farmed animals or the introduction of waste into the wider environment; 51. Calls on the EU to continue impact assessment studies concerning the sustainable character of the Fishing Partnership Agreements (FPAs) and to allocate the necessary resources for this purpose; 52. Envisages, based on scientific studies, the creation by ACP countries of marine parks or protected zones, where only traditional indigenous fisheries could be allowed; calls for financing and training of personnel capable of carrying out the surveillance needed in these areas; 53. Calls for national and regional sustainable development strategies in the fisheries sector to take into consideration, based on reliable scientific research and adapted to the particular local marine circum- stances, other means of reducing the negative biological effects of fishing and to restore depleted fish stocks, such as closed seasons and mesh size regulations; 15.12.2006 C 307/34 Official Journal of the European Union EN ",
        "54. Underlines the need for measures in the fisheries sector for the protection of the marine environment to be integrated into, and complemented by, more wide-ranging marine sustainable development stra- tegies that address issues such as coastal and off-shore pollution and maritime transport; 55. Underlines the need, when developing fisheries strategies, to find a proper balance between economic and ecological considerations so as not to penalise economically and socially vital fishing operations through over-regulation; stresses the need for financial mechanisms to compensate or support fish- ermen having to adapt to new environmental legislation; 56. Calls for a ban on the use of fishing techniques which may cause migratory species to lose their feeding habits and migration trajectories; admits that exceptions could be accepted when coastal fish- eries contribute towards meeting local communities' fish security needs; 57. Calls for a ban on the use of explosives and traditional herbal poisoning of fish as methods of fishing, as these kill fish indiscriminately and are very harmful to coral and the general marine ecosystems; therefore urges all fishing nations to ensure that the ban is reflected in their national policy frame- works; 58. Urges tropical ACP countries which have mangroves around their coastal waters to formulate national policy frameworks for the protection of mangroves, as they provide the marine environment and ecosystems necessary for natural fish breeding; 59. Recommends that ACP countries use EU help at enterprise level to improve the sanitary conditions of fish, fish products and by-products; 60. Calls for eco-labelling to be included in country and regional fishery strategies as a tool for conserva- tion of the environment and marine biodiversity, and also as a marketing tool for creating market niches with better and more stable prices; 61. Instructs its Co-Presidents to forward this resolution to the ACP-EU Council, the European Commis- sion, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the African Union and all Regional Fisheries Orga- nisations.

RESOLUTION ( 1 ) on avian influenza The ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, \u2014 meeting in Vienna (Austria) from 19 to 22 June 2006, \u2014 having regard to Article 17(1) of its Rules of Procedure, \u2014 having regard to the recent spread of the H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) from south-east Asia to western Asia, Europe and Africa, 15.12.2006 C 307/37 Official Journal of the European Union EN ( 1 ) Adopted on 22 June 2006. ",
        "\u2014 having regard to the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals adopted on 23 June 1979, \u2014 having regard to the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement signed in Cotonou (Benin) on 23 June 2000, \u2014 having regard to the International Health Regulations adopted by the World Health Organisation on 23 May 2005 concerning the management of public health emergencies of international concern, \u2014 having regard to Directive 2005/94/EC of the Council of the European Union adopted on 20 December 2005 on Community measures to control avian influenza, \u2014 having regard to the International Pledging Conference on Avian and Human Influenza held in Beijing (China) on 17 and 18 January 2006, \u2014 having regard to the undertaking given by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) to deal with any situation arising out of the spread of HPAI, A. whereas, since late 2003, outbreaks of HPAI, caused by the H5N1 virus, which are unprecedented in their geographical scope and virulence, have been spreading rapidly in many countries in Europe and Africa, B. whereas HPAI has potentially serious implications for agriculture and sectors of the subsistence economy, in particular poultry-keeping, and for human health, the sustainable use of wild birds and the conservation of species, C. whereas, in addition to causing human mortality and morbidity, a pandemic may disrupt the global economy, break production chains, halt trade and interrupt services that involve human contact, D. whereas, according to World Bank estimates, a global pandemic could cost US$ 800 million per year, reducing global GDP by 2 %, with Asia and Africa likely to be hardest hit, E. whereas essentially all currently known cases of human infection with the avian influenza virus have been caused by contact with infected poultry rather than by contact with wild birds, F. whereas there is a need to strengthen public health systems in developing countries, G. whereas in many developing countries, particularly the ACP States, there is a flagrant lack of informa- tion coupled with general disregard for the important issues related to the spread of avian influenza, the risks it may pose, and ways of anticipating and responding to outbreaks of avian influenza, H. whereas the outbreak of the H7N7 virus in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany was successfully stamped out in 2003 by implementing rigorous control and biosecurity measures, I. whereas it is important to minimise at source the threat posed by the avian influenza pandemic to both animal and human populations by means of a rapid reduction in the viral burden of H5N1, prompt notification of outbreaks in birds, poultry culling and vaccination, including of \u2018backyard\u2019 flocks, and provision of appropriate compensation for farmers, J. whereas human cases of H5N1 infection may be difficult to distinguish from other infections, since health systems in developing countries, particularly in Africa, are already struggling to cope with chil- dren and adults suffering from HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, respiratory infections and other diseases, K. whereas at the Beijing International Pledging Conference the international community pledged US$ 1,9 billion to help third countries, in particular the least developed, to tackle avian influenza at source and, in so doing, reduce the risk of a human influenza pandemic, L. whereas at their 11th Summit held in Nairobi (Kenya) on 20 March 2006 the Heads of State and Government of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) announced concerted efforts to establish all the necessary mechanisms and preparedness plans to mitigate the impact of avian influenza, 15.12.2006 C 307/38 Official Journal of the European Union EN ",
        "M. whereas the WHO has issued a warning about a possible influenza pandemic in the near future, 1. Expresses its solidarity with all the countries affected by the H5N1 avian influenza virus and pays tribute to all the victims of this epidemic; 2. Recognises that avian influenza poses a global threat with possible repercussions for human health, the global economy and world stability, since little is known about human immunity to a mutated strain of H5N1; 3. Urges the ACP States to further integrate public health into their national economic and social devel- opment strategies, including through the establishment and improvement of effective public health mechanisms, in particular networks for disease surveillance, response, control, prevention and treat- ment, information exchange and recruitment, training and retention of national public health personnel; 4. Draws attention to the need to draw up emergency plans in the event of human or animal infection and takes the view that those emergency plans should focus on: \u2014 strengthening surveillance and detection capacities, \u2014 preventive containment measures at the slightest suspicion of infection, \u2014 making the general public and the professionals concerned more aware of what is at stake, educating them and making appeals to their individual sense of responsibility, \u2014 supporting those affected by the crisis so that they can develop their ability to overcome it, and in particular full compensation for small poultry-farmers, \u2014 promoting human vaccine research and development, \u2014 supporting the measures needed to contain the disease; 5. Emphasises that national plans to combat the virus must reflect the situation on the ground and specific national or local circumstances, in particular taking account of the role played by associations and the medical professions or of the arrangements for distributing medicines; 6. Calls on the ACP States and the EU Member States to take effective, fully transparent measures to prevent the spread of avian influenza in their respective regions; 7. Emphasises the importance of international cooperation in the area of the control of infectious diseases with a view to strengthening public health facilities in developing countries, including by exchanging information and sharing experience; 8. Welcomes the biosecurity measures being taken by the European Union in response to the most recent outbreaks of avian influenza; 9. Stresses the need to implement fully integrated approaches in order to address the issues raised by the spread of avian influenza, approaches which must draw on and integrate virological, epidemiological, medical, ornithological and wildlife management expertise; 10. Urges the African countries affected by avian influenza to make even greater efforts in their respective regions to halt the spread of the disease by establishing their own coordination and surveillance plans at national, regional or continental level, with a view to optimising collective cross-border prevention and planning measures and to being ready to work together in the event of a cross-border outbreak or an outbreak in a neighbouring region; 11. Calls on the European Union to promote research into and the development of vaccines against the H5N1 virus and to assist the ACP countries with response and containment measures in the event of outbreaks; 12. Calls on the international community to help the countries affected and the countries at risk to enhance their veterinary and public health capacities; 15.12.2006 C 307/39 Official Journal of the European Union EN ",
        "13. Calls on the European Union to provide financial assistance for farming and rural communities in the ACP States hit by an epizootic and for associated sectors, such as agri-foodstuffs, tourism and trans- port; 14. Urges that existing national immunisation networks, such as the polio immunisation network, should be used to provide large numbers of people with timely health information and to take action in connection with potential outbreaks of avian influenza; 15. Welcomes the undertaking given by the European Commission to earmark \u20ac 30 million for the African, Caribbean and Pacific States, out of the \u20ac 80 million it pledged at the Beijing International Pledging Conference, to help third countries to tackle potential outbreaks of avian and human influ- enza; 16. Hopes that there will be no delay in mobilising financial resources so that the countries concerned can implement programmes to combat H5N1 avian influenza as effectively as possible; calls on the Commission to release the whole amount pledged for ACP countries at the Beijing International Pled- ging Conference; 17. Calls on the Commission to actively support the efforts of the Nairobi-based United Nations Environ- ment Programme; urges that the measures to be taken should seek to establish the precise routes taken by migratory birds across the world, with a particular focus on the European-African and Euro- pean-Russian routes, and should concentrate on what can be done to protect birds; emphasises that random screening of animals and vaccination against avian influenza can be valuable tools to supple- ment disease control measures; 18. Expresses it concern at the increase in export refunds for poultrymeat announced by the Commission and calls for a study into the impact which that measure might have on markets in the ACP coun- tries; 19. Instructs its Co-Presidents to forward this resolution to the ACP-EU Council, the European Commis- sion, the ACP Ministers responsible for health and agricultural/veterinary matters, the Director- General of the World Health Organisation, the Director-General of the United Nations Food and Agri- culture Organisation, the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the African Union Commis- sion. 15.12.2006 C 307/40 Official Journal of the European Union EN "
