        "EN 3 EN INTRODUCTION In June 2005, the European Council called for a period of reflection on how to take the institutional reform forward 1 . In response to this call, the European Commission adopted \u201cPlan D for Dialogue, Democracy and Debate\u201d on 13 October 2005 2 . Its aim was to encourage Member States to organise a broad public debate on the future of the European Union involving citizens, civil society, social partners, national parliaments and political parties, with the support of the EU institutions. The main thrust of Plan D was \u201clistening better\u201d, \u201cexplaining better\u201d and \u201cgoing local\u201d to engage citizens. It fostered a type of consultation on the future of Europe which was complementary to the stakeholder and general public consultations on specific policy proposals. Plan D was spearheaded by six transnational European citizens\u2019 projects managed by civil society organisations (Annex 1). The aim of these projects was to test innovative consultation methods and enable people from the different national public spheres to connect with each other as European citizens and debate the future of the EU. In June 2006, the European Council acknowledged the Commission\u2019s contribution to the period of reflection and noted that the EU\u2019s commitment to becoming more democratic, transparent and effective goes beyond the reflection period. It also noted that \u201creinforced dialogue with the citizens requires adequate means and commitment\u201d 3 and recommended that the period of reflection should be prolonged into 2007. The Commission responded to this call in November 2006 by drawing lessons from the first year, in an information note entitled \u201cPlan D \u2014 Wider and Deeper Debate on Europe\u201d 4 . The Commission renewed its commitment to the action taken under Plan D. It also decided to co- fund a new series of civil society projects with a special emphasis on youth and women and on \u201cgoing local\u201d. The period of reflection came to an end in June 2007, when the European Council agreed on a mandate for a new intergovernmental conference (IGC) to reform the institutional framework of the Union. The IGC was concluded in October and the \u201cReform Treaty\u201d was signed in December 2007 in Lisbon. These events opened a new phase, with ratification of the new treaty to be followed by the European elections in June 2009. The European Council underlined the crucial importance of communicating more and better with the citizens by providing them with comprehensive information on the European Union and involving them in a permanent dialogue 5 . 1 Declaration by the Heads of State or Government of the Member States of the European Union on the Ratification of the Treaty establish a Constitution for Europe, European Council 16-17 June 2005, paragraph 4. 2 COM(2005) 494, 13.10.2005. 3 Presidency Conclusions, European Council, 15-16 June, paragraph 3. 4 SEC(2006) 1553. 5 SI(2007) 500. ",
        "EN 4 EN In October 2007, the Commission adopted a Communication on \"Communicating Europe in partnership\" 6 . Its overall objective is to strengthen coherence and synergies between the activities undertaken by the different EU institutions and by Member States, in order to offer citizens better access and a better understanding of the impact of EU policies at European, national and local level. The present Communication addresses the future of the Plan D approach of \"listening better, explaining better and going local\" which lasted from 2005 to 2007. This approach will continue with certain adaptations in 2008 and 2009, during the ratification process of the Lisbon Treaty and with due regard to the next European elections. It aims to contribute to one of the central objectives of the Commission's communication policy - empowering citizens by giving them access to information so that they may be in a position to hold an informed debate on EU affairs. 1. ASSESSING PLAN D \u2014 RESULTS AND EXPERIENCES In order to encourage the development of a European public sphere, Plan D sought to promote two-way dialogue, both face to face and virtual, between the EU institutions and the citizens of the Union. This approach proved to be particularly useful in opening up the discussion on the future of Europe following the French and Dutch \u201cNo\u201d to the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe. Alongside other programmes managed by the Commission and other EU institutions and bodies, Plan D has played a key role in testing innovative ways in which civil society organisations could involve citizens from all walks of life in debates on the future of Europe, combining: \u2022 virtual and face to face communication, \u2022 deliberative consultation and polling, \u2022 country-level, cross-border and pan-European consultations. Internet debates were conducted on the \u201cDebate Europe\u201d web site 7 . The Commission Representations and the Europe Direct centres were used intensively . \u201cPlan D\u201d visits by Members of the Commission played an important role in reaching out to national parliaments, civil society, business and union leaders, regional and local authorities in Member States. This confirmed the importance of personal contacts and of \u201cputting a human face\u201d on the EU. In particular, civil society projects were co-funded by the Commission as part of Plan D. Citizens were chosen at random and met each other both nationwide and across borders. They were supplied with the relevant information (e.g. documentation on the issues to be debated, vetted by a representative panel of Members of the European Parliament) and with the means to overcome the language barrier so that they could use their mother tongue throughout the consultation process. As a result, they were in a position to engage in substantial discussions with decision-makers and make suggestions for the future of the EU. Overall, approximately 6 COM(2007) 568, 3.10.2007. 7 http://ec.europa.eu/commission_barroso/wallstrom/communicating/conference/dialogue/ index_en.htm. ",
        "EN 5 EN 40 000 people took part in the six transnational Plan D projects in person and hundreds of thousands are estimated to have participated virtually via the Internet. The civil society organisations managing the projects served as multipliers and disseminated the views expressed by citizens through their political and media networks, at different stages of the projects. The Plan D civil society projects showed that participatory democracy can usefully supplement representative democracy. They confirmed the feedback received from other types of citizens\u2019 programmes, namely that consultation events offer participants both a human and a political experience. Regardless of their opinion on the EU, citizens\u2019 views evolved significantly in the course of the consultations. At the end of the process, they were anxious to receive feedback from decision-makers, in particular EU institutions and bodies. This is why, in December 2007, the Commission organised a concluding conference for the six Plan D citizens\u2019 projects. It was entitled \u201cThe Future of Europe \u2014 The Citizens\u2019 Agenda\u201d. For the first time, at a pan-European level, citizens who had taken part in a variety of transnational participatory democracy projects had a chance to synthesise their wishes and articulate them directly to decision-makers. The resulting recommendations were addressed in the form of an open letter to the EU Heads of State and Government, the national parliaments, the EU institutions and European political parties, ahead of the December European Council (Annex 2). It called on the European political parties to address the recommendations in their programmes and to discuss them with citizens in the run-up to the elections to the European Parliament in 2009. It also called upon the EU Heads of State and Government to encourage the development of active European citizenship at all levels of governance. The citizens\u2019 projects demonstrated several ways of doing this as they tested: \u2022 a European debating web site connected to a network of national debating sub-sites, combined with local, national and European debating events; \u2022 a multilingual, highly interactive web site, the content of which was determined by focus groups in different EU countries and adapted according to feedback from target audience workshops; \u2022 national consultations on the same issues in all Member States, taking place more or less at the same time, leading to a European synthesis; \u2022 pan-European deliberative polling, where a random sample of the population polled gathered for three days and debated face to face; \u2022 local debating events in several EU Member States combined with polls and video recording of citizens\u2019 views. Those projects showed that the development of participatory democracy on EU-related issues at local, regional, national and cross-border level is possible, both in terms of quality and logistics. In terms of substance, they showed that there was sometimes a gap between citizens\u2019 expectations and the actual domains of EU competence, for example in the field of social affairs, education and diplomacy/defence. By participating in the consultations, people became more familiar with the EU decision-making process. By the end of the process, they ",
        "EN 6 EN had a clearer view of how to challenge decision-makers and narrow the gap between policy- makers and citizens in the future. Interesting lessons can also be learnt from the projects in terms of timing, the selection of participants, moderator training, the logistics of cross-border and multilingual debate and the kind of information and expertise required to ensure that citizens from all walks of life are in a position to hold an informed debate on European issues. Easy access to scientific advice and expertise is notably a must in participatory processes involving lay stakeholders and policy makers. 2. THE WAY AHEAD \u2013 \u201cDEBATE EUROPE\u201d In its first phase, Plan D focused on the \u201cdebate and dialogue\u201d part of the process. The follow- up to Plan D will take this process one step further and focus on \u201cD for democracy\u201d, further enabling citizens to articulate their wishes directly to decision-makers and making better use of the media in the process. That is why the new phase will be named \u201cDebate Europe\u201d , after the Commission\u2019s dedicated Plan D website. Debate Europe will act as follows: 1. Articulate citizens\u2019 consultations held by civil society with political decision-makers. The conclusions reached by citizens will be synthesised by the citizens themselves and sent to elected politicians, political parties and foundations. A high point will be a debate between citizens and politicians on the proposals contained in the citizens\u2019 platforms. In this process, Debate Europe will take advantage of the new European political and institutional context, including the new Regulation 8 governing political parties and foundations at European level. 2. Involve close cooperation and, wherever possible, joint action between EU institutions and bodies in order to maximise the impact of their endeavour to promote active European citizenship (citizens\u2019 forums; the European Parliament\u2019s communication strategies ahead of the 2009 elections and Agora debates with civil society organisations; and initiatives by the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee). 3. Add leverage to existing EU initiatives, including Commission programmes promoting active citizenship \u2014 e.g. the \u201cEurope for Citizens\u201d programme, the European Fund for Integration of Third-Country Nationals, social cohesion and anti- poverty programmes, other one-off initiatives to mark the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue (2008) and the European Year of Creativity and Innovation as well as the eParticipation Preparatory Action and related activities and the e- Inclusion initiative. In so doing, Debate Europe will reinforce the Commission's efforts to explain the added value of EU policies to citizens (e.g. internal market related success stories \u2013 roaming mobile charges, low cost flights, closing the gap in regional development, environmental protection and the fight against climate change). 8 Regulation (EC) No 1524/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2007. ",
        "EN 7 EN 4. Pursue other successful Plan D actions (internet debates, bringing EU officials and citizens closer together; cooperation between Commission and European Parliament information offices, using EU information relays to \u201cgo local\u201d). 2.1. Connecting citizens\u2019 debates to representative political bodies There is a general wish to bridge the gap between politics at national and European level. European political parties need to be supported as they strive to engage in the debates taking place within each national public sphere. Particularly during European election campaigns, European issues must be brought to the fore and citizens must perceive the impact on their day-to-day lives of the political choices they make at European level. Debate Europe will act as a catalyst to reinforce on-going Commission initiatives to bridge the above-mentioned gap. It will co-fund a pan-European citizens\u2019 consultations project managed by civil society organisations in partnership with think-tanks, research organisations and universities, political parties and foundations. It will also promote actions at national and regional level enabling citizens from all walks of life to debate, synthesise their views, discuss them with decision-makers and involve the media. It will benefit from the new EU Regulation on political parties and foundations, which is one of the practical measures to result from the first phase of Plan D. The Regulation widens the scope of activities of European political parties and supports the development of European political foundations, which will play an important role in involving citizens in a permanent, genuine and informed political dialogue. In 2007, those foundations submitted action plans to the Commission aimed at developing a series of pilot activities in 2008: raising citizens\u2019 awareness of the forthcoming European elections through training sessions, targeted communication initiatives, Internet sites, brochures and the creation of networks with national foundations and think tanks. From September 2008 onwards, the political foundations will be subsidised on a permanent basis. Debate Europe will supplement those efforts by inviting the political foundations to contribute to citizens' consultations held by civil society. 2.2. Enhancing cooperation with the European Parliament The December 2007 \u201cFuture of Europe \u2014 the citizens\u2019 agenda\u201d Plan D conference showed that the EU institutions have more impact when they join forces and take part together in dialogue events with citizens. It is an opportunity for them to demonstrate the whole spectrum of EU democracy. This in turn allows citizens to understand the EU decision-making process better. This form of inter-institutional cooperation will be embedded into Debate Europe projects at European and national and regional level. In its elections communication strategy, the European Parliament calls for close cooperation between EU institutions. Debate Europe will contribute to meeting this need. Indeed, cooperation not only with the European Parliament but with the Committee of the Regions and the European Economic and Social Committee is crucial when it comes to encouraging active European citizenship. Each institution/body has acquired considerable experience in organising citizens\u2019 forums. ",
        "EN 8 EN The Commission stands ready to work with incoming EU presidencies that wish to organise citizens\u2019 summits involving the different EU institutions and bodies, thus providing a platform for giving a citizens\u2019 perspective on concrete issues to European decision-makers. 2.3. Creating synergies between Commission programmes Debate Europe will complement and operate in synergy with other Commission programmes which promote active European citizenship. The distinctive feature of the Debate Europe projects will be their inter-institutional, political and media dimension \u2014 the outcome of the consultation events organised at regional, national and pan-European level will be an informed, public debate between citizens and decision-makers from Member States and from all the EU institutions. The terms of reference of the Debate Europe calls for proposals will ensure that the projects selected take into account the Commission\u2019s overall political effort to promote active European citizenship, in particular: \u2022 the \u201cEurope for citizens\u201d programme, which promotes active European citizenship by providing support to a whole range of actors (local authorities, civil society, business and consumer organisations, citizens), so that they may act, debate, discuss and network together in a variety of ways, both traditional (town-twinning activities, civil society transnational projects) and innovative (e.g. citizens\u2019 panels); \u2022 the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue in 2008, in which all the EU institutions/bodies are involved, and the European Year of Innovation and Creativity in 2009; \u2022 the European political foundations and parties which are striving to raise citizens\u2019 awareness of the forthcoming European elections with Community support; \u2022 the European Fund for the Integration of Third-Country Nationals. Integration of immigrants is a process in which close partnerships exist between different levels of government and non-governmental actors such as employers, unions, religious organisations, civil society, migrants\u2019 associations, the media and NGOs supporting migrants; \u2022 the e-Participation Preparatory Action, which aims at increasing the involvement of citizens in the legislative and decision-making processes at EU level, using new technologies. A number of trials are already being implemented on new forms of interaction between citizens and the European Institutions; \u2022 research and accompanying initiatives funded by the Seventh Research Framework Programme in the fields of governance and citizenship (Social Sciences and Humanities Work Programme) and public engagement in science (Science in Society Work Programme) 9 . 9 Decision n\u00b01982/2006/EC of the European Parliament and the Council; Decisions 2006/971/EC and 2006/974/EC of the Council. ",
        "EN 9 EN 2.4. Further developing other Plan D initiatives Debate Europe will act in conjunction with ongoing initiatives in the Member States, many of which have valuable potential for inter-institutional cooperation. These include: \u2022 Pilot Information Networks (PINs) \u2014 the networks have already been contracted. They will bring together European, national and regional parliamentarians, journalists and other European opinion-makers to share information, knowledge and ideas on the EU. PINs will bring the European debate closer to national parliaments. They will use the Internet, other online tools and meetings to develop \u201cidea networks\u201d and help connect politicians and the media with innovative civil society projects. \u2022 European Public Spaces \u2014 Commission Representations and European Parliament Information Offices in Madrid, Tallinn and Dublin have worked together to create European Public Spaces which accommodate exhibitions, debates, seminars and training sessions on EU matters. It is envisaged to extend this pilot project to other capital cities, starting with Rome, London, Copenhagen and Berlin. \u2022 Citizens\u2019 fora \u2014 the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions organise citizens\u2019 fora in the Member States. Debate Europe will encourage members of the various EU institutions and bodies to get together and jointly intervene in such fora, on the basis of the Plan D \u201cEuropean Round Tables for Democracy\u201d concept 10 . \u2022 Visits to the Member States \u2014 Commissioners\u2019 \u201cPlan D\u201d visits to the Member States have reached out to the national parliaments, regional and local authorities, the media and civil society. Commission officials have been encouraged to visit their old schools. Debate Europe will further develop such \u201cface to face\u201d contacts, in line with the Commission's staff engagement strategy 11 which encourages its staff to play an active role in the field of communication as ambassadors of the Institution, e.g. such as the \"Back to School\" operation and the Enterprise Europe Network. Debate Europe will also encourage members and officials of the other EU institutions and bodies to join in. \u2022 Going even more local \u2014 together with the Commission Representations, the Europe Direct centres have organised debates, events and seminars with citizens in towns and cities beyond the capital cities of the Member States. Debate Europe will continue to develop these activities, taking advantage of the fact that a \u201csecond generation\u201d of Europe Direct centres will be launched in 2009. \u2022 Refining the Eurobarometer opinion polls \u2014 the Commission\u2019s Eurobarometer opinion polls will take into account experiences from the first phase of Plan D projects, which experimented with deliberative polling techniques on the future of the EU on a pan- European scale. \u2022 Internet debates \u2014 the \u201cDebate Europe\u201d web site dedicated to Plan D was revamped in January 2008 to increase its potential for interactive debate with Internet users on topical EU issues, with the participation of the Commission Representations. The recent re-launch of web discussions will be followed by similar online discussions later in 2008 and in 2009. 10 COM(2005) 494, section 4.1.5. 11 SEC(2007) 912. ",
        "EN 10 EN 3. CALL FOR PROPOSALS AND DECENTRALISED ACTIONS Debate Europe will ensure that the Commission\u2019s global effort to promote active European citizenship becomes part of an integrated inter-institutional effort which reaches out to decision-makers at all levels of governance. A twin-track strategy is suggested, backed by a EUR 7.2 million budget: \u2022 pan-European level: a centralised call for proposals to co-finance a comprehensive 27- Member-State transnational project with a budget of EUR 2 million; \u2022 national and regional level: decentralised calls and actions supporting local projects with a budget of EUR 5.2 million 12 . At pan-European level, the terms of reference will state that, taking into account the experience of the first series of transnational participatory democracy projects, Debate Europe will: \u2022 hold citizens\u2019 consultations in each Member State; \u2022 establish a common set of conclusions at European level and send them to European political organisations; \u2022 engage citizens in dialogue with elected representatives and European political organisations, in close cooperation with the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions. At national or regional level, Commission Representations: \u2022 have planned approximately 140 actions in 2008 to stimulate public debate about the EU; \u2022 will co-fund action tailored to specific needs (e.g. action targeting schools and youth centres, exhibitions, fairs and festivals, conferences, seminars, events with NGOs etc.) through local calls for proposals; \u2022 will carry out such action with other EU institutions and bodies through, for example, European Public Spaces, the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, the planned European Year of Creativity and Innovation and EU national institutes of culture. Depending on the national context, even limited funding for country-level NGOs could result in fruitful dialogue on EU issues. Commission Representations, in cooperation with European Parliament's Information Offices, will increase the impact of such dialogue events by involving regional and local authorities. These initiatives could boost existing and new regional and local networks and help spread best practice, using e-Participation tools 13 . They could also be of interest to politicians standing for European elections, who could use these discussions as a basis for dialogue with their constituents. 12 Commission Decision C(2008) 924 on the annual work programme on grants and contracts in the field of communication for 2008, adopted by the Commission on 12 March 2008 (Table 2.6.2). 13 Such as those described by the e-Participation Community at www.epractice.eu. ",
        "EN 11 EN 4. CONCLUSION Involving citizens Public support for the EU can only be built through lively and open debate and by getting citizens actively involved in European affairs. In addition to the many stakeholder and general public consultations carried out by the Commission on specific policy issues, the EU needs more political debate and awareness if it is to achieve its objectives and deliver the right policies. This is one of the central objectives of the Commission\u2019s communication policy 14 : to empower citizens, by promoting active European citizenship . Connecting to policy makers Political parties and their elected representatives are in a privileged position to raise European issues in national debate and to spark cross-border public debate across Europe. Cross-border communication channels are required to promote debate and dialogue on issues of common concern on the European agenda. The Commission has contributed to developing these channels through legislative proposals designed to facilitate the development of European political parties, through a series of citizens\u2019 programmes and NGO outreach activities and through Plan D. Following the series of pilot projects carried out, the challenge is to ensure that their output feeds into the political decision-making process. The first phase of Plan D confirmed that there is clear demand for measures to strengthen and expand political dialogue on European issues and that participatory democracy can usefully supplement representative democracy. In the next phase, covering 2008 and 2009, and in the wake of the European elections, \u201cDebate Europe\u201d will provide an operational framework for reaching out, connecting, and acting in partnership. But it must also be viewed in the long term: \u201cDebate Europe\u201d seeks to change the perception that EU matters are too abstract and disconnected from the national public sphere to be of interest to citizens, and it gives an opportunity to break the often artificial divide between national and European issues. 14 COM(2007) 568, 3.10.2007.

The EU celebrated its 50th Anniversary this year. Since 1957, the European Union has progressed from economic cooperation to a political union that affects the lives of almost 500 million citizens. This evolution also brings responsibilities for the political leaders of Europe. The permissive consensus that existed at the beginning has to be turned into an actively earned consensus in dialogue with the European citizens. Associating citizens to the European construction is more than ever a fundamental issue. If we do not want the citizens to desert once more the European elections in 2009, political leaders need to regain the citizens' trust and confidence in the European project and show they care about citizens' involvement in the decision-making machine. Plan D launched by Commission Vice-President Margot Wallstr\u00f6m responded to this challenge in a novel manner. It co-financed a series of projects to learn how ordinary citizens can be invilved in the EU decision-making and how they view the EU's future. This exercise responds to a basic value of the EU in the 21st century: active citizenship. The European Movement International, the King Baudouin Foundation, Notre Europe, Deutsche Gesellschaft, European House Budapest and CENASCA-CISL, with a large network of partners across Europe have engaged actively in Plan D. A series of grass roots debates, consultations, polls and events aimed at consulting citizens on their visions of Europe have been carried out in a number of Member States, while deliberative polling and consultation has taken place on a pan-European scale. Thousands of citizens took part in those projects throughout the European Union in 2007. Over 250 of them have assembled in Brussels on 8 and 9 December to debate on the major concerns which have emerged through Plan D. There was a clear consensus among participants that more opportunities of this kind should be provided to involve citizens in the debate over Europe's future. They have structured these concerns into three themes: 1. The human aspects of globalisation 2. Enlargement, political integration and EU citizenship 3. The EU's role on the world stage. They have consolidated their conclusions into a single set of recommendations (annexed to this letter). They have debated those recommendations with decision-makers representing the EU institutions as well as the present Portuguese and future Slovenian Presidencies of the EU: \u2022 Mrs. Margot Wallstr\u00f6m, Vice-President, European Commission. \u2022 Mrs Jillian van Turnhout, Vice-President, European Economic and Social Committee. \u2022 Mr. Ivo Opstelten, Mayor of Rotterdam, Member of the Committee of Regions, ",

They call on the European political parties to address those recommendations in their programmes and to discuss them with citizens in view of the elections to European Parliament in 2009. They call upon the EU Heads of State and Government, both in their capacity as European but also as national leaders, to heed those recommendations and thereby encourage the development of active European citizenship, without which there cannot be a truly political Union. They call for the dialogue with citizens on European issues to be continued and deepened in the future. The participants to the conference on \"The future of Europe-the citizens' agenda Twenty\u2013seven recommendations 1. As work is considered a crucial dimension for individual emancipation, the welfare systems should protect citizens\u2019 life conditions during periods of transition for example by providing people with an unemployment indemnity when changing jobs. 2. Citizens expect more action from the EU in the area of social policy and social cohesion in order to fight the black market, reduce salary gaps, promote gender-equality, ease unemployment and to make it attractive to work longer before retiring. 3. The EU should promote equal rights, comparable standard of living in all EU member states and foster equal opportunities through harmonised social and economic policies and a welfare model for all member states. 4. The Member States and the EU should make sure that migrants enjoy equal rights and opportunities and have access to education and work if they observe the laws, rules and values of the host country and commit to learning the language. 5. The European migration policy , so far based only on restrictive measures, should adopt a more sophisticated approach aiming at the social and economic development of the involved countries. The EU needs to clarify its approach to economic refugee status. 6. Migration needs to be acknowledged as one of today\u2019s most pressing issues, and cannot be tackled without a coherent development aid strategy. 7. The EU should ensure that part of each country\u2019s national curriculum, in both schools and universities , requires a section on Democracy and European Citizenship, to ensure a greater understanding of the EU, its history, and its opportunities. 8. The EU should show more commitment to educational promotion in general but also specifically regarding European issues, e.g. through the expansion of existing educational EU programmes or the ",
        "EN 22 EN establishment of new EU programmes as well as the incorporation of the European integration process as a central topic in the national school curricula. 9. Exchange projects need further support to encourage young people to recognise the importance of their EU citizenship in the global context. 10. The EU should help preserving, appreciating and respecting the diversity of peoples, knowledge, customs and languages identities - while recognising common and shared European values. 11. Integration strategies such as the educational policy incorporating the EU into school curricula will favour the development of a European identity. 12. The EU should prioritise creating and communicating a new \u2018memory\u2019 about Europe , to move away from the stereotypes associated with certain countries and history, so that all citizens can be valued and we can understand each other better. 13. The EU should increase opportunities for a more active, direct participation of European citizens from all walks of life in policy-making through regular citizen Plan D-type participatory projects, debates, public hearings, etc. at EU but also at regional and national levels. More transparency-more influence for European citizens! 14. The EU should make sure that the current citizen recommendations are considered and discussed not only by the EU but also national policy-makers or become part of existing policy-making processes (e.g. impact assessments, public consultations). The EU should not only listen but also learn. 15. The EU should become more interactive, citizen friendly and inclusive, recognising the growing significance of regional approach and identity . New and innovative information technique should be used to improve communication with citizens especially young people. Specific attention has to be paid to the frequently neglected gender issues. 16. Climate change and energy security cannot successfully be dealt with at the national level alone. The EU should be given stronger powers to develop a common energy policy and ensure that Member States live up to the commitments they have made at European level. 17. In a global world, it makes sense for the EU to take greater responsibility than today in the fields of military action, foreign aid and diplomatic relations . The EU should be able to speak with one voice on a global level to defend its values. 18. The EU can be more efficient than national governments in security, police and struggle against drugs traffic and cartels . 19. The EU should lead the world in protecting the environment and promoting clean energy. ",
        "EN 23 EN 20. Europe should develop a strong voice on the global stage with common foreign and security policies that promote peace , security in regional conflicts democracy and the respect for human rights providing for a strong role model across the world, whilst recognizing the importance of the nation state. 21. The EU should show a united front in international affairs ; the current practice is influenced too much by national short-term interests and considerations. 22. The EU should tackle the impact of Europe\u2019s energy use on both the economy and the energy and foster the transition to environmentally clean, safe and sustainable energy sources. 23. European citizens want the EU to take the lead when it comes to social, energy and environmental standards on a global level. 24. The EU should develop specific educational and action-oriented programmes for citizens on global issues such as trade, energy and the environment. 25. The EU should coordinate its aid programmes with NG Os engaged in humanitarian work to bring timely and efficient relief to crisis regions or to promote sustainable development. 26. The EU should lower barriers to international trade as, overall, freer trade benefits developed and developing countries. 27. The EU should show more commitment in the fields of international peacekeeping as well as humanitarian aid during catastrophes . ",

INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND On 13 October 2005 the Commission approved its Communication to the Council, to the European Parliament, to the European Economic and Social Committee and to the Committee of the Regions: Plan D for Democracy, Dialogue and Debate. This was a listening exercise so that the European Union can act on the concerns expressed by its citizens. The Commission aimed to stimulate debate and widen recognition for the added value that the E U provides. It was a two-way process which: \u2022 informed the public about the EU's role, with examples of its projects and achievements, \u2022 identified their expectations for the future in return. On 29 November 2006 Vice President Wallstr\u00f6m presented an information note to the College of Commissioners on Plan D \u2013 Widen & deepen the debate. The purpose of this was to take stock and further widen and deepen the debate in the period of reflection. On 2 April 2008, the Commission adopted a Communication to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions entitled \"Debate Europe-building on the experience of Plan D for Democracy, Dialogue and Debate\". It noted that the first phase Plan D focused on the \"debate and dialogue\" part of the process. The next phase of Plan D will take this process one step further and focus on \"D for democracy\", further enabling citizens to articulate their wishes directly to decision-makers and making better use of the media in the process. This new phase has been named \"Debate Europe\". In October 2005 the Commission launched a series of Europe-wide civil society projects for 2006,which it co-financed. In 2007, it promoted a further series of initiatives, targeting young people and women in particular. 2. OBJECTIVES One of the key lessons from this first round of projects and the concluding conference of Plan D is that the interface between citizens and EU decision-makers needs to be strengthened to ensure that issues of interest and concern Europe-wide are debated and addressed at a European level. There is a need to communicate those Europe-wide issues and concerns which affect to a large degree all of Europe's citizens identified from consulting on a pan- ",
        "EN 25 EN European basis and to communicate these to European political decision-makers and media especially in view of the June 2009 European elections. As a result, the Commission wishes to strengthen the existing debate about the future of Europe and its impact on citizens' daily lives by launching one or more pan-European projects with the following objectives: In a first phase; \u2022 Carry out a Europe-wide dialogue between citizens, political decision-makers and other key opinion formers through a series of debates/conferences/consultations and other events, with a view to ascertaining citizens' principal issues and concerns at a European level which touch their daily lives. This dialogue will ensure a close involvement of the other EU institutions (EP, EESC, COR) and European political parties' foundations. \u2022 The conclusions arising from these events should be synthesised and made public. At a concluding event they should be presented to European decision makers to give them the opportunity to react and take into account the concerns of the European electorate. This phase of the project should be completed ideally before the June 2009 European elections. In a second phase, the contractor could continue with a series of meetings with newly-elected MEPs and representatives from the principal European media (television, radio, press). In carrying out both phases, the contractor will take into account the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue and on-going Commission programmes such as Europe for Citizens and e-Participation. The resulting projects will involve consortia of civil society organisations with a view to replying to these objectives on a Europe-wide scale. These consultations will complement those planned to be held at local level designed to address concerns focused on European issues with a more local impact. 3. TIMETABLE 3.1. Submission of applications Publication of call beginning April 2008. Applications must be submitted by end June 2008 at the latest. Contracts will be signed September 2008. Please read carefully section 10 of this call for proposals concerning the procedures for submitting applications. 3.2. Duration of projects The project should begin between 1 September and 1 October 2008 and will be in two phases as described above. The first phase will be completed by mid-May 2009 (before the European elections) and the second phase by 1 November 2009. ",
        "EN 26 EN Applications must clearly state the project's starting and finishing dates (dd/mm/yy). The maximum duration of projects is 14 months. However, if, after the signing of the agreement and the start of the project, the beneficiary observes that, for fully justified reasons beyond his control, it becomes impossible to complete the project within the scheduled period, an extension to the eligibility period may be granted. A maximum extension of 3 months will be granted, provided that this is requested before the deadline specified in the grant agreement. The maximum duration will then be 18 months. The period of eligibility of expenditure resulting from implementation of a project will begin on the day of signature of the grant contract by the last of the parties. If the nature of the project requires the project to start before the contract is signed, expenditure may be considered eligible before the signature of the contract. Under no circumstances can the eligibility period start before the date of submission of the grant application. 3.3. Information on the results of the selection It is planned that applicants will be informed of the outcome of the selection procedure in July 2008. The lists of selected projects will be published on the following website: http://europa.eu.int/comm/dgs/communication/grants/index_en.htm Applicants whose applications have not been selected will be informed in writing. 4. FINANCING The budget initially available for part-financing projects is estimated at \u20ac 2 000 000. If during the 2008 budget year, additional amounts are allocated to boost the initial budget for this call for proposals, they might be allocated to co-financing projects which were adopted at the selection phase but not given priority for co-financing in the overall budget initially available. The Commission therefore reserves the right to set up a \u201creserve list\u201d of proposals evaluated positively in order to take account of the resources actually available in the 2008 budget. The grant awarded may not exceed 70% of the total eligible project costs. Community contributions are meant to facilitate the implementation of a project which could not otherwise be implemented easily without the support of the European Union. They are based on the co-financing principle. Consequently, a minimum of 30% of the total estimated eligible expenditure of the project must come from sources other than the European Union budget. Applicants must include evidence that co-financing is available (secured) for the remainder of the total cost of the project. The Commission intends to finance 1 to 2 projects for a budget of \u20ac 1 or \u20ac 2 million in total.. ",
        "EN 27 EN The European Commission reserves the right not to distribute all the funds available. The amount allocated by the Commission may not in any circumstances exceed the amount requested. Moreover, the Commission reserves the right to award a grant lower than the amount requested by the applicant. An organisation is not entitled to receive more than one grant from the Commission for the action covered by the selected project. After approval by the Commission, a \u201cgrant contract\u201d, a draft of which is reproduced at Annex VI, expressed in euros and specifying the conditions and the financing level, will be concluded between the Commission and the beneficiary. The originals of the finance contract must be signed and returned to the Commission immediately for signature. The Commission will be the last party to sign. The payment methods are detailed in the draft contract (Article I.4), with a list of eligible and ineligible costs (Article II.14 of the general conditions and Article I.3 of the special conditions of the grant contract). 5. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Applications which comply with the following criteria will be the subject of an in-depth evaluation. 5.1 Eligible countries Grant applications are eligible if they are presented by organisations having a legal status and established in one of the 27 Member States. Organisations established in countries other than the countries listed above are not eligible. 5.2 Types of cooperation eligible The types of cooperation eligible include partnerships. The term partnership/partners implies full or partial active intellectual collaboration in the execution of the project. In no case will financial support alone (sponsorship) be deemed to constitute a partnership. However, any financial support accompanied by active intellectual collaboration in the execution of the project will be accepted as a partnership. In all cases, the purpose of partnership is to add value to the project. 6. EXCLUSION CRITERIA Applicants must certify on their honour, by signing the application form, that they are not in one of the situations mentioned in Articles 93 and 94 of the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002), which are listed below.

Applicants will not receive financial support if, during the grant allocation procedure: a) they are subject to a conflict of interests; b) they are guilty of misrepresentation in supplying the information required by the European Commission as a condition of participation in the grant award procedure, or fail to supply this information. In accordance with Articles 93 to 96 of the Financial Regulation, administrative and financial penalties may be imposed on applicants who are guilty of misrepresentation or are found to have seriously failed to meet their contractual obligations under a previous contract award procedure. To respect these provisions, the applicant and his partners must provide evidence that they are in none of the situations listed in Articles 93 and 94 of the Financial Regulation. 7. SELECTION CRITERIA The selection criteria are designed to demonstrate the applicant\u2019s capacity to see the project through to a successful conclusion.

Applicants must attach to the grant application a curriculum vitae for the project leader and for the personnel of their organisation who will actually do the work. They must also enclose a recent activity report . 7.2 Financial resources In order to permit assessment of this criterion, applicants must submit with their application the following documents: \u2013 annual accounts for the last complete financial year; \u2013 the \u201cfinancial identification\u201d form (bank details) (Annex III), completed by the beneficiary and certified by the bank (with original signatures). If, on the basis of the submitted documents, the Commission assesses that the financial capacity of the applicant is not sufficient, it may: \u2022 reject the request for a Community grant; \u2022 ask for further information; \u2022 ask for the deposit of a guarantee; \u2022 propose a grant agreement without a pre-financing payment. 7.3 Audit Where the cost of the project to be financed exceeds \u20ac300 000, the grant application must be accompanied by an external audit report produced by an approved auditor. This report must certify the accounts for the last year available and give an assessment of the applicant\u2019s financial viability. 8.

        "EN 34 EN ANNEX 4 CALL FOR PROPOSALS MANAGED BY EUROPEAN COMMISSION REPRESENTATIONS IN EU MEMBER STATES (LOCAL CALL) - DG COMM No xxxxxx, EC Representation xxxxxxxx Grants for local and national civil society initiatives to promote public debate about European issues - part of the European Commission\u2019s \"Debate Europe\" initiative 1. BACKGROUND On 13 October 2005 the Commission approved its Communication to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions entitled \"Plan D for Democracy, Dialogue and Debate\". This was a listening exercise to enable the European Union (EU) to act on citizens' concerns. The Commission aimed to stimulate debate and widen recognition for the added value that the EU provides. It was to be a two-way process which: \u2022 informed the public about the EU's role, with examples of its projects and achievements, \u2022 identified their expectations for the future in return. On 29 November 2006 Vice President Wallstr\u00f6m presented a note to the Commissioners entitled, \"Plan D \u2013 Widen & Deepen the Debate\". Its purpose was to take stock and further widen and deepen the debate in the period of reflection. The note is publicly available and has been sent to Member States and other EU institutions. On 2 April 2008, the Commission adopted a Communication to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions entitled \"Debate Europe - Building on the Experience of Plan D for Democracy, Dialogue and Debate\". It noted that the first phase of Plan D focused on the \"debate and dialogue\" part of the process. The next phase of Plan D will take this process one step further and focus on \"D for democracy\", further enabling citizens to articulate their wishes directly to decision-makers and making better use of the media in the process. This new phase has been named \"Debate Europe\". In October 2005 the Commission launched a series of Europe-wide civil society projects 15 for 2006, which it co-financed. In 2007, it promoted a further series of initiatives, targeting young people and women in particular. 15 \u201cTomorrow\u2019s Europe\u201d introduced by the foundation \u201cNotre Europe\u201d (Paris) http://www.notre-europe.eu/ \u201cEuropean Citizens\u2019 Consultations\u201d introduced by the \u201cKing Baudouin Foundation\u201d (Brussels) http://www.european-citizens-consultations.eu \u201cSpeak up Europe\u201d introduced by the \u201cEuropean Movement International\u201d (Brussels) http://www.europeanmovement.org/emailing/newsletter/speakupeurope_briefing_nonote.pdf ",
        "EN 35 EN Drawing on this experience, the Commission, through its Representations in EU Member States, will offer grants in each Member State for civil society initiatives focusing on \"Debate Europe\" priority issues 16 . These are: \u2022 Priority issue 1: involvement of citizens with political decision-makers; \u2022 Priority issue 2: joint action between EU institutions and bodies to promote active citizenship. Differences in economic, social and other aspects of national life greatly affect the public's attitudes to the EU and to particular European issues. So the new round of local calls will therefore be tailored to each Member State's needs . The Commission\u2019s Representations will help define the content, and manage and follow up the calls. Depending on the national context, even limited funding for country-level NGOs could result in a fruitful debate on EU issues . 2. OBJECTIVES 2.1. General The Commission wishes to help fund national and regional initiatives by civil society organisations to: \u2022 solicit citizens' views on European issues which have a direct impact, locally and nationally, on their daily lives; and \u2022 encourage citizens to become more informed about these issues, and to discuss and debate them with local opinion-formers. \u201cOur message to Europe\u201d introduced by the Deutsche Gesellschaft (Berlin) http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/communication/grants/index_fr.htm \u201cRadio Web Europe\u201d introduced by CENASCA (Rome) http://www.cenasca.cisl.it/entra.htm \u201cOur Europe \u2013 Our Debate \u2013 Our Contributions\u201d introduced by the European House (Budapest) http://www.europeanhouse.hu/ All data on the 6 Plan D projects are summarized at the following address: http://europa.eu/debateeurope/paneurope_en.htm. 16 Priorities specified in the Commission's communication entitled \"Debate Europe - Building on the Experience of Plan D for Democracy, Dialogue and Debate\"(2 April 2008) and in its 2008 annual work programme. ",
        "EN 36 EN These initiatives will: \u2022 facilitate dialogue between citizens, national and/or local political decision-makers and opinion-formers through debates, conferences, consultations and/or other events; \u2022 closely involve local members of: \u00b0 the European Parliament, European Economic and Social Committee, and Committee of the Regions, and \u00b0 European political parties, and those parties' foundations \u2022 collate and publish these events' conclusions to: \u00b0 identify specific European issues which matter to people in their particular local/national environment; \u00b0 raise local media and politicians' interest in the debate on Europe; \u00b0 increase understanding of the EU's impact on citizens' everyday life; \u2022 create networks of participatory democracy which integrate the European dimension of local/regional/national debates; \u2022 complement: \u00b0 Commission Representations' other initiatives to target local constituencies; \u00b0 current EU programmes with similar goals, including: (cid:224) the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue (EYID) 2008 (cid:224) Europe for Citizens (cid:224) e-Participation (cid:224) Integration of Third Country Nationals (INTI). \u2022 be tailored to meet each Member State's specific needs. 2.2.

Information on the results of the selection It is planned that applicants will be informed of the outcome of the selection procedure [deadline needs to be no later than Jul. 2008] The lists of selected projects will be published on the following website: http://europa.eu.int/comm/dgs/communication/grants/index_en.htm & http:// xxxxxxxxx Applicants whose applications have not been selected will be informed in writing. 4. FINANCING The budget available for this call for proposal is \u20ac [to be filled by each Representation]. The grant awarded may not exceed 70% of the total eligible project costs. Community contributions are meant to facilitate the implementation of a project which could not otherwise be implemented easily without the support of the European Union. They are based on the co-financing principle. Consequently, a minimum of 30% of the total estimated eligible and final expenditure of the project must come from sources other than the European Union budget. Applicants must include evidence that co-financing is available (secured) for the remainder of the total cost of the project. Indicatively, the amount of the grant from the EU will be between 50 000 and 100 000 EUR per project. The European Commission reserves the right not to distribute all the funds available. The amount allocated by the Commission may not in any circumstances exceed the amount requested. Moreover, the Commission reserves the right to award a grant lower than the amount requested by the applicant.

Applicants will not receive financial support if, during the grant allocation procedure: a) they are subject to a conflict of interests; b) they are guilty of misrepresentation in supplying the information required by the European Commission as a condition of participation in the grant award procedure, or fail to supply this information. In accordance with Articles 93 to 96 of the Financial Regulation, administrative and financial penalties may be imposed on applicants who are guilty of misrepresentation or are found to have seriously failed to meet their contractual obligations under a previous contract award procedure. To respect these provisions, the applicant and his partners must provide evidence that they are in none of the situations listed in Articles 93 and 94 of the Financial Regulation. 7. SELECTION CRITERIA The selection criteria are designed to demonstrate the applicant\u2019s capacity to see the project through to a successful conclusion.

They must also enclose a recent activity report . ",
        "EN 41 EN 7.2.

If, on the basis of the submitted documents, the Commission assesses that the financial capacity of the applicant is not sufficient, it may: \u2022 reject the request for a Community grant; \u2022 ask for further information; \u2022 ask for the deposit of a guarantee; \u2022 propose a grant agreement without a pre-financing payment. 8. AWARD CRITERIA Commission Representations will evaluate eligible projects against four criteria: a) consistency \u2013 is the project's overall concept consistent with the: i. objectives of Plan D? ii. general and detailed objectives of the call (see point 2 above) b) quality \u2013 are the work programme and working methods of sufficient quality? c) feasibility \u2013 is the project feasible, based on the action plan? d) visibility \u2013 what is the likely effect of the project's actions to raise awareness? 9. ELIGIBLE COSTS For all projects, the eligibility period for expenditure relating to the implementation of a project will be stipulated in the grant agreement and will, except as described in the next point, be no earlier than the signature of the agreement by the Commission. A grant may be awarded for a project which has already begun only where the applicant can demonstrate the need to start the project before the agreement is signed. In such cases, expenditure eligible for financing may not have been incurred before responding to the call for proposals. The eligibility period for expenditure will not exceed the time allowed under each type of action, and may not go beyond . Only the categories of expenditure listed below are eligible , provided that they are properly accounted for and evaluated in accordance with the market conditions, and that they are identifiable and verifiable. They must be direct costs (i.e. generated directly by the project and indispensable for its implementation, having regard to the cost/benefit principle): ",
        "EN 42 EN \u2013 personnel costs incurred exclusively for the purpose of implementing the project are eligible only where the accounting systems of the applicants in question can clearly isolate and demonstrate the percentage of staff time devoted to the implementation of the project within the period of expenditure eligibility, and therefore the percentage of personnel costs which can be attributed to the project; \u2013 travel / accommodation / subsistence costs associated with the project. Organisations must use their own daily scales to calculate these costs. However, these may not exceed the maximum amounts set by the Commission 18 ; \u2013 the cost of organising and running conferences and seminars (rental of rooms, welcoming and reception services, interpretation, speaker fees); \u2013 cost of hire or depreciation of technical equipment and services (only the depreciable element of durable goods can be considered); \u2013 information dissemination costs (production, translation, distribution and dissemination costs, etc.); \u2013 cost of consumables and supplies \u2013 costs entailed by other contracts awarded by the beneficiary for the purposes of the project (also see Section 10); \u2013 costs arising from requirements imposed by the agreement ; \u2013 general costs (or \" eligible indirect costs \": office supplies, sundry consumables, depreciation of computer equipment, etc.). These costs may be eligible if incurred by the beneficiary for the purpose of implementing the project, but may not exceed 7% of total eligible direct expenditure . N.B.: indirect costs will not be eligible if the applicant already receives an operating grant from the Commission during the lifetime of the project. 10. NON-ELIGIBLE COSTS Non-eligible expenditure The following expenditure cannot be considered eligible under any circumstances : \u2013 costs of invested capital; \u2013 general provisions (e.g. for losses, possible future liabilities); \u2013 debts; \u2013 interest owed; \u2013 doubtful debts; \u2013 exchange losses; \u2013 expenditure on luxuries; 18 Commission Decision C(2004) 1313 of 7 April 2004: General implementing provisions adopting the Guide to missions for officials and other servants of the European Commission.

Contributions in kind Part of the contribution from project sponsors to the project costs may be in kind. These contributions in kind must be included in the provisional budget under the \"receipts\" section, expressed as a financial equivalent of the services or materials provided, and for an identical amount in the \"expenditure\" section, but separately from the rest of the budget. In fact, they cannot be considered as eligible costs. Contributions in kind refer in particular to the provision of durable capital goods, raw materials and unpaid voluntary work by a private individual or corporate body. The amount declared by the beneficiary as contributions in kind must be valued either on the basis of objective factors or on the basis of official scales laid down by an independent authority or by an outside independent professional. The cost of private charity work must be valued in accordance with the national rules regarding the calculation of hourly, daily or weekly labour costs. Contributions in kind will not be accounted for as eligible costs but rather as an increase in the grant in terms of value or as a percentage of the eligible costs. The Community contribution is subject to a ceiling relating to the total eligible cost (70% maximum of the total eligible cost), excluding the value of contributions in kind. Subcontracting and calls for tender Where the implementation of subsidised actions requires a subcontract or the launch of a call for tender, the beneficiaries of the grant must award this contract to the tender offering the best value for money, respecting the principles of transparency and equal treatment of potential contractors and ensuring there is no conflict of interests. None of the basic activities of the project may be subcontracted, et subcontracting must account for only a limited part of the project. For all contracts, beneficiaries must keep evidence that the selection of subcontractors was competitive, involving at least three offers, unless it can be shown that only one supplier exists in a given market. Grants may only be awarded after a project's start date (given in the application) upon prior written approval from the Commission. 11. PUBLICITY The Commission will publish the list of successful applicants (unless the publication of information is likely to endanger the successful applicant safety or harm his interests). The Commission will publish the following information in whatever form and on whatever medium it wishes, including the Internet: ",

It will ensure that the Commission's global effort to promote active European citizenship is an inter-institutional effort, in connection with the EU institutions' political and communication priorities, which reaches out to the decision-makers at all levels of governance. A twin-track strategy is suggested, backed by a 7.2 million EUR budget: \u2022 a centralised call for proposals to co-finance a global trans-national project with a budget of 2 million EUR; \u2022 decentralised calls and actions supporting local projects with a budget of 5.2 million EUR. On a Pan-European level \u2013 The terms of reference of the call for proposal will state explicitly that, taking into account the experience gained by the first series of trans-national participatory democracy projects co-funded under Plan D, Debate Europe will support a civil society initiative which organises citizens' consultations in each Member State, establishes a common set of conclusions/proposals at European level and, on the basis of this common platform, engages the citizens in a dialogue with elected representatives and European political organisations, in partnership with European political foundations. On a country level - Taking into account the experience gained by the civil society projects co-funded by Commission Representations in some Member States, Debate Europe will co- fund decentralised actions tailored to specific needs (e.g. actions targeting schools and youth centres, exhibitions, fairs and festivals, conferences, seminars, events with NGOs\u2026). These actions will comprise local calls for proposals and other actions as defined in the framework of Debate Europe (e.g. Internet debates, visits by Commissioners, activities in the framework of European Public Spaces and Pilot Information Networks, going local through the Europe Direct Centres\u2026). therefore requested. The detailed breakdown of this amount is described in the Commission decision on the annual work programme on Grants and Contracts concerning the field of Communication, for 2008, C(2008) 924, adopted by the Commission on 12 March 2008 (cf. Table 2.6.2). ",
        "EN 49 EN 5. METHOD OF CALCULATION ADOPTED The 7.2 million EUR budget allocated to Debate Europe is divided as follows: \u2022 As already mentioned, one call for proposals will be launched by DG COMM's Headquarters for an estimated sum of 2 million EUR, in order to co-finance a global transactional project. Furthermore, the Representations will launch decentralised calls for proposals for an estimated amount of 3.1 millions EUR. There will probably be one call for proposal per Member State; with an average budget between 100 000 and 200 000 EUR. These figures have been estimated on the basis of previous experience (2007's Plan D calls for proposal amounted to 2.4 million EUR for 13 Member States). \u2022 Regarding the remaining 2.1 million EUR, in addition to ongoing contracts, the Representations foresee to launch approximately 136 calls for tender (131 of them \u2264 60 000 EUR and 5 of them > 60 000 EUR). 6.
