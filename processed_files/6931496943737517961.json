        "RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CAPACITY BUILDING PROJECTS Marxan with zones study to identify candidate MPAs - Comoros Element Description Title Identification of candidate Comorian MPAs for discussion through a Marxan with zones study SDG Target 14.5 Country or Region Comoros Main challenge(s) or gap(s) which project addresses Comoros are not likely meet the SDG 14.5 target of MPA coverage by the target date of 2020. Since 2000, the percentage of marine protected areas has increased from 0% to 0.3% in 2015 and now at a level of 3%, but not near the target of 10%. Scientific support using identified \u201cgood\u201d practice as employed in the Seychelles for the same purpose is recommended to identify candidate MPAs for discussion. Objective Building on the regional experience of the Seychelles (Seychelles Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) Initiative and The Nature Conservancy) in identifying candidate areas for MPAs using a Marxan with zones approach this project will replicate this process in the Comoros where there are similar fisheries, habitats and stakeholders. The objective would be to develop candidate MPAs in Comoros to meet the required level of coverage within 3 years. Main elements of the project The main elements of the project workplan to enable achievement of the objective(s) would include: \uf0b7 Identification of data sources required; \uf0b7 Stakeholder inputs into process; \uf0b7 Data collection; \uf0b7 Development of candidate MPAs; \uf0b7 Secondary stakeholder consultation; and \uf0b7 Provision of advice to meet necessary SDG target of 10% coverage. This would be implemented using a Marxan with zones style analysis. Marxan is the most widely used decision support software for conservation planning globally. It's used in 184 countries to build marine and terrestrial conservation systems and is the global leader in conservation land and sea use planning software.

Allows MCS authorities (e.g. Comoros fishing Authority, Coastguard etc.) to better understand the risks that Comoros is facing and to include the risk assessment in a national MCS strategy / NPOA-IUU as appropriate to better target limited national resources. With only 2 small Defender class Coastguard vessels there is limited capacity. Comoros currently has no NPOA-IUU in place and limited or no port State control though there are no major ports for industrial fisheries. Comoros has been identified as a non-cooperating third country under the EU\u2019s regulation to fight and deter illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing (May 2017). Each national IUU risk assessment will feed into a regional MCS strategy allowing shared resources to be better deployed and managed and understand risks shared between States and how these can be deterred an mitigated against.

        "Cape Verde national sheet Increased awareness of plastic pollution- Comoros Element Description Title Identification of plastic pollution sources and pathways in Comoros to support development of a regional strategy to combat plastic pollution SDG Target 14.1 (By 2025, prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds, in particular from land- based activities, including marine debris and nutrient pollution) Country or Region Comoros Main challenge(s) or gap(s) which project addresses The main challenge which the Comoros face in terms achieving SDG 14.1, is that it has little control over the sources of marine pollution and marine debris. Plastic pollution found in the Comoros\u2019 EEZ is thought to largely originate from external sources (e.g. Madagascar). This means the source of pollution can be difficult to identify and therefore difficult to control and regulate. By identifying the sources of pollution and developing a method for tracking plastic from its source, this information can be used to raise awareness for the need for proper waste management. In Comoros, where a large proportion of the plastic comes from external sources, a regional strategy will need to be developed to ensure a collaborative approach with neighbouring countries, to tackle marine plastic pollution. Objective To identify the main sources of marine plastic pollution in the country\u2019s EEZ (both internal and external sources). This information can then be used to increase public awareness of the issues with marine plastic and help to support the development of a regional strategy to minimise waste and properly enforce effective waste management (e.g. recycling schemes/plastic bag ban). The indicators which can be used to measure whether the objectives are reached include: - Method developed which accurately tracks plastic waste from source to sink - Training course programmes and record of attendance. - Recycling schemes set up in country - Joint regional strategy developed in Indian Ocean Main elements of the project \uf0b7 Define method to identify sources of plastic pollution in Comoros\u2019 EEZ. \uf0b7 Define method to track pathway of plastic from the source to the Comoros\u2019 EEZ. \uf0b7 Hold workshops in-country to raise public ",

It is governed by a federal system at the level of the Union with an elected president every 5 years, and a parliament but at the level each autonomous island, a governor and a council who are also elected every 5 years. Azali Assoumani won the most recent presidential elections in 2016. With a more stable government, a series of structural and fiscal austerity reforms are gradually being implemented (World Bank, 2017). In 2015, it was ranked in the lowest 10 countries globally for government effectiveness with a score of -1.52 and lowest10-25 th for control of corruption with a score of -0.64 (which both range from -2.5 to 2.5) (WRI, 2017; following the methodology by Kaufmann et al., 2010, see also Figure 1). In 2016, the Comorean population was estimated at 795,601 inhabitants (World Bank, 2017) with an annual growth rate of 2.063%, and a high population density of approximately 390 inhabitants per km2 (UNDP, 2013). More than half of the population (53%) is under the age of 20 (World Bank, 2017). In 2015, the Comoros was ranked 159th (out of 188) in the U.N.\u2019s Human Development Index in 2015 (in 2013 it was 169 out of 187 countries (UNDP 2013)). In 2012, the rate of household poverty had gone from 36.9% in 2004 to 38% (UNDP, 2013). The last household survey conducted in 2014, showed that almost 18% of the population lives under the international poverty line set at US$1.9 per capita per day (expressed in 2011 purchasing power parity terms). The incidence of poverty is highest in rural areas and on the island of Mwali. There is a high level of inequality (Gini index = 44.9) (World Bank, 2017). ",

Agriculture, including fishing and forestry, contributes 40% of the GDP and employs 80% of the labour force, providing most of the country\u2019s exports. Its geographical isolation, the small size of domestic markets and the geographic dispersion of islands result in considerable additional costs in infrastructure, transport and communications (Joint UNEP/OCHA Environment Unit, 2013). Given the important role of agriculture in the economy, measures aimed at stimulating agricultural activities and rural development are regarded as particularly important to improve the living conditions of the poorest segments of the population, most of whom live in rural areas (World Bank, 2017). Fishing in Comorean waters can be categorized as small-scale artisanal fishing performed by local fishermen and industrial fishing carried out by large foreign vessels operating under bilateral fisheries agreements. The total national fleet is estimated at around 5,300 vessels, of which 45% and 49% in the islands of Anjouan and Grande- Comore, respectively, and the remainder in Moh\u00e9li. The average degree of motorisation is of approximately 30% (Toihir, 2011). Artisanal fishing provides around 24,000 indirect jobs and contributes 8-10% to the country's GDP (Naji & Youssouf, 2007). More recent reports state that nearly 15% of the population work in fisheries; representing about 15% of the GDP (UNCTAD, 2017). The Comoros is therefore hugely reliant on fishing, and fishery products are the main source of animal protein for a large proportion of the population of the islands (Naji & Youssouf, 2007; UNCTAD, 2017). The Comoros have had EU fisheries partnerships since 1988, and currently has a Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement, which entered into force in 2013 following some concerns over IUU fishing in 2011. -3 -2 -10123V&A PSNV GE RQ RoL CoC COM OROS Min Average Max ",
        "\u2018Evaluation of driftnet fisheries \u2013 Case study report Page 18 There are no official reports that have assessed the country\u2019s progress in meeting its SDGs. The Comoros was not included in the recent report \u201cSDG Index and Dashboards Report 2017\u201d due to insufficient data availability. The Comoros current Strategy for Accelerated Growth for Sustainable Development (2014-2019) which follows on from its 2009 growth and poverty reduction strategy targets undernourishment, increasing food security, strengthening the economy and good governance. The Comoros scored very low in 2015 on its achievement of Millennium Development Goals (UNSD, 2015). Only 3 of the 20 MDGs were considered \u2018potentially achievable\u2019 according to the African Development Bank. Main challenges in delivering the SDG14 targets include Comoro\u2019s institutional capacity which is considered very weak (ABD, 2016), lack of policy frameworks required to achieve SDG14 targets, and considerable poverty levels. On the former, there is limited pool of skills and expertise to support research and data collection especially when it comes to highly technical areas such as fisheries management, ecosystem protection, MPAs. There are also very little environmental data to use to establish baselines or support planning/decision making. Some progress has been made with the establishment of new government bodies to lead on and implement relevant policies but there is limited information about their effectiveness. 2 P ROGRESS ON SDG 14 TARGET Target specific details about SDG 14 are captured in Table 1 while Table 2 and 3 provide a perspective on challenges that might thwart delivery and mechanisms that could support it, respectively. 2.1 Overview International The Comoros are a Party to the Convention on Biodiversity, Convention on Climate Change, Convention on Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Convention on Desertification, Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, Convention on Hazardous Wastes, Convention of Vienna on the Protection of the Ozone Layer, Convention on Law of the Sea, Convention on Ship Pollution, Convention on Wetlands and has signed the Memorandum of Understanding on the Conservation and Management of Marine Turtles and their Habitats of the Indian Ocean and South-East Asia. It is a Party to the Nairobi Convention and the African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (known also as Algiers Convention). The Union is also part of the two regional fishery bodies covering the south-western Indian Ocean, which are both related to tuna and tuna-like fisheries: the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) and the Southwest Indian Ocean Fisheries Commission (SWIOFC)). It has also ratified the COP21 Paris Agreement. The Comoros is a party of the first global agreement, which aims to achieve and maintain a favourable conservation status for sharks and rays based on the best available scientific information and taking into account the economic value of sharks and rays for Range States. It aims to establish regional management plans by the end of 2018. Comoros ratified the International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Co-operation in 2000 and it entered into force on Apr 5, 2000. A National Plan to Combat Oil Spills at Sea (Plan national de lutte contre les d\u00e9versements des hydrocarbures en mer), known as POLMAR, was elaborated in 2010 \u2013 but it is unclear whether it has been implemented (Joint UNEP/OCHA Environment Unit, 2013). Regional ",
        "International Oceans Governance - Scientific Support Comoros Literature Review Page 19 The Comoros is involved in several regional scale mechanisms aimed at improving marine and coastal governance. These include a partnership called the \u2018Western Indian Ocean Coastal Challenge\u2019 (WIOCC) aimed at improving national level engagement in support of Nairobi Convention and a Memorandum of Understanding between the Consortium of Coastal and Marine Ecosystems in the Western Indian Ocean 1 (WIO-C) and the WIOCC (signed in 2013). Two further programmes include: the \u201cImplementation of the Strategic Action Programme for the Protection of the Western Indian Ocean from Land-based Sources and Activities\u201d and the \u201cWestern Indian Ocean LMEs Strategic Action Programme Policy Harmonization and Institutional Reforms (SAPPHIRE) Project\u201d The implementation of the Strategic Action Programme aims to promote multi-state cooperation to balance conflicting water uses in transboundary surface and groundwater basins and multi-state cooperation to rebuild marine fisheries and reduce pollution of coasts and Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs) while considering climatic variability and change. The SAPPHIRE Project aims to achieve effective long-term ecosystem management in the Western Indian Ocean LMEs. A further partnership worth mentioning is the WIOLAB Sustainability Strategy which started in 2010. It aims to improve the knowledge base and establish and demonstrate regional strategies for the reduction of stresses to the marine and coastal ecosystem by i) improving water and sediment quality; ii) strengthening the regional legal basis for preventing land-based sources of pollution; and iii) developing regional capacity for sustainable, less polluting development including the implementation of the Nairobi Convention. Another example of the Comoros engagement in regional mechanisms, is its participation in a regional meeting on the implementation of the voluntary guidelines for securing sustainable small-scale fisheries in the context of food security and poverty alleviation (SSF Guidelines). The meeting was held in 2016 by the Indian Ocean Commission (IOC), in collaboration with the Southern African Development Community (SADC), with support from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). The aim was to produce a regional Action Plan to better address small-scale fisheries. The Comoros has become involved in a number of recent initiatives to combat IUU fishing in the Western Indian Ocean region. This includes: FISH-i Africa which brings together eight East African coastal countries along the Western Indian Ocean, aimed at enhancing regional cooperation, improve data analysis and provide technical expertise with the view to stopping illegal catch getting to market, and preventing criminal fishers pursuing their businesses. FISH-i Africa has a Task Force that enables authorities to identify and act against large-scale illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing; and helps share vessel data in real-time and accessing satellite tracking expertise. The overall aim is to build a robust and effective mechanism to catalyse enforcement actions and ultimately to secure a sustainable end to illegal fishing in the Western Indian Ocean. Another initiative is the Fisheries Transparency Initiative (FiTI) which includes countries from the Indian Ocean Islands and East Africa that meet to develop strategies to tackle illegal fishing and increase accountability in fisheries practices. From 26-28 July 2017, representatives from the fishing industry, civil society, governments and fishing 1 WIO-C is an umbrella organization, anchored within the Nairobi Convention, consisting of a consortium of NGOs, whose membership includes BirdLife International, Coastal Oceans Research and Development in the Indian Ocean (CORDIO), International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), Western Indian Ocean Marine Sciences Association (WIOMSA), and World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), among others. ",
        "\u2018Evaluation of driftnet fisheries \u2013 Case study report Page 20 administrations from Seychelles, Mauritius, Comoros, Madagascar, Tanzania, Kenya and Mozambique, met on Mahe Island, Seychelles, to discuss the Fisheries Transparency Initiative (FiTI). The FiTI Western Indian regional workshop was organized by the African Natural Resources Center of the African Development Bank (AfDB), the Government of Seychelles, the Indian Ocean Commission (IOC), and the FiTI International Secretariat. It was aimed at enhancing the understanding of fisheries administration, transparency in the sector and how FiTI can yield benefits for communities and other stakeholders. The workshop was also aimed at raising the interest of the IOC and Eastern African countries to participate in FiTI and adhere to the FiTI standard. National Marine resources are important to the Comoros. Artisanal fishing is a cornerstone of national food security and is the main source of animal protein for over 70% of the rural population (Obura, 2012). Recent research has shown that the Comoros is one of the countries that are the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change and ocean acidification, which are likely to become more severe in coming years, further threatening the nation\u2019s food security. The Comoros is also one of nine countries regarded to be most vulnerable to coral reef degradation (Burke et al., 2011). Unfortunately, the country has for a long time lacked a clear fisheries policy and an effective national fisheries management to safeguard the marine biodiversity, which underpins its fisheries and food security. However, recent initiatives have sought to improve this and to strengthen governance in the marine environment. A legal framework for fisheries governance has been in place since April 2015 [Decret d\u2019application du code de la peche], a Coastal Demersal Fisheries Management Plan (2012); a development strategy for fisheries (2004), and a Fisheries and Aquaculture Code (2007). The establishment of a Seafood Quality and Sanitation Control Office [l\u2019Office National de contr\u00f4le Qualit\u00e9 et de certification des produits Halieutiques (ONCQCPH)] in 2010 marked an important step towards developing an export market for seafood products. The threat posed by Somali piracy has led to underutilisation of fishing opportunities according to COFREPECHE et al., (2013). Total fisheries production was around 10,000 tonnes per year from 1990 to 2000 after when production started to increase year on year and reached 63,517 metric tonnes in 2010. It has dropped to 43,732 in 2013. These figures do not account for the EU\u2019s catch which has been recorded at around 60,000 tonnes/year. Local production reached 15000 tonnes from 2010. All production is recorded as being from capture fisheries (World Development Indicators, 2017). The threat posed by Somali piracy has led to underutilisation of fishing opportunities since 2005 according to COFREPECHE et al., (2013). It dropped to 43,732 in 2013. The Comoros currently has a fisheries partnership agreement (FPA) with the European Union for the yearly capture of 4,850 tonnes of large migratory pelagic species. According to Joint UNEP/OCHA Environment Unit, 2013, there has been a vessel monitoring service (VMS) centre in operation at the Directorate-General for Fisheries Resources in Moroni since 2007. The Indian Ocean Commission currently provides assistance to the fisheries monitoring centre, based in Moroni, in charge of fisheries activity monitoring and supervision missions in the maritime space of the Union of Comoros. Five fishery inspectors and observers regularly participate in regional missions to fight illegal fishing and embark on offshore patrol vessels (ADB, 2016). Jurisdiction within its EEZ is complicated due to the fact that Mayotte remains a French possession and Comoros\u2018 EEZ overlaps with Madagascar, Mozambique, Tanzania and the Seychelles (European Union 2013). For these reasons, meeting SDGs 14.2, 14.4, 14c is likely to be challenging. Nearly half of the EU financial contributions through the SFPA are earmarked for government capacity building (COFREPECHE, 2013). ",
        "International Oceans Governance - Scientific Support Comoros Literature Review Page 21 FAO assistance in Comoros is shaped by the 2014-2019 FAO Country Programming Framework (CPF), which revolves around three priority areas: Intensification, diversification and commercialization of agricultural and livestock production for improved food security, including efforts to foster a more competitive and diversified agriculture sector; strengthening governance and sustainable management of forest and other natural resources, with an emphasis on agroforestry development; improving the collection and quality of agricultural statistics, including support to the national agriculture census and the establishment of a permanent agricultural information system. Jointly developed with the Government and other stakeholders, the CPF reflects relevant priorities in key national development policies, including the Accelerated Growth and Sustainable Development Strategy (2015-2019) and the Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (2010-2014). It is also takes into account sectoral policies such as the National Agricultural Strategy, the National Fisheries Strategy, the National Forestry Policy, and the Food and Nutrition Strategy. There is no aquaculture recorded in the Comoros, all production is from capture fisheries (ReCoMap, 2007; World Development Indicators, 2017). Between 1993 and 2001, the Union of the Comoros adopted a political framework which resulted in the development and adoption of a National Environment Policy, an Environmental Action Plan, and a National Strategy and Action Plan for the Conservation and Sustainable Management of Biodiversity. The Comoros National ICZM Committee was formally established as the ICZM Sub-Committee of the Commission Nationale de D\u00e9veloppement Durable (CNDD) by a Ministerial Order in 2008. Three Island ICZM Committees exist on Anjouan, Moheli and Grande Comore and each one finalised their Activity Plans 2009-2010. ICZM Capacity Development (Policy Development, Planning Processes, Monitoring and Reporting) has been supported by ReCoMaP (Regional Programme for the Sustainable Management of the Coastal Zones of the Indian Ocean Countries). There is a critical lack of marine environmental protection efforts and this lack of information about fishing stocks, the scale of fishing efforts and fish captures hinders fisheries management efforts (COFREPECHE, 2013). The Comoros\u2019 weak central capacity for supporting marine management, coupled with the limited scope of the country\u2019s marine conservation initiatives to date, have been at the heart of NGOs work in the Comoros, where they have become more active over the five years. In particular, national NGOs have been at the forefront in this field since the 90s: for example \"Ulanga\", \"ADSEI\" (Association pour le D\u00e9veloppement Economique et Social d\u2019Itsamia) which strongly contributed to the creation of the first protected area, \"AIDE \". More recently, Blue Ventures, WWF and Dahari have focused their efforts on a new model for community-led marine environmental management, in which coastal communities are fully engaged in resource monitoring and management (Blue Ventures, per comm. 2017). This has the potential to contribute to several SDGs and targets under SDG14. WWF and Dahari have received $27,000 for research on the use of marine resources and the socio-economic context in order to develop a model of community-based management of marine resources (Dahari, 2017). Dahari also have CEPF funding through Blue Ventures, for a two-year project to develop a model of community-based management of marine resources; and development of knowledge and capacity for the monitoring and management. Activities are focused on improving the knowledge of the marine environment in the region through participatory assessments of coastal habitats and fisheries; ($150,000). Both projects are focused in the West of Anjouan and one is in the peninsula of Sima (Dahari, 2017). A large MPA \u2013 Moheli Marine Park (PMM) was established officially in 2001 and became a National Park in December 2015. It is the Comoros first national park. It covers 404 square km and protects coral reefs, seagrasses and mangroves and about 16,170 km of forest. The Union of the Comoros is ",
        "\u2018Evaluation of driftnet fisheries \u2013 Case study report Page 22 planning to put in place a national network across the three islands, including six new protected areas with support from the GEF/UNDP (agreed in 2014, started in 2015). At the end of the project, the perentage coverage of marine protected areas will increase from 3% to 5% ( pers comm., Assani Moinahalima, October 2017). This percentage differs from that reported by the World Bank Data Bank on the Sustainable Development Goals, which notes that MPA coverage has increased from 0% in 2000 to 0.3% in 2015. The Research Institute for Agriculture, Fisheries and the Environment [l\u2019Institut National de Recherche pour l\u2019Agriculture, la P\u00eache et l\u2019Environnement (INRAPE)] was created in 1995 to facilitate adaptation research programmes (agricultural, fisheries and environmental), to consolidate analysis and publication of results and to promote national and international research collaborations including training and staff development programmes, as well as to promote techniques and methods for increasing agricultural and fisheries productivity, and environmental conservation. Reef monitoring is regularly carried out by World Development Indicators, (2017)the Comoros Reef Network which is run by the NGO AIDE (Association d\u2019Intervention pour le D\u00e9veloppement et l\u2019Environnement) under the supervision of the Directorate General of Environment and Forests (DGEF). In addition, the Moh\u00e9li National Park also regularly monitors the Park's various conservation targets (reefs, turtles, mangroves, dugong, etc.). The monitoring of turtles is carried out in collaboration with KELONIA (in Reunion Island) since the creation of the park in 2001. However, there is still a need for a more systematic collection and analysis of data on the status of terrestrial and marine coastal ecosystems. After accession of the Comoros to the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC/UNESCO) in 2001 and the project of ODINAFRICA (network of oceanographic data and information exchange for Africa), a National oceanographic Data Center for Comoros (CNDOC) was created in July 12, 2001, with the support of the Government of Flanders and UNESCO. The CNDO is hosted by the Centre National de Documentation et de recherches scientifique (CNDRS). It is responsible for monitoring and backing up data including oceanographic information and socio-economic data; improving knowledge on the state of the marine and coastal environment; collecting and storing physicochemical, biological and socio-economic data related to the marine environment; developing and distributing services and products on the data and marine information; raising awareness and promote access to information marine of all users. However, according to the Joint UNEP/OCHA Environment Unit (2013), the number of experts on marine and coastal science is small and the capacity of the University of the Comoros to undertake sustained research and monitoring programmes is very reduced. There have been several collaborations with research institutions in the region and abroad in the last couple of decades, notably with the CORDIO programme following the 1998 and 2002 coral bleaching events and in recent years, Turin University in efforts related to biodiversity conservation, and with WWF over MPAs. Previously funded projects from the World Bank and GEF (SWIOFISH) have made progress in strengthening ecological management and sustainable use of the fisheries resources in the West Indian region. The Global Environment Facility funded projects across SIDS including Comoros, one of which aimed at integrated water resources and wastewater management which has resulted in an active committee in charge of watershed management plan; cleanup activities as well as reforestation and anti-erosion measures. Another \u2013 more recent project \u2013 is the Co-Management of Coastal Resources for Sustainable Livelihoods (CoReCSuD) Project, which finished in April 2017 and was aimed to help boost employment and revenue in the fisheries sector. Funding totalling $2.73 million, came from World Bank, the Japanese Social Development Fund (JSDF), and International Development Association (IDA). The Directorate General for Fisheries Resources (DGRH) was responsible for its implementation, in close collaboration with the Community Development Assistance Fund (FADC). The project also supported the Comoros Country Partnership Strategy\u2019s goal of shared growth through a stronger, ",
        "International Oceans Governance - Scientific Support Comoros Literature Review Page 23 sustainable fisheries industry. As a result of this work 27 villages have developed plans for managing their fisheries. Other initiatives include the partnership coordinated between 2009 and 2010 by the Secretariat of the Indian Ocean Commission with the EU which has been focused on upgrading and equipping the Fisheries Surveillance Centre of Comoros; support to Marine Protected Areas in Seychelles, Mauritius, Comoros; and coastal erosion protection in Seychelles and Comoros (NGOs). Unfortunately, no progress reports exist. A new project relevant for fisheries in the Comoros is the First South West Indian Ocean Fisheries Governance and Shared Growth Project for the Africa region. Its aim is to improve the management effectiveness of selected priority fisheries at the regional, national and community level. It recognizes the importance of fisheries as a key contributor to food security and nutrition, safety net, and job creation for rural coastal populations of the Southern WIO, which are among the poorest and most vulnerable. The FAO is also providing technical assistance for the formulation of this co-financed by the World Bank and Global Environment Facility fisheries development project. IUU fishing has remained an issue in the Comorean EEZ, even though several actions and initiatives have been taken. The EU Sustainable Partnership Fisheries Agreement (started in 2013) provides for strengthening the fight against illegal fishing, as well as technical monitoring of migratory resources across the Indian Ocean. The agreement calls also on both the EU and the Union of the Comoros to follow the recommendations of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC). The Comoros adopted an IOTC Resolution on IUU fishing in 2016 (IOTC, 2016). However, in 2017, the Comoros was identified as non-cooperating third countries under the EU's regulation to fight and deter illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing\u2013 and this therefore presents a challenge for achieving SDG 14.4 (EU, 2017). The Comoros have received a red card, which implies trade sanctions. As the Comoros do not export fish to the EU, the decision will not impact on trade. However, EU vessels will no longer be allowed to take licences to fish in their waters. This is despite the EU Sustainable Partnership Agreement, which commits to strengthen the Comoros fight against IUU. 2.2 Progress with MDGs The Comoros developed a Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy [Strat\u00e9gie de Croissance et de R\u00e9duction de la Pauvret\u00e9 2010-2014 (SCRP)] in 2009 in order to help make progress on the MDGs. The Comorian National Commission for Sustainable Development (Commission Nationale du D\u00e9veloppement Durable - CNDD) was created in 2008 by a joint decree from the Ministry for Fishing, Agriculture and the Environment and the Ministry for Territory Planning, Infrastructures, Town Planning and Housing. It is the national body working to engage stakeholders including NGOs and the private sector in sustainable development discussions and acts as a bridge between the government and stakeholders. In 2015, the Comoros was ranked 159th (out of 188) on the UN Human Development Index \u2013an improvement compared to 2012. However, despite the country achieving progress with a Gross National Income (GNI) per capita of which rose from $US 400 in 2002 to $US 820 in 2014 (ADB, 2016); the Comoros scored very low in 2015 on its Millennium Development Goals (UNSD, 2015). The Comoros also experienced a reduction of Overseas Development Aid as a percentage of its GNI of over 25 per cent in 2012 (UNSD, 2015). Only 3 of the 20 MDGs were considered \u2018potentially achievable\u2019 according to the African Development Bank. Institutional capacity in the Comoros is considered still very weak (ABD, 2016). When the timeframe for the SCRP ended, a new strategy for sustainable development was adopted to cover the period 2015-2019; the Strategy for Accelerated Growth for Sustainable Development ",

The CNDD is responsible for its monitoring and implementation. 2.3 Delivery across SDGs There are no official reports that have assessed the country\u2019s progress in meeting its SDGs. The Comoros was not included in the recent report \u201cSDG Index and Dashboards Report 2017\u201d due to insufficient data availability. In May 2014, the Comoros adapted its new poverty reduction and growth strategy (SCA2D) for the period 2015-2019 \u2013 which follows on from its 2009 growth and poverty reduction strategy. The SCA2D is based on a participatory approach and sets out a medium-term development strategy and the foundations for a long-term program. Its main objectives are to: strengthen the economy to promote high, viable, equitable, sustainable, and inclusive growth; improve the quality of life of the population and ensure equity in access to basic social services; promote the natural and cultural heritage and sound management of natural resources ; and promote good governance and improve resilience in the face of political fragility (World Bank, 2017). The African Development Bank developed a new Country Strategy Plan 2016-20 to help the Comoros meet its development aspirations in line with SCA2D 2015-19 (ADB, 2016). A consultation process with different stakeholders for aligning the SCA2D with the UN SDGs is underway (pers. comm., Assani Moinahalima, October 2017). The Comoros had previously set an objective to increase consumption of fish, and to reduce dependency on meat imports. The Government aimed to increase production by over 50% from its 2010 level, adding more than 5,000 new jobs and increasing the contribution of fishing to the GDP to 16 percent (Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy, 2009). Undernourishment has reached chronic levels in Comoros with 65% of the population affected. The proportion of undernourished has declined only marginally in the last decade suggesting that much work is yet to be done under the current era of SDGs (FAO, 2017). No progress reports could be found. ",

        "ZF2296 SWOT Template \u2013 Comoros v001 55 1 I NTRODUCTION The main objective of this series of SWOT analyses is to obtain information about the capacities and the limitations that are currently faced by each of the countries in the study in being able to address their SDG14 requirements. In a standard SWOT analysis (strengths weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) internal (S&W) and external (O&T) factors (to the country in this case) are analysed. The internal scope (strengths and weaknesses) are those related to the organisations, projects and structures of the country; the external scope (opportunities and threats) are those events and pressures that influence the country from outside but can much it easier (opportunities) or make it more difficult or prevent a country from achieving its objectives (threats). Once the four elements: strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats have been analysed individually (Section 1), some key underlying mechanisms may be determined to utilise strengths and opportunities individually or to address and counter weaknesses and threats. However, it is usually necessary to further analyse the relationships between the four components to identify potential ways forward and then to set strategies to follow in order to take advantage of our strengths based on specific opportunities and to reduce threats, and to work to combat any identified weaknesses by identifying opportunities and to highlight where weaknesses and threats coincide so measures can be taken to reduce the potential negative impacts.

        "\u2018Evaluation of driftnet fisheries \u2013 Case study report Page 58 3 SWOT D EFINITION The following four sections identify individual strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats identified for Comoros. Each element identified is given a unique number for future reference, fully described and evidence given. 3.1 Strengths Strengths can be described as a country\u2019s internal positive attributes that makes a country stand out from others. Strengths could include attributes such as a defined national focus on a particular key issue, strong academic infrastructure that can underpin research, good long-term funding for relevant government bodies etc. For example, a country may only have a single national university but if that university has a strong oceanographic or marine biology focus with strong internationally renowned research groups that would be a key strength in developing mechanisms and analysing data to enable a country to meet its SDG targets. Comoros has a politically stable government enforcing a strong regulatory framework for environmental and fisheries issues. The National Environment Policy has provided a political framework and strategic action plan for the Conservation and Sustainable Management of Biodiversity. Although there is a high proportion of small scale, generally low impact fisheries, conservation commitments (shark and ray, climate change action) have been made and projects on marine biodiversity protection and ecosystem restoration have been implemented. Comoros has a strong network of key national bodies and NGOs as well as membership to two regional fisheries bodies (IOTC & SWIOFC), enabling the improvement of scientific knowledge, developing research and improving artisanal/livelihood capacity in the area. A large emphasis has been put on marine spatial planning and integrated coastal zone management within Comoros, and large areas of coastal and marine protected areas are being established to regenerate previously identified critical habitats.

The Comoros reef network benefitted from capacity building, which allowed it to be autonomous and effective in reef monitoring activities, in the absence of diving clubs and a marine scientific research institute in the Comoros. It established a regular monitoring of the sites from 1998 to 2007, followed up in 2010 by the Marine Park of Moh\u00e9li and in 2015. This formed the basis of the report on the regional assessment of coral reef health status in the South West Indian Ocean. 22 14.1 Some actions funded to improve wastewater management at a local level.

The African Development Bank developed a new Country Strategy Plan 2016-20 to help the Comoros meet its development aspirations in line with SCA2D 2015-19 (ADB, 2016). 3.2 Weaknesses Weaknesses stop a country from performing at its optimum level. Weaknesses are highlighted as areas or attributes that can be improved to enable the country to improve in particular areas for example a lack of political will to implement changes, reduced administrative or enforcement capacity that can reduce effectiveness. A lack of marine expertise and capacity in Comoros has resulted in limited or incomplete assessment of marine ecosystems, while an absence of a monitoring programmes allowing collection and analysis of ecosystem data has resulted in a general lack of marine environmental data on a national level. There are currently high levels of poverty and inequality on the islands, and with fish remaining an expensive food source in times of both low and high supply, food nutrition security is a concern. Although aquaculture is often considered a mechanism to improve levels of poverty and food security, there is virtually no aquaculture production in Comoros. Overall there is a critical lack of marine environmental protection efforts, with the recently released fisheries policy deficient of an effective national fisheries management. The low overall coverage environmental policy and protection, including the coverage of MPAs around the island may be attributed to this absence of technical capacity, but also the ineffectiveness and corruption within governance.

General lack of institutional capacity In 2012, the rate of household poverty had gone from 36,9% in 2004 to 38% (UNDP, 2013). The last household survey conducted in 2014, showed that almost 18% of the population lives under the international poverty line set at $1.9 per capita per day (expressed in 2011 purchasing power parity terms). The incidence of poverty is highest in rural areas and on the island of Mwali. There is a high level of inequality (Gini index = 44.9) (World Bank, 2017). 4 14.1 National Pollution Plan may not be implemented It is unclear whether it the POLMAR been implemented (Joint UNEP/OCHA Environment Unit, 2013). 5 14.5 Low overall coverage level of MPAs The required target of 10% coverage of protected areas in relation to marine areas may be difficult to reach by the deadline of 2020. It currently stands at 3%. 6 14.1 There is a general lack of marine environmental data at the national level 4 Very little waste water treatment Overall, there is a lack of infrastructure to support waste water management. Water sanitization is a priority 7 All Weak food security \u2013 subsistence based economy. Poor marketing opportunities Fish remains a very expensive commodity for the poorest population in times of low production (when prices increase), but also in times of increased production due to lack of storage and sale facilities. Fish is sold almost exclusively fresh. 8 14.4 Fisheries Policy relatively recent The Comoros has for a long time lacked a clear fisheries policy and there is no effective national fisheries management to safeguard the marine biodiversity underpinning fisheries and food security. There is also a critical lack of marine environmental protection efforts. 9 14.2 Lack of assessments on marine ecosystems No assessments for ocean acidification are available for the Comoros aside from regional reports. Incomplete coral reef status assessments 10 14.4 Low opportunities for aquaculture development There is virtually no aquaculture production in Comoros 4 http://nodc-comoros.org/news/9-centre-oceanographieque-des-comores-cndo-cndrscentre- oceanographieque-des-comores-cndo-cndrs.html) ",

As opportunities are external, a country cannot easily \u2018create\u2019 opportunities, they can only ensure that they are in the best position to gain the maximum benefit from any opportunities that appear, i.e. have the governmental structures in place. There is a high priority for achieving SDG 14 in the region due to the nature of the Indian Ocean, with several current funded programmes aiming to contribute to improved water management and marine and coastal governance. The Integrated Coastal Zone Management committee established in 2008 provides scope to bring together ICZM plans alongside national local plans, while a number of funded projects are encouraging the development of bottom up governance for fisheries management; providing opportunities to improve the effectiveness of resource management within Comoros. Available EU SPFA funding provides further governance improvement opportunities, strengthening the fight against illegal fishing in the area, as well as technical monitoring of migratory resource across the Indian Ocean. The combination of high regional knowledge and experience, and strong internal NGO backing has provided support and funding opportunities for capacity building, including community based monitoring on marine resources and conservation training.

A typical threat would be \u201cGlobal warming creating negative economic impacts through reduced fishing opportunities and environmental damage\u201d. The current level of regional fishing effort remains high, and the limited effectiveness of enforcement within the Comorian EEZ threaten marine conservation initiates such as MPAs and actions against IUU activities. This being said, the current status of MPAs are not being declared to a sufficient level of coverage, potentially leading to significant loss of biodiversity and damage to valuable ecosystems. Due to reliance of Comoros on their marine resources, the ineffectiveness of small MPAs and the growing threat of climatic changes to fisheries could have a detrimental impact to their economic stability and resilience to large-scale global economic down-turns in the future. The nature of common waters and neighbouring EEZs means Comoros has limited control over unsustainable fishing activities and inputs of marine debris in the region, ultimately impacting the ecological status of their own marine resources.

In these cases the assessment of risk is crucial. It is very important to understand the risks faces and ignorance of those risks is a poor state to be in. Where risks and potential impacts are shown to be low then we should highlight these issues as a low priority and ensure that countries are not distracted by them, but where the risks and / or the impacts are high then it is recommended that an assessment of funding and capability gaps is conducted and a mitigation plan developed to ensure these risks are addressed. This could be through additional funding, training, bringing in additional temporary technical assistance, or working with neighbouring States to transfer skills, personnel or equipment (e.g. rent of a patrol vessel during \u201chigh\u201d season in one EEZ during the \u201clow\u201d season in the vessel owners\u2019 EEZ) or joint purchasing and usage of high value resources. Low overall coverage of MPAs has been highlighted as significant weakness in Comoros, with coverage failing to achieve the 10% defined by SDG14. Limited enforcement capacity and insufficient levels of coverage of MPAs may threaten marine conservation initiatives, potentially resulting in increased loss of biodiversity and damage to vulnerable resources.

The proportion of undernourished has declined only marginally in the last decade suggesting that much work is yet to be done under the current era of SDGs (FAO, 2017). 7 Lack of capacity (technical skills, equipment and resources) IUU fishing has remained an issue in the Comorean EEZ, even though several actions and initiatives have been taken (large EEZ, low level of MCS resources) Economic \u2013 Global economic downturn Current high level of regional fishing effort Comoros has a large EEZ of approx. 163,752km2. Large area to cover for enforcement with limited policing resources. Jurisdiction within its EEZ is complicated as Mayotte remains a French possession and Comoros EEZ overlaps with Madagascar, Mozambique, Tanzania and the Seychelles (European Union 2013). In 2017, the Comoros was identified as non-cooperating ",

FISH-I Africa and FiTI initiatives will improve regional cooperation to stop IUU fishing in the WIO Planning question : \"If these areas are not already being planned for and prioritised, then why not?\" \u201cPotentially attractive options\u201d Low technical skills can be addressed through capacity building and knowledge exchange (e.g. Western Indian Ocean Coastal Challenge; SAPPHIRE Project, UNESCO-IOC and ODINAFRICA) Limited capacity on fisheries for establishing local plans can addressed via SWIOFISH and FAO programmes Lack of capacity to cover the large EEZ could be improved through regional mechanisms aimed at targeting IUU fishing and support from EU SFPA Lack of capacity to police the Comorean waters can be addressed via EU-SFPA, and IOC training in MCS By 2021, the Comoros has committed to increasing the coverage of protected areas (marine & terrestrial) from 11% to 27% Vulnerabilities in food security and malnutrition can be targeted via ADB, SWIOFISH and FAO programmes NGOs help deliver community-led marine environmental management where government capacity is low Planning question : \"What is stopping or limiting progress on implementation, are assumptions correct and are plans realistic and substantial?\" ",
        "T h r e a t s \u201cThreats should be easy to defend and counter\u201d Work on external sources of pollution and marine debris has begun in the WIO region. Health risks being mitigated via training in assessment and local waste water treatment via Western Indian Ocean Coastal Challenge (WIO-CC); SAPPHIRE Project. Food security risks being mitigated via programmes to improve fish marketing storage and processing systems Strengthening governance, fisheries assessments and participation in RFMOs can help to mitigate against potential impacts from unsustainable practices in neighbouring EEZs. Regional cooperation to tackle IUU fishing and improve enforcement and control of fisheries activities in the national EEZ. Self-sufficient systems set up and run within country must start to replace short-term external funding Climate change mitigation is being encouraged and options for coastal ecosystem resilience enhanced; particularly in context of coral reefs Planning question : \"Are threats properly informed and organisation in place to deal with threats? No surprises. Regional threats be turned intolocal opportunities?\" \u201cPotentially high risk scenarios\u201d The WIO region remains high risk for IUU fishing with reports of piracy. In particular, where poverty, conflict and political instability exist, IUU fishing tends to increase (e.g. Somalia). Further economic pressures are likely to lead to unsustainable use of resources locally and in the region as a whole particularly when there is a lack of capacity to enforce fisheries regulations and to police the EEZ Food security risks from increased natural hazards due to high dependence on fish for protein for subsistence, with limited opportunities for food storage and distribution. When national level of corruption is coupled with common pool resource governance, this can lead to overexploitation through enforcement difficulties and tragedy of the commons behaviour. As development and industrialisation increases, pollution is likely to increase. In addition, the Comoros is subject to external sources of pollution and marine debris which are outside its control. The Comoros has been identified as at high risk from climate change. Current lack of capacity for assessing and monitoring marine resources presents a challenge for the long-term particularly where there is a lack of baseline data. Without long-term sources of funding, the Comoros has been unable to collect standardised, long-term data series on marine environmental change Insufficient MPA coverage for the achievement of SDG 14.5 [<3%]. Planning question : \"Are risks and impacts assessed for these issues? Where the risks / impacts are high are specific mitigation plans in place?\" ",
