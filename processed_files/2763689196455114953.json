        "Note to readers Apart from the titles, a full translation of written questions with answers tabled from the sixth parliamentary term onwards is not available in the 22 official languages. P and E questions are translated by Parliament into the 11 \u2018old\u2019 languages and into the author\u2019s language if it is one of the 2004 and 2007 enlargement languages. As regards answers to questions, the situation is more complicated: \u2014 answers prepared by the Commission are supplied only in the author\u2019s language and in either EN or FR, as requested; \u2014 the Council gives answers only in the 11 EU official languages of the period before 2004. In the light of this situation, readers seeking details of the substance of questions and answers should go to Parliament\u2019s website (Europarl) and, more specifically, the \u2018Parliamentary questions\u2019 heading: http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB/home.jsp Should the language version the reader is seeking not be available, Europarl will propose an alternative.
