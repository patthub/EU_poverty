        "N. 22 N.E \u2013 MARCH APRIL 2011 3 I n this issue's dossier, we find that Africa, which had experienced \u2018spa- tial inversion\u2019 in colonial times with coastal ports as capitals, with the sole aim and purpose of draining natu- ral resources abroad for export, is now articulating itself differently. Several multi-nodal transport networks are being developed between countries. Through their development agreements, the EU and other donors are assisting. China is also getting involved purely from a trade point of view. For their part, Pacific states who are vic- tims of the tyranny of distance and hence have difficulties shipping their produce, have recently created a specific shipping company with connections to the rest of the world, via Australia and New Zealand. The Caribbean is struggling after seeing two airlines close due to the elevated price of air travel. An Irish company is prepar- ing to move in. The development of transport in Africa links with the article on \u2018diplomacy of raw materials\u2019 in our \u2018Interaction\u2019 section. Sometimes a single country supplies a large proportion of an indispensible prod- uct to a branch of global industry. This is the case of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), which supplies 40% of the world\u2019s cobalt, and South Africa which produces 80% of the world\u2019s platinum. Consumer countries, in particular the European Union (EU), are demanding equal access to raw materials critical for industrial production and economic devel- opment. The EU is asking for reform from the countries which supply raw materials on the taxation and transparency fronts. NGOs and European researchers mean- while retort, \u2018Who is looking at transpar- ency of companies in developed countries who use these products from Africa and who controls the price\u2019? A number of developing countries, espe- cially in Africa, are victims of \"vulture funds\" which prey on a country as soon as signs of economic recovery emerge, often after debt forgiveness. A country attacked by these birds has little strength to negotiate the sale of its commodities, or the exchange of commodities for the construction of much needed roads. The means to do so, however, have been out- lined by the African Development Bank (AfDB) in an initiative known as ALSF (African Legal Support Facility) to assist countries threatened by these funds. The first country to benefit is the DRC. But the funds at ALSF\u2019s disposal are rela- tively insignificant to support all victims of vulture funds. This issue also draws attention to events in Ivory Coast and Haiti, two of the many countries of the South where things are happening at a great pace. On the one hand, there\u2019s a President who was consti- tutionally elected several months ago but who has had to take up arms in trying to take up his position. He effectively came to power on the 11 th of April, thanks to the armed action of his troops and the military intervention of UN and French forces. On the other hand an atypical outsider came to power in Haiti, a coun- try which is the subject of our special supplement included in this issue, after a somewhat chaotic early election process, with, for once, broad swathes of support from the slums of Port-au-Prince and the country\u2019s great American neighbour. We also report in this issue on Sudan, formerly the largest country in Africa, which has shrunk with the independence of its southern part. The country is on the right track in giving its peoples the right to choose their own destinies. Southern Sudan\u2019s first steps are more reassuring than once feared. Concerns were expressed about the impact of revolutionary upheavals in North Africa on sub-Saharan Africa. The new Mr Africa of European diplomacy, in our Profile section, welcomes the signs from the democratically-held elections in Guinea Conakry and the arrival in power of the opposition in Niger. He says that the lesson to be learned from the turmoil of North Africa is that opting for economic development without political progress is inevitably doomed to failure.

        "Untapped opportunities in the Pacific Secretary General of the Pacific Islands Forum, Tuiloma Neroni Slade Debra Percival S amoan national, Tuiloma Neroni Slade, became Secretary General of the Secretariat of the 16-nation Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) 1 in August 2008. Formerly a judge at the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague, Netherlands, he was his country\u2019s Ambassador in various locations and was previously Samoa\u2019s Attorney General and senior legal adviser with the Commonwealth Secretariat in London. Although the Pacific is geographically far from Europe, he feels there is scope for increased trade links and action on common issues between the two regions, such as climate change, as explained in an interview with The Courier : \u201cOne of the major challenges for Pacific island countries is diversifying their export base and, where possible, ensure that an over- reliance on one or two major partners does not render their countries more vulnerable in times of crisis, as we saw during the Global Economic Crisis.\u201d During the recent downturn, fewer employment opportunities in New Zealand and Australia have negatively affected the region\u2019s economies, particularly those heavily dependent on remittances, such as Samoa and Tonga. \u201cCountries including Tuvalu and Kiribati have trust funds that are invested in international equities. They use the returns from these funds to help finance national budgets. The fall of global share markets resulted in these countries receiving less revenue at a time when communities required additional assistance,\u201d says Mr Slade. But he believes there are good export opportunities in the European Union (EU) market, notably fisheries and fish processing, beauty products, mineral waters and high quality and organic tropical agriculture, waiting to be tapped under an eventual region-wide Economic Partnership Agreement \u2013 a free trade agreement \u2013 with the EU. To date, only Papua New Guinea (PNG) and Fiji have signed a \u2018goods only\u2019 interim EPA with the EU 2 . Under this, PNG is particularly benefitting from a change in Rules of Origin resulting in increased fish canning which has created more jobs. Although the PIF is not at the EPA negotiating table, it gives advice to its member states for the on-going trade talks. EPA opportunities \u201cEven small countries can eventually establish fish freezing and smoking possibilities. It is very important that fresh and frozen fish be granted concessional Rules of Origin in the EPA if the Agreement is to be truly development enhancing,\u201d says the Secretary General. \u201cThe Agreement will only benefit Pacific countries if the private sector is able to take advantage of new market access. Work to improve customs management systems, develop value-added agricultural industries and promote trade to Europe is being supported by the EU and will be essential if the Agreement is to increase trade with the Pacific,\u201d he adds. Underlining the importance of EU aid for trade, Mr Slade also draws attention to the Memorandum of Understanding recently drawn up with the EU to foster dialogue on climate change. The low-lying Pacific region is particularly vulnerable to climate change-induced sea level rises. Increased international donor assistance for education, health and basic infrastructure is also needed if the region is to reach the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), he says. The PIF has set up a \u2018Forum Compact on Strengthening Development Assistance\u2019 which is a dialogue with donors, including the EU, to improve aid coordination and effectiveness across the region. 1 Members of the PIF are: Australia, Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Palau, PNG, Republic of the Marshall Islands, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu. Fiji\u2019s membership is currently suspended (since 2 May 2009) due to the failure of Commodore Bainimarama\u2019s to address constructively by 1 May 2009 the country\u2019s return to democratic governance in an acceptable time- frame for the PIF. 2 Fiji and PNG) initialled an interim EPA (liberalising trade in goods only) with the EU in 2007. PNG signed in July 2009, and Fiji in December 2009.

        "Nicholas Westcott, the EU\u2019s new \"Mr Africa\" Anne-Marie Mouradian B ritish High Commissioner to Ghana and Ambassador to the Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, Niger and Togo until January of this year, and with a previous posting in Tanzania, Nicholas Westcott is now the \u201cMr Africa\u201d of European diplomacy. As Managing Director for Africa in the new European External Action Service (EEAS), responsible for European policy on sub- Saharan Africa and relations with the African Union, he has extensive experience of the continent. \u201cI have been interested in Africa since 1976,\u201d stresses Nick Westcott who speaks fluent French and has a good knowledge of Swahili. \u201cMy doctoral thesis at Cambridge was on political issues in East Africa in the colonial era, including the progress towards independence, the question of nationalisms and economic development.\u201d He also has solid experience of European affairs as a British diplomat in Brussels during the 1980s. The new Managing Director is taking office at a particularly volatile time. Although Libya is primarily the responsibility of his colleague Hugues Mingarelli, Managing Director for the Middle East and the Southern Neighbourhood area (from Morocco to Syria), Nick Westcott is responsible for liaising with the AU and for the humanitarian situation of the hundreds of thousands of African migrants working in Libya. \u201cWe are coordinating with ECHO \u2013 the European Commission's Humanitarian Aid department, the United Nations and the IOM \u2013 the international organisation for migration - in assuring their return to their country of origin.\u201d His services are currently considering the possible implications of the revolts in North Africa for sub- Saharan Africa. \u201cThree elements must be taken into account,\u201d he noted. \u201cFirstly, direct contagion. Is there a risk of destabilisation in neighbouring countries - in West Africa or Sudan, for example? Then there is the coordination of the international community. That is fundamental. Finally, what can the EU do to help the other fragile African countries?\u201d \u201cThere are lessons to be learned from the events in North Africa. The popular discontent is due to the fact that these countries are seeing economic development but without a political system that assures the interests of all their citizens,\u201d he concludes. \u201cWe must help the very fragile sub-Saharan countries such as the Sudan, the DRC and the Ivory Coast that are experiencing a genuine tragedy.\u201d \u201cThe Sahel States do not seem to be destabilised at present. There are even encouraging signs, with democratic elections recently in Guinea Conakry and Niger where the opposition leader has become the new elected president. A democratic process is functioning despite the difficult security situation in the region and the fact that these are among the world\u2019s poorest countries.\u201d The EU is to set out a strategy for the Sahel that will combine the development approach and the security approach, \u201cbecause we cannot guarantee security if there are no jobs for the young people.\u201d Helping the soon to be independent South Sudan meet the needs of its population and resolve outstanding issues with the North is another major challenge for the EU that demands Nick Westcott\u2019s attention. \u201cIt's busy,\u201d he says, \u201cbut there is a real job to do here. We have a great opportunity to help. That's why I came.\u201d N. 22 N.E \u2013 MARCH APRIL 2011 5 Nicholas Westcott \u00a9EEAS ",

He is both a former foreign minister (1977-1982, 1983-1987 and 1991- 1993) and a Member of the European Parliament (1995- 2007). At the time of going to press, parlia- mentary elections were scheduled in Finland for 17 April. Interviewed in Helsinki, the Minister gave us his views on the future of EU development policies in light of the on-going debate. What are Finland\u2019s development priorities? Our main goal is poverty reduction through sustainable development. Economic growth economic sustain- ability must go hand in hand with social and environmental sustain- ability. Finland has in fact led the way in sustainable development. Our 2007 development policy programme (Ed: this stressed the goal of pov- erty reduction and commitment to the MDGs, while also prioritising sus- tainable economic, social and ecological development) was a novelty in the EU, because after the Rio Earth Summit of 1992, the principles of sustainable development A return to Rio\u2019s development principles Interview with Paavo Matti V\u00e4yrynen, Finland\u2019s Minister for Foreign Trade and Development P a a v o V \u00e4 y r y n e n , F i n l a n d \u2019 s M i n i s t e r f o r I n t e r n a t i o n a l T r a d e a n d D e v e l o p m e n t \u00a9 D .

        "7 N. 22 N.E \u2013 MARCH APRIL 2011 To the point were forgotten. I believe this was partly due to the subsequent introduction of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Although there is environ- mental sustainability (the seventh partnership of the MDGs), it is dif- ficult to measure and has been pushed aside. Social and economic sustain- ability do not feature in the MDGs at all. If we want to be effective in pov- erty reduction, economic growth must be inclusive but also accompanied by poverty reduction programmes inside a country. We also have to pay atten- tion to social sustainability; peace and security, stability, democracy, good governance, human rights and social sector development \u2013 for example in health and education. Fifty per cent of the EU\u2019s aid is allo- cated through budgetary support. Is this the best instrument through which to alleviate poverty? One of the consequences of the misin- terpretation of the MDGs is that funds for poverty reduction have been chan- nelled directly to the public sector. This has led to neglect of the private sector and infrastructure. In Finland, I have been very critical about general budget support. We have capped the amount of general budget support any country receives at 25 per cent, although we do use a lot of sectoral budget support. In Tanzania, we have changed from general to sectoral budget support. I have an open mind, however, about general budget support given by the EU. I understand to some extent the administrative point of view; it\u2019s much easier for the European Commission to give large sums of money to the country than implement its own programmes. On the other hand, general budget sup- port brings a greater risk of corrup- tion. The Commission has some new ideas on this which could result in more general budget support being given to Middle Income Countries. But we have to emphasise development of the poor- est countries. Has Finland attained yet the devel- opment spending threshold of 0.7 per cent of Gross National Income (GNI)? We are one of the few countries in the EU and the world to have increased both the amount of money and percent- age of GNI allocated to development. Last year, the share was 0.55 per cent of GNI and this year it will be 0.58 per cent. I believe that we are going to be able to reach 0.7 per cent in 2015. This year, the Finnish government has earmarked \u20ac1bn for development funding. We have eight main partners, five of them are in Africa; the others are Nicaragua, Vietnam and Nepal. We also fund pan- African actors and some regional pro- grammes in Africa. As a small country, can Finland bring its influence to bear on development policies? Development policy is much more than development cooperation: you have to be able to influence development on the basis of the Rio principles. At the beginning of 2009, I took an initiative to set up a transatlantic partnership for sustainable development. Together, the United States and the EU provide 80 per cent of all Overseas Development Assistance (the EU and its member States alone provide 60 per cent). We have to act closely so that the develop- ment policies are as effective as possible and respect the principles of sustainable development. We also have to influence new actors such as China, India and Brazil, to be effective in poverty reduc- tion. The Obama Administration has been especially keen to raise develop- ment in its priorities, focussing on the 3 Ds; diplomacy, defence and develop- ment, with development being an inde- pendent pillar equal to foreign policy. Do you have a view on the strategy that the EU is drawing up for the Sahel? I\u2019m worried that the coming into force of the EU\u2019s Lisbon Treaty could subor- dinate development and humanitarian policies to foreign and security policies. In the Sahel region, the motivation of the EU for a special strategy seems to be \u2018our own security\u2019. We have to ensure we are effective in poverty reduction and promote social sustainability in Sahel countries. We have to go there and say, we\u2019re interested in your development, according to our values and princi- ples and negotiate a comprehensive programme. This is the way to pro- mote our security interests. In the EU, there seems to be a tendency to couple security and development. The EU drew up its sustainable devel- opment strategy in 2001 and added an external dimension to it in 2002 in the wake of the World Summit for Sustainable Development, held in Johannesburg. It was updated in 2006 and should be updated again if we want to effectively influence the outcome of the UN\u2019s Rio plus 20 Conference on Sustainable Development due to be held from 4 to 6 June, 2012 1 . The EU Council has very clearly stated that sustainable development should be the overarching principle or framework for all EU policies and strategies, also on the external relations side. It has repeat- edly been said that the EU is an eco- nomic giant and a political dwarf, but that is not true. Those seeking to extend the security and defence side of our policy use this kind of phrase. The EU is a giant on the global stage in three areas; development, trade and environmental policies which are inter-connected. We should build on these pillars. 1 http://www.uncsd2012.org/rio20/index. php?menu=35 In the EU, there seems to be a tendency to couple security and development ",
        "8 C urier The Round up Marie-Martine Buckens C oming to the aid of African countries that are victims of \"vulture funds\" or that are legally poorly equipped to defend themselves against foreign inves- tors is the objective of the African Legal Support Facility (ALSF) established by the African Development Bank (AfDB).\" Vulture Funds\" are hedge funds buy- ing up the bad debt of poorer countries at low prices, seeking to sell it on at an inflated price. Set up in 2009 (see below), the ALSF has reached an agree- ment with the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and is now seeking to consolidate its position. The Courier met with the director, Mamoudou Deme, on a visit to Brussels in January. \u201cThe aim of our visit to Brussels was two- fold: to meet with representatives of the European Union, particularly represent- atives of the Commission\u2019s Development and Cooperation Directorate-General, and also to meet with NGOs that are concerned with the developing countries' Combating vulture funds F i n a n c i a l t r a n s a c t i o n s \u00a9 R e p o r t e r s ",
        "9 N. 22 N.E \u2013 MARCH APRIL 2011 Round up The African Development Bank has 77 members: 53 independent African countries (regional members) and 24 non-African countries (non-regional members), including eight EU countries and most of the OECD countries. As well as the Legal Assistance Facility, the AfDB created the Water and Sa- nitation Department (OWAS) in 2006, which works to consolidate its water sector activities in the region. One of the most important decision-making bodies of the AfDB\u2019s institutional struc- ture is the Board of Directors. This is made up of 18 members, 12 of whom are elected by the governments of the regional member countries and six of whom are elected by the governments of the non-regional member counties. Some of the AfDB\u2019s loan activities are undertaken jointly with the European Investment Bank (EIB). \u201cThese vulture funds are a plague, not only for developing countries but also for wealthy nations, because they are the principal beneficiaries of debt reduction,\u201d explains Renaud Vivien, a lawyer on the Committee for the Abolition of Third World Debt (CADTM), an international network present in around 30 countries, mainly in the South. In Belgium, the CAD- TM is a member of the CNCD. \u201cIf there is one lesson to be learned from previous attacks by vulture funds, it is that they wait until their victims achieve a little financial breathing room, such as a slight debt reduction, before attacking them in the courts,\u201d he continues. So what is the attitude of creditors in the North, in particular the 19 countries that make up the Paris Club, or organisations such as the World Bank? \u201cFor the moment, they are content with codes of good conduct. Only Belgium and Great Britain have taken measures, but they are far from being sufficient. Indeed, the Belgian law adopted in 2008 limits itself to protecting its public development aid by making it \u2018untransferable\u2019 and \u2018unseizable\u2019. In France and the United States some bills have been drafted, but these have not as yet come to anything.\u201d A plague debt, especially the Belgian National Centre for Development Cooperation (CNCD). The functions of these meet- ings were to explain the work of the ALSF and to explore the possibilities of cooperation,\u201d explained Mamoudou Deme. Whilst the AfDB Facility has just recently been established, \u201cthe idea actually dates back to 2005,\u201d its direc- tor points out. \u201cAt the time, the Council of African Ministers of Finance had launched an appeal to set up a body whose function would be to offer tech- nical and legal assistance to African states on three issues: debt, negotiat- ing commercial contracts for natural resources, and strengthening capac- ity.\u201d This appeal was repeated in Addis Ababa in 2007 at the African Union Summit. The African Development Bank looked into the idea in 2008, when the 77 members of its Board of Governors gave the green light to set up the Facility. In 2009, the Facility\u2019s Governing Council and Management Board were launched. \u201cOur work mainly involves recruiting lawyers who are able to assist these coun- tries when they face litigation linked to debt or to contracts,\u201d continues Mamoudou Deme, \u201cbut we also organise and participate in seminars on strength- ening capacity, with sister associations.\u201d The first such seminar was held on 14 February in Kigali (Rwanda) for the countries of East Africa. Fifteen applications and the DRC In November 2010, the Facility com- pleted its first transaction when it granted the DRC US$500,000. Around 15 appli- cations in all have been lodged with the AfDB\u2019s Facility. While not wanting to discuss the details, Mamoudou Deme explained to us that 14 of these con- cern the negotiation of mining, agro- industrial, or infrastructure-related contracts. Of these 15 applications, the Facility is preparing to offer assistance in six. But here comes the crunch: \u201cOur budget was set at 16 billion dollars and we want to mobilise between US$50M and US$100M by 2012.\u201d These are sums that must come from Member States as well as donors.

        "10 C urier The Debra Percival \u201cT his will mean cementing our global partnership on climate change, spea- king with one voice in the international debate and encoura- ging other partners to join forces with us, both politically and financially\u201d, said the Commissioner spea- king at the high level Regional Conference on Climate Change in the Pacific held in Vanuatu, 2-4 March. Details of the new plans are expected to be penned during the Polish Presidency of the EU from 1 July 2011. The effects of climate change in the Pacific include rising sea levels, increa- sed erosion from more intense storms and the risk of saltwater intruding into fresh water supplies, all of which put a brake on achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In December 2010, Commissioner Piebalgs signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Secretary General of the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF), Tuiloma Neroni Slade (see profile in this issue). It is a rallying call to all donor entities to provide a fair share of international climate change funding to Pacific nations. Vulnerability The low-lying Pacific island nations have 10 million inhabitants but cover one-fifth of the globe\u2019s surface and are particularly vulnerable to climate change. Rising sea levels mean that some of the islands could New Pacific-EU framework on horizon even disappear. For example, an increase in the sea level by just 60 centimetres could make the islands of Kiribati and Tuvalu uninhabitable. Commissioner Piebalgs said that the EU should not just mop up the consequences of climate change in the Pacific having, for example, used European Development Funds (EDF) to rebuild Tonga\u2019s only hospital, destroyed in the 2009 tsunami, on higher ground. \u201cThe EU\u2019s own approach to fun- ding in the Pacific needs to evolve\u201d, he said. He suggested that the EU and the Pacific should look together at suppor- ting not only purely technological solutions to climate change problems but also \u2018greener\u2019 ones which use, for example, overlooked traditional knowledge. The Pacific and EU needed to work on climate adaptation programmes for agriculture, water and sanitation and on renewable energies, he said. EU programmes aimed at fighting poverty and the consequences of climate change, totalling \u20ac89.4M, were announced during the Commissioner\u2019s visit. A proposed \u20ac11.4M of support for Pacific small island states is expected to follow. Commissioner Piebalgs has also suggested that the entire 10 th European Development Fund (2008-2013) Mid-term Review \u201ctop up\u201d for Pacific ACP countries (\u20ac16.6M) be used to address climate change issues. He called on ACP countries of the region to identify projects that link climate change adaptation with the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).

A poor result in the opinion of experienced observers of the political scene in Niger, given the demographic weight of the female population. Souleymane Ma\u00e2zou \u201c Y ou have to love your country, be a democrat, possess a political vision and, above all, be driven by the desire to succeed,\u201d declared Mrs Bayard Mariama Gamati\u00e9, independent candidate in the presidential election of January 2011. This 50-year-old militant, active since the first stirrings of Niger\u2019s civil society, founder of the Democratic Assembly of Nigerien Women (RDFN) and former minister under the Fourth Republic, made a bold statement in standing as a presiden- tial candidate in a country where politics is dominated by men. The only woman among 10 candidates, Madame Bayard Mariama Gamati\u00e9 won 0.38% of the votes cast. With this result of 12,000 votes out of the 3 million vali- dly cast, this woman candidate ranked 10th and last in the presidential race that marked Niger\u2019s return to democracy after the coup d\u2019etat of 18 February 2010 that overthrew President Tandja Mamadou\u2019s civilian government. Yet women make up more than 52% of the Niger population estimated at 14 million. \u201cDespite this considerable demo- graphic and electoral weight, women in Niger find it hard to overcome the marginalisation they suffer in society,\u201d explains Fati Hassane, an active mem- ber of Niger\u2019s civil society committed to defending women\u2019s causes. Niger nevertheless has a whole legal arse- nal designed to guarantee the promotion of women. In 1996, in response to the inequalities that women continued to face, the government passed a law for the promotion of women, followed by the National Assembly\u2019s adoption, in 2000, of a law setting a minimum quota for the numbers of each gender employed in the management of public affairs. \u201cWe must not be discouraged. We must fight day and night to break the chain of discrimination against women,\u201d declares Hassana Aliou, a politician and twice candidate in the local elections. This 47-year-old woman has never succeeded in being elected. Sociologist Almoustapha Boubacar belie- ves that the poor results women obtain in Niger\u2019s various elections is due to the harsh political climate for women in Niger. \u201cAnd this even for the most courageous among them,\u201d he adds. Women who seek to be involved in politics in Niger face many obstacles. There are family difficulties coupled with the need to overcome sociocultural obstacles and discrimination within the political par- ties themselves. The high illiteracy rates among women (88%), forced marriages, unemployment, premature school leaving and poverty are all obstacles that block the path to success for women in Niger's political life.

She noted: \u201cThe signi- ficant efforts made in addressing the eco- nomic crisis and improving the delivery of social services in Zimbabwe\u201d. But long-term development assistance to the country under the European Development Fund (EDF) for African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) states remains suspended as the country is deemed to be flouting Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement between EU and ACP states (2000-2020) relating to res- pect for democracy, human rights and rule of law. The same clause, however, keeps EU channels of communication open with any ACP country in breach of these \u201cessential clauses\u201d of the Agreement in order to dialogue on steps to be taken to normalise relations. \u201cI would like to emphasise that the EU remains willing to amend its decision at any time within the next 12 months should further, concrete deve- lopments take place. In particular, I consi- der a common unders- tanding between the parties in Government on the necessary steps to be taken in the run up to elections to be critically important for the democratic process in the country\u201d, said the High Representative. \u201cThe EU continues to provide assistance to Zimbabwe, not only through govern- ment channels. Since the establishment of the Government of National Unity in Zimbabwe in February 2009, the EU has provided \u20ac365M in support to the social sectors as well as for food security, the promotion of governance from previous EDF budgets and EU budget lines\u201d, she said. \u201cFurther reforms are necessary with regard to the respect for rule of law, human rights and democracy which are essential in order to create an environ- ment conducive to the holding of credi- ble elections\u201d she added.

Drawn up by Greek Socialist Member of the European Parliament (MEP), Anni Podimata, it says that the introduction of a financial transaction tax on a unilateral basis will raise money for \u201cpublic goods\u201d, including overseas development and climate change. Non-Governmental Development Organisations widely back the tax: \u201cThe European Parliament has set the world standard by pressing ahead on an EU-wide Robin Hood Tax 1 . This is great news. The EU alone could raise tens of billions of euros to help millions of people pushed into poverty because of bankers\u2019 greed,\u201d said Elise Ford, Head of Oxfam International\u2019s EU Office. \u201cWith France chairing the G20 group this year, Europe is in an excellent position to make an FTT happen. We now urge MEPs to challenge their governments to back it,\u201d she said. According to a study by Dr Stephan Schulmeister of the Austrian Institute of Economic Research, an average 0.05 per cent tax across the 27 EU member sta- tes levied on shares, currency exchanges and bonds could raise \u20ac210bn a year for spending on \u201cpublic goods\u201d, including development aid. But any decision will ultimately be in the hands of EU Member States.

        "14 C urier The Round up O ver the last decade the EU\u2019s preferred method of disbursing external aid has been budget support, accounting on average for 50 per cent of all aid managed by EU institutions. In a special report, the EU\u2019s Financial Watchdog, the Luxembourg- based European Court of Auditors (ECA), says there\u2019s \u201croom for improvement\u201d in the way it is administered. Its assess- ment provides input for the European Commission\u2019s (EC) current internal brainstorming on whether modifications are needed to EU-funded budget support programmes in order to achieve develop- ment objectives. This type of aid involves the transfer- ral of payments directly into the respective national treasuries of partner countries. The criteria to be met to trigger its release are reached through policy dialogue between the EU and beneficiary countries. On the positive side, such programmes can foster ownership by the recipient country of aid resources, strengthen national accounting systems and usher in policy changes to reduce poverty. \u201cThis kind of aid has political advantages in that large sums of aid can be trans- ferred in a predictable manner\u201d, said Lars Heikenstein, member of the Luxembourg- based European Court of Auditors at the February launch of the report enti- tled, \u2018The Commission\u2019s management of General Budget Support in African, Caribbean and Pacific, Latin American and Asian countries.\u2019[ Ed : Sectoral budget aid \u2013 EU aid to a particular sector such as health or education, is not covered in the ECA\u2019s report). Could do better But EU institutions could do better. \u201cObjectives are too general and hinder programme design. It is not made clear where most added value is obtained\u201d, Lars Heikenstein told journalists. The aim of the report, he added, was not to come out for or against budget support but analyse whether it was working according to the aims set. Lars Heikenstein said that policy dia- logue is currently not used to its full potential and that there was a need for clearer guidelines: \u201cThere is a need too for systematic analysis about how budget aid reduces poverty.\u201d \u201cThere are macro- economic objectives but these are often too general and hin- der programme design\u201d, said G\u00e9rald Locatelli, the ECA\u2019s Head of the European Development Fund division. The European Commission is aware of criticisms of budget support, said the ECA officials. The EU\u2019s Commissioner for Development, Andris Piebalgs, launched an internet public consulta- tion on budget support - concluded at the end of January 2011 1 - to gather as many views as possible on the topic fol- lowing the publication of the Green Paper on \u2018The future of EU budget support to third countries\u2019. 2 The EC is expected to draw up recommendations on the issue in the run up to the Fourth High level Forum on Aid Effectiveness to take place in Busan, South Korea, 29 November -1 December 2011. \u201cThe EU should respect its commitment to make budget support its preferred aid modality and continue to increase its use of this aid instrument in the com- ing years\u201d, notes the non-governmental organisation, Oxfam, on the public con- sultation\u2019s website. It also wants to see the strengthening of audit institutions, parliaments and civil society organisations to monitor the use of budget resources and suggests the setting up of a public register for budget support agreements. Nick Roberts, Budget Support Advisor at Samoa\u2019s Ministry of Finance, said one of the issues encountered was actions to take if there were inadequate reforms in the recipient country. Mechanisms could be developed to rate the progress of reforms and deliver warning signals to government in cases where progress has been very slow, or non-existent, he says on the website. Dr Kwabena Duffuour, Ghana's Minister of Finance and Economic Planning, uploaded the following comment: \u201cI believe there is a case for having less rigorous eligibility criteria for sectoral budget support as this would allow the EU to differenti- ate and would facilitate the use of sector budget support as an instrument.\u201d D.P. 1 http://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/how/public- consultations/5221_en.htm 2 http://ec.europa.eu/development/icenter/ repository/green_paper_budget_support_ third_countries_en.pdf EU budget aid not reaching full potential \u201cRoom for improvement\u201d, says EU financial watchdog \u201cThere is a need for systematic analysis about how budget aid reduces poverty\u201d Lars Heikenstein, European Court of Auditors Refugees in new IDP Camp due to tribal clashes \u00a9Reporters ",
        "15 N. 22 N.E \u2013 MARCH APRIL 2011 Round up Hegel Goutier T he future president of Haiti, whose inauguration is sched- uled for May 14, 2011 is Michel Martelly, the former pop singer, idol of the poor slum dwell- ers of Port-au-Prince, supported by the Haitian business community and the international community alike. Unlike fellow musician, Wyclef Jean, whose name surfaced in the presiden- tial race early on, the fact that Michel Martelly (widely known by his stage name \u2018Sweet Micky\u2019) did not surface at first, in fact protected him from attacks by the country\u2019s elites who found it dif- ficult to consider electing a President without a string of academic letters to his or her name. As a young artist, Martelly had already formed strong relationships with U.S. politicians, especially those from the Republican Party. In seeking power, his strategy was like that of a chess player whose moves are for the future rather than the present. He used his U.S. friendships between the D iplomatic and economic pressure had been placed on Gbagbo by the international community. Since the 22 nd of December, the EU put in place economic sanctions, including freezing the financial assets of 19 Ivorians notably those of the incumbent president and his wife. Meanwhile the African Union (AU) urged Gbagbo to respect the will of the people two rounds of the elections and they will prevail should any charge of populism now be levelled against him, such as in appealing to the electorate of the slum, Cit\u00e9 Soleil, for its votes in the second round. From the outset, the very name of his party, \u2018Repon Peyizan\u2019 (\u2018Farmers reply\u2019) has been a rallying call to the voting booth in a predominantly rural country. His slogans, \u2018Michel Martelly, T\u00e8t Kal\u00e9\u2019 in Creole or the \u2018the bald one\u2019, the \u2018cheeky one\u2019 and even \u2018bad boy\u2019, were a big hit with young people. Between the two rounds, Martelly pro- posed collaborating with the \u2018Inite\u2019 party candidate, Jude Celestin, who dropped from 2 nd to 3 rd place, and also drew sup- port from Jean-Claude Duvalier and Jean-Bertrand Aristide whose cryptic speeches seemed to give support to his rival, Mirlande Manigat. Participating in a major electoral debate with the lat- ter, he appeared as the outsider, a former singer standing before the Professor. But Martelly surprised everyone with both his gall and knowledge of issues. On Facebook, he amassed 25,000 friends against Mirlande Manigat\u2019s meagre 5000. The die was cast. and to concede to his political oppo- nent. A position strengthened by the decision of South Africa, and particularly Angola, to join in these demands for their African peers. The same can be said for the Economic Community of West Africa (ECOWAS) who asked the UN to intervene militarily in Ivory Coast to stop the growing hostilities between the two camps - hostilities that risked leading to civil war. On the 4 th of April, European Com- missioner for Humanitarian Aid and International Cooperation, Kristalina Georgieva, expressed her deep con- cerns about the magnitude of violence and the growing number of people flee- ing their homes. Over 120,000 refugees have poured into neighbouring countries, including Liberia; countries who them- selves are often on the edge of humanitar- ian crisis. M.M.B.

        "16 C urier The Dossier Marie-Martine Buckens I n the Caribbean and the Pacific, with their island states, the major challenge is maritime transport, a subject covered in the last two pages of this report. Also important is air trans- port, as indeed it is in Africa. A previous Courier report already tackled this subject (see Issue 17, May June 2010). A simple glance at a map of Africa is all it takes to be able to appreciate the scale of the challenge this continent faces if it wants to achieve endogenous develop- ment. Roads and railways are centred around major ports whose primary func- tion is to export raw materials, while the few that venture further into the interior often terminate upon reaching mines. With the notable exception of South Africa, the transport networks of most sub-Saharan countries have evolved little since the end of colonial times, and there is very little interconnection. In recent years, however, there has been a growing number of plans and projects aimed at correcting this infrastructure deficiency in Africa. Notably these have come from the African Union (AU), with support from the European Union (EU) (see separate article), but also from the United States. China is also hugely involved.

        "17 N. 22 N.E \u2013 MARCH APRIL 2011 Dossier Spatial inversion A number of projects in Africa \u2013 some of which are well on the way to completion \u2013 are seeking to restore the communication links that were abandoned by the colonial powers. These are particularly focus- sing on North-South links. As French geographer Sylvie Brunel writes in her book L'Afrique, un continent en r\u00e9serve de d\u00e9veloppement \u201cColonisation resulted in a genuine spatial inversion in Africa (\u2026) through favouring the coasts, along which towns were created, to the point of upsetting the balance between land and sea. Most African capitals are ports, built at the end of railways draining the products of the interior. The transport networks are also very often laid out perpendicular to the coasts, creating a problem for cross-country connections.\u201d \u201cHow,\u201d the author asks, \u201ccan regional integration be achieved when it is not even physically possible to move from one country to another, due to the lack of railways but also to the lack of roads that are negotiable in all seasons? How can useful connections be created between countries when even air links have to pass through hubs that are often a great distance away?\u201d These projects are therefore hindered by the non-central locations of the major urban centres. This explains, adds Sylvie Brunel, \u201cwhy several African countries have sought, at great cost, to give them- selves new, more central capitals. Abuja in Nigeria, Dodoma in Tanzania, and Yamoussoukro in the C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, for example\u201d. Today, the density of both road and rail transport networks in Africa remains very low. Road density is 6.85 kilometres per 100 square kilometres, compared to 12 kilometres per 100 square kilometres in Asia, and an average of 100 kilome- tres per 100 square kilometres in Europe (over 400 kilometres per square kilometre in Belgium). The density of the African rail network is no more than 3 kilometres per 100 square kilometres compared to 60 kilometres per 100 square kilometres in Europe. Road or rail? Considered too expensive and poorly managed, rail was often neglected by major donors (primarily the World Bank) in favour of roads. The relative cost of roads has fallen in the last 20 years. Rail was also targeted by struc- tural adjustment policies, due to the fact that these state-owned companies were suffering constant losses. Since the year 2000, however, this has changed. The European Union, followed by the World Bank and other donors, has adopted rail development as a cooperation priority. Nevertheless, the obstacles remain huge. Laying new railways is very costly, exist- ing lines have different track gauges and a structure is needed to manage the net- works. Regarding this last point, many donors favour restructuring in coopera- tion with the private sector and recom- mend granting concessions rather than total privatisation. While roads are more numerous (they provide most links to rural areas) they also suffer from a lack of funding and a chronic lack of main- tenance work. Also to be remembered, as highlighted elsewhere in this issue, is the vital role of the ports. Numbering almost 100, they play a vital role in Africa\u2019s trade relations with the rest of the world.

It involves the EIB, the French Development Agency, the European Commission, and the EU delegation in charge of the dialogue with the Zambian authorities,\u201d said Juergen Kettner, a transport policy and infra- structure specialist at DEVCO. It is also an example of an international partner- ship involving numerous parties fund- ing its different sections, including the African Development Bank \u2013 which is involved in the Mozambican project \u2013 , and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).

We support the AU Commission in its efforts to establish a cohesive overview and vision, to develop strategic programmes such as PIDA through which it seeks to influence the continent as a whole and to play a coor- dinating role in developing its transporta- tion corridors. Additionally we support the African regional organisations in their work to achieve regional integration and trade facilitation, the harmonisation of standards, for example, or the con- struction of juxtaposed customs posts in West Africa.\u201d But public resources (whether national African resources or those provided via public development aid) are insufficient given the magnitude of the requirements. In accordance with the new priorities set out in the recent Green Paper on Development Policy 1 , the EC wants to encourage the pri- vate sector, which is the main engine of growth, to become a development partner. \u201cPrivate investors may be interested in the market but they are scared off by political risks, currency risks, and governance issues. We are developing ways of working with them, for example by combining our finan- cial contributions with their long-term funding. The private sector could benefit indirectly from projects co-financed by European financial institutions using the Trust Fund,\u201d says Paulus Geraedts. The Chinese presence: a challenge for the EU and Africa China has invested billions of dollars in the infrastructure sector in Africa: the Infrastructure Consortium for Africa's annual report said Chinese investment amounted to around US$5 - 6 billion in 2010. \u201cThis clearly presents a challenge. Europe provides a full package, includ- ing the political dialogue and partner- ship that goes along with donations and investments,\u201d says Paulus Geraedts. It could be said that the Chinese, for their part, offer to build roads in exchange for access to primary materials. \u201cIt\u2019s up to the Africans to choose, which is also a challenge for them,\u201d he notes. \u201cGovernments have sometimes indicated that on particular projects, they prefer to work with the Chinese. That's life. But the requirements are so significant that there's room for everyone, however it seems to me that it is necessary to establish a sort of \u2018fair play\u2019. \u201d The EC believes that Africa, China, and the EU should work together to identify a number of areas where trilateral cooperation may be beneficial, and is attempting to get this dialogue going. \u201cIn Zambia for exam- ple we are already in contact with the Chinese,\u201d says Juergen Kettner. \u201cThe challenge is to enter into a dialogue with our Chinese colleagues in order to come to an agreement on common priorities with the government and to channel funds appropriately. We prefer to work with partners rather than in isolation.\u201d India, Brazil, and Japan are also involved. \u201cIt's a fascinating time and the game plan is still not clear\u201d, says Paulus Geraedts. \u201cThe G20 could play a significant role in bringing together developed and emerg- ing economies, as donors with developing economies such as the African countries, as beneficiaries.\u201d 1 The Green Paper on EU development policy in support of inclusive growth and sustainable development : visit http:// ec.europa.eu/europeaid/how/public-con- sultations/5241_en.htm to see the results of the public consultation and background documents It\u2019s important to coordinate national, regional and continental policies \u00a9 G .

Not only politically - as witnessed by recent events in Egypt, the Maghreb and Sudan - but also economically, which may just herald in the true liberalisation of the continent that was for so long blighted by internal strife and economic mismanagement. Or could it herald in a new era of colonisation ... this time by the Chinese? Be that as it may, Africa is on the move and much of the economic movement is driven by Chines investment and much of the goods being moved are moved by Transnet, the South African transport company. Although it is wholly owned by the South African government, Transnet is not subsidised and is a profitable under- taking. According to South Africa\u2019s Standard Bank which, in partnership with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), has a strong presence in 17 African coun- tries outside South Africa, Chinese inves- tment in Africa will double to \u20ac36.8 billion by 2015, as will Africa-China bilateral trade from the current \u20ac110 billion to \u20ac220 billion. African GDP is expected to rise by 6% in 2015, up from the current growth rate of 4.9%. All this increased economic activity begs the question of how to transport all the associated goods across Africa\u2019s poor road and rail networks. According to its spokesman Mike Asefovitz, Transnet comprises 80% of the African rail network and is busy getting \u201ctheir house in order in South Africa, where demand is outstripping supply\u201d. Asefovitz could not comment \u201con a strategic level\u201d on whether Transnet planned to link up with the infrastructure developments undertaken by the Chinese on the continent. (It should be noted that Transnet\u2019s involvement in SADC is limited to the leasing of rolling stock and maintenance of railway lines and pipelines.)

The necessary funding \u2013 currently estimated at around six billion dollars \u2013 is to be rai- sed through a public-private partnership. Relying in part on existing railways, the Africarail network will open up the coun- tries involved, as well as neighbouring countries such as Nigeria, Mali, Senegal, the C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Ghana, and Chad. A number of transnational rail projects are also being studied by the East Afri- can Community (EAC). Four \u2018corridors\u2019 have been approved. These include a rail link between the Kenyan and Ugandan capitals, and another linking Tanzania, Burundi, and Rwanda. National projects are also being exa- mined. In particular a project to link the centre of Congo-Brazzaville to the port of Pointe-Noire with 500 kilometres of track. There is also a project to connect all of Mozambique's provinces, which would require 2000 kilometres of track, at a cost of 11 million US dollars. Not to mention the road-rail-bridge project to link the world\u2019s two closest capital cities, Brazzaville and Kinshasa. M.M.B. Africarail and others Train in South Africa in 1983.

        "21 N. 22 N.E \u2013 MARCH APRIL 2011 Dossier Roads remain the dominant mode of transport in Sub-Saharan Africa, repre- senting nearly 90% of interstate and long distance traffic of goods. But its density is among the lowest (6.65 km per 100 km 2 ) and the condition of the roads the most hazardous. On average, 24.5% of African roads are paved. An average that includes North Africa, whose percenta- ge reaches a high of 64%, against 4% for Central Africa, 9.5% for East Africa, 20.7% for Southern Africa and 22.4% in West Africa. It is a network that suffers from poor main- tenance (on average a mere 30% of the needs required for their maintenance is guaranteed) and the overloading of trucks, which thus reduces the lifespan of the roads. The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is one of them. Five worksites were announced in 2006, one of which included the construction or rehabili- tation of approximately 10,000 km of roads and bridges. In four years, some 5,000 km of works have been completed. But there has been little tarring, and no fundamental change to the existing network, primarily built in the colonial era. The European Union is the main funder, alongside the World Bank and the African Development Bank. Not for- getting China, albeit with a still relatively limited presence, with the exception of road works undertaken in the capital Kinshasa. M.M.B. The river ports of sub-Saharan Africa are still far from competing with the continent's sea ports. The reasons? A lack of navigation markers and antiquated infrastructure. Almost 97% of international trade is done through shipping. Africa has more than 80 major seaports - relatively few for a continent with 53 countries - of which 15 are landlocked and six are islands. But many of these ports are confronted with difficulties in securing material and equipment, providing security, tackling pollution and dealing with inadequate technical capabilities. In addition, 80% of the vessels are more than 15 years old, in comparison with the world ave- rage of 15%. River transport is characterized by just as many weaknesses. Even great rivers like the Congo or the Nile are not fully navigable. But in the areas where they are, they represent an important boon to regional economic integration, par- ticularly in remote areas. This is parti- cularly the case in the DRC, where the EU is currently funding a large project marking navigation paths in the Congo River. In addition, river transport enjoys considerable economic advantages: it is six times cheaper to transport containers by ship than by air freight, and a barge of 500 tons can complete a journey in half of the time it takes a 14 ton truck to do the same.

        "22 C urier The Dossier Bernard Babb* M ore than ever before Caribbean nationals have been calling for impro- ved connections between the islands, reduced taxes on travel and an informed policy on regional travel from Governments of the CARICOM 1 trading bloc. Several regional commentators have argued that one of the main hindrances to the effectiveness of the Caribbean Single Market and Economy (CSME) has been the lack of a viable and workable regional transportation system. Norman Smith, a letter writer to the \u2018Daily Nation\u2019 in Barbados, summed up the pain of fellow Caribbean nationals when he wrote in February (2011) that there was a pressing need to reduce the high fares in the region. Wrote Smith: \u201cRecently, I made some enquiries about travelling to St Vincent and Grenada and was given these fares Barbados to St Vincent, $533 (US $266); Barbados to Grenada, $637 (US $318); Barbados to St Vincent to Grenada $858.42 (US $427). In the past, if you left Barbados to travel to Grenada via St Vincent on LIAT, you were charged the fare for the farther destination. Now you are hearing that these are two destinations; so you have to pay two fares. These exor- bitant fares are discouraging people from travelling. You should not have to pay $858 to travel just over one 100 miles, when you could travel to Miami, about 16 times as far, for the same price or less.\u201d Falling business Over the past two years, the situation has been aggravated as rising fuel costs and multi-million-dollar losses helped to hasten the demise of Air Jamaica , while regional legacy carrier LIAT has been struggling with unprofitability while seeking to ratio- nalise routes and stay in business. American Eagle , operated by American Airlines as an island hopping carrier between Puerto Rico and the Caribbean, has also discon- tinued service to several islands, citing unprofitability. The drop in intra-regional travel by 30 per cent over the past five years, says the Caribbean Tourism Organisation (CTO) due to the contractions in the global economy, has negatively affected the region\u2019s air carriers. With diminishing air capacity and prevai- ling high airfares dampening the urge to travel, efforts to increase alternate modes of transport by sea have also been floun- dering. In recent years, a number of enter- prising businessmen have announced plans to expand ferry services in the Eastern Caribbean, which would cut travel costs by 60 per cent. But a reliable ferry service serving the wider Caribbean is yet to mate- rialise.Travelling across sea should mean cheaper fuel, and hence cheaper passenger tickets, but passenger traffic will also be competing with cargo. Meanwhile, the latest attempt to improve intra-regional travel in the Caribbean has emerged in the form of Redjet , a low-cost carrier created by two Irish businessmen. They are using the European Ryanair model and are eagerly awaiting formal approval from the Barbados Government. 1 Member states of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM): Antigua and Barbuda, The Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, Montserrat, Saint.

        "23 N. 22 N.E \u2013 MARCH APRIL 2011 Dossier Dev Nadkarni* T he Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) has recognised such impedi- ments to development. One of its earliest moves of the PIF was the Pacific Forum Line , set up by Pacific governments 1 in 1978 to meet their freight shipping requirements. While this shipping initiative \u2013 unlike repeated attempts at establishing a truly regional airline, which have never taken off the ground \u2013 is often hailed as a success story in Pacific Island regionalism, its growth has been constrai- ned by a lack of port facilities and high fuel costs. Ram Bajekal, Group Chief Executive of FMF (Flour Mills of Fiji), one of Fiji\u2019s largest manufacturing companies making food products for exports throughout the Pacific, including Australia and New Zealand, believes that although both shipping and air travel have changed for the better in recent years, there\u2019s a long way to go. \u201cWe would like to base our growth strate- gies on exports which would rely on impro- ved connectivity between the Islands and Australia and New Zealand\u201d, he says. Low volumes of traffic and a lack of competi- tion mean that complacency prevails with irregular shipping schedules. Bajekal says the region needs to urgently improve on the freight logistics front, in the interests of business growth and econo- mic development in the islands. \u201cShipping freight costs have marginally reduced but haven\u2019t yet reached levels that can be accep- ted as \u2019proportionate\u2019 to the distance invol- ved. We could provide a lot better service to our customers in the islands, Australia and New Zealand if only shipping services were more frequent and more reliable and punctual\u201d, he says. Recent initiatives Recent initiatives have focused on inter- island transport connectivity, particularly among the smaller islands. Two years ago, a meeting of small island maritime ministers came up with a proposal for local ship- ping companies including Kiribati Shipping Services , a government-owned enterprise, to run services connecting Nauru, Tuvalu, Kiribati, Wallis and Futuna to Suva in Fiji \u2013 the nearest transhipment port with onward connections to the wider world. Meanwhile, private shipping companies like the Pacific Direct Line have stepped up their existing services around the smaller islands with a recently establis- hed hub in Fiji to better serve the islands, the company\u2019s New Zealand-based Commercial Manager, Alan Foote, told The Courier . While there are moves to shore up ser- vices in the region, shipping companies have over the past few months been faced with the challenges of rising of fuel. But shipping company representatives told The Courier that companies were striving to keep freight rates unchanged as far possible. General Manager of Fiji-based Carpenters Shipping , Manickam Narain, said that although fuel prices were volatile, the company that serves Fiji, Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Rim countries had refrained from revising their rates upwards. *New Zealand-based journalist 1 The Pacific Forum Line \u2019s shareholders are: Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga and Tuvalu .

        "24 C urier The Trade O n 15 March in Brussels, the President of the Committee of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA) launched an offensive aimed at generating a new impetus on the part of the European Union and the United States to mobilise support of African cotton. The action is being led by the UEMOA and the C4 that represents the four producing coun- tries (Burkina Faso, Benin, Mali and Chad), instigators of the first \u201ccotton initiative\u201d submitted to the WTO in 2003. Recent years have brought no progress, stressed Souma\u00efla Ciss\u00e9. The aim is to obtain the removal of internal subsidies for European and US cotton producers that cause imbalances on the world market at the expense of African producers. The EU and the US each claim they are not the ones respon- sible as they maintain a status quo that is adding to the impoverishment of the 15 million cotton growers of West and Central Africa, stresses the UEMOA. The West African organisation wants to benefit from the opportunities offered by the current review of the Common Agricultural Policy in the EU and by the preparation of debates on the Farm Bill in the United States. Decoupling At the European level, the C4 is deman- ding the 100% decoupling of aid to cotton producers in Greece and Spain. Coupled aid subsidises farmers\u2019 incomes accor- ding to the surface area they cultivate. The aid is higher for cotton than for most other agricultural pro- ducts. Cotton has been decoupled for 65%, compared with 90% for other agricultu- ral products. That is insufficient, stressed Souma\u00efla Ciss\u00e9, who called for the remaining 35% to be abo- lished and declared that there will be no solution for the Doha round if there is no solution for cotton. Applying the WTO rules The UEMOA Commission President addressed the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly. The new ini- tiative for African cotton is aimed at making MEPs more aware of the issue and motivating them to act, especially given their increased power of co-decision, and to initiate legislation introduced by the Lisbon Treaty. JPA Co-President Louis Michel has already relayed their message. In a parliamentary question addressed to the European Commission, the MEP stressed that: \u201cAfrican cotton growers are not asking for favoured treatment but the application of the WTO rules {\u2026} and the abolition of unbalanced measures in support of cotton production and export, with the aim of combating poverty by recognising the strategic nature of cotton for their development.\u201d For its part, the European Commission stresses that its production represents just 2% of global production and is far behind that of the United States, the third major producer after China and India. The UMEOA is also seeking European support in pleading its case in the United States. The African cotton industry has high growth potential. \u201cWe must prevent its decline,\u201d warns Souma\u00efla Ciss\u00e9, \u201cif we want to avoid reliving the experience of the collapse of the Groundnut Basin in Mali and Senegal that saw young people from the region join the flow of migrants to Europe.\u201d New offensive to defend African cotton Anne-Marie Mouradian \u201cWe must prevent the decline of African cotton if we want to avoid a repeat of the experience of the Groundnut Basin in Mali and Senegal\u201d M e n i n a c o t t o n f a c t o r y \u00a9 R e p o r t e r s ",

First established in Tunisia, the fund initially expanded to cover the Maghreb region, and is now targeting Sub-Saharan African business. The Group is currently investing its third generation of funds, targeting growth and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). In an interview with The Courier , he explains his positive experience with entrepreneurship in Sub-Saharan Africa, where he believes that combined with social and environmental considerations, entrepreneurship can not only be profi- table, but could represent the future for development. What is the core business of your company? It is to support small and medium-sized enterprises through funds raised from investors but also from the World Bank (WB) and the European Investment Bank (EIB). There are three families of funds: those for Tunisian or Moroccan inves- tors; funds for international investors to be invested in the Maghreb region and funds for international investors to be invested in Sub-Saharan Africa. We are administering $650M and are now also interested in microfinance. How do you choose the businesses you finance? Since 2004, we have an office in Ivory Coast for investment in Francophone West Africa, an office in Lagos for Anglophone West Africa, and an office in Nairobi for East Africa. In all these regions, there are opportuni- ties. We try to find them and transform them into real, productive projects. It is important to understand the specific eco- nomic environments and markets in each country. For example, our latest inves- tment in Kenya is in a private school. It is well managed and profitable. In Senegal, we have invested in a laundry- soap industry, which currently has a small turnover and manufactures only a few products. We identified certain weak- nesses and we are working to update its methods and means of production. We foresee a turnover of \u20ac4-5M in a few years from now. With our staff, or with external, speci- fic short-term expertise, we work on the information systems, the staff recruitment process and the industrial plane. It is not only about providing finance but also inte- raction, collaboration and collective work. We fall into line with the entrepreneur: if we gain, we gain together, if we lose, we lose together. We don\u2019t normally hold the majority of the capital. How many investments have you in sub-Saharan Africa and in which sectors? We are currently financing about 25 enterprises. In North Africa, we finance all sorts of companies, bar construction companies as they don\u2019t create real deve- lopment and do not produce exportable goods. We also try to avoid unhealthy sectors such as the tobacco, alcohol, and gambling industries. Our investee companies are bound by a code of conduct and ethical standards, particularly in terms of confidentiality. You recently spoke at the EU\u2019s 2010 Dev Days event in Brussels. What did you take from the experience? It was interesting to share our experien- ces, to explain what we do and show that development can come about through entrepreneurship.

That is the hypothesis of a team of resear- chers from Parakou University (Benin) and two Belgian universities, who have just published an article 1 based on a sys- tematic review of international literature of the past decade devoted to the subject. Carried by the Harmattan Their concern is focused on the huge dust clouds capable of travelling thousands of kilometres that regularly form in various areas of the globe first and foremost in the Sahara, where between 50% and 58% of these clouds are believed to originate.

How do smaller particles, with the ability to penetrate the pulmonary alveoli, perform when found in combination with the PM 2.5 pollution found in cities?\u201d Looking in particular to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the World Health Organization (WHO), the Beninese and Belgian scientists hope that more attention will soon be paid to these phenomena due to growing concerns about climate change and its effects on public health.

They are then carried by the Harmattan 2 , a dry wind that blows from late November through to March, in the direction of the Gulf of Guinea by way of, inter alia, Benin, Nigeria, Togo, Ghana and Ivory Coast. Intrigued by the possible health impact of this desert dust, the university team stu- died 231 scientific articles devoted to the impact of PM 10 particles on air quality. Affecting the upper respiratory channels, these particles made up largely of quartz play a major role in a number of respiratory diseases, including asthma, pneumonia and chronic obstruc- tions. They could well play a part in respi- ratory infections that are responsible for up to 20% of infant mortality in certain regions. Surprisingly, just three studies \u2013 1.3% of the total \u2013 were found to be concerned with air pollution in Africa! After a second review of the literature, this time targeting key words with greater \u201chealth\u201d connota- tions (for example, mortality, morbidity and asthma), the researchers arrived at an even more startling conclusion: of the 41 studies identified, not a single one was devoted to Africa. \u201cThe international scientific interest accorded to this subject shows a clear regional imbalance,\u201d concludes Florence De Longueville, a post-doc specialised in the management of natural risks at the Department of Geography of the Facult\u00e9 Universitaire Notre-Dame de la Paix (FUNDP) in Namur (Belgium). Whereas North Africa is the region that produces the most desert dust by far, the literature remains largely silent on the sub- ject, whereas Asia, the big dust producer in the region of the Gobi Desert (China/ Mongolia), is much better studied.\u201d Another pertinent finding is that while only between 5% and 10% of Saharan dust enters the European atmosphere, the effects of the PM 10 particles on the popu- lation in Spain is better documented than the effects on populations in West Africa. In 2008 a study showed, for example, that desert dust particles present in the air in Barcelona were associated with an 8.4% increase in the death rate. Scientific shortcomings There are a number of explanations for this scientific under-investment in West The PM 10 are not completely \u201cnatu- ral\u201d. While they are indeed the result of wind erosion and suspension in the air due to wind action, the quantities emit- ted are influenced by human activities: bush fires, deforestation, overgrazing and other agricultural practices. \u201cIn certain regions,\u201d explains Pierre Ozer, \u201cthe vegetal matter that peasants used to leave on the ground is now collected for various uses, such as animal feed, to provide a stock of kindling between the growing seasons. The result is that the earth is totally bare at the end of the farming season, which favours the release of dust.\u201d In his doctoral thesis, the Li\u00e8ge geographer had shown that wind erosion in West Africa doubled or even trebled overall between the 1950s and 1980s.

It remained part of the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland under Russia until Finland declared its independence in 1917. Trading centre The city has a rich legacy of being a buoyant trading and vibrant cultural centre. Turku was a stop for merchants of the Hanseactic League in the 13th century when this group of Northern Europe\u2019s traders, whose hub was the northern German city of L\u00fcbeck, dominated routes from the Baltic to the North Sea. Although Turku had no official status as a capital at this time, the area around the city was known as \u2018Finland proper\u2019 and the Dukes and Governors General of Finland under Swedish rule traditionally set up their residences there, although rarely hold- ing their positions for long. Christina, Queen of Sweden, established the Swedish University of Turku in 1640, implanting the city\u2019s lasting reputation for academic excellence. Two of the oldest buildings which remain standing, although rebuilt or refurbished several times, are the cathedral and the castle. Consecrated in 1300, the cathedral which stands in the Old Great Square was originally built out of wood. It is the Mother Church of the Evangelical Lutheran Church (81 per cent of Finns are of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland) and to this day the seat of the Archbishop of Finland. The con- struction of Turku castle began in 1280. It was a former military base for the Swedish conquerors and an administra- tive centre for \u2018Eastland\u2019, as Finland was known during the period of the Swedish empire. It is now mainly used for formal city and private receptions. Under the Russian empire, Turku\u2019s status as the capital of the Duchy of Finland was short-lived. Russian Emperor, Alexander I, felt that Turku was geographically too far from Russia and too close to Sweden and trans- ferred the Duchy\u2019s capital to Helsinki in 1812.Turku\u2019s Great Fire of 1827 also reduced the city\u2019s influence and transformed the look of the city forever. Academic excellence \u00c4bo Akademi was re-launched as the Swedish University in 1918, followed by the establishment of the city\u2019s Finnish University in 1920. Turku also has four universities of applied sciences and other academic institutions. Continually seek- ing new opportunities, it is in the fortu- nate strategic position of looking west across the Gulf of Bothnia to eastern Sweden and Western Europe and east to Russia and China (see article on the economy in this sec- tion). Nearly four million passengers annually travel via the port of Turku. Although shipbuilding is now going through harder times, moves have been made to adapt shipbuilders\u2019 skills to new industries. Bio-technology, information and com- munication technology, tourism and the food manufacturing are rapidly develop- ing areas of the city\u2019s economy. Turku\u2019s present grid design is that of Carl Ludwig Engel, the German archi- tect appointed by the Russian Emperor to draw up a new city plan after the Great Fire. Engel also put his mark on Finland\u2019s capital, Helsinki. Like Rome, Turku stands on seven hills. Some of the old wooden structures to have survived the fire, notably in the Port Arthur dis- trict, are now sought-after for private homes and offices. The granite art-deco houses of wealthy traders of the late 19th and early 20th centuries featuring stone-engraved replicas of nature, such as foxes or pine trees, line the city\u2019s wide leafy boulevards. Citizens are also proud of their city\u2019s newer buildings such as the recent extension of the public library which has the atmosphere of a small village hall in the winter, with people gathering to read newspapers, surf the net or simply drink coffee. But after the long, dark days of winter (in mid-December, the sun doesn\u2019t rise before 10 am and sets at 2pm), eve- ryone\u2019s itching for the great outdoors. Many city-dwellers have cottages in the archipelago (see box page: no ) or jog, stroll or cycle the wide pedestrian walkways at the side of the River Aura which ices over in the winter. \u201cThe banks of the Aura are our living room in the summer\u201d, says Anu Salminen. Over the summer months, some of the cultural capital\u2019s exhibits will be placed in the central public park where animals once roamed free in the 18 th century.

Over the past winter months the pro- gramme has even included a celebration of darkness, \u2018876 shades of darkness\u2019. Cots- small tent-like shelters in various forms \u2013 were erected in public places around the city where people could sit for a while to explore their innerpeace during the twilight hours. A \u2018pitch black gallery\u2019 invited visitors to feel, listen, smell and touch art installations, rather than look at them, and \u2018pitch black parties\u2019 forced people to use every sense but sight when being introduced to fellow party-goers! Legacy The initiative for the EU policy of annu- ally designating one or more cities as \u2018Cities of Culture\u2019 (from 1999, as \u2018Capitals of Culture\u2019) was taken by Greece\u2019s former Minister of Culture, Melina Mercouri. Rumour has it that she met with, Jack Lang, then French Culture Minister in 1984 to discuss the idea.

        "31 Discovering Europe nominated as the first European City of Culture the following year followed by Florence in 1986. In the early days, these European City of Culture events were limited to summer festivals (the chosen cities have traditionally been in EU member states although Istanbul, Turkey, was a Capital of Culture in 2010). For Cay Sev\u00f3n, the turning point came when Glasgow was awarded the honour in 1990. At the time, it was a run-down city with many social problems but gained a new lease of life fol- lowing its year in the limelight, becoming a \u2018hip\u2019 destination and attracting inter- national congresses and festivals. Cay Sev\u00f3n says she hopes that Turku will now be put on the international map too. The city has already been cited in the top ten lists of not-to-be-missed-places in 2011 by numerous newspaper columnists. Financing Although an EU-driven programme, since 2010 those cities appointed as Capitals of Culture have to foot the organisa- tional bill themselves. Out of the \u20ac50M allocated from the Turku Foundation\u2019s budget, \u20ac18M is from the City of Turku and \u20ac18M from the state of Finland with \u20ac10M to be raised from the actual perfor- mances staged, although 70 per cent of the events are free-of-charge. Since 2010, a Capital of Culture city is also eligible for the \u20ac1.5M \u2018Melina Mercouri Prize\u2019 which is only awarded to those cities that make \u2018sound prepa- rations\u2019 in organising a programme. Turku and Tallinn both won individual \u2018Melina Mercouri\u2019 awards in 2010 to put towards their respective 2011 cultural agendas. Big names The Turku programme includes some big names such as locally-born operatic star, Karita Mattila, who will give a perfor- mance this August. The year-long exhibi- tion of the work of the homo-erotic artist, \u2018Tom of Finland\u2019, alias Touko Laaksonen (1920-1991), can be visited in Turku\u2019s \u2018Logomo \u2013 The Centre of Culture\u2019 venue, a former railway engineering workshop transformed into a permanent exhibition space for the Capital of Culture year. But the uniqueness of the Turku programme is that most of the projects are locally-driven and have been selected by open public tender. In this way, the Foundation was keen to ensure that the list of events did not become too provincial by including such events as \u2018The Detour\u2019, an exhi- bition by two architects, Simon Brunel and Nicolas Pannetier, featuring a \u2018jour- ney\u2019 through three cities with photos, videos and other material gathered from Turku, St Petersburg and fellow Capital of Culture for 2011, Tallinn in Estonia. Some 14,000 people are directly partici- pating in the events of Turku\u2019s cultural year; 11,000 from the region, 2,000 from other parts of Finland, just under 1,000 from other parts of Europe and just over 100 from other continents, says Cay Sev\u00f3n. Three thousand people are working in a professional capacity, mostly producers and artists in the cultural field, on 155 projects and a total of 5,000 events. The CEO explains that the overall aim is to build bridges between the artist and those in other walks of life which will remain once the year is over. For example, the mapping of cultural exercise paths (see article page 33) is proof that \u201cartists and sports services can work together and we hope that such cooperation will continue,\u201d says Cay Sev\u00f3n. Another trail- blazing project involves asking residents of senior citizen accommodation about their cultural preferences, whether draw- ing, music or handicrafts. Artists from various disciplines then visit the residents and try to make, \u201ctheir cultural dreams come true\u201d. Another original project is the issuing of a total of 5,500 \u201ccultural prescrip- tions\u201d by medical doctors. Turku\u2019s doc- tors write prescriptions for these which patients exchange for tickets to a cultural happening of their choice at the city\u2019s cultural information centre. \u201cCulture not only increases mental wellbeing but research suggests it also promotes physical welfare,\u201d says Cay Sev\u00f3n.

The refugee stories will be posted on the project\u2019s website. They include that of Moses Kambale who fled from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to Uganda when he was just 10 years of age. He was taken by the Red Cross to a camp across the border, in Rukingiri: \u201cI was staying in a refugee camp. I was given this saucepan on the first day in Matanda. I had never ever cooked before but I had to eat. It was great having something to eat after coming from the forest\u201d, recounts Moses pictured with his pot. Refugees who contribute pots are given new ones. Akim Color, a Finland-based master drummer from Benin, will accompany the drum float around schools to teach his skills. \u201cThe project will also launch an inter- net space where refugees can exchange stories and become a fan of the pro- ject or write about their own expe- riences with the assistance of local NGOs\u201d, says Kristiina Tuura.

Sandals, mostly flip flops from the feet of refu- gees around the world will be laid around Turku in the form of paths. A tent woven together from pieces of cloth made by refugees will provide a venue for music, drama, poetry and debate. This \u2018Pots, Sandals and a Tent\u2019 project, a highlight of the Cultural Capital\u2019s spring and summer agenda, is intended to raise awareness of the contribution of refugees to culture and society in Turku and globally, explains its producer, Finnish documentary film maker, Kristiina Tuura. \u201cYou can\u2019t hold a European cultural year without the presence of refugees. The project stresses the importance of refugees telling their stories in their own words\u201d, says Kristiina Tuura. She is work- ing closely on its design with Shiffra-ry , a small Somali women\u2019s NGO in Finland. A heated debate is currently going on in the country, she says, on issues of asylum with the presence of refugees often perceived as negative. In the project\u2019s offices in central Turku, Annika Raittinen producer of the \u2018Tent\u2019 and Ida-Lotta Backman, a theatre direc- tor, are preparing to go to the Turku\u2019s refugee reception centre for their weekly workshops. The refu- gees are making the long chains of beads which will adorn the tent. They are asked to choose beads, explains Annika Raittinen, which sym- bolise momentous events in their lives, both happy and sad. Global contributions Funded in part by the Turku 2011 Foundation which is implementing the Turku European Capital of Culture, the project has brought together a host of NGOs, individuals and associations work- ing with refugees around the globe.

        "33 N. 22 N.E \u2013 MARCH APRIL 2011 Discovering Europe Ships, design and life sciences Looking both West and East T he broad base of Turku\u2019s economy means that it has not been as rocked by the recent economic recession as some European Union cities. It is renowned for its design companies, shipbuilding and burgeoning life science industries. Topping this, tourism is expanding, particularly in the unique archipelago. Westwards to Sweden and eastwards to Russia and China, new markets beckon on the horizon. Arts and crafts industries were the first to develop in the city with professionals starting their businesses in the 1600's. The Kupittaa Clay ceramics factory dates back to the 1750's and a thriving textile industry developed in Kestil\u00e4, near Turku, in the early 1900's. The furniture manufacturing, company Huonekalutehdas Korhonen , was founded in 1910 and used designs of celebrated Finnish designer and architect, Alvar Aalto (1898-1976). People come from all over Finland to buy the products of Turku\u2019s design companies which will be showcased in the \u2018Turku Design Phenomenon Project\u2019 during the Capital of Culture events. Another project, \u2018Dimensions on Wood\u2019 will feature the growth of Huonekalutehdas Korhonen. World-class ship manufacturer Shipbuilding also has a long history, dating back to the early 1700's when the first wooden boats were constructed at the mouth of the river Aura. Although orders have slackened in recent years, Turku\u2019s shipyards have made some of the biggest ships ever built, notably for the cruise line, Royal Caribbean International . Whilst awaiting fresh orders, Aleksi Randell, Mayor of Turku, says that on-going Russian oil and drill- ing operations in North Lapland, are expected to create demand for a dif- ferent kind of ship - icebreakers. Ever- innovative Turku-based companies, with their long tradition in shipbuilding, are now seeking to adapt their skills to land-based industries such as buildings that float, explains the business man- ager of the City of Turku, Kalle Euro. The waste water treatment company, Clewer was expected to travel to China in March 2011, he says, to seek new clients and Turku-based firms have exported well-made, unbreakable public toilets to Switzerland and Austria. Other manufacturing in the Turku region includes electrical and hybrid cars at Uusikauanki. Industrial design companies, Provoke and ED , have col- laborated with the Nokia mobile phone company which has a factory in Salo, near Turku. Before the recession, unemployment stood at eight per cent in Turku although it has now crept up to 12 per cent, says the Mayor, add- ing that new market opportunities in both Russia and China abound. The Russian city of St. Petersburg is just five hours away from Turku by train. \u201cWe know how to work with Russia,\u201d says Mayor Randell. The city is attracting an increasing number of Russian tour- ists, the Mayor tells us, most heading for the unique and idyllic archipelago of 20,000 islands where many rent cot- tages during the long days of summer. Links with Russia and China The trans-Siberian railway starts in Turku and links the city with Vladivostok and beyond to Beijing. Turku is twinned with Tianjin in China, a city with a pop- ulation of 12 million. \u201cWe are trusted and loyal and people keep coming back to us,\u201d says Kalle Euro. \u201cThe Chinese value the involvement of the Turku city administration in making business con- tacts,\u201d he adds. Other growing opportunities for Turku are in bio-imaging \u2013 the creation of \u20183d\u2019 images, which show how diseases such as cancer progress, and \u2018e-health\u2019. Turku researchers have pioneered and collected data in particular on hormonal disease. Turku Science Park, set up 22 years ago, is a catalyst for such innovation. It is a \u201ctriple helix of universities, private com- panies and the public sector,\u201d explains its Chief Executive Officer, Rikumatti Levom\u00e4ki, bringing together science, research and business concerns under one roof. He agrees that there are huge opportunities in both Russia and China. \u201cWe cannot compete on price but we can on innovation and by providing the best available equipment,\u201d he says. Consultants from Turku\u2019s Science Park worked on a feasibility study to set up a similar innovation hub in South Africa\u2019s Gauteng province in 2008 under the COFISA programme between South Africa and Finland to enhance the South African National System of Innovation (SANSI). Gauteng\u2019s \u2018Centres of Excellence\u2019 focus on research into telecommunications, laser technology and biotechnology,such as malaria, HIV/Aids and tuberculosis. D.P.

        "34 C urier The Discovering Europe Jan-Erik Andersson is busy designing a sauna for the Capital of Culture\u2019s \u2018Sauna Lab\u2019 project which will place five saunas in public places to explore this Finnish ritual. His is in the shape of a garlic or pumpkin, or perhaps of the dome of St. Petersburg\u2019s Orthodox cathedral. But it is his fairy-tale-like leaf shaped house that is drawing visitors from around the globe and is yet another symbol of Turku\u2019s innovation. Built in one of the city's green suburbs, \u2018Life on a leaf\u2019, was first conceived in 1999 as part of Jan-Erik\u2019s Doctorate in Fine Arts at the Helsinki\u2019s Fine Arts Academy. \u201cWe are entering the house through the stem,\u201d says Jan-Erik, as he shows us around. The three-storey building has curved walls and a huge window in the shape of a leaf looks across to Turku castle in the distance. Both inside and out it is in stark contrast to the angular lines and minimalism traditionally associated with Nordic design. Twenty artists were invited to put their signature on the house from a video installation concealed under one of the top floors showing people rushing about like ants in New York city (artist: Pierre St. Jaques), to the images of impish sprites covering the kitchen worktops (artist: Karin Andersen). \u201cIt\u2019s an imaginative space,\u201d says Jan- Erik, adding, \u201ceverything here is ne- cessary\u201d. His intention is to explore the nature of ornamentalism, he says; whether it is possible to live in a pic- ture or sculpture and whether nature, brought inside a home, can transform a living space. Chicago-based sound artist, Shawn Decker, attached micro- phones to the walls on the outside to bring sounds that are sometimes im- perceptible to the human ear into the interior. It was a feature that initially worried his partner, interior designer, Marjo Malin, but she now finds these soft noises reassuring. \u201cWe need orna- mentalism to sharpen our imagination and fantasy,\u201d says Jan-Erik.

As temperatures pick up and the water reappears, cottage culture swings into action and city dwellers and visitors from further afield flock to the 20,000 islands which spill into the Baltic Sea off Turku. From June to September 2011, \u2018Con- temporary Art Archipelago\u2019, will put the islands from Ruissalo to Ut\u00f6 in the spot- light. A score of artists will mount diverse art installations and exhibits highlighting the sheer tranquil beauty of the archi- pelago, its way of life and threatened ecology, through different mediums from photography to sound. Turu Elving, artistic director of the project which is part of the Turku Capital of Cul- ture event says that although the Baltic is known as the most polluted sea in the world, \u201cthe archipelago is in better shape than it was 20-30 years ago\u201d. The guest artists both local and from around the globe, including Colombia\u2019s Alfredo Jaar, have already visited the archipelago to gain inspiration. The exhibition\u2019s pieces will be scattered throughout the islands, visible from the big ferries and cruise boats plying the seas, small craft, or the roads and brid- ges inter-linking some of the islands. One inspiration is an 80-year-old man who has lived all his life on the archipelago and has knowledge of changes in the winds over the decades, explains Taru Elving. The project also probes what\u2019s happening under the shallow waters whe- re marine biologists are replanting sea grasses. \u2018Archipelago Logic: Towards a Sustainable Future\u2019, an international symposium organised by Turku\u2019s \u00c5bo Akademi University which takes place in August will put the future of the world\u2019s archipelagos under the microscope.

I even wondered whether I would remain\u201d, he says. It\u2019s minus 15 degrees Celsius outside when we meet in Turku University which has a worldwide reputation for academic excellence. He is finalising the outline of his PhD on the subject of deforesta- tion in Zanzibar\u2019s Pemba Island. His suggested title for the doctoral thesis is: \u201cThe causes of forest change and the implication on people\u2019s livelihoods.\u201d One hundred and fifty years ago, 95 per cent of Pemba was covered by forests. The Ngezi national park created on the island in 1960 encompassed all of the remaining five per cent of the forest area. In spite of this protected status, 40 per cent of the Ngezi Park has since disappeared due to human activity. \u201cThere are multiple uses of the land and many different causes of deforestation\u201d, explains Zahor. The invaluable Geographic Information System (GIS) Turku University\u2019s Faculty of Geography has provided Zahor with office space, a desk top computer, a laptop, an allowance (stipend) and accommodation. He is par- ticularly delighted to gain practical expe- rience of the Geographic Information System (GIS) involving the collection of data and satellite imagery about a loca- tion to enable models and maps to be created. He explains the applications of GIS: \u201cIf you can map where human settlements and transport systems are, you know where to place a market\u201d. He says that he was always top of the class in the theory of GIS in Dar es Salaam, but initially failed the exam in the subject in Turku simply because he had never previously used computer software to apply the theory and find solutions. On doing a re-take, he was among three out of twenty students who passed. Whereas 1,400 students cram into a university lecture room in Tanzania, there are just 20 to 30 in a class in Turku which is a factor in the high quality of teaching in Finland, says Zahor. He particularly enjoys the feeling of safety, security and peace of mind in Finland and enjoys some traditional local activities. He has learnt to ice skate and shares a sauna the cabin of intense dry heat found on nearly all Finnish premises with friends and colleagues. \u201cAt first, I was a bit shocked when I found you had to take off all your clothes and the sauna got hotter and hotter as water was added to the hot stones\u201d, he says of his sauna experience. Although academic classes are taught in English, he has learnt about 50 Finnish words. In the summer, he will go back to Pemba to do some field work alongside his fellow researchers from Turku who are analysing environmental issues on Zanzibar\u2019s Unguja Island. He hopes to extend his studies in Turku in the autumn but is pleased that the University of Turku has already guaranteed access to the invaluable GIS when he eventually returns to Dar es Salaam University.

        "36 C urier The Zoom Model on a mission Born in Lubumbashi in the DRC to a Congolese mother and a Greek father, Coursaris left Africa at the age of five, when her mother sent her to Europe to live with an aunt because she couldn\u2019t afford to keep her. It would be another 13 years before she returned to the DRC to meet her mother and see for herself the place from which she came, a transformative experience that changed her life and set her on a new path. Coursaris, who is becoming as equally known for her philanthropy as for her role in the fashion industry, recently delivered an address to the Congolese Parliament and UNICEF in Kinshasa about the issues that face underprivileged girls in Congolese society. When we spoke for this interview, she was in New York to give a talk at the UN. Sylvia Arthur N oella Coursaris\u2019 face may be her fortune but her charity work is worth more than its weight in gold. In 2007, the model esta- blished the Georges Malaika Foundation (GMF), named after her late father, to provide educational opportunities for young girls in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Since the charity came into being, it has sponsored the education of sixteen youngsters, paying their school, food and orphanage fees. Now, GMF is in the process of an ambitious project to build an ecological school for 104 children in the province in which Coursaris spent her early years. ",
        "37 N. 22 N.E \u2013 MARCH APRIL 2011 Zoom What made you decide to start GMF? I lost my dad at five years old and my mum didn\u2019t have the resources to keep me. I grew up from family to family and it was only after 13 years that I went to visit my mum. Up until that time, I had little contact with her and I didn\u2019t have any pre- conceived ideas about what to expect when I went to the DRC. But, when I got there, what I saw made me feel extremely lucky for my life and the way I was brought up. I couldn\u2019t resent my mother for sending me away because I saw that she did it for my own good. Seeing all these kids with no schooling or pregnant at a very young age really touched me and I promised myself that I would do something to give back to the country that gave me life. Why did you decide to focus on girls in particular? Because their story is my story. In Africa, women tend to rely on their husbands and when their husband dies, or something happens to him, they have nothing left. Women need to be empowered to be able to go it alone when necessary. Why is education the key to empowering women in the DRC? The history of the DRC is a tragic one. We\u2019ve had colonisation, war, 5.5 million deaths, thousands of women raped. We need to be in control of our country and of our resources and the only way we can do that is through education. We need to see more women in power and invol- ved on the social, economic and politi- cal levels. They need to be empowered through knowledge. Only then can we move forward as a nation. What would you like to see the EU do to improve the situation for the people of the Congo? We need to work together. We shouldn\u2019t be imposing solutions and policies but we should be working with Africans to get the best for both sides. How has your dual heritage affected your perspective on Africa? It\u2019s great to have the two cultures. I\u2019m still learning everyday about them both. I also lived in the USA for four years so I have three cultures. We need all of them to make positive changes. How easy was it to reconnect with Africa when you visited at the age of 18 after 13 years away? It was difficult at first. First I needed to reacquaint myself with my mother but it was great to discover my roots. It was very beneficial and it makes me more grounded as a person. What do you think is the biggest misconception in Europe about Africa? Europe tends to see Africa as underdeve- loped and poor and starving but Africa has much to offer. What message would you like to send to the world about Congolese women \u2013 their plight and their resilience? Although Congolese women continue to suffer and are traumatised the world is more aware of the DRC now and, because of that, they don\u2019t suffer as much as they once did. We have to thank everyone for that because a lot of people and coun- tries are supporting them. Congolese women are strong and we have to give them a chance by providing them with the opportunity to access education and microfinance but also to teach them about things like family planning too. How has having a child changed your vision of the future, for yourself and for the work that you do? The best thing that ever happened to me was having a child. It makes me want to do even more for the kids, and to make sure that the school we are building will be a good step for their future. Education is the right of every child. Every child has the right to go to school and to one day stand on his or her own two feet. It\u2019s like a chain. Once they\u2019ve been empowered they then can help others too. But it\u2019s important that the children have good teachers who themselves have had good quality training and are well paid. What\u2019s next for you and GMF? The school we\u2019re building is opening in September for 104 girls and it will be used to teach the parents at weekends. We want this school to be a platform to bring even more NGOs and other organisations in the Kalebuka region together, so that they too will get involved and develop it further. Most importantly, though, is that the community is still involved. They are everything to this project and are essential to the development, not only of the region, but of the country too. We also recently aided Doc to Dock (a charity that redis- tributes medical supplies to hospitals in the developing world) to deliver a health container worth $500,000 to Sendwe hos- pital in Katanga province. We hope to do more collaborative work in the future. T o find out how you can help GMF break the cycle of illiteracy and poverty in the DRC visit www.gmalaikaf.org.

        "38 C urier The Interactions Reinforcing a raw materials diplomacy Published in February 2011, a European Commission Communication highlights the challenges Europe faces in com- modity markets and on raw mate- rials \u2013 issues affecting Africa too. Proposals to ensure access to resources have won praise from industry, while NGOs have reacted with scepticism. Anna Patton A frica\u2019s share in the global pro- duction of raw materials is rela- tively limited. The potential of the continent is, however, enor- mous, with much territory yet unexplored. Already, Africa produces over 60 metals and minerals, including copper, nickel and iron. Resource-poor Europe, meanwhile, is increasingly concerned by the surging global demand and volatile markets that threaten access to raw materials \u2013 and the 30 million jobs that depend on them. These concerns were highlighted in the European Commission Communication, \u201cTackling the challenges in commodity markets and on raw materials\u201d. 1 Echoing its Raw Materials Initiative launched in 2008, the EC calls for action under three ",
        "39 N. 22 N.E \u2013 MARCH APRIL 2011 Interactions pillars: fair access to raw materials on world markets, sustainable supply from European sources, and efficient use of resources. The 2011 Communication also broadens the scope to include energy, agriculture and food commodities, and calls for improved regulation and transparency of financial and commodity markets. Progress on raw materials in recent years includes new EU guidelines on extraction in protected areas and new research oppor- tunities in mining. But the fundamen- tal challenges are, if anything, growing. Demand for key metals shot up between 2002 and 2008, and is expected to con- tinue: demand for gallium is set to rise 20-fold and for indium 8-fold between 2006 and 2030. Total demand for food is expected to rise about 70% from 2006 to 2050. Meanwhile, markets have shown unprecedented volatility, with price swings occurring across all major com- modity markets including energy, met- als, minerals, food and agriculture. This phenomenon has been linked to large- scale new investment flows: speaking in Brussels, Internal Market Commissioner Barnier noted that the volume of finan- cial contracts for commodities deriva- tives tripled from 2002 to 2008. Though the precise impact on market stability is disputed, the EC confirms the need for more research into the link between financial and physical commodity markets. EU needs to imports The EU has set ambitious economic targets by 2020; as the world\u2019s largest importer of raw materials, it cannot grow without them. High-tech sectors are particularly affected, while innovative and clean energy industries are dependent on materials defined as \u201ccritical\u201d to the EU \u2013 those of high economic importance and high supply risk. While Africa as a whole has a low share of global production of critical materials, a few countries are major play- ers, such as South Africa (almost 80% of global platinum production) and the Democratic Republic of Congo (40% of cobalt produced). The EU\u2019s list of critical raw materials, to be updated every three years, also includes rare earths, needed for energy-efficient products such as hybrid cars or solar panels. China cur- rently produces 97% of rare earths and the EU is 100% dependent on imports; the announcement in 2009 that Chinese exports would be restricted was a striking reminder of Europe\u2019s dependency. Exploring alternatives through \u201craw mate- rials diplomacy\u201d is therefore an EU prior- ity. In the case of Africa this also means using development policy instruments. The 2011 Communication proposes support for geological surveys and for increased financing for industry. The EC is also to \u201cencourage partner governments to develop comprehensive reform programmes\u201d with \u2022 Monitor access to critical raw materials \u2022 Engage in raw materials diplomacy \u2022 Develop bilateral cooperation with Africa \u2022 Improve regulations on sustainable extraction in the EU \u2022 Enhance resource efficiency and recycling \u2022 Promote research and innovation \u2022 Improve transparency and stability of markets European Commission proposals on raw materials and commodity markets objectives for example in taxation and transparency. But working with govern- ments is only one side of the issue: \u201cOn transparency for companies, the EU is lagging behind\u201d, says Isabelle Ramdoo of ECDPM, a think tank, citing binding US laws compared to EC proposals to \u201cpromote EU standards\u201d among European firms. Increased support for the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative is wel- comed by the B\u00f6ll Foundation, a German NGO, but the NGO warns that \u201cwithout binding regulation, there will be no real change on the ground\u201d. As well as using development tools, the EU is stepping up its trade policy. Trade bar- riers will be tackled through dialogue, but also at the WTO if necessary. International NGO Oxfam has criticised what it calls an attempt to \u201cforce developing countries to ban or curb the use of export taxes, which many rely on to help them develop\u201d. Investment provisions are also to be \u201cfur- ther embedded\u201d within trade negotiations \u2013 a major issue for African countries. In a joint report, \u201cThe new resource grab\u201d, five development NGOs warn that foreign investment can be positive, but \u201cthis EU push will make it more difficult for govern- ments to regulate investment to promote local development\u201d. While looking to the global markets, the EU will also expand sustainable extrac- tion within Europe: exploitation of rare earths could restart from 2015. Efficient use of resources is also tackled, with the 2011 Communication proposing best prac- tices in waste collection and boosting com- petitiveness of recycling industries. For some, the importance of this third pillar has been underestimated. \u201cScarcity is not the only challenge\u201d, argues Member of the European Parliament, Reinhard B\u00fctikofer. \u201cA strategy with its primary emphasis on access to resources may help for a while, but it doesn\u2019t help industry to reduce its basic dependency on resource supply\u201d. Though the EU approach raises challenges, it also suggests opportunities. Above all, the debate around natural resources indi- cates an opportunity for African govern- ments to develop their own strategies. If Europe desperately needs raw materials, many African countries are also heav- ily dependent on them. Managing those resources effectively will become ever more important \u2013 for both continents. 1 European Commission, 02.02.2011, COM(2011) 25 final.

Over the last decade, the region\u2019s depend- ency on tourism revenues has increased as income from cash crops, such as bananas and sugar, has slack- ened. In St. Kitts and Nevis, the final sugar crop was harvested five years ago. The Caribbean now has the thirteenth larg- est tourism industry globally. Although known throughout globe over for its \u201cpristine beaches, wonderful weather and welcom- ing people\u201d, the region is facing competi- tion from places such as India, China and Dubai and even Europe given the trend for \u201cstaycation\u201d, many choosing to take their vacations nearer to home, Minister Skerritt told the summit. The fall-out of this was seen two weeks ago, he said when a leading US cruise liner announced the repositioning of one of its cruise services from the Caribbean Sea to European waters for the summer of 2012. Tighter budgets Hugh Riley told The Courier that although member countries of the CTO registered the biggest number of arrivals ever at the end of 2010 - 23 million at the end of 2010 worth $39.4bn \u2013 once in the Caribbean, visitors held on to their purse strings. He suggested how the EU could help stimulate the sector acting on areas already identified in the tourism annex of the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) signed between the EU and the Caribbean\u2019s 15-member state trade bloc, CARIFORUM. Environmental and quality standards, internet marketing strategies, participation in international standard setting bodies, tourism exchange programmes, training and exchanges on best information and practices and setting up national satellite accounting systems which enable countries to report the true impact of tourism on development are included. The European Commission, through its statistical office Eurostat, was itself instru- mental in setting up a global Tourism Satellite Accounts system. Together with the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the World Tourism Organisation (WTO) it signed a conceptual frame- work on a methodo- logical design which led to the approval of the \u201cTourism Satellite Account: R e c o m m e n d e d M e t h o d o l o g i c a l Framework\" by the thirty-first session of the Statistical Commission of the United Nations in March 2000. The UN recom- mendations aim to provide a framework for a tourism satellite account system to enable greater international comparability in tourism statistics. Over the last decade, the region\u2019s dependency on tourism revenues has increased as income from cash crops, such as bananas and sugar, has slackened Brussels was the location picked for the annual summit of the Caribbean Tourism Organisation (CTO), from 13 to15 March. The aim was to draw the attention of the EU to the \u201ccritically important role of tourism in the region to livelihood and poverty alleviation,\u201d said Hugh Riley, Chief Executive Officer of the Barbados-based CTO which represents 33 member coun- tries and many private sector entities.

Leng is currently developing, \u2018Alerts Connect\u2019, which is a new response software to monitor and manage a crisis. \"This is designed as a low-cost operational tool for the Disaster Management Offices in the Pacific,\u201d says Leng. \"It\u2019s a map-centric, web-based informa- tion system that allows inbound data to be rapidly categorised, mapped and then channelled to the appropriate responders or Agencies. Infrastructure, asset and resource information can be mapped via the internet at Google Earth, or by using local GIS (Geographic Information System) mapping, so that there is a cen- tral repository of information allowing decisions to be taken quickly by the Disaster Advisory Committee,\" explains Leng.

Throughout the recovery operation, mobile phones were the lifeline for many in isolated areas who were able to call the Red Cross, other aid organisations, or the emergency services. Samoa\u2019s Principal Disaster Management Officer (DMO), Ms Filomena Nelson, says mobile technology plays an integral role in their work to warn the public and respond to disasters. The DMO either issues a text message, or makes a phone call, to contact points across Samoa, who in turn manually ring bells to inform residents of the disaster. Antony Sass, Captain of the Water Safety Team for the Volunteer Emergency Response Team Samoa (VERTS) says mobile technology has made a tremen- dous difference to his work. \"Our phones are on standby now, 24/7. If we get the information or details of the emergency sent to us via text, it makes our job easier before we get there,\" he says. Another great tool is the internet. Up-to-date meteorological forecasts and geological information can be used by VERTS to respond accordingly. \u201cThat's our lifeline really, when we are called in due to a looming cyclone, we basically camp in front of the computer to monitor the progress and prepare ourselves, says Antony Sass.

According to Sightsavers, one of the ways the programme will reduce the prev- alence of blindness and visual impair- ment amongst rural and poor populations in the Caribbean is partly through train- ing professionals in early detection. \u201cOne of the aims of the programme is to reduce the cost of spectacles and pro- vide equipment and training to personnel within the government sector. We want the programme to develop in a way that when it finishes, the government can carry it forward\u201d, explains Charles Vandyke of Eye Care Guyana, speaking in his office in Georgetown, Guyana.

Facilities at seven health institutions are to be improved and 13 spe- cialised vision centres set up within dis- trict or community health facilities, as well as five spectacle laboratories. The profes- sionals will be trained at the University of Guyana which began offering a four-year BSc degree course in optometry the only one in the Caribbean \u2013 in 2010. The EU programme is providing some of the funding for course lecturers and scholar- ships for students. Research is another part of the pro- gramme.

Its promoter is the Open Society Initiative for West Africa (OSIWA), part of the network of the Soros Foundations whose aims are to further democracy, good governance, the rule of law, free- dom and civil society participation. After initial attempts to establish the radio station in Sierra Leone in 2002 were met with political opposition, WADR\u2019s headquarters were finally estab- lished in Dakar, Senegal from where it began broadcasting in 2005, says Ndeye Aita Sarr, OSIWA\u2019s Executive Director. \u201cWADR now has correspondents in ten West African countries, while the affili- ate stations also serve as sources of infor- mation from their respective localities in urban and rural West Africa,\u201d says Aita Sarr. In addition to the live short- wave broadcasts, WADR\u2019s programmes are delivered by satellite digital radio to local radio partners who also receive technical support. Communities\u2019 voices \u201cWe seek to improve the capacity of community radio stations, especially those in rural areas, and boost the par- ticipation of their local communities.

        "46 C urier The Report by Marie-Martine Buckens O n July 9 th next, Sudan will lose its title as the largest country in Africa. The proclamation of the independence of South Sudan will end a turbulent common his- tory largely created by the first colonisers \u2013 be they Egyptian, Turkish or English, of this territory six times the size of France. In Khartoum, the capital of unified Sudan, at least for the next three months, the population \u2013 as we will read about later\u2013 is traumatised by a separation which divides the so-called Arabo-Muslim north of the country from the so-called Afro- Christian, but also the largely animist (the belief that non-human entities are spiritual beings) south. These cleavages hide the reality of a mosaic of different ethnicities and origins, both social and religious, and whose geographic repar- tition has been disrupted by civil war between the north and the south, without counting the war to the west in Darfur, which forced thousands of people to seek refuge in neighbouring countries or in camps close to northern cities. The Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) signed in 2005 between the seces- sionist south and the north, and actively supported by the European Union, ended more than fifty years of conflict \u2013 inter- spersed with relative peace in the 1970s- and led to the January 2011 referendum where an overwhelming majority of Southern Sudanese voted for independ- ence. Independence that will take effect from July of this year. Between now and then, numerous ques- tions still remain to be resolved, be it on the sharing of oil revenue where most of the discovered oil fields lie in the south, on the sharing of external \u2018national\u2019 debt or even on the drawing of borders. Questions which, at the time The Courier went to press, were still giving rise to sporadic and deadly skirmishes in certain border areas. The challenges that await the two new countries are considerable. The EU, meanwhile, is actively preparing the way for South Sudan to sign the Cotonou Agreement, which will mark its entry into the group of ACP countries. The Sudan of Khartoum, of President Omar al-Bashir, has as yet refused to sign the latest version of the Cotonou agreement. While the EU has nevertheless decided to continue to pursue cooperation with the fledgling country, in support of the CPA process, the division of the country should bring the European leaders to reflect upon the opportunity to pursue cooperation with Khartoum in a different manner. A reflection that becomes all the more urgent because of the events unfolding in North Africa, notably in Libya and in Egypt, Sudan\u2019s biggest neighbours.

A fascinating country, lying at the crossroads of the Arab and Black African worlds, on which Pharaonic, Christian and Muslim civilizations have each left their mark, and home to a mosaic of cultures, languages and reli- gions. With the Nubians and Arabs in the north, the Fur and Massalit in the west, the Dinka and Nuer in the south, and the Beja in the east, Muslims, Christians and Animists are all represented. The 42 million Sudanese are made up of 500 tribes, themselves originating in around 50 ethnic groups. Retracing the history of such a vast coun- try, flanked by nine countries - Libya and Egypt to the north, to the east the Red Sea, Eritrea and Ethiopia, the Central African Republic and Chad to the west, and the DRC, Kenya and Uganda to the south \u2013 is a daunting task. While relatively little is known of the history of southern Sudan before the 19th cen- tury, historians speak of a rich Neolithic civilization in the north. This was fol- lowed by the kingdoms, including the Kerma Kingdom in around 2,500 B.C. One of these kings annexed Egypt and proclaimed himself pharaoh. Besieged by the Assyrians, this dynasty of \u201cblack pharaohs\u201d was forced to withdraw to Meroe, in Nubia, not far from Khartoum, where splendid vestiges of their civiliza- tion remain today. In around 350 B.C. it was the turn of the Ethiopian kingdom of Aksum to conquer Nubia. From the 6th century A.D. there followed a succession of small Christian kingdoms through to the 16 th century. This was the era of the illustrious Funj Sultanate, Blacks who had converted to Islam and whose power stemmed from a slave trade in the Blacks of the south. The pace of events then accelerated. In 1820, Ottoman Egypt invaded Sudan. Egyptian domination lasted 60 years and spread to the south, which became the supplier of slaves. The country was administered by the Englishman Charles Gordon on behalf of the Ottoman Empire. The sultanate of Darfur was the only one to remain independent, until 1916. In 1882, the Sudanese rebellion led by the \u2018Mahdi\u2019 broke out. The caliph who succeeded him continued to conquer the Nilotic peoples of the south, annexing their territory to Sudan. In 1896, the British, concerned at the growing influence of France in Central Africa, launched an expedition against the caliph. Led by the British General Kitchener, it ended in the defeat of the Mahdist troops in 1898. There followed an Anglo-Egyptian \u2018reign\u2019 that lasted until Sudan gained independence in 1956. It was under this \u2018reign\u2019 that the split between the north and south of the country consolidated. In the north the British encouraged orthodox Islam and banished the Christian missionaries to the south, where they administered through relatively autonomous \u2018marsh barons\u2019. Economic development was concentrated in the north, based essen- tially on agriculture. The British faced a number of uprisings, especially by the peoples of the south. As a result they decided to prevent all contact between north and south, a policy that generated resentment and frustration. A brief history A first legislative assembly was elected in 1948, dominated by the parties of the north. Eight years later the Republic of the Sudan was proclaimed. After a num- ber of turbulent years General el-Nemeiri came to power in 1969 and granted autonomy to the separatists of the south. In 1972, the Sudists, under their histori- cal leader, John Garang, rebelled against the attempt to impose Islamic law. In the north the situation also deteriorated. Martial law was imposed in 1984. In 1989, General Omar el-B\u00e9chir seized power and strengthened Islamic law. The war intensified with the Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Army (SPLA) under John Garang. As negotiations between Khartoum and the South seemed to be making progress, in 2003 it was the turn of Darfur, in the west to ignite. It was not until 2005 that a global peace agreement was signed between North Sudan and South Sudan, recognising the latter\u2019s right to self-determination. M.M.B.

        "48 C urier The Report The Courier met with H.E. Mr Carlo De Filippi, Head of Delegation of the European Union to Sudan. H ow long have you been the EU\u2019s Head of Delegation and how would you best describe your experiences and challenges in Sudan? I\u2019ve worked in development related pro- jects in Africa since 1977 and for the European Institutions since 1986. I have been here since December 2007 follow- ing postings in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon and Equatorial Guinea. Sudan is a very interesting country to work in and is a big challenge. Sudan is like a small version of Africa. It has a diverse and rich culture and has huge economic and political potential. Of course, if it had to be defined in one word, that word would be 'challenging'; there are huge challenges including con- flict prevention, peace building, post war reconstruction, poverty alleviation, democratic transfer, protection of human rights and nation building. Sudan is a country where I feel that the EU has a lot to offer that would benefit the Sudanese people and would enrich EU experience in handling African issues. On a more personal level what most impressed you about the Sudanese people which could give Western readers a different view of a country only known for its con- flicts)? It is very different living here than hear- ing about it in the media. The Sudanese are kind and generous people. They are also very simple in their daily lives. They are proud of their history and identity and they respect foreigners when they speak their languages and eat with them. As people, the Sudanese are quite politicized, they are critical and informed about their country's status, about Europe and the world. They have very interesting views about world events. Europeans conduct extensive dialogue with the Sudanese at all levels, official and non-official. It is very important to have two-way communication; to listen and not just speak. What is the EU vision for Sudan and your plans for the future of Sudan Our engagement so far shows that Sudan is important to Europe, geographically, strategically and culturally, as a mixture of Africa and the Arab World, and has vast resources to explore. It is an impor- tant gateway between Africa and the Middle East. In addition, the Sudanese people and government are interested in Europe and the European Union. Thus, I am optimistic about the future. It is important to continue a constructive political dialogue and to continue bal- anced cooperation projects that would achieve long term results in all parts of Sudan. Since Khartoum has not signed the Cotonou agreement, what are the main EU actions in Sudan? Our cooperation projects are worth 500 million Euros and cover a wide range of issues in all parts of Sudan; in addition we are the largest donor of humanitarian aid amounting to \u20ac776M since 2003. We have played an important role in demo- cratic transformation by providing tech- nical and financial support to elections and referendums. We also support the United Nations Mission in Sudan (NMIS) and the African Union/UN Hybrid operation in Darfur (UNAMID) both of whom are keeping peace in Darfur and South Sudan. The EU has opened an office in Juba that is a focal point for the work done in Southern Sudan. In addition, we are conducting constructive dialogue with the government on many other issues. There is positive improvement and we are slowly building our relationship. At their last informal meeting, EU Development ministers agreed to open negotiations with the govern- ment of South Sudan regarding the Cotonou agreement; what are your views on this? South Sudan has chosen to become an independent country from 9 July 2011. After that the government of South Sudan becomes a sovereign country and has every right to join the ACP. In my view, the Cotonou Partnership Agreement is well designed to support the African, Pacific and Caribbean countries. South Sudan can gain a lot by joining this group but it remains their sovereign decision to do so.

It is my mission to help to deliver the EU's strategic policy objectives, which include active support for the full and timely implementation of the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) and an agreement on post-referendum arrangements. Though based in Brussels, I spend at least two weeks of every month in Khartoum and Juba. I have also been to Darfur, Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile and also to a number of high-level inter- national meetings in Addis Ababa, New York and Washington to support progress on CPA implementation and unblock obstacles. I'm in constant motion! What is your evaluation of CPA implementation by the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM)? The CPA ended Africa's longest civil war and, as such, was a remarkable achieve- ment. As a witness to it, the EU has consistently given strong support to its implementation. There are still concerns about the need to resolve outstanding CPA issues like the Abyei issue, delimit- ing the North-South border and holding credible Popular Consultations in Blue Nile and Southern Kordofan. Recent violence and loss of life in Abyei has caused deep concern and we call on the parties to reach an early and equitable solution. We support the efforts of the AU High Level Implementation Panel chaired by President Mbeki to resolve these out- standing CPA issues and to facilitate agreement on post-Referendum arrange- ments, including citizenship, oil, debt, currency, border management and secu- rity arrangements, that will sustain the North-South relationship in the long- term. How do you see the different on- going processes concerning Darfur and the role of the EU in the Eastern Sudan Peace Agreement? We\u2019re concerned about the continued violence in Darfur and consequent suf- fering of its people. The coming months represent a critical period for Sudan and Darfur, in particular. The EU has given consistent support to the peace process in Doha. Now that the Afro-Arab Mediation team for Darfur has circulated draft ele- ments for an agreement, I hope that the opportunity to make real progress will be seized. Humanitarian assistance has been pro- vided by the EU to the people of Eastern Sudan since the early 1990s and devel- opment support since the signing of the 2006 Eastern Sudan Peace Agreement. Although some poverty indicators are as bad as in Darfur or parts of Southern Sudan and it hosts the oldest refugee caseload in Africa, the East receives relatively little international attention and much lower than average per capita financial transfers from Khartoum. At the international donors' and investors' conference in Kuwait last December, I announced that the EU plans to allo- cate 24 million euros for Eastern Sudan. This is in addition to the EU's on going assistance for rural livelihoods, food security and empowerment of women and civil society and bilateral assistance from EU Member States. The EU is now participating in a mechanism with the Government and Arab Funds for contin- ued donor interaction on Eastern Sudan. What are the main obstacles to a sound cooperation between the EU and Sudan and how to promote EU/ Sudan relations in the future? The EU is prepared to establish a long- term dialogue on issues of common inter- est with the Government in Khartoum and remains committed to providing assistance to the people in the North. It is also ready to examine closely possible EU support for an international debt relief effort, consistent with political progress. Resolving the Darfur conflict and out- standing CPA and post-CPA issues will lay the basis for the further strengthening of EU-Sudan relations. Following the Referendum, we look forward to further developing a close and long-term partnership with South Sudan. We\u2019re ready to scale up our efforts to support basic services and agricul- tural development and to engage with the Government of Southern Sudan and other partners in supporting effective institutional capacity building.

Tomorrow is Friday, a public holiday and his team of 15 journalists and secretaries has left already. He sits taking notes as he waits for our questions. The founding of the newspaper? \u201cI began my career in 1949 when I left school. I started the newspaper with two friends thanks to loans from our acquaintances in October 1953. From the outset we positioned ourselves as a national newspaper, covering politics, economics and social affairs.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a risky job being a journalist here. The paper has been taken over, shut down and we have been arrested many times. Between 1970 and 1986 Al Ayaam was nationalised. I survived by open- ing a printing company and working for foreign newspapers. Then, in 1989, the newspaper was shut down completely for 10 years. No private newspapers were allowed until 1993. After that the grip was slowly loosened. We started up again at the beginning of 2000.\u201d The division of Sudan? \u201cI\u2019m sad. It was a good country but so many things have gone wrong. In the 1990s Sudan was already a country with very, very long-standing problems in the South and West. This separation is a very traumatic experience for us. But it\u2019s a good thing that the South has decided to call itself \u2018South Sudan\u2019, as if they are still Sudanese. I believe it is important to stop for a moment and ask oneself: is this going to happen elsewhere? There is war in Darfur and what do they think there of the separation of the South? How do they see it in terms of the risk and the opportunities? The only reason South Sudan was able to split is that it has oil revenue. What will happen if the prospecting for oil in South Darfur produces a promising result? And how will this separation affect not only the population in South Kordofan and the Blue Nile [ Ed: transition zones between the North and the South], but also the populations in the East? Then there are other unknown factors such as the fate of the Southern people living in the North. The Khartoum government is right to ask them to leave. But in practice how are issues such as pensions and prop- erty ownership going to be resolved?\u201d The future of South Sudan? \u201cThe South has been fighting Khartoum for 50 years now and I fear that this culture of mutiny will remain. We now risk seeing the tribes revolt against the Report A special witness At the head of the newspaper 'Al Ayaam' that he founded back in 1953, Mahjoub Mohamed Saleh witnessed at close hand every step in his country\u2019s move to independence in 1956, amid political upheavals marked by repeated newspaper closures and arrests. At the age of 84, this wise man of the Sudanese press takes a lucid but empathetic look at what his country\u2019s future may hold.

Today is March 8, International Women's Day. The police have just stopped a dem- onstration by women demanding the gov- ernment to stop violence against women. \"The recent history of Sudanese women has not yet been written\u201d, says Balghis Badri. \u201cWho initiated the process of nego- tiations between the North and South of the country? Women did. In 2000, we managed to change the law on women's participation in public affairs. Today, women take to the streets as protestors. I think the wind of change has risen in Sudan. \" But the director of the Institute recognizes that this will not happen without difficul- ties. \"The challenges are not only social. They are also cultural. The separation of public and private spheres has always been unfavourable for us. But women are becoming more aware. Especially now, with the separation of Southern Sudan, the government is challenged with sus- taining (as will be the case in the South) human rights movements and especially women's movements. Now we are worried when we read that the Khartoum govern- ment intends to strengthen Islamic Sharia law, in the North.\" Balghis Badri, who led a study on mecha- nisms for resolving inter-community con- flict \u2013 a sensitive issue in a country where ethnic rivalries are at the root of most conflicts - highlights the vital work to be conducted with civil society to induce pos- itive change, both politically and socially. \"I have worked with the European Union on those subjects. But since the signing of the peace agreements the EU no longer funds projects directly although it does so via UN agencies. I think it will be impor- tant to see what role Europe intends to play during the transition period, and after July, when the split in the country will come into effect.\" M.M.B. Report Sudanese Women, fulcrum of renewal central government in Juba. Today\u2019s Sudan also has nine neighbours and South Sudan will have six. That\u2019s a lot for a country that is also landlocked. For one reason or another each of these six neighbours is interested in South Sudan and therefore risks destabilis- ing it. One of the questions is who owns the money, banks and trade. Ugandans, Kenyans and Indians are already a very strong presence.\u201d What about aid from the West, and from the European Union in particular? \u201cTake the case of Darfur. In the final analysis what is happening down there is a question of underdevelopment. The inhabitants \u2013 farmers and shepherds \u2013 are fighting over very limited natu- ral resources. And the population is increasing. But nobody is getting to grips with the underlying problems or developing a global strategy. The international community is no excep- tion. Following the 2005 peace agree- ment, the donor countries met in Oslo to support reconstruction and devel- opment projects. They then decided to transfer this money to Darfur, but in the end only released 20% of it for the intended projects. I was in Oslo, representing civil society. I had pre- dicted this. I get the impression that the West is only interested in crisis zones. It is not interested in long-term development that brings stability.\u201d The future of Sudan, of Khartoum? \u201cChange must come, even the govern- ment accepts that. But how and to what end? The questions remain. There are so many things to resolve. We have four months to sort out the North-South sepa- ration, we must find a way to end the war in Darfur and we must also reflect on the future of the entire zone that is today in such turmoil. One of the major problems is poverty. When those with a monopoly on authority assume the right to the wealth, you have inequalities that lead to conflict and rebellion. Poverty creates rivalry, not harmony. That is no doubt our biggest problem, learning to live with one another.\u201c M.M.B. Women protest in Omdurman, 8 March 2011 \u00a9 GCRTSudan ",

Four years ago, it was Khartoum that hosted the Economic Forum of the ACP countries. How are relations between Sudanese and European businessmen? \u201cOur relations deteriorated seriously in the 1980s. This when Europe had been our principal partner since 1950. In the mid-1990s the economic boycott decreed by the United States resulted in a de facto European boycott, even if it was not official.\u201d This was the time when the Sudanese Government started to look to the East and to China which today, adds Bakri Omer, presents Sudan as an African success story. Initially interested in West Sudan\u2019s oil resources, Beijing has invested progres- sively in all sectors, including agriculture. To date, however, the benefits for the Sudanese private sector have been few and it is generally regarded as the big loser in inter-governmental cooperation. \u201cProgress has been made in the past three years, even if joint Sudanese and Chinese companies are far from the rule,\u201d stresses the Secretary General, while at the same time regretting that \u201cwe are in the process of losing all the European technology.\u201d New North-South partnership But Bakri Omer becomes enthusiastic when he speaks of the trade relations established between South Sudan and the North. \u201cOur role is positive. In Juba, in 2007, we organised a forum on equitable investment attended by 30 German com- panies. Last November we welcomed 70 businessmen from South Sudan, includ- ing eight women and eight young entre- preneurs.\u201d The Secretary General is also trying to get banks in the North to return to the South. \u201cI explained to the bankers that the vacuum would soon be filled by our neighbours.\u201d He also stresses the close ties that remain between the two regions, and the identical way in which they do business: \u201cHistorically, the role of the businessman in Sudan is different to that in other countries. Our social role is major. I myself have built two high schools in my village and 80% of my company\u2019s employees come from my village.\u201d This is the spirit in which the employers\u2019 federation is investing in Darfur: \u201cWe have contributed actively to rebuilding the villages, schools and wells. With the Chamber of Craft Trades we organised workshops for rebels who laid down their weapons. Rather than giving money we believe it makes more sense to teach them a trade.\u201d M.M.B.

Located in the \u2018EU compound' where the embassies of Italy, France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain and Sweden also live for the moment - the EU delegation is actually a focal point of the EU delegation to the Sudan, and is six peo- ple strong. \"Initially, from May to September 2009, the office was reduced to its simplest form, work- ing even without a computer server, says Jesus Orus Baguena, who has been in Sudan for two years. The security situ- ation and lack of schools, means that the European staff is mostly single. \" Yet because of the enormous challenges facing the nascent Southern Sudan, the EU presence, he believes, should be expanded, and quickly: \"South Sudan could be an excellent reference for post- conflict regions, especially for interna- tional cooperation. \u201cThus was created an informal group in Juba, the 'G6', which includes the heads of delegation of the World Bank, UN, U.S., UK, Norway and EU. Together we are trying to coordi- nate our policies. In addition, a joint team of donors has established some joint actions. The team includes four EU member states - Denmark, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands - plus Norway and Canada. \" The task facing the international com- munity and the government in place is enormous. The country, plagued by war, starts with nothing. Covering an area greater than France, some 590,000 km \u00b2, inhabited by only 9 million people, it is one of the poorest in the world and its human development index is amongst the lowest; 85% of adults are illiterate. But it also has a number of advantages including fertile agricultural land and oil resources, which represent 80% of Sudan's oil reserves, currently estimated at 6 billion barrels. Heading good governance and food security \"The international community, including the EU, is the main source of assistance for the reconstruction of the country\", says a European observer, who continues: \"we must first address the issues of repa- triation, reintegration and rehabilitation, including former guerrillas.

        "54 C urier The Report \u201cOne of the major problems that the government of Southern Sudan will have to deal with is corruption and nepotism\u201d, explains Nhial Bol. And for the simple fact of declaring this opinion, the boss of the independent newspaper of Southern Sudan, launched in 2005, has repeate- dly spent time in prison. In Khartoum, in his former role as the general director of the independent newspaper, the Khar- toum Monitor , he was also incarcerated in 2002 for accusing Omar el-Bashir\u2019s government of turning a blind eye to the slavery and abduction of women and children in the Southern regions. \u201cHuge efforts have to be made to not only train the police force, but also to support it so as to avoid any slippage\u201d. Southern Sudan has adopted a Cons- titution, \u201cbut where are the laws?\u201d asks Nhial Bol. \u201cFor without laws\u201d he conti- nues, \u201cpeople guilty of corruption can- not be prosecuted. And at the present moment in time, you can be arrested simply for \u2018security reasons\u2019. In Juba today, some 2,300 people are languis- hing in a prison with capacity for 300 without any form of bathroom facilities\u201d. For the editor in chief of The Citizen , the role of the EU could be crucial. \u201cIf the Europeans wish to have a presence here, alongside the Americans and the Norwegians, it is imperative that they start constructive dialogue with the go- vernment, to ensure that they remain virtuous and also with the opposition, to make it less violent.\u201d \u201cThe EU must establish a dialogue with the Southern authorities\u201d Interview with Nhial Bol, Editor in Chief of The Citizen in Juba, Southern Sudan Nhial Bol\u00a9 Marie-Martine Buckens In Juba \u00a9 Marie-Martine Buckens tures in all 10 states of the country. It is a slow process, hampered by two major constraints: a lack of financial resources and trained people, notwithstanding the many differences both within the ruling party - the Sudanese People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) - and between the SPLM and its rival factions. \u201cBut the SPLM must above all learn to change from a movement with a military hierarchy (Silva Kiir, now president of Southern Sudan, was the head of the armed wing the SPLA, the Popular Army for the Liberation of Sudan) to a political party with a democratic structure. \u201cThe SPLM, says the observer, has enlisted the help of Southern Sudanese in the diaspora. Between these and the former guerrilla leader, accustomed to mak- ing decisions without a safety net, this makes for a sometimes fractious but very interesting mixture. \" If some members of the diaspora have answered the call, most actually come from cities in northern Sudan. \u201cThese people\", explained another European expert, \"were trained in Arabic and fol- low Islamic law, very different from the common law - British in nature - in force in South Sudan\".

The press also reports regu- larly on corruption cases, such as that of a finance minister implicated in large- scale food aid fraud. In February 2011, following the referendum, Salva Kiir declared that his government would now get to grips with \u201cthe endemic corrup- tion that it had thus far ignored\u201d as it had been preoccupied with implemen- ting the peace agreement signed in 2005. \"Our role is facilitated by the participa- tive tradition of South Sudan, reinforced by the war, and also complicated by this same tradition,\u201d the Anti-Corruption Commission president explained. \u201cWhen we attack someone, it is the entire community that feels targeted. Hence the importance of the active par- ticipation of all: of women, government and civil society. The inquiry we have just completed also shows us the impor- tance of the cultural dynamic behind the corruption.\" Recruitment The Anti-Corruption Commission recently signed a letter of intent with the 10 semi-autonomous states of South Sudan. \u201cThe central government,\u201d explains Pauline Riek, \u201cwould like to decentralise the fight against corrup- tion, but we believe it is too soon. We are in the process of recruiting per- sonnel in all these states but they still have to be trained. Here in Juba itself we are severely lac- king in staff and tra- ining. We have nine investigators, four of them qualified. But the workload is huge. We are currently looking into 66 cases. How long will these investigations take? Two months, three years, we don\u2019t know.\u201d Fourteen languages are spoken in South Sudan, \u201cand we have to be able to speak these languages,\u201d maintains the president. \u201cIt is also essential that the investigations be carried out by South Sudanese. If the investigator is a foreig- ner, the people interviewed will simply say what they think he wants to hear, whereas they answer differently when questioned by a national because he will know where they come from.\u201d South Sudan has adopted an anti- corruption strategy for the period 2010- 2014. \u201cIt is not our strategy, it is the government\u2019s strategy,\u201d the president is quick to point out. \u201cTwo bills should soon be passed that will better define our role. Our margin of manoeuvre is at present limited; we do not yet have a mandate to prosecute.\u201d In the meantime, last year South Sudanese officials were invited to fill out a \u201cfortune declaration\u201d. Only 222 people out of 1,000 responded. M.M.B.

        "56 C urier The Oil, land and water Report The independence of South Sudan should speed up negotiations on the difficult issue of sharing the waters of the Nile T he 2005 peace agreement makes provision for the sha- ring of oil revenue, three- quarters of which is obtained in South Sudan. It also makes provisions regarding the concluding of interna- tional treaties, including the treaty on sharing the waters of the Nile. To these two sensitive issues, a third must be added that is not covered by the peace agreement: land ownership. Whereas in North Sudan the land theo- retically belongs to the state - even though the latter pri- vatised farms in the 1980s and 1990s - it is a land tenure sys- tem rooted in com- mon law that must prevail in the South. That at least is the position adopted by the Juba government, albeit while recognising the need for a land policy that permits the commercialisation of agriculture and the development of a \u201cfair and inclusive\u201d market economy in a region ravaged by war and where the population is dependent on subsistence farming. The recognition of common land ownership will be even more difficult to apply in the oil regions from which the population was forcibly evicted by Khartoum. As government revenue in South Sudan comes almost exclusively from oil revenue, the government will have cause to create new structures for political control. Monopolizing In the meantime, according to a study carried out by the NGO Norwegian People\u2019s Aid, between 2007 and 2010 foreign companies purchased a total of 2.64 million hectares of land designated for agriculture, forestry and biofuel pro- duction. The surface involved is believed to represent about 9% of South Sudan\u2019s total surface area, which makes it an area bigger than the whole of Rwanda. Blue gold The independence of South Sudan should speed up negotiations on the difficult issue of sharing the waters of the Nile. The visit of Egyptian Foreign Minister Nabil Elaraby to Khartoum on 27 March, followed by a visit to Juba, is noteworthy. Egypt enjoys an \u201chistoric\u201d right to the waters of the Nile that, since the agreement impo- sed by the British in 1929 and amended in 1959, has enabled it to benefit from 70% of the waters of the river, 20% being allocated to Sudan in compensation for land flooded by the Assouan dam in Egypt and the displacement of more than 60,000 Nubians. The remaining 10% is allocated to countries lying downstream of the White Nile basin: Uganda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi, Rwanda, Tanzania, Kenya and Ethiopia, cradle of the Blue Nile and in reality responsible for 85% of the Nile that actually has its source in Khartoum where the White and Blue Niles meet. Since 1999, the Nile Basin Initiative has been trying to take account of the growing demand for water from coun- tries lying downstream. Most of these countries have ratified the Initiative. Cairo, hitherto opposed, now seems ready to accept a compromise. The idea is to revitalise the project to build the Jonglei Canal. Launched in 1973 this canal, 360 km in length, was designed to allow the White Nile to avoid pas- sing through the Sudd marshes in South Sudan, thereby recovering 10 billion m3 of water a year. Work on such a pro- ject was halted by the civil war in 1983 and the Egyptian minister now plans to relaunch it with his new South Sudanese partners. M.M.B.

Apart from this author, who passed away two years ago, few Sudanese authors have managed to have their voices heard out- side of their country. The collection \u2018News from Sudan\u2019 wants to fill this gap. The authors of the six collected short stories are of Arab, Nubian, Southern or Darfuri origin. All write in Arabic, but depict characters and personalities from the four corners of the country, with their different traditions and cha- racteristics.

I wanted to be a revolutio- nary, a leader, not a political one, but a cultural one. I bought land in Khartoum where I designed and built these buil- dings. All of the materials are locally sourced.

This conflict with mul- tiple causes \u2013 inter-ethnic conflict, aggravated by population growth, oil exploration, and an expansion of the conflict in Chad \u2013 has to date displaced over 2.5 million people, with more than one million killed. Since the beginning of the conflict the EU has attempted to give aid and support to the local populations via its humanitarian aid department, ECHO. Issam Abdel-Hafiz visited Darfur in 2006 and 2007 with a humanitarian NGO. A book published two years later (see images below) was decora- ted with 32 of his photos. Returning to Khartoum, he launched an inter- net based campaign \u2018Save the Kids of Darfur\u2019. \u201cWe received more than seven tons of medicine, school materials and clothes from all over the world, espe- cially from the Sudanese diaspora\u201d he explained. Since them, Issam Abdel- Hafez has continued his work, not without difficulty, as a photographer with a mission, not to mention his work painting and drawing. M.M.B. Darfur, as seen by the artist Issam Abdel-Hafez This essay, writes the Editor Salah M. Hassan, highlights the selective ways in which the conflict in Darfur has been presented, represented, and used by a range of actors inside and outside of Sudan to promote their own agendas and interests. It draws attention to the urgency of apprehending the po- litics of representation around Darfur \"from within.\" Focusing on Sudan's historically strong civil society, the essay elucidates how the Sudanese civil society's analysis of the country's conflicts eschews oversimplified bi- nary oppositions, such as \"Arab North\" versus \"Christian/Animist South\" or \"Arab\" versus \"African,\" as in the case of Darfur. Hassan argues in favour of looking at the origins of these con- flicts as manifestations of unequal development and historic injustices perpetrated against the margins by the ruling class of Arabized elites. In the process, Hassan reveals the vigorous engagement of Sudanese at all levels in the Darfur crisis, as well as other areas of conflict currently engulfing the country. The essay urges the need to pay attention to Sudanese voices if a genuine resolution to the country's manifold conflicts is to be pursued.

Copyright and artists\u2019 mobility in the ACP cultural landscape Eugenio Orsi W hat contribution can cul- ture make to reducing poverty? ACP Cultures, an on-going EU-ACP pilot project, is attempting to answer this question. Globalization is making the use of culture for economic develop- ment increasingly attractive. To exploit its full potential, there must firstly be a clear understanding of how cultural industries operate. Up to now, a lack of data from ACP countries has been an obstacle. An observatory set up under the project is trying to fill this information gap. It is behind a new report (currently being finalized) which addresses copyright and intellectual property issues as well as those of artists\u2019 mobility. The research was launched in October 2010 and was addressed to 478 cultural organisations in 60 countries, from the audio-visual industry, to dramatic arts performers and musicians. It found a world of small- sized organizations where over 80% of creative employment is generated by entities with fewer than 10 employees. Copyright The future is not very bright as far as respect for intellectual property rights is concerned. \u201cMost of the income from intellectual property in ACP countries will eventually end up in the hands of producers and managers. Artists are the last ones who benefit from copyright\u201d, explains Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Jacquemin, a senior expert on the project. Only 75% of ACP countries have a copyright management agency. Even when a functioning copy- right system is in place, artists the world over still feel that the system should be doing more for them. Jacquemin sug- gests that the ACP should also start to look at alternatives such as capitalizing on web technologies and peer-to-peer sharing. Mobility The bulk of travelling of ACP cultural artists is within ACP states and what's more, within the artist\u2019s region. \u201cAn artist from Ghana is more likely to go Poetry reading \u00a9Cecile Mella ",

He says that the visa issue is part of the problem but not the only one. \u201cI believe we should be really care- ful with the proposal of a cultural visa. It would of course be useful for those who work with the EU, but it would create a privileged mobility. I don\u2019t see why artists should have this privilege and not people from other fields, such as carpenters or teachers for example, who also need to travel for their work\u201d, he says. So how does the observatory\u2019s research contribute to poverty reduction, the pro- gramme\u2019s main goal? \u201cCollecting data might not sound such a sexy activity\u201d concludes Jacquemin, \u201cbut sometimes you have to build knowledge first in order to design effective projects.\u201d To find out more: www.acpcultures.eu/ ",
        "62 C urier The Creativity Sandra Federici I n 2005, Pat Masioni won interna- tional fame with the publication of a two part comic book based on the 1994 Rwanda genocide \u201cRwanda 94\u201d-\u201cDescente en enfer\u201d (Descent into Hell) and \u201cLe camp de la vie\u201d (The Camp of Life). These publications ele- vated Masioni to the ranks of a master of his art. His work was included in a volume of the famous series Unknown Soldier about the war in Uganda, published in the United States by Vertigo/DC Comics . He was also selected with nine other artists to collaborate on a special edition of Colors international magazine about Super Heroes (March 2011). Pat, on your blog you wrote \u201cle soleil brille\u201d, the sun is shining, but it can\u2019t have been easy getting this far in international comics publishing? It was hard because the world of European comics is a little closed. The publishers are hesitant about African authors, whose books may not sell well. I arrived in France as a refugee in 2002. As soon as I obtained my residence per- mit, I started to get small jobs as an illustrator and cartoonist. The turning point came with the publi- cation of \u201cRwanda 94\u201d, which received very positive reactions from the press and from the critics and consequently made me famous. What training do you have in comic art? After all, your studies were in architecture. I studied interior design in the Kinshasa Academy of Fine Art but my training in drawing comics started at the age of 12 when my art teacher encouraged me by giving me books, magazines and materials to work with. I published my first drawing at the age of 14, which was a compact disc cover, and so I gained confidence. While studying at the academy I attended painting and ceramics courses at a private studio. I also contacted the Saint Paul publish- ing house in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and got a contract for a nine-volume history of Jesus Christ (a book that is still being reprinted and dis- tributed throughout francophone West Africa). An art workshop at the French Cultural Centre was also important for my artistic development. You draw situations with meticulous realism. What are your influences? When I was in the DRC, my favour- ite author was Jean Giraud, but since I arrived in France I have had the oppor- tunity to see a number of different pub- lications. I am a fan of comics and follow everything that is \u201cjust published\u201d, where I find my inspiration. My style is evolving but is always recognizable. In the African comics landscape, Congolese authors are renowned for excellence in their craft. What are the reasons? Since 1953, we have had good arts schools in the DRC (formerly the Belgian Congo), but the biggest oppor- tunity arrived in 1968 with the publi- cation of the comic, Jeune pour Jeunes . Publishing professionally scripted black and white comic stories, the magazine was circulated widely throughout the country. As young artists, we enthusi- astically bought every issue. We copied the comics\u2019 drawings as well. Interview with Congolese comic author Pat Masioni In this respect, the cultural model of our colonizing country, Belgium, had a positive influence. In addition, different artists such as Barly Baruti, travelled to Europe and brought different meth- ods and ideas back to the Congo. At the moment, the DRC has a good and diversified comics publishing industry, with several associations, magazines, and festivals.
