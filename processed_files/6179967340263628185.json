        "Migrant integration Migrant integration is measured in terms of employment, health, education, social inclusion and active citizenship in the hosting country. A detailed analysis of integration indicators can be found in a series of specific articles on Statistics Explained, the official Eurostat website presenting statistical topics in an easily understandable way. The full list of articles can be accessed under the following URL: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/ Migrant_integration_statistics In order to achieve better comparability among EU Member States, the 2010 Zaragoza declaration agreed on a set of common indicators which were further developed in the study Indicators of immigrant integration \u2014 a pilot study of 2011 and analysed in the publication Migrants in Europe \u2014 A statistical portrait of the first and second generation. Besides the existing Zaragoza indicators, new indicators have been proposed in the report Using EU Indicators of Immigrant Integration \u2014 final report prepared for DG Migration and Home Affairs of 2013, with the objective of boosting the monitoring and assessment of the situation of migrants, along with the relative outcomes of integration policies. Migration statistics EU migration statistics are collected on an annual basis and are supplied to Eurostat by the national statistical authorities of the EU Member States. Since 2008 the collection of data has been based on Regulation 862/2007. This defines a core set of statistics on international migration flows, population stocks of foreigners, the acquisition of citizenship, residence permits, asylum and measures against illegal entry and stay. Although EU Member States may continue to use any appropriate data according to national availability and practice, the statistics collected under the Regulation must be based on common definitions and concepts. Most EU Member States base their statistics on administrative data sources such as population registers, registers of foreigners, registers of residence or work permits. Some EU Member States use sample surveys or estimation methods to produce migration statistics. More specifically, the data on the acquisition of citizenship are produced from administrative systems and provided to Eurostat by the EU Member States on an annual basis through the Joint Annual Migration Data Questionnaire. Residence permits data are also collected annually from administrative sources. As regards the dimensions of employment and education, the data are based on the results of the EU labour force survey (EU-LFS), while the EU statistics on income and living conditions (EU-SILC) covers topics relevant to social inclusion (see below). ",
        "Terminology The following terms are commonly used to describe various migrant groups. For the population by country of birth (COB): \u2022 Native-born: the population born in the reporting country; \u2022 Foreign-born: the population born outside the reporting country; \u2022 EU-born: the population born in the EU, except the reporting country; and \u2022 Non-EU-born: the population born outside the EU. For the population by citizenship (COC): \u2022 Nationals: the citizens of the reporting country; \u2022 Foreign citizens: the non-citizens of the reporting country; \u2022 EU citizens: the citizens of the EU Member States, except the reporting country; and \u2022 Non-EU citizens: the non- citizens of the EU Member States. Data Data used for the indicators on migrant integration come mainly from the EU labour force survey (EU-LFS) for employment and education indicators and the EU statistics on income and living conditions survey (EU-SILC) for social inclusion and health, complemented by administrative data sources such as population registers, registers of foreigners, and registers of residence or work permits (for naturalisation rates). Foreign population by COB is the population most commonly described as migrants, as these persons have migrated to their current country of residence at some stage during their lives. It includes persons with foreign citizenship as well as persons with the citizenship of their country of residence, either from birth or acquired later in life. Foreign population by COC are foreign citizens residing in the EU Member States and EFTA countries. As citizens of another country, the members of this group are in a different situation than nationals with regard to their legal rights. This is particularly the case for non- EU citizens (third-country nationals). Persons in this group may have migrated into their country of current residence or may have been born there. ",
        "The data analyses in the Eurostat articles on migrant integration are performed either by COB or COC, based on data availability and reliability per case. The data are generally presented for the following age categories: \u2022 20\u201364: this group has been selected because it is relevant to the first Europe 2020 target (employment of 75 % of this population by 2020); \u2022 25\u201354: this is considered as the most appropriate group for the analysis of the situation of migrants of working age, as it minimises the effect of migration for non-economic reasons (e.g. study or retirement) and forms a more homogeneous group, large enough to produce reliable results; and \u2022 55\u201364: this age group focuses on the older migrants \u2014 caution is however needed for the interpretation of the results, due to small sample sizes. Additionally Eurostat produces statistics on a range of migrant integration issues such as education, active citizenship, social inclusion and employment. EU-SILC The EU statistics on income and living conditions (EU-SILC) survey is the main source for the compilation of statistics on income, social inclusion and living conditions in the EU Member States as well as in Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, Serbia and Turkey. It provides comparable micro data on people at risk of poverty or social exclusion (AROPE), income distribution and monetary poverty, living conditions and material deprivation.

        "EU-LFS The EU labour force survey (LFS) is a large quarterly sample survey that covers the resident population aged 15 and above in private households in the EU, EFTA (except Liechtenstein) and candidate countries. It provides detailed quarterly data on employment and unemployment, broken down along many dimensions, including age, gender and educational attainment. Regulations set by the European Council, the European Parliament and the European Commission define how the LFS is carried out, whereas some countries have their own national legislation for the implementation of this survey. The LFS is an important source of information on the structure and trends of the EU labour market. The 2014 EU labour force survey (EU-LFS) ad hoc module on the labour market situation of migrants and their immediate descendants is a considerable source of data on the labour status of migrants. The variables were collected for all persons in the household in the target group age (15\u201364). Data on the country of birth of the father and the mother enable the identification of second-generation migrants.
