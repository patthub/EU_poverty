        "3 The EU-Africa summit in December 2007 in Lisbon marks the beginning of a new era in the relationship of our two continents. As direct neighbours and bound together by historical, political and economic ties and on the basis of common values, we - Africans and Europeans - have decided to use the enormous potential of our partnership to jointly fi nd answers to the common challenges of today\u2019s globalised world. The Joint Strategy and the First Action Plan for the period 2008 to 2010 are the proof that we do not want to do business as usual anymore. The two documents have not only been worked out in a truly joint eff ort. They also defi ne objectives that go beyond the traditional relationship. Of course, the EU will remain the most important development partner of Africa. But EU/Africa cooperation becomes more of a \u201ctwo-way road\u201d, where both sides benefi t in social, economic and political terms. In the future the EU and Africa will systematically and jointly address common challenges such as migration, energy and security, and to work together on global issues such as climate change, trade, human rights and HIV/Aids. Africa and the EU are fully committed to produce measurable results in the next three years. But only with a combined eff ort of all interested actors, including individual Member States, Parliaments and non-institutional actors will we be able to deliver real progress. To the benefi t of the peoples in Africa and in Europe.

        "9 The Lisbon Summit, bringing together the European Union and Africa, has off ered us a unique opportunity jointly to address the common contemporary challenges for our continents, in the year that we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the European integration and the 50th anniversary of the beginning of the independence of Africa. We have come together in awareness of the lessons and experiences of the past, but also in the certainty that our common future requires an audacious approach, one that allows us to face with confi dence the demands of our globalizing world. Since our fi rst gathering in 2000 in Cairo, much has changed. In Africa we have witnessed the creation of the African Union, which off ers a new continental framework for addressing African issues and has become a recognised voice for the continent, and of its economic instrument, NEPAD. In Europe, the EU has grown in membership and scope, deepening its process of integration and acquiring new responsibilities in the world. On a global scale, we have today an increased understanding of our vital interdependence and are determined to work together in the global arena on the key political challenges of our time, such as energy and climate change, migration or gender issues. In recognition of our ambitions, and of all that we share today and have shared in the past, we are resolved to build a new strategic political partnership for the future, overcoming the traditional donor- recipient relationship and building on common values and goals in our Lisbon Declaration - EU Africa Summit (Lisbon, 8-9 December, 2007) EN812676.indd 9 EN812676.indd 9 24/12/08 11:09:17 24/12/08 11:09:17 ",

We will develop this partnership of equals, based on the eff ective engagement of our societies, in order to achieve signifi cant results in our fundamental commitments, namely: the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals; the establishment of a robust peace and security architecture in Africa; the strengthening of investment, growth and prosperity through regional integration and closer economic ties; the promotion of good governance and human rights; and the creation of opportunities for shaping global governance in an open and multilateral framework. We are determined to give this new strategic partnership the necessary means and instruments that will enable it to fulfi l the Joint Strategy and the Action Plan that we have adopted today, and to do so we have created a comprehensive and eff ective follow-up mechanism that can deliver on these goals and show us the results on the occasion of the Third Summit that shall be held in 2010. We believe that this Summit will be remembered as a moment of recognition of maturity and transformation in our continent to continent dialogue, opening new paths and opportunities for collective action for our common future.

        "11 I. CONTEXT, SHARED VISION AND PRINCIPLES 1. Context Africa and Europe are bound together by history, culture, geography, a common future, as well as by a community of values: the respect for human rights, freedom, equality, solidarity, justice, the rule of law and democracy as enshrined in the relevant international agreements and in the constitutive texts of our respective Unions. Since the historic fi rst Africa-EU Summit in Cairo in 2000, where our partnership was strengthened through the institutionalisation of our dialogue, considerable change has taken place on both continents. Democratisation and reform processes have been launched and are being deepened in both Africa and Europe and eff orts have continued on both continents to address confl ict and crisis situations. At the same time, integration processes on both continents have accelerated \u2013 on the Headquarters of the African Union, Addis Ababa \u00a9 African Union EN812676.indd 11 EN812676.indd 11 24/12/08 11:09:20 24/12/08 11:09:20 ",
        "12 one hand, the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) has been transformed into the African Union (AU) with its socio-economic programme, the New Partnership for Africa\u2019s Development (NEPAD); on the other hand, the European Union (EU) has nearly doubled in size and is in the process of deepening the Union. The world has also changed: new international and global challenges have emerged, globalisation has accelerated and the world has become increasingly interdependent. In response to these changes, cooperation between Africa and the EU has rapidly developed and diversifi ed. Both sides have developed political strategies and policy documents to guide their cooperation, including the AU Constitutive Act and Strategic Framework 2004-2007 and the EU Africa Strategy of 2005. However, it is now time for these two neighbours, with their rich and complex history, to forge a new and stronger partnership that builds on their new identities and renewed institutions, capitalises on the lessons of the past and provides a solid framework for long-term, systematic and well integrated cooperation. There is now a need for a new phase in the Africa-EU relationship, a new strategic partnership and a Joint Africa-EU Strategy as a political vision and roadmap for the future cooperation between the two continents in existing and new areas and arenas. 2. Shared Vision The purpose of this Joint Strategy is to take the Africa-EU relationship to a new, strategic level with a strengthened political partnership and enhanced cooperation at all levels. The partnership will be based on a Euro-African consensus on values, common interests and common strategic objectives. This partnership should strive to bridge the development divide between Africa and Europe through the strengthening of economic cooperation and the promotion of sustainable development in both continents, living side by side in peace, security, prosperity, solidarity and human dignity.

        "13 This Joint Strategy, which will provide an overarching long-term framework for Africa-EU relations, will be implemented through successive short-term Action Plans and enhanced political dialogue at all levels, resulting in concrete and measurable outcomes in all areas of the partnership. 3. Principles This partnership and its further development will be guided by the fundamental principles of the unity of Africa, the interdependence between Africa and Europe, ownership and joint responsibility, and respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law, as well as the right to development. In the light of this new partnership, both sides also commit themselves to enhance the coherence and eff ectiveness of existing agreements, policies and instruments. The partnership will furthermore be governed by strengthened political dialogue, co-management and co-responsibility in our bilateral cooperation and towards global issues, burden-sharing and mutual accountability, solidarity and mutual confi dence, equality and justice, common and human security, respect for international law and agreements, gender equality and non-discrimination and, not least, a long-term approach.

        "14 T he four main objectives of this long-term strategic partnership are: i. To reinforce and elevate the Africa-EU political partnership to address issues of common concern. This includes strengthening of institutional ties and addressing common challenges, in particular peace and security, migration and development, and a clean environment. To this end, both sides will treat Africa as one and upgrade the Africa-EU political dialogue to enable a strong and sustainable continent-to-continent partnership, with the AU and the EU at the centre. ii. To strengthen and promote peace, security, democratic governance and human rights, fundamental freedoms, gender equality, sustainable economic development, including industrialisation, and regional and continental integration in Africa, and to ensure that all the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are met in all African countries by the year of 2015. iii. To jointly promote and sustain a system of eff ective multilateralism, with strong, representative and legitimate institutions, and the reform of the United Nations (UN) system and of other key international institutions, and to address global challenges and common concerns such as human rights, including children\u2019s rights and gender equality, fair trade, migration, HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and other pandemics, climate change, energy security and sustainability, terrorism, the proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction and the illicit traffi cking of Small Arms and Light Weapons, and knowledge-based society issues such as ICT, science, technology and innovation.

        "15 iv. To facilitate and promote a broad-based and wide-ranging people- centred partnership, Africa and the EU will empower non-state actors 1 and create conditions to enable them to play an active role in development, democracy building, confl ict prevention and post-confl ict reconstruction processes. Both sides will also promote holistic approaches to development processes, and make this Joint Strategy a permanent platform for information, participation and mobilisation of a broad spectrum of civil society actors in the EU, Africa and beyond. Ongoing dialogue with civil society, the private sector and local stakeholders on issues covered by this Joint S t r a t e g y will be a key c o m p o n e n t to ensure its implementation.

        "16 I n order to meet these fundamental objectives, Africa and the EU will need to jointly address a number of key political challenges that are essential for the success of the new partnership, including: a) To move away from a traditional relationship and forge a real partnership characterised by equality and the pursuit of common objectives. b) To build on positive experiences and lessons learned from our past relationship where successful mechanisms and instruments have been applied in specifi c policy areas and learn from shortcomings in other areas. c) To promote more accurate images of each other, in place of those that are dominated by inherited negative stereotypes and that ignore the overwhelmingly positive developments on the two continents. d) To encourage mutual understanding between the peoples and cultures of the two continents and promote better and more systematic use of our shared cultural and social heritage and our cultural diversity, as well as the economic wealth and opportunities that exist in Europe and Africa. e) To recognise and fully support Africa\u2019s eff orts and leadership to create conducive conditions for sustainable social and economic development and the eff ective implementation of partner-supported development programmes and to, in this context, underline the importance of strong African political commitment and III.

        "18 1. Strategic Framework The four main objectives of this long-term strategic partnership set the comprehensive framework within which specifi c strategies will have to be put in place in the following areas: (a) peace and security, (b) governance and human rights, (c) trade and regional integration and (d) key development issues. In the implementation of this new partnership, the principle of policy coherence for development will be applied by both African and EU partners by identifying and promoting interactions and positive complementarities between sectoral policies and strategies, while ensuring that measures taken in one policy area do not undermine results in other areas. 2. Strategic Priorities In order to meet our objectives, Africa and the EU will need to take concrete action and to make signifi cant progress in the following strategic inter-related priority areas: a ) Peace and Security: Promoting a Safer World Due to their history and experience, Africa and Europe understand the importance of peace and security as preconditions for political, economic and social development. On this basis, the two continents have laid the foundation for successful cooperation based on the need to promote holistic approaches to security, encompassing confl ict prevention and long-term peace-building, confl ict resolution and post-confl ict recon- struction, linked to governance and sustainable development, with a view to addressing the root causes of confl icts.

        "19 However, there is today a clear determination by both Africa and the EU to bring this partnership to a new and strategic level, not only to foster peace and security in both continents, but also to address issues of common concern in the global arena. Promotion of Peace, Security and Stability in Africa and Europe \u2022 At the core of the partnership between Africa and the EU is the need for a strengthened dialogue and institutional cooperation that not only addresses issues of peace and stability in Africa, but also challenges that Europe is facing. The two sides therefore undertake to share information, perspectives and lessons learned, as well as to consult on issues of common concern. Not only will this enhance the ability of both continents to respond timely and appropriately to peace and security threats, but it will also facilitate the coordination of eff orts in relevant international fora, in particular the United Nations Security Council. Under the leadership of the AU, the African Peace and Security Architecture (APSA) is taking shape.

        "20 regional and national levels. Continentally or regionally sponsored peace agreements are the norm on the continent today, and most African countries now enjoy peace and stability. The EU has been a key partner for African countries and organisations to help create conditions for lasting peace and stability. In view of their expertise, fi nancial and human resources and experience, the EU and its Member States are well placed to provide continued and increased support for the AU in its eff orts to \u2013 in cooperation with the relevant African regional organisations \u2013 operationalise the APSA, including through long-term capacity building for the various structures provided therein, including the Continental Early Warning System, the Panel of the Wise, and the African Standby Force. The AU Peace and Security Council (PSC) will play a key coordinating role in this process. This support will, moreover, aim at facilitating the implementation of other relevant AU instruments such as the Policy on Post-Confl ict Reconstruction and Development, the Declaration on the Border Program and relevant instruments on disarmament issues. In this context, eff orts will be made to ensure coherence with wider international eff orts. EU support to Africa has been and continues to be guided by the principle of African ownership. At the same time, valuable guidance for the cooperation will, as appropriate, be drawn from the EU Concept for Strengthening African Capabilities for the Prevention, Management and Resolution of Confl icts and relevant parts of the EU Joint Policy Framework on Security Sector Reform and the EU Concept on Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration, and from lessons learned from the implementation of the African Peace Facility (APF), and from wider international experience. EU support will be provided through a number of diff erent instruments, in particular the capacity building component of the APF, EU crisis management instruments as well as other EU programmes, such as Euro-RECAMP, and through bilateral Member States\u2019 support. Building capacity should go hand in hand with contributing to adequate, coherent and sustainable fi nancing of the activities undertaken by the AU and the Regional Mechanisms for Confl ict Prevention, Management EN812676.indd 20 EN812676.indd 20 24/12/08 11:09:32 24/12/08 11:09:32 ",
        "21 and Resolution, both with respect to civilian crisis management and post-confl ict reconstruction and development. Sustainable, predictable and fl exible funding for African-led peace support operations is another major challenge. The APF has made a substantial contribution and is a good example of how partner support can complement and reinforce African funding for African-led peace support operations, including from the AU Peace Fund. However, experience over the past years has clearly shown that additional fi nancial support is urgently needed, together with sound and accountable management systems. The EU is committed to taking steps towards establishing a predictable and sustainable funding mechanism, building on the experience of the APF and EU Member States\u2019 bilateral contributions, as well as on the determination of Africa to raise additional resources from within the continent. At the same time, the EU will back Africa\u2019s eff orts to widen the funding base and mobilise additional resources from G8 and other international partners. Africa and the EU will also work together for the establishment, within the context of Chapter VIII of the UN Charter, of a UN mechanism to provide predictable, fl exible and sustainable funding for peace keeping operations undertaken by the AU, or under its authority, and with the consent of the UN Security Council. Africa and the EU together commit themselves to support and promote the role of civil society and non-state actors in underpinning a comprehensive approach, emphasising the importance of confl ict sensitivity. The two sides also commit themselves to the implementation of UN Security Council Resolutions 1325 on Women in Peace and Security and 1612 on Children in Armed Confl icts. Common and Global Peace and Security Challenges \u2022 While today\u2019s global environment has opened up new opportunities to enhance international peace and security, it has also come with new security challenges, which in a world of increasing interdependence and close links between the internal and external aspects of security, only EN812676.indd 21 EN812676.indd 21 24/12/08 11:09:33 24/12/08 11:09:33 ",

Issues relating to transnational organised crime, international terrorism, mercenary activities, and human and drugs traffi cking, as well as the illicit trade in natural resources, which are a major factor in triggering and spreading confl icts and undermining state structures, are of particular concern. It is also recognised that the illicit proliferation, accumulation and traffi cking of Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) and their ammunition, explosive remnants of war and the continued use of anti-personnel landmines, are all major common concerns, as is the issue of the proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDs). Africa and the EU will work together on all these issues, and seek to promote, as appropriate, the adoption of multilateral, regional and national instruments, and support the implementation of commitments made, including in the context of UN Security Council Resolutions. This cooperation, which will include matters relating to counter-terrorism, will take place through the exchange of information, law enforcement and institutional capacity building and judicial cooperation.

        "23 Furthermore, over the past years a number of new global, and human security challenges have emerged, relating to issues such as climate change, environmental degradation, water management, toxic waste deposits and pandemics. There is a need for Africa and the EU to deepen their knowledge of the security challenges involved and jointly identify responses that could be formulated towards, and together with, the larger international community. Looking beyond Africa and the EU, the two sides will also coordinate their actions and bring their infl uence to bear in the search for lasting solutions to crises and confl icts in other parts of the world that undermine international peace and security, in particular in the Middle East region. b) Governance and Human Rights: Upholding our Values and Principles Common and Global Governance and Human \u2022 Rights Challenges The promotion of democratic governance and human rights constitutes a central feature of the Africa-EU dialogue and partnership. The two continents will join eff orts towards the enhancement of the eff ectiveness of the multilateral system and the promotion of the values of democracy, rule of law and human rights. In this regard, the Africa-EU strategic partnership will facilitate an open, intensive and comprehensive dialogue on all aspects and concepts of governance, including human rights, childrens\u2019 rights, gender equality, democratic principles, the rule of law, local governance, the management of natural resources, the transparent and accountable management of public funds, institutional development and reform, human security, security sector reform, the fi ght against corruption, corporate social responsibility, and institution building and development. This dialogue should help both parties to defi ne the issues at stake, agree on common positions on issues of common concern and jointly undertake specifi c initiatives and actions.

        "24 In the context of situations of confl ict, crisis, instability, severe democratic defi cit, and/or institutional weakness, and on the basis of discussions in various international fora, Africa and the EU will also hold a dialogue on the concept of \u00absituations of fragility\u00bb aimed at reaching a common understanding and agreeing on steps that could be taken. With regard to human rights, Africa and the EU will work together to protect and promote the human rights of all people in Africa and Europe, including through enhanced dialogue between relevant institutions from both continents, such as the European Court of Human Rights of the Council of Europe, the African Court on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and the African Commission on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights, the African Committee on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, and African and European national human rights institutions. Similarly, Africa and the EU will also work together on a global level and international fora, including in the UN Human Rights Council, for the promotion and protection of human rights and international humanita- rian law and for the eff ective implementation of international and regional human rights instruments. Both sides also commit themselves to Human Rights Council, Geneva \u00a9 U N / J e a n - M a r c F e r r e EN812676.indd 24 EN812676.indd 24 24/12/08 11:09:34 24/12/08 11:09:34 ",

The most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole, especially crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide, should not go unpunished and their prosecution should be ensured by measures at both domestic and international level. In this context, the partners agree that the establishment and the eff ective functioning of the International Criminal Court constitute an important development for peace and international justice. Africa and the EU stress the importance of having a better knowledge of African cultural goods and call for the exchange of information between EU and African countries on existing African cultural goods in the EU and Africa. Africa and the EU will continue to cooperate in the fi ght against the illicit trade in cultural goods, and facilitate and support the return of illegally acquired cultural goods to their countries of origin, as set out in the relevant UNESCO and UNIDROIT conventions and other commonly agreed legal instruments. Africa and the EU will also cooperate through the exchange of best practices and lessons learned, by raising public awareness and by providing capacity building in, and technical assistance to, African countries. Cooperation between Africa and the EU on Democratic \u2022 Governance The AU is putting into place a new pan-African governance architecture and Africa is developing its public and private institutional capacity at all levels \u2013 national, regional and continental. In this context, the EU is committed to supporting institutional development, knowledge-sharing and capacity-building. EU support, based on dialogue and incentives, will build on the approach followed to integrate governance in the EDF programming, under the Governance Initiative, under which additional funding is provided to partner countries committed to engaging in reforms. EU support provided will apply the principle of African and local ownership and should follow African agendas. EN812676.indd 25 EN812676.indd 25 24/12/08 11:09:37 24/12/08 11:09:37 ",
        "26 Two particularly promising cases of Africa-owned governance reform programmes and democracy-building eff orts are the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM) and the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance. To support the APRM process and the implementation of the Charter, and more broadly the pan-African governance architecture, the EU will set up an instrument that takes into account the positive experience with the African Peace Facility and which combines strong African ownership of programme design and implementation with provisions for strategic and political EU-level involvement. Specifi c support and cooperation are foreseen with the African Court for Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights, the African Commission for Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights, the Pan-African Parliament and the AU Economic, Social and Cultural Council (ECOSOCC). Africa and the EU will together support the strengthening of the rule of law in Africa, through enhanced support for national Human Rights Commissions, national Parliaments and independent electoral commissions, as well as civil society organisations. The AU and EU will also work together to support democratic elections in accordance with international and regional standards, including the AU standards for elections, through election assistance and electoral observation. To that end they will strive to reinforce the role of the AU, the regional organisations and of civil society in election observation in line with the UN-endorsed Declaration of Principles for International Election Observation of 2005 and the Durban Declaration on the Principles Guiding Democratic Elections in Africa. Africa and the EU will enhance cooperation in the context of international initiatives to counter the illicit trade and to promote the transparent and equitable management of natural resources, such as the Kimberley certifi cation process, the Forest Law Enforcement Governance and Trade (FLEGT) and the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI). Africa and the EU will also, together, address issues relating to the fi ght against corruption, bribery, counterfeiting, money-laundering, tax-fraud, as well as other aspects of economic governance. In this context, both sides will EN812676.indd 26 EN812676.indd 26 24/12/08 11:09:37 24/12/08 11:09:37 ",

On all these issues, Africa and the EU recognise that civil society, the media and democratic institutions have important roles to play in ensuring transparency and accountability. c) Trade and Regional Integration: Raising Potential and Using Opportunities The improvement of economic governance and the investment climate are essential elements to build Africa\u2019s economic strength and allow Africa to move away from continuous donor support and fi nd its place in global markets. In this regard, the development of domestic markets and regional integration are key in creating larger and more integrated markets that, in conjunction with enhanced regulatory convergence, will help to attract investment, increase productive capacities and therefore foster sustainable economic growth and development. One of the priorities of the Africa-EU partnership will be to help Africa improve its productive capacities, move up the value-added scale and become less dependent on raw materials and simple processed products, which in the long term is the best way to avoid a deterioration of the terms of trade and participate in, and benefi t from, the global economy. Africa and the EU will also, together with other international partners, work to promote fair trade. In order to achieve this, the key goals which will be pursued by Africa-EU cooperation on trade and regional integration will be: (i) private sector development, supported by foreign investments, to strengthen the supply side of African economies; (ii) the development and strengthening of physical infrastructure networks and related services, which are needed for the movement of persons, goods, information; and (iii) trade integration, which is essential to increase both South-South and North-South trade fl ows.

        "28 Private Sector Development du secteur priv\u00e9 \u2022 The promotion of an investment and business friendly environment is a core prerequisite for the development of the private sector, within the framework of a stable political environment and governance-related reform. These eff orts should be underpinned by appropriate African economic growth strategies aiming at maintaining macroeconomic stability, promoting regulatory reform and harmonisation, protecting intellectual property rights and standards, promoting investment codes, and establishing credible laws and guarantee systems. In this context, it will also be necessary to address key investment disincentives such as fraud, corruption, money laundering and organised crime. Cooperation between Africa and the EU in this fi eld will aim to promote stable, effi cient and harmonised legal frameworks for business, free of unnecessary administrative red tape, as well as to promote Corporate Social Responsibility. Both sides will cooperate on technology development and transfer, quality infrastructure and skills development in support of the industrialisation process. It will also aim at enhancing appropriate Mr Alpha Oumar Konar\u00e9, President of the Commission of the AU, and Mr Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, President of the European Commission \u00a9 E C EN812676.indd 28 EN812676.indd 28 24/12/08 11:09:38 24/12/08 11:09:38 ",

The partnership will, furthermore, contribute to the facilitation and strengthening of the dialogue between, and within, governments and with the private sector on both continents via appropriate continental and regional networks. In this regard, the EU-Africa Business Forum will play a key role in bringing together entrepreneurs and public and private in- vestors from both Europe and Africa in order to discuss ways of improving the investment and business climate and to raise the profi le of doing business in Africa. Trade and Integration \u2022 In line with the Abuja Treaty, establishing the African Economic Community, trade and integration are recognised as essential components of the wider process of regional integration and development, which shall be duly promoted by the present partnership. Regional Economic Communities will play an essential role as building blocks of the continental integration process. In order to do so, Africa and the EU will work together to make trade rules and regimes more coherent and harmonised. This will require the gradual harmonisation of trade, customs and industrial policies, laws, regulations and procedures. Africa and the EU will cooperate to put in place programmes and mechanisms to develop norms, standards and quality control at regional and pan-African levels with reference to international standards. One key area will be regulations and technical standards, including sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures. It is widely recognised that meeting international SPS standards is a key component for advancing the competitiveness and market access of African agriculture and food processing industry. Improving African standards will therefore enable EN812676.indd 29 EN812676.indd 29 24/12/08 11:09:40 24/12/08 11:09:40 ",

Both sides will continue to promote market access for African goods and services to international markets, in particular the EU market. Another key area will be enhancing pharmaceutical production capacities in accordance with international rules on good manufacturing practices (GMPs) and effi cient regulatory procedures, including the control of counterfeit medicines and of other products, while promoting access to aff ordable essential generic medicines, vaccines and commodities for major prevailing diseases and epidemics. In this regard, the capacity of African countries to make full use of fl exibilities in TRIPs, in line with the Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Plan for Africa, will be developed. A third key area will be preferential market access for environmentally friendly technologies and products. Africa-EU cooperation will be underpinned by stronger bilateral development- oriented trading relationships between Africa and the EU: (i) through the implementation of Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) with African EPA regions (West Africa, Central Africa, Eastern and Southern Africa and the Southern African grouping), which involve the RECs and other African organisations 2 , and the implementation of the EU-Mediterranean Free Trade Agreement with the countries of North Africa, (ii) by supporting African business in its eff orts to meet EU norms and standards and to develop its productive capacity , and (iii) by cooperating in developing export strategies and business-to-business relations. The EPA-agreements, as instruments for development, are to be implemented at the sub-regional level, however, the AU-EU dialogue is relevant to the overall process of regional integration and interface with developing Regional Economic Communities. Both sides stress the need for the EPA process to be suppor-tive of Africa\u2019s regional and continental integration agenda on the basis of the Abuja Treaty. 2) The regional economic communities (RECs) and other organisations involved in the EPA negotiations are: ECOWAS, UEMOA, ECCAS, CEMAC, COMESA, SADC, SACU, EAS, EAC and IOC.

        "31 The above eff orts, in particular the EPA implementation process, as well as more general eff orts to better integrate into the rules-based world trading system and to more eff ectively use trade in the promotion of growth and the eradication of poverty, will be supported by the Community (EDF and other instruments) and EU Member States in accordance with the EU Aid for Trade Strategy, as well as by contributions from other development actors. In coherence with the eff orts to further integrate at sub-regional level, eff orts to better integrate at continental level will also be supported. At the global level, Africa and the EU will seek to promote global economic governance, and sustain Africa\u2019s eff orts to integrate into the world economy. To achieve this, the coordination of African and EU positions in international fora will be promoted. Africa and the EU will seek to join eff orts to conclude the Doha Development Agenda as soon as possible. This could involve, in particular, seeking common ground to address key issues for development, such as reductions in trade distorting subsidies, \u00a9 E C Intercontinental trade contributes to growth - the port of Hamburg EN812676.indd 31 EN812676.indd 31 24/12/08 11:09:41 24/12/08 11:09:41 ",
        "32 greater access to the markets of all WTO members, reductions in tariff peaks, better anti-dumping rules, as well as the implementation of reforms in view of facilitating trade and ensuring the security of the supply chain. In this context, Africa and the EU will cooperate to build technical and institutional capacity for negotiations in trade and related areas, such as quality and food safety, industrial goods, TBT/SPS and commodities issues in order to promote African trade and safeguard the health and rights of consumers. Finally, Africa and the EU will strengthen their cooperation in the fi eld of statistics with the aim of helping policy makers and other users of statistics and enhancing ongoing eff orts in the coordination and harmonisation of statistics in Africa within the framework of the African Charter for Statistics. d) Key Development Issues: Accelerating Progress towards the MDGs For the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to be achieved, African countries need to sustain economic growth and equitable social development, and both Africa and the EU have to boost their investments, better focus their policies and deliver on the promises made. Mid-way between 2000 and 2015, supporting Africa\u2019s eff orts to achieve the MDGs remains the key challenge for the EU\u2019s external and development cooperation policy vis-\u00e0-vis the continent. In this regard, eff orts should focus on making a key contribution to the achievement of the 8 MDGs on (1) poverty and hunger, (2) universal primary education, (3) gender equality and empowerment of women, (4) child mortality, (5) maternal health, (6) HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases, (7) environmental sustainability, and (8) the development of a partnership for development.

        "33 Development Cooperation \u2022 In order to achieve the objectives set out in the present Joint Strategy, partners should urgently work on more predictable and less volatile aid, focusing on results. The EU therefore reaffi rms its determination to reach the targets agreed in the context of the Monterrey consensus in May 2005 to increasing ODA volume to individually achieve 0.51% ODA/GNI for those Member States which joined the EU before 2002; to strive to achieve 0.17% for those Member States which joined the EU after 2002 within their respective budget allocation processes, and collectively achieve 0.56% ODA/GNI by 2010 as an intermediate step towards achieving the UN target of 0.7% by 2015. By 2010, attaining the 0.56% ODA/GNI should correspond to at least an additional \u20ac20 billion in ODA per year, and no less than 50% of this increase will benefi t the African continent. The EU will respect and implement these commitments and will take appropriate measures to guarantee a timely delivery of aid commitments towards Africa. Partners will also make further eff orts to keep debt at sustainable levels and, where debt becomes unsustainable, consider debt cancellation in the framework of existing initiatives and fora. Africa and the EU will also strengthen their cooperation in the implementation of the Paris Declaration on aid eff ectiveness. They will further promote alignment and harmonisation of development aid instruments, increase the use of general and sectoral budget support where circumstances permit, and cooperate closely to implement the EU\u2019s commitments to promote complementarity and division of labour. The predictability of development aid should be promoted and the EU will work toward a limitation of conditionalities and further move towards result-oriented aid, with a clear link with MDG indicators and performance. In this context, Africa and the EU will also improve and expand their cooperation in the fi eld of statistics so that policies and decisions are made on the basis of clear evidence.

        "34 Moreover, the two sides fully recognise that development cooperation alone is not enough to achieve these objectives and that non-aid policies on both sides need to be better geared towards attaining the MDGs, including by enhancing Policy Coherence for Development (PCD). To this end, the EU and the AU will discuss how the coherence between policies and initiatives with development objectives could be enhanced, on the basis of stronger commitments on both sides. In order to ensure coherence and complementarity with the work of other international actors, including emerging partners, Africa and the EU recognise the need to broaden their cooperation with third partners through enhanced tripartite dialogue. Similarly, both parties recognise the importance of triangular cooperation for the development of the two continents . 3 . Human and Social Development \u2022 Employment issues, notably social protection, the shortage of employment opportunities and the promotion of decent work in Africa, will be jointly addressed, with priority being given to creating productive jobs in the formal economy, improving poor living and working conditions in line with the UN decent work agenda and integrating the informal economy into the formal. Investments in private sector development will be promoted, looking in particular to youth and women. The service sector will be further developed as this is where women and youth are mostly involved. Africa and the EU will make technology work for employment, and will ensure that infrastructure works to create jobs for Africans, both skilled and unskilled. In addition, attention will be paid to the creation of jobs through micro-fi nance schemes. As generally disadvantaged groups often benefi t substantially from such microfi nance schemes they should be actively pursued. 3) In the context of this Joint Strategy, triangular cooperation refers to the implemen- tation of a project for the development of an African country with the technical involvement of another African country and with fi nancial and/or other input from the EU side, or vice versa.

Special eff orts will be made to assist youth and children in (post-) confl ict situations. All these measures will be supported by predictable long-term fi nancing. Moreover, partners insist on the urgent need to strengthen not only basic education but entire education systems, at all levels. Africa and the EU will together work towards ensuring long-term predictable funding for national education plans to help ensure quality education for all and that all girls and boys attend and complete school, including through the Education for All Fast Track Initiative and the implementation of the Plan of Action for the Second Decade of Education for Africa. Particular attention will be given to the inclusion of hard-to-reach children and children and youth with disabilities. \u00a9 E C A joint priority for Africa and the EU: to ensure that all girls and boys attend and complete school EN812676.indd 35 EN812676.indd 35 24/12/08 11:09:44 24/12/08 11:09:44 ",

Africa and the EU will therefore support the recruitment, retention and training of teaching staff , as well as a general valorisation of the teaching profession. A further priority is to ensure that \u2018there are jobs behind the education\u2019 and an increased responsiveness of training to the needs of the economic sectors. Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) and skills development with the involvement of the productive sectors will also be promoted. Furthermore, building upon the 2007 Addis Ababa Declaration on Science Technology and Scientifi c Research for Development, Africa and the EU shall strengthen their cooperation in these areas. In this context, attention will also be paid to space-based technology, applications and sciences. In the fi eld of health, integrated strategies, including the strengthening of national health systems at all levels, will be promoted by Africa and the EU, based on adequate fi nancing, human resources and commodities. To reinforce health system capacity, partners will also jointly address both the migration of health workers, which is a crisis in some African countries, and the creation or reinforcement of social protection systems. Eff orts will be made in line with the Africa Health Strategy, the EU Project on Human Resources for Health, the Abuja commitment (15% fi nancing for health) and the European Programme for Action to Tackle the Shortage of Health Workers in Developing Countries. Eff orts to scale up towards universal access to basic health services, HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis Malaria prevention, treatment, care and support by 2010, and cooperation on other pandemics as well as on issues relating to meningitis, will be intensifi ed, with special focus on women, children and adolescents, older and disabled persons as well as members of vulnerable groups.

Africa and the EU will, in addition, promote further research, particularly for vaccines and new medicines for both major and neglected diseases, and on issues relating to water-borne diseases, as well as on the clinical eff ectiveness of traditional medicine. Partners will also work towards eff ective implementation of international health agreements and regulations. Other issues of common interest, such as the abuse of narcotic drugs and the preparedness and responses for emergencies, should be addressed. Special attention will be given to fi ghting malnutrition in Africa, in line with the Africa Regional Nutrition Strategy. Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR) will be promoted with the aim of achieving universal access to reproductive health by 2015 and to reduce newborn, infant and maternal morbidity and mortality, as set out by the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) and the Maputo Plan of Action, in the context of the Action Plans of this Joint Strategy. Gender Equality \u2022 Africa and the EU will also strengthen the inter-institutional fabric of their administrations to mainstream gender equality in all strategies, policies, programmes and actions. They will address the entire range of women\u2019s rights and strengthen their eff orts to eliminate illiteracy and to ensure equal access of girls to education, to fi ght the feminisation of poverty, to promote women in decision-making positions and peace processes, and fi ght sexual and gender based violence against women and early forced marriage, and work towards the abandonment of female genital mutilation and cutting (FGM/C) and other harmful traditional practices, as set out in the Beijing Platform for Action and the AU Solemn Declaration on Gender Equality.

        "38 Environmental Sustainability and Climate Change \u2022 Africa and the EU have a clear common interest to address environmental sustainability and climate change. Environmental degradation and climate change undermine sustainable development and represent threats to the achievement of the MDGs. Climate change is aff ecting all countries, but will be most immediately and severely felt in the poorest and most vulnerable countries, which do not have the means and resources to adapt to the changes in their natural environment. Africa will be particularly hit in terms of food security, water management and extreme weather phenomena such as drought, fl oods and cyclones. Africa-EU cooperation in this fi eld will link positively with economic growth, job creation, social stability, and the building of capacities for adaptation to, and mitigation of, negative eff ects of climate change. It will address interrelated areas such as food security, sustainable agriculture and land management and will cover a vast number of interrelated areas and issues such as land degradation, desertifi cation, the preservation of biodiversity, bio-safety issues including GMOs, prevention of toxic waste dumping, environmentally sound waste management, sustainable use and management of natural resources including forest, fi sh stocks and integrated water management, weather observation and early warning systems to improve disaster risk management. Africa and the EU will also work together in the global arena and international fora to eff ectively respond and adapt to climate change and other global environmental challenges. In this context, the compliance with UN and other international agreements is of key importance and \u2013 following the December 2007 Bali conference \u2013 Africa and the EU will work together for an ambitious post-2012 climate framework. The EU will furthermore support Africa\u2019s capacity building eff orts in the sustainable management of natural resources, including on weather observation and early warning systems, as well as helping to tackle illegal logging EN812676.indd 38 EN812676.indd 38 24/12/08 11:09:46 24/12/08 11:09:46 ",

In this context, Africa and the EU should strengthen existing cooperation mechanisms and programmes relating to the use of space technologies and space-based systems. At the global level, the EU will promote a better geographical distribution of Clean Development Mechanism projects, helping Africa profi t from the global carbon market. Migration and Development \u2022 Migration and mobility are interwoven with the history of human development and should be treated as largely positive phenomena. Acknowledging this, Africa and the EU will pursue and implement policies and programmes that address all relevant dimensions of migration, including circular migration. These eff orts will aim to promote and better manage legal migration and mobility with a view to supporting the socio-economic development of both countries of origin and countries of destination. Africa and the EU will work to deepen their frank and constructive dialogue in taking forward the implementation of the Declaration adopted in November 2006 at the Tripoli EU-Africa Ministerial Conference on Migration and Development, and ongoing regional processes, which provide a comprehensive agenda for common action in the area of migration and development. Partners will foster the linkages between migration and development, maximise the development impact of remittances, facilitate the involvement of diasporas/migrant communities in development processes, promote the protection of the human rights of migrants, assist and protect asylum seekers and refugees and help countries of origin, transit and destination in Africa build capacity to better manage migration. Africa and the EU will also jointly address the down-sides of migration. This includes jointly combating illegal migration, where cooperation needs to be stepped up, including through cooperation on return and readmission of migrants in the context of the Tripoli Declaration and relevant international agreements, as well as on border control and traffi cking EN812676.indd 39 EN812676.indd 39 24/12/08 11:09:47 24/12/08 11:09:47 ",

Partners will also work to promote respect for the principles and provisions of the OAU Convention governing the specifi c aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa and the Geneva Convention on Refugees. Africa and the EU will pay particular attention to brain drain in sensitive sectors like health and education. Both sides commit themselves to ensure that adequate fi nancial resources are made available for the eff ective implementation of the measures outlined in the Tripoli Declaration. Legal migration and legal mobility support the socio- economic development of both countries of origin and countries of destination \u00a9 E C EN812676.indd 40 EN812676.indd 40 24/12/08 11:09:47 24/12/08 11:09:47 ",
        "41 Agriculture and Food Security \u2022 In the area of agriculture, Africa and the EU will promote policy coherence for development, food security, food safety and food quality; strengthen farmer organisations and inter-professional associations; improve policy and strategy development processes; increase domestic and foreign investment; promote diversifi cation in rural areas; strengthen livestock disease surveillance and control systems, including through fi ghting against the avian fl u; promote risk management approaches and the use of early-warning systems; strengthen capacity vis-\u00e0-vis regional and international trade and SPS standards, promote institutional reforms, strengthen agricultural research for development and make the best use of the opportunities opened up by advances in biotechnology. A new EU-AU partnership on agricultural development will support Africa\u2019s agricultural agenda, as set out in the Comprehensive Africa Agricultural Development Programme (CAADP). This includes putting emphasis on improved governance of agriculture and supporting capacity-building on the part of African public and private organisations involved in agriculture, particularly at regional and continental levels. It also includes a strong engagement in Africa\u2019s agricultural research for development agenda as coordinated by the Forum for Agricultural Research in Africa (FARA). African fi sheries resources, both coastal and inland, represent vital natural capital and a potential source of wealth able to contribute substantially and sustainably to economic growth and poverty reduction. As with agriculture, Africa and the EU will improve policy coherence for development, particularly related to fi sheries access arrangements, trade and controlling illegal, unregulated and unreported fi shing, notably through the Fisheries Partnership Agreements (FPAs). Africa and the EU will EN812676.indd 41 EN812676.indd 41 24/12/08 11:09:53 24/12/08 11:09:53 ",

Infrastructure \u2022 The promotion of interconnectivity of African infrastructure at all levels in line with AU/NEPAD priorities will be further advanced. In doing so, the two sides will make use and build upon the framework off ered by the 2006 EU-Africa Infrastructure Partnership and Trust Fund as well as the Pan-African Infrastructure Development Fund which set out the strategy for securing interconnectivity across the continent and its diff erent regions and for tackling the issue of delivery of infrastructure services. In line with the priorities identifi ed through the Infrastructure Partnership, the following goals shall be pursued: As regards transport, Africa and the EU will aim at increasing interconnectivity by investing in and improving infrastructure along the Trans-African road transport corridors and associated regional road and rail networks. Partners shall also focus on enhancing port effi ciency, and supporting measures for improving air and maritime safety and security. By supporting the removal of non-physical barriers to the free movement of goods, services and people through more rigorous implementation of regional protocols the Partnership shall also aim at improving transport services. As regards water, Africa and the EU acknowledge that in order for water to contribute fully to national development and local livelihoods, investment in regional hydraulic infrastructure needs to be increased. As regards energy, the two sides recognise that increased regional and continental interconnectivity is necessary for enhancing the reliability and effi ciency of energy systems. Partners will thus aim at improving energy infrastructure, in particular for electricity interconnections, agreements on joint standards and regulation procedures, as well as removing non-physical barriers for exchange of energy across borders.

        "43 Water and Sanitation \u2022 Water resource management and access to safe water and basic sanitation are crucial both for economic growth and poverty reduction and the achievement of the MDGs. Africa and the EU will therefore work together to further develop the existing EU-Africa Partnership on Water Aff airs and \u00a9 E C / G .

        "44 Sanitation with the overall objective to meet basic water and sanitation needs and contribute to improved water resource management at local, river basin and catchment, national and trans-boundary level. In addition, Africa and the EU will reinforce their joint eff orts to address the challenges of water security and climate change, sustainable access to safe aff ordable water supplies, hygiene education and sanitation. In this context, Africa and the EU will aim at mobilising increased investments for hydraulic infrastructure in Africa. Furthermore, they will promote the participation of other international partners in the dialogue on the sustainable use of Africa\u2019s water resources. Energy \u2022 The two sides recognise that the international energy challenges have created a need for Africa and the EU to give an even stronger focus to sustainable energy in their mutual relations. Both sides will therefore aim at strengthening cooperation and solidarity in the sustainable management of their energy resources and at continuing to promote access to energy, energy security and safety, and regional cooperation. To this end, the partners have agreed to establish the Africa-EU Energy Partnership, which will address the joint challenges of energy security and diversifi cation of supply, access to aff ordable, clean and effi cient energy services, new and renewable energy resources and climate change. Partners will furthermore aim at building capacity, at mobilising increased investments for energy infrastructure in Africa, including through the existing EU Energy Facility and other fi nancial instruments, and at including emerging donors in the dialogue on sustainable energy sector development in Africa.

        "45 Africa and the EU will also explore ways and means to launch a dialogue on the peaceful use of nuclear energy, within the framework of relevant International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) provisions and in line with international safety standards and rules. Development of Knowledge-based Societies \u2022 Africa and the EU will strengthen their cooperation in building knowledge- based societies and economies. Both sides recognise that the development of S&T and innovation is one of the essential engines of socio-economic growth and sustainable development in Africa; that competitiveness in the global economy is increasingly dependent on knowledge and innovative ways of applying modern technology, especially Information and Communication Technology (ICT); and that meeting the MDGs requires a special global eff ort to build scientifi c and technological capacities in Africa. Thus partnerships and investments advancing access to ICT infrastructure, access to quality education, and the development of science and technology and innovation systems in Africa are crucial for attaining all other development goals. Africa and the EU will strengthen their cooperation and support to bridge the digital divide and promote the development of an inclusive Knowledge Economy, including through the implementation of the outcome of the World Summit on Information Society and relevant AU/ NEPAD programmes. More specifi cally, in the area of ICT, Africa and the EU will aim at bridging the digital divide that limits access to modern telephony and internet services. It will address the harmonisation of policy and regulatory frameworks and investment in broadband infrastructure and support non-commercial e-services. EN812676.indd 45 EN812676.indd 45 24/12/08 11:09:58 24/12/08 11:09:58 ",
        "46 In parallel, similar eff orts will be made to address the scientifi c divide and increase Africa\u2019s research capacities. Inadequate technical capacity of Africa will be upgraded through the establishment of specialised networks in regions and sub-regions, which need to focus on identifi ed priorities so as to underpin economic growth and sustainable development of the African continent. In this respect, Africa and the EU will promote the strengthening of collaborative links between African regional and sub-regional partnerships and European partners, in order to contribute to the sustainability of established centres and networks of excellence. Cultural Cooperation \u2022 A stronger political partnership between Africa and the EU should be underpinned by an equally strong partnership on cultural cooperation. All expressions of culture, including arts, multilingualism and sports, should be taken into account. Africa and the EU will therefore engage in an eff ective dialogue and cooperation on culture, promote cultural exchanges and twinning arrangements, and support capacity building and technical assistance on the protection and preservation of, and access to, cultural goods and sites in Europe and Africa. These eff orts will strengthen the safeguarding of African World Heritage sites, as well as the diversity of cultural expressions within the framework of relevant UNESCO conventions. In this context, the two sides will launch an inventory of ongoing cooperation on cultural goods issues with a view to identify potential areas of further cooperation. Furthermore, Africa and the EU will also \u2013 in the context of their development cooperation \u2013 fully take into account local culture and contribute to increase the access of people to culture and to means of cultural expression.

        "47 Communication \u2022 Africa and the EU recognise the need to better communicate with each other and to better promote the social and cultural values of the European and African peoples. In this regard, partners will also work towards the promotion of more accurate images of each other, and fi ght stereotypes, xenophobia and racism, through enhanced exchanges and contacts of non-state actors, including trade unions, professional associations, the private sector, media, schools, universities, research and cultural institutions, and sport clubs and associations, including through support for twinning arrangements between civil society organisations.

        "48 1. Institutional Architecture and Actors A frica and the EU will implement their new strategic partnership through an institutional architecture, which allows and promotes intensive exchange and dialogue on all issues of common concern. The partnership will involve a large number of institutional and non-institutional actors in Africa and the EU at continental, regional, national and local levels, with a central role of the AU and the EU. Partners will therefore place greater value on the role of their continental organisations in facilitating this partnership and task them to work closely together, including through more regular dialogue between corresponding AU and EU institutions, in the preparation and follow-up of decisions and meetings. The frequency of these meetings at political level, namely, of senior offi cials, Ministers and Heads of State and Government, will have to be enhanced in order to take forward the objectives of the Joint Strategy. It should be noted that this strategic partnership, and the eff ective implementation of the policies and actions outlined in the Joint Strategy, are also the shared responsibility of all African and EU states. Regular Africa-EU Summits \u2022 In the future, starting from the Lisbon Summit, meetings of the Heads of State and Government will be organised every three years, alternately in Africa and the EU. These Summits will refl ect the importance which the two sides attach to their relationship, take stock of progress made in the implementation of commitments made and give political guidance for further work, including through the approval of Action Plans. These Summits should be prepared at ministerial level. V. INSTITUTIONAL ARCHITECTURE AND IMPLEMENTATION EN812676.indd 48 EN812676.indd 48 24/12/08 11:09:59 24/12/08 11:09:59 ",
        "49 The political momentum and visibility of the new partnership will also require political engagement and commitment of the leaders of Africa and the EU in the period between the Summits. To this end, the Presidents of the EU Council and the AU, of the European and the Pan-African Parliament and of the European and AU Commissions, will \u2013 in the period between Summits and on a regular basis \u2013 meet their institutional counterparts, alternately in Africa and the EU, to review progress and provide political guidance to the partnership. The AU and EU: Different Levels of Interaction \u2022 In this context, partners recognise a need for a more defi ned division of roles and responsibilities between the pan-African, sub-regional, national and local levels and between the diff erent actors on the EU side, as well as for coherence and complementarity with other international actors. The African Union has emerged as a natural interlocutor for the EU on continental issues and as the most important institutional partner for the EU. Therefore, the institutional architecture promoted by the Joint Stra-tegy will, on the African side, be centered on the AU. This approach requires strong institutions that invest particularly in their capacity to act eff ectively and interact with each other. The EU will therefore allocate the necessary resources and adapt its organisational structures. The opening of an EU Delegation to the AU in Addis Ababa will be an important step in that direction. The AU will also further strengthen its representation in Brussels. Beyond that, the EU will continue to assist the AU in its ongoing institutional transformation process and also support the strengthening of the AU\u2019s institutional ability to interact with the EU and other international partners. One particular challenge is to simplify the institutional framework for regional integration and its articulation with the EPA-related groupings. Regional Economic Communities (RECs) are important for the continental economic and political integration agenda and should continue to be key partners for the EU in Africa. The EU and AU will aim at integrating the RECs and the Sub-Regional Organisations (SROs) in the present institutional architecture and at minimizing overlap between, and confl icting mandates EN812676.indd 49 EN812676.indd 49 24/12/08 11:09:59 24/12/08 11:09:59 ",
        "50 of, the entities concerned. The issue of the confi guration of the EPA-related groupings is of particular importance in this context. Africa-EU Troikas \u2022 In the period between the Summits, the dialogue between Africa and the EU should be maintained through regular meetings of Senior Offi cials and Ministers. In order to ensure an eff ective and balanced representation of both Unions, these meetings will continue to be held in Troika format, whereby each side is represented by a smaller number of representatives who are mandated to speak on behalf of Africa and the EU respectively. On the EU side, the Troika consists of the current and incoming EU Presidency, the European Commission and the EU Council Secretariat, while on the African side the Troika consists of the current and outgoing Presidencies of the AU and the AU Commission, expanded to include chef de fi le countries at the expert and senior offi cial levels. The biannual Africa-EU Ministerial troika meeting will play a central role in the review and monitoring of the implementation of the Joint Strategy and its successive Action Plans.

        "51 Africa and the EU will continue to hold biannual Africa-EU troika meetings between Foreign Ministers, alternately in Africa and the EU, and will also, as necessary, strengthen their dialogue through additional sectoral Ministerial meetings. Commission-to-Commission Dialogue and Joint \u2022 EU-AU Task Force The two Commissions will play a central role as the driving forces behind the partnership. They will continue and further develop their cooperation, together with the EU Council Secretariat. The existing Joint EU-AU Task Force will be strengthened to facilitate permanent working level dialogue, interaction and joint projects between the diff erent institutions and will continue to hold regular meetings to move forward the agenda of the strategic partnership. The Colleges of Commissioners of the European and AU Commissions will meet on an annual basis to provide political leadership and impetus to the work of the Joint EU-AU Task Force. Parliaments and other Representative Institutions \u2022 This institutional architecture will also strengthen the formal structure of the dialogue between the institutions that represent the people of the two continents, the European Parliament, the Pan-African Parliament (PAP) and the AU Economic, Social and Cultural Council (ECOSOCC). The PAP and the ECOSOCC \u2013 both part of the AU institutional architecture \u2013 are promising and legitimate voices for democratic governance in Africa and deserves the support of all actors in the Africa-EU partnership. Cooperation between the socio-economic partners at both sides will also be enhanced, notably through the dialogue between the EU Economic and Social Committees (EESC) and the AU ECOSOCC. These dialogues will complement and/or feed into the institutional EU-AU troika dialogue. Consideration will also be given to setting up mechanisms for exchanges between stakeholders on the EU side to achieve maximum coordination, coherence and consistency of EU policies and approaches.

        "52 Civil Society \u2022 Partners furthermore recognise that the Joint Strategy should be co-owned by European and African non-institutional actors and that these actors can play an important role in taking forward the objectives of the partnership. With a view to a people-centred partnership, an appropriate and prominent place needs to be defi ned in the institutional partnership for civil society and other non-state actors. Africa and the EU will therefore further promote the development of a vibrant and independent civil society and of a systematic dialogue between it and public authorities at all levels. In addition, both sides will make effective communication with non-institutional actors a priority and strengthen their capacity to disseminate information, collect and make use of ideas and proposals from civil society partners, and encourage the active involvement of non-institutional actors in the implementation and monitoring of the Joint Strategy and its Action Plans. EU and AU Member States, and sub-regional organisations and institutions, will play a key role in this work. To facilitate these people-to-people contacts, Africa and the EU will promote and expand twinning arrangements in relevant sectors. To make these arrangements work, both sides will work towards facilitation of entry procedures \u2013 including visa requirements \u2013 for people participating in these schemes. The Joint Strategy should remain a permanent platform for continued dialogue with stakeholders in Africa and the EU in the years ahead. Members of Parliament, civil society organisations and European and African research institutes and think tanks will participate in dialogue mechanisms and initiatives and play a key role in monitoring the implementation of African, European and joint policies and commitments outlined in the Joint Strategy.

        "53 2. Implementation and Follow-up Mechanisms Action Plans \u2022 The Joint Strategy, which provides an overarching long-term policy framework for Africa-EU relations, will be implemented through successive Action Plans which will build on the operational part of this Joint Strategy and cover proposed priority actions for three years. The fi rst Action Plan will be adopted in Lisbon, covering the period up to the next Summit. These Action Plans will identify the main political priorities, as well as the policy commitments, programmes and actions that will be needed to achieve them. The Action Plans will allow Heads of State and Government to, on a regular basis, assess the successes and failures of implementation in key areas and, if necessary, provide new political impetus. Financial Instruments \u2022 The two sides will work closely together to secure appropriate funding, and to enhance the accessibility of fi nancing sources, to give eff ect to this Joint Strategy and its successive Action Plans. The implementation of the Joint Strategy and the initiatives to be developed in this framework will be supported by existing fi nancial instruments in accordance with their respective scope and their relevance to the objectives and activities concerned, such as the European Development Fund (EDF), the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI), the European Neighbourhood Policy Instrument (ENPI), the Instrument for Stability, as well as the Thematic Programmes and by EU fi nancial institutions, such as the European Investment Bank (EIB). Where possible these instruments will be complemented by further contributions by EU Member States. More-over, whenever possible, African fi nancial instruments and AU Member States shall contribute to this process and an involvement of African fi nancial institutions such as the African Development Bank will be ensured as appropriate. In order to ensure the eff ective use of instruments in this innovative Africa-EU cooperation framework and to ensure that they enable partners to meet the goals of the strategic partnership, the complementarity and EN812676.indd 53 EN812676.indd 53 24/12/08 11:10:03 24/12/08 11:10:03 ",
        "54 coherence of these instruments will be properly ensured. To this end, partners will work together towards gradually adapting relevant policies and legal and fi nancial frameworks, as well as relevant cooperation instruments and mechanisms, to the needs and objectives of the partnership. In particular, Africa and the EU will work together to build synergies between existing cooperation agreements in support of the partnership, including through the progressive establishment of a Pan-African fi nancial support programme. Monitoring, Evaluation and Review Mechanisms \u2022 The Joint Strategy is for the long term and shall be reviewed on a regular basis and as appropriate. The two Commissions and the EU Council Secretariat will \u2013 on an annual basis and in cooperation with the AU and EU Presidencies \u2013 coordinate the preparation of a joint report on the progress made in the implementation of the Joint Africa-EU Strategy, focusing on the policies and actions outlined in the Action Plans and using clear indicators and concrete benchmarks and timetables to ensure that implementation is on track. These reports will be presented to the Africa-EU Ministerial Troika meetings which will monitor progress and ensure that implementation is on track: every third year, these reports will be presented to Heads of State and Government, meeting at Summit level, alternately in the EU and in Africa. In parallel, the European Parliament and the Pan-African Parliament are invited to organise joint hearings and to prepare political reports on progress made. Finally, and in order to ensure a wide ownership of the process and transparency in the monitoring, civil society organisations in the EU, Africa and beyond are invited to prepare general and sector-specifi c reports, the conclusions of which will be taken into account in the progress reports prepared by the two Commissions and the EU Council Secretariat and inform the further implementation of the Joint Strategy.

        "55 Introduction T he Joint Africa-EU Strategy identifi es strategic priorities in the area of peace and security, democratic governance and human rights, trade and regional integration and other key development issues. To implement the commitments made in the Joint Strategy, the EU and Africa will address and advance all identifi ed objectives on all the strategic priorities, with a wider view of supporting African countries in their eff orts to attain all Millennium Development Goals by the year 2015. However, to reach early results on the key deliverables of the Lisbon Declaration, special attention will be devoted to a number of selected priority actions in the initial period 2008- 2010, all of which have a positive impact on the daily lives of the citizens of Africa and Europe. The Parties agree to implement these selected priority actions in the context of specifi c \u2018Africa-EU Partnerships\u2019 on subjects of common interest, which add value to existing cooperation and political dialogue. The Partnerships will focus in particular on actions at the global, continental or regional level, with a clear comparative advantage as compared to cooperation at the national level, where the participating actors have a collective capacity to deliver. In addition, other agreed initiatives and partnerships will continue to be implemented. In this context, the development of infrastructure as a cross-cutting priority, and the implementation of the EU-Africa Infrastructure Partnership launched in Addis Ababa on 24 October 2007, are of particular relevance. FIRST ACTION PLAN (2008-2010) FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AFRICA-EU STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP EN812676.indd 55 EN812676.indd 55 24/12/08 11:10:04 24/12/08 11:10:04 ",
        "56 The Partnerships will work under the political guidance and responsibility of the existing Africa-EU Ministerial Troika, where appropriate with inputs from sector-specifi c ministerial Troikas. Partners also agree to take the necessary steps in the initial period 2008-2010 to establish and implement the institutional framework. The monitoring of progress will take place in the framework of the Joint EU-AU Task Force, which will report to their respective constituencies. The Partnerships are to be seen as political relations between interested partners who have organised themselves on a voluntary basis around a shared vision with the intention of launching concrete activities. Their actors and duration will vary, in function of the objectives of the cooperation. Each of these \u2018Africa-EU Partnerships\u2019 are open for a wide range of actors, which could include the European and AU Commissions, EU and AU Ministerial Councils, the EU Council Secretariat, EU Member States and African States, EU and African Parliaments, local and decentralised authorities, EU and African civil society actors, African sub-regional organisations, research institutions, international organisations or institutions and the private sector. The actions under each of these \u2018EU Africa Partnerships\u2019 will be fi nanced out of existing or new fi nancial resources, which could include, where appropriate, the 10th European Development Fund (EDF) and its facilities and trust funds, the relevant EU budgetary instruments (European Neighbourhood Policy Instrument\u2013ENPI, Development Cooperation Instrument-DCI) and the geographical and thematic programmes deriving from these, bilateral contributions from both African or EU States, contributions from interested third states, international fi nancing institutions, international organisations and civil society groups as well as private sector investments.

This partnership will ensure that better-managed migration and employment issues become an essential part of poverty reduction strategies or other national development and co-development strategies of African countries. The partnership will ensure that migration and employment works for sustainable development and that all relevant international agreements and declarations are implemented. The partnership will in particular build on the Tripoli Declaration on Migration and Development and the Ouagadougou Declaration and Action Plan on Employment and Poverty Alleviation. At the Tripoli EU-Africa Ministerial Conference on Migration and Development in November 2006, Africa and the EU adopted for the fi rst time a joint strategy, in the form of the Tripoli Declaration, to respond to the challenges and maximise the benefi ts of international migration. The EU-Africa Action Plan on traffi cking in human beings, which was formally endorsed on the same occasion, is part and parcel of the comprehensive strategy adopted in Tripoli, even though, for practical reasons, it is addressed separately in this document. 7.

        "119 RATIONALE A frica is the continent where the scientifi c and digital divides are the widest. The MDGs identify the essential role of science and technology for socio-economic transformation. Investments in African scientifi c capacities have not been prioritized and the continent is loosing some of its best scientifi c and technical expertise to other regions. It is in this context, that the Africa Science and Technology Consolidated Plan of Action was developed, consolidating the AU Commission and NEPAD programmes related to science and technology capacity building, knowledge production and technological innovation. The MDGs also identify information and communication technologies (ICTs) as key enablers for poverty reduction and growth. Although ICTs are multi-sectoral tools for socio-economic development, a dedicated coherent strategy needs to be implemented in order to develop an inclusive information society in Africa. It is on these principles, and in the context of the World Summit on Information Society, that the African Regional Action Plan for Knowledge Economy (ARAPKE), an AU initiative, was developed. Space applications provide, by their very nature, an eff ective platform to address problems from a regional perspective. The use of space science for development in Africa presents considerable opportunities, and there is a need to establish institutional arrangements to enable Africa to tap their benefi ts. Space-based systems can play a key enabling role in the attainment of Africa\u2019s sustainable development objectives and contribute to the monitoring of climate change. 8.
