        "Respect for multilingualism 1. Considers that multilingualism is one of the key features of the European Union, which highlights cultural and linguistic diversity and ensures equal treatment of EU citizens; 2. Considers that multilingualism guarantees citizens' right to communicate with the EU institutions in any of its official languages, thus enabling them to exercise their right of democratic control; 3. Considers that the linguistic services of the EU institutions facilitate communication, and that, in so doing, the institutions remain open to the citizens of Europe; 4. Considers that the total cost of all the linguistic services of the EU institutions, translation and inter- pretation combined, represent merely 1 % of the total EU budget; 5. Considers that its Rules of Procedure stipulate that Members may speak in the official language of their choice and that interpretation into the other languages is provided; considers that, in addition, the use of official languages is governed by its \u2018 Code of Conduct on Multilingualism \u2019 , updated in 2004; 6. Considers that multilingualism is an expression of the EU's cultural diversity, which must be preserved, and that, therefore, while the increasing number of official languages calls for pragmatic solutions in the preparatory work within the institutions, multilingualism must be guaranteed to ensure the legitimacy and diversity of the European Union; With regard to all institutions 7. Welcomes with satisfaction the high quality of interpretation in the EU institutions; is furthermore of the opinion that the high quality of interpretation must be continuously evaluated and guaranteed; 8. Notes that the overall cost of interpretation in 2003 was EUR 57 000 000 as regards the Parliament and EUR 106 000 000 as regards the Council, the Commission, the European Economic and Social Com- mittee, the Committee of the Regions and some agencies; 9. Is, however, very concerned that in 2003 approximately 16 % (EUR 25 900 000) of the total interpre- tation costs for that year of EUR 163 000 000 represented costs for services supplied but not used and for stand-by arrangements; 10. Is of the opinion that the Parliament, the Council and the Commission should endeavour to reduce \u2018 implicit or explicit stand-by duty \u2019 , these arrangements accounting for EUR 18 000 000 spent on interpreta- tion services supplied but not used; notes that reserve interpreters should be available for ad hoc meetings with a short request time; 11. Calls on its administration, the Council and the Commission to improve inter-institutional cooperation; 12. Calls on the Parliament and Commission interpretation services, in order to be more efficient, to exchange interpreters and create mixed interpretation teams, and to make possible the use of available interpreters where and when they are requested in order to meet real needs; 13. Calls on the institutions to encourage and facilitate the use of \u2018 local interpreters \u2019 , language combina- tion premitting , and stresses that national administrative provisions must not be an obstacle; notes that a high quality of interpretation must be guaranteed; 14. Considers that the Parliament and the Commission should establish an overview on the official/ freelance ratio per language in time for the 2006 discharge; C 305 E/68 EN 14.12.2006 Official Journal of the European Union Tuesday 5 September 2006 ",
        "15. Calls on the Commission to reinforce, in coordination with other institutions, cooperation with Member States in training interpreters from their respective countries; 16. Calls on the EU institutions to renegotiate the agreement with the Auxiliary Conference Interpreters (ACI) with regard to travel arrangements, remuneration, inter-institutional cooperation and administrative simplification; 17. Notes the high share of travel and accommodation costs; urges meeting organisers and interpretation services to reduce travel and accommodation costs; calls for better coordination, planning and organisation of travel and accommodation arrangements; With regard to the Parliament 18. Expects its administration to provide estimates of the average total daily cost of ACIs and permanent interpreters in time for the 2005 discharge report; 19. Notes that the full cost for an interpretation day is almost 30 % higher in Parliament than in the Council or the Commission, one reason being that very few local interpreters can be used during Strasbourg sessions, which increases Parliament's interpretation costs in Strasbourg by 13 %; 20. Notes its refusal to take part in an evaluation with a view to creating an inter-institutional office providing interpretation services to all EU institutions, this having been considered by the Bureau on 4 September 2005 as being incompatible with the interests of Parliament; 21. Calls on its administration to continue to establish meaningful \u2018 session reports \u2019 , i.e. reports from the head of an interpretation team about the active and passive use of languages during group, committee and delegation meetings, and to report back on its findings in time for the 2005 discharge procedure; 22. Urges its administration to raise Members' awareness of interpretation costs; asks if it makes best possible use of the language profiles of Members; stresses that this should not lead to a ranking of official EU languages; 23. Recalls that, pursuant to Article 1 of the Code of Conduct on Multilingualism of 19 April 2004, resources should be allocated taking into consideration the users' real needs; 24. Calls on its administration to study how the Council's \u2018 request system \u2019 , the Council of Europe's inter- nal billing system or Unesco's quota system for interpretation could be used by the Parliament; 25. Notes that in 2003 it spent EUR 4 000 000 on interpretation services made available but not used due to late requests or cancellations; asks that last-minute cancellations and last-minute requests be discour- aged; furthermore calls on the interpretation services to be more flexible in their service planning and request system; 26. Calls on its responsible bodies to adapt its calendar of committee, group and plenary session weeks in order to achieve a better balance between needs and available resources; * * * 27. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission and the European Court of Auditors. 14.12.2006 EN C 305 E/69 Official Journal of the European Union Tuesday 5 September 2006 ",

(4) For the purposes of implementing these new tasks of preventing and responding to pollution, the Administrative Board of the Agency adopted on 22 October 2004 an Action Plan for Oil Pollution Preparedness and Response, which determines the Agency's oil pollution response activities and is aimed at optimum use of the financial resources available to the Agency (hereinafter \u2018 the Action Plan \u2019 ). (5) The pollution response action of the Agency, as defined in the Action Plan, relates to activities in the fields of information, cooperation and coordination and above all the provision of operational assist- ance to the Member States by supplying, on request, additional anti-pollution vessels to combat oil pollution and other types of pollution such as that caused by hazardous and noxious substances. The Agency is to pay particular attention to those areas identified as most vulnerable without prejudice to any other area in need. (6) The activities of the Agency in this field should not relieve coastal states of their responsibility to have appropriate pollution response mechanisms in place and should comply with existing cooperation arrangements between Member States or groups of Member States in this field. In the event of a maritime pollution incident, the Agency is to assist the Member State(s) affected, under whose auth- ority clean-up operations are to be conducted. (7) In accordance with the Action Plan, the Agency is to play an active role in developing a centralised satellite imagery service for surveillance, the early detection of pollution and identification of the ships responsible. This new system will improve the availability of data and the effectiveness of the response to pollution caused by ships. (8) The additional means to be provided by the Agency to the Member States should be made available through the Community mechanism in the field of civil protection assistance interventions, including accidental marine pollution, established by Council Decision 2001/792/EC, Euratom ( 4 ). (9) In order to ensure thorough implementation of the Action Plan and strengthen the prevention of and response to pollution caused by ships by expanding current anti-pollution activities, the Agency should be provided with a viable and cost-effective system for financing, in particular, its operational assistance to the Member States.

        "(10) It is therefore necessary to provide for appropriate financial security for the funding of the tasks entrusted to the Agency in the field of pollution response and other associated actions on the basis of a multiannual commitment. The annual amounts of the Community contribution should be deter- mined in accordance with the procedures in force. (11) The amounts to be committed for the funding of pollution response should cover the period 2007 to 2013, in line with the new financial framework. (12) A financial envelope covering the same period should therefore be provided for the implementation of the Action Plan. (13) The amount of that envelope should be regarded as the minimum needed to carry out the tasks entrusted to the Agency in the field of responding to pollution caused by ships. (14) In order to optimise the allocation of commitments and take into account any changes with regard to activities in response to pollution caused by ships, it is necessary to ensure continuous monitoring of the particular needs for action so as to allow for adaptation of the annual financial commitments. (15) The Administrative Board of the Agency should thus review the budgetary commitments, on the basis of a report to be produced by the Executive Director, to include any necessary adjustments to the budget of the Agency. Regulation (EC) No 1406/2002 should therefore be amended accordingly, HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1 Objective This Regulation lays down the detailed arrangements for the financial contribution of the Community to the budget of the European Maritime Safety Agency for the implementation of the tasks assigned to it in the field of responding to pollution caused by ships and other associated actions, pursuant to Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1406/2002. Article 2 Definitions For the purposes of this Regulation the following definitions shall apply: (a) \u2018 the Agency \u2019 means the European Maritime Safety Agency, established by Regulation (EC) No 1406/2002; (b) \u2018 regional agreements \u2019 means the bilateral and regional agreements concluded between coastal states to render mutual assistance in the event of a maritime pollution incident; (c) \u2018 oil \u2019 means petroleum in any form including crude oil, fuel oil, sludge, oil refuse and refined products as established by the International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Cooperation, 1990; (d) \u2018 hazardous and noxious substances \u2019 means any substance other than oil which, if introduced into the marine environment, is likely to create hazards to human health, to harm living resources and marine life, to damage amenities or to interfere with other legitimate uses of the sea, as established by the Protocol on Preparedness, Response and Cooperation to Pollution Incidents by Hazardous and Noxious Substances, 2000.

        "Whereas: (1) The Treaty establishes that in the definition and implementation of all Community policies and activities a high level of human health protection has to be ensured; Article 3(1)(p) of the Treaty requires Com- munity action to include a contribution to the attainment of a high level of health protection. (2) Community action should complement national policies directed towards improving public health, obviating sources of danger to human health. (3) Physical, sexual and psychological violence against children, young people and women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or private life, and, in particular, trafficking in human beings and enforced prostitution, constitute a breach of their right to life, safety, freedom, dignity and physical and emotional integrity and a serious threat to the physical and mental health of the victims of such violence. The effects of such violence, being so widespread throughout the Community, constitute a genuine human rights violation and health scourge and an obstacle to the enjoyment of safe, free and just citizenship. (4) Traditions and cultural practices associated with the exercise of physical violence against women, such as genital mutilation and honour crimes, constitute a particular form of violence against women with short-term and long-term detrimental effects on their health, the main victims being members of minority communities. (5) The World Health Organisation defines health as a state of complete physical, mental and social well- being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. According to a 1996 World Health Assembly resolution, violence is a leading worldwide public health problem. In its report on violence and health of 3 October 2002, the organisation recommends promoting primary prevention responses, strengthen- ing responses for victims of violence and increasing collaboration and exchange of information on violence prevention. (6) These principles are recognised in numerous conventions, declarations and protocols of the main international organisations and institutions such as the United Nations, the International Labour Orga- nisation, the World Conference on Women and the World Congress against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children. (7) The fight against violence should be placed within the context of the protection of fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union ( 1 ) , which reaf- firms, inter alia, the rights to dignity, equality and solidarity. It includes a number of specific provisions to protect and promote physical and mental integrity, equal treatment for men and women, the rights of the child and non-discrimination, as well as to prohibit inhuman or degrading treatment, slavery and forced labour, and child labour. It reaffirms that a high level of human health protection shall be ensured in the definition and implementation of all Union policies and activities. (8) The Commission has been called upon by the European Parliament to draw up and implement action programmes to combat such violence, inter alia, in its Resolutions of 19 May 2000 on the commu- nication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament \u2018 For further actions in the fight against trafficking in women \u2019 ( 2 ) , of 20 September 2001 on female genital mutilation ( 3 ) , of 17 January 2006 on strategies to prevent the trafficking of women and children who are vulnerable to sexual exploitation ( 4 ) , and of 2 February 2006 on the current situation in combating violence against women and any future action ( 4 ).. (9) The programme of Community action (the Daphne programme) (2000 to 2003) on preventive measures to fight violence against children, young persons and women set up by Decision No 293/2000/EC ( 5 ) has helped increase awareness within the European Union and increase and consolidate cooperation between organisations in the Member States active in combating violence.

        "(10) The programme of Community action (2004 to 2008) to prevent and combat violence against children, young people and women and to protect victims and groups at risk (the Daphne II programme) set up by Decision No 803/2004/EC ( 1 ) further developed the results already achieved by the Daphne programme; accord- ing to Article 8(2) thereof the Commission shall take the necessary steps to ensure the consistency of the annual appropriations with the new financial framework. (11) It is desirable to ensure continuity for the projects supported by the Daphne and the Daphne II programmes. (12) It is important and necessary to recognise the serious immediate and long-term implications of violence against children, young people and women for physical and mental health, psychological and social development, and for the equal opportunities of those concerned, for individuals, families and communities, and the high social and economic costs to society as a whole. (13) It is necessary to recognise that some groups, namely women belonging to minority groups, refugee women, women migrants, women living in poverty in rural or remote communities, women in insti- tutions or in detention, female children, lesbian women, women with disabilities and elderly women, are particularly vulnerable to violence. (14) Not only children who are directly subjected to violence but also children who witness their mothers being assaulted should be regarded as victims of violence in accordance with this programme. (15) Concerning the prevention of violence, including maltreatment of newborn children or abuse and sexual exploitation perpetrated against children, young people and women and the protection of vic- tims and groups at risk, the European Union will bring added value to the actions principally to be undertaken by Member States by the following means: the dissemination and exchange of information, experience and good practices; the promotion of an innovative approach; the inclusion of new family models; the joint establishment of priorities; the development of networking as appropriate , not least in order to support the victims of sexual, psychological or physical violence and groups at risk ; the selection of Community-wide projects; and the motivation and mobilisation of all parties concerned. These actions should also concern children and women brought to the Member States through human trafficking. (16) The overall objective of the Union's measures against violence is to prevent and combat all forms of violence in order to eliminate this crime and gross violations of human rights completely. To achieve this objective, clear and credible targets are required. (17) The European Federation for Missing and Sexually Exploited Children groups together at European level different NGOs dealing with the problem of the disappearance and sexual exploitation of chil- dren. The Federation raises awareness and fights against the phenomena of missing and sexually exploited children by facilitating communication between European organisations towards a more efficient approach, stimulating the creation of a European study centre to centralise and analyse data concerning these phenomena and promoting and conducting activities to improve the situation of minors, victims of disappearance and/or sexual abuse, and to change the legal norms, the mentality and behaviour in Europe. (18) The programme will pay attention to the situation of street children, a situation which is becoming dramatic as street children are not only victims of traffickers in drugs and human beings, but also suffer violence and sexual abuse. In order to reintegrate these children into society a programme is needed which provides answers to social and family problems and takes account of these children's needs. (19) The European Network of Ombudspersons for Children (ENOC) links independent children's rights institutions in twenty-four Member States of the Council of Europe. Its aims are to encourage the fullest possible implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, to support collective lobbying for children's rights, to share information, approaches and strategies, and to promote the development of effective independent offices for children.

        "(20) The objectives of the proposed action, namely to prevent and combat all forms of violence against children, young people and women, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States because of the need for an exchange of information at EU level and for the Community-wide dissemination of good practices. This can be better achieved at Community level. Due to the need for a coordinated and multidisciplinary approach and by reason of the scale or impact of the initiative, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Decision does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives. (21) Appropriate measures should also be taken to prevent irregularities and fraud and the necessary steps should be taken to recover funds lost, wrongly paid or incorrectly used. (22) This Decision lays down , for the entire duration of the programme, a financial envelope constituting the prime reference, within the meaning of point 37 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and sound financial management ( 1 ), for the budgetary authority during the annual budgetary procedure. (23) Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applic- able to the general budget of the European Communities ( 2 ), hereinafter \u2018 the Financial Regulation \u2019 , and Commission Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002 of 23 December 2002 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 ( 3 ), which safeguard the Community's financial interests, have to be applied, taking into account the principles of simplicity and consistency in the choice of budgetary instruments, a limitation on the number of cases where the Commission retains direct responsibility for their implementation and management, and the required proportionality between the amount of resources and the administrative burden related to their use. (24) The Financial Regulation requires a basic act to be provided to cover operating grants. (25) In accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission ( 4 ) , measures for the implementation of this Decision should be adopted by use of the advisory procedure provided for in Article 3 of that Decision. This is appropriate since the programme does not have a significant impact on the Com- munity budget, HAVE DECIDED AS FOLLOWS: Article 1 Subject matter and scope 1. Building on the policies and objectives laid down in the Daphne and Daphne II programmes, this Decision establishes the specific programme \u2018 Fight against violence (Daphne III ) \u2019 , hereinafter referred to as \u2018 the programme \u2019 , as part of the general programme \u2018 Fundamental Rights and Justice \u2019 , in order to provide European citizens with an area of Freedom, Security and Justice without internal borders . 2.

However, in order to contribute to meeting the commitments made by the Community and its Member States under the Kyoto Protocol, the proposed elements directly relat- ing to carbon dioxide emissions should be inserted in the tax bases of the passenger related taxes applied during the commit- ment period from 2008 to 2012. As the Community's strategic objective to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions from passenger cars needs to be achieved by 2010 at the latest, it is appropriate to apply fully the carbon dioxide based element by 31 Decem- ber 2010.

        "K. whereas an adequate income is fundamental to social inclusion and active participation in society as well as a life of dignity, L. whereas social policies, when appropriately designed, should not be regarded as a cost but, instead, as a positive factor in the EU's economic growth, not only by increasing productivity and competitiveness, but also by generating social cohesion, raising living standards for citizens, and ensuring access to fundamental rights and equality, thus becoming an important factor in ensuring societal peace and political stability, without which there can be no lasting economic progress, M. whereas such social policies must recognise that the majority of employers are small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and that they employ the majority of employees, N. whereas services of general interest (SGIs) and services of general economic interest (SGEIs) were expressly recognised for the first time in the Amsterdam Treaty as core elements of how Member States ensure social and territorial cohesion and as areas which Member States retained the right to define and to fund, and this position was reinforced in the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, O. whereas the concept of the European social model is reflected in that constitutional Treaty, and is underpinned by the principles of equality, solidarity and non-discrimination, P. whereas the Member States should follow the Roadmap for equality between women and men 2006- 2010 (COM(2006)0092), and the European Pact for Gender Equality, and fully transpose current Com- munity anti-discrimination legislation into national law, Q. whereas the EU has the capacity positively or negatively to influence the economies in many other parts of the world, by the way in which it trades, both in terms of its role in the WTO and in the conditions that it applies and the agreements into which it enters with less developed regions and countries, R. whereas the implementation of a trade policy based on European collective preferences and globally shared values, and an aid policy aimed at eliminating child labour and promoting education, basic labour and environmental standards, and standards of transparency and good governance, will contri- bute to the enhancement of the political strength of the EU in international institutions, Reform of the European Social Model 1. Stresses the necessity of preserving and enhancing the values associated with the European social model: equality, solidarity, individual rights and responsibilities, non-discrimination and redistribution with access for all citizens to high-quality public services, and the high social standards already achieved; 2. Insists that only an EU based on economic and social cohesion that defends its common values can be strong enough to protect its interests; 3. Is convinced that there is no alternative to urgently reforming economic and social systems where they fail to meet the criteria of efficiency and socially sustainable development, and where they are inadequate to tackle the challenges of demographic change, globalisation and the IT revolution; 4. Expresses its deep disappointment at the present growth rate in the EU which makes structural reform extremely difficult; 5. Is aware of the widespread concerns among EU citizens regarding unemployment \u2014 especially unem- ployment among young people \u2014 exclusion, poverty, insecurity on the job market, and the potential failure of social security systems; 14.12.2006 EN C 305 E/143 Official Journal of the European Union Wednesday 6 September 2006 ",
        "6. Believes that where demographic changes and unemployment affect certain groups disproportionately the European Union must aim to ensure equal access to high-quality jobs; 7. Views the need to renew the EU's commitment to a social Europe as of paramount importance in restoring citizens' confidence in the EU project, which provides jobs, growth and prosperity; 8. Is fully aware that employment and social policy remain broadly within national competence, but stresses that the EU also has competences in this field, as set out in the Treaties, and that there is a need for the EU to create a stronger economic and social framework, in order to allow Member States to imple- ment reforms as necessary at national level, according to their own economic, social and political circum- stances; 9. Asks the Commission to take further initiatives to achieve the full implementation of the internal market, which, if fully realised, will create economic growth and competitiveness, having regard to the need to exclude any \u2018 race to the bottom \u2019 in social, consumer or environmental standards; 10. Supports the Commission in its efforts to encourage the creation and success of European enter- prises, with particular reference to SMEs, which contribute greatly to the EU economy and account for the great majority of private-sector employees; 11. Calls on the Commission and the Council to respect the initial equilateral triangle of the Lisbon Strategy and to develop an approach that is better balanced between economic coordination on the one hand and employment and social policy on the other; 12. Expresses its disappointment that many Member States are far from achieving the Lisbon Strategy objectives; therefore reiterates the call on Member States fully to implement the revised Lisbon Strategy, which is considered to be the only sustainable way to achieve economic growth, increase competitiveness and create more and better jobs; calls on the Member States to achieve, in particular, the specific targets set for employment, especially of women and young people, R&D investment, childcare and lifelong learning; views the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy as minimum goals that are vital if the Member States are to undertake the necessary structural reforms; 13. Recommends that Member States deepen cooperation and the exchange of best practice through the enhanced open method of coordination, thereby providing an efficient policy making instrument in the fields of employment, social protection, social exclusion, gender equality in the labour market, pensions, and healthcare; believes that the open method of coordination should enhance the role of parliaments, social partners and relevant organisations; 14. Calls on the Commission to democratise the open method of coordination, ensuring that not only the European Parliament but also national parliaments play a full role in the setting and achieving of targets by Member States' governments; 15. Stresses the importance of launching public campaigns to explain and negotiate the basis of reform objectives in which EU institutions, national governments, public authorities, social partners, and NGOs have an active role to play; 16. Reaffirms its resolution of 12 January 2005 on the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe ( 1 ) and the Commission's \u2018 3D \u2019 campaign of dialogue, debate and democracy; calls on the Commission now to incorporate the social dimensions in its impact analyses in accordance with the social clause provided for in the constitutional Treaty; 17. Calls on the Commission to respect the social economy and to present a communication on this cornerstone of the European social model, as well as to introduce a statute for a European mutual society and a European association; ( 1 ) OJ C 247 E, 6.10.2005, p. 88.

        "Financing the reform 18. Calls on the Member States to undertake reforms in order to ensure the financial sustainability of national social systems, without prejudicing acquired rights, mutual support and intergenerational solidarity, having regard to the context of a changing society and a changing labour market, demographic change, globalisation and technological developments; points out that some of the most successful Member States have already carried out such reforms, while maintaining the sustainability and effectiveness of their social systems; considers, therefore, that comparative analyses should be made of the reforms already made, together with SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) analyses of those still to be imple- mented; stresses the importance of promoting excellence, inter alia , by pooling good practice; 19. Is aware that in some Member States current contributions to social protection systems may be inadequate to meet citizens' expectations; considers that Member States, while respecting the principle of solidarity and subsidiarity, should reflect on alternative ways to finance those systems which would promote dynamic reforms while not adversely affecting wages, such as harnessing the added value produced by companies and promoting the principle of vertical and horizontal subsidiarity between institutions and the public; 20. Calls for improved coordination of Member States' tax policies with a view to avoiding harmful tax competition, ensuring sustainable financing for social protection and making tax policy more employment- friendly; notes the fact that tax rates on capital and consumption have, in general, remained stable over the last 30 years while real tax rates on labour have risen over the same period; recommends that the Member States reflect in a coordinated way on the possibilities of improving the existing tax systems in the Union, since tax reforms of this nature would benefit the financial sustainability of national social systems; 21. Stresses the need to strengthen the Structural and Cohesion Funds in order to take account of eco- nomic and social cohesion and calls on the Member States to utilise EU funds, such as the Structural Funds, more efficiently in order to co-finance national reforms; deplores the fact that the recent agreement on the Financial Framework was manifestly insufficient to properly resource programmes in favour of cohesion, education and training, lifelong learning, mobility and social dialogue; 22. Stresses that any reforms have to be considered within the context of the Member States' budgetary margin of manoeuvre, but suggests that the reformed Stability and Growth Pact offers opportunities for social investment not previously available; SGIs and SGEIs 23. Recalls that SGIs and SGEIs are an essential element of the European social model, and are funda- mental to the universal delivery of health, education, public transport, water and energy supplies to all citizens; considers it essential that in reforming the EU's social systems, SGIs and SGEIs are respected, given their key role not only in improving the quality of life of citizens, but also in enhancing businesses' capacity for efficiency and their access to a high-quality labour force; 24. Notes the necessity of dealing adequately with new types of family, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, and of enlarging the scope of social services, such as accessible childcare, care for those with special needs or disabilities, and long-term care for elderly persons, while maintaining a high level of con- sultation in medium and long-term planning; Social Dialogue 25. Recalls that social dialogue in its various manifestations is an essential element in the traditions of the Member States and, in accordance with national customs and practices, that any successful reform of social systems should involve all stakeholders, in particular the social partners; calls for the renewal of the social dialogue at both national and European level and the development of a greater role for the trialogue at European level; 14.12.2006 EN C 305 E/145 Official Journal of the European Union Wednesday 6 September 2006 ",
        "26. Recognises the positive role that corporate social responsibility can play in promoting social cohesion through the way in which companies' behaviour impacts upon the daily life of the communities in which they are involved and in enhancing companies' accountability to their stakeholders; recommends the use of social and environmental reporting requirements and public policy measures such as public procurement, in order to stimulate responsible behaviour on the part of companies; Human Resources 27. Insists that as a central element of the modernisation of social systems the Commission and the Member States cooperate in the setting up of concrete programmes and initiatives focused on the improve- ment of working and living conditions and the sustainable development of human resources, such as the setting of targets and standards for improved healthcare; 28. Calls for a broad debate concerning the right of all people to a pension of an acceptable level; recognises the fear that pension reforms, begun in many Member States, will increase the number of pen- sioners already living in poverty; highlights the urgent need for positive action to encourage and enable older workers to remain in or re-enter the labour market, grant fair access and more flexibility in the choice of pension and retirement schemes; calls on the Commission to study national efforts to address the impact of demographic change on pension sustainability and pensioner poverty, and to monitor more effectively the implementation of existing age-discrimination legislation; 29. Draws attention to the situation of women whose pension entitlement should not be diminished because of their marital status or interruptions in employment due to maternity or parental leave, or child-care breaks; 30. Recognises the advantages of \u2018 flexicurity \u2019 systems which Member States should adopt, in accordance with their circumstances, in order to protect workers' capacity to keep/find jobs through mobility and/or improvement of professional skills by way of occupational training and lifelong learning, and considers them to be a means of promoting the reconciliation of work-life balance and work and lifecycle concepts; 31. Notes the creation of a Globalisation Adjustment Fund as a potential complement to the European Social Fund, as well as the Member States' efforts at national, regional and local level to provide specific support to workers seeking new or better jobs; 32. Recalls that gender and race equality and the principle of non-discrimination under Article 13 of the EC Treaty, which provides a legal basis for appropriate action to combat discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation, must be systematically included in all social policies; considers that emerging EU policies on integration are in fact a concrete form of social policy that should be developed; believes that ensuring that everyone, women, men, minority groups, and immi- grants, are well integrated delivers benefits to society and social benefits in terms of cohesion and prepared- ness for the workplace; 33. Emphasises in particular the importance of introducing social and work inclusion measures for dis- advantaged persons experiencing difficulties in gaining access to the labour market without assistance, as provided for in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2204/2002 of 12 December 2002 on the application of Articles 87 and 88 of the Treaty to State aid for employment ( 1 ), with a view both to taking practical action to combat discrimination and to providing those concerned with a means of securing an income, indepen- dence, personal development and integration, either as an alternative to or in conjunction with welfare assistance; Social Protection 34. Emphasises that social protection systems should be efficient in achieving their goals of preventing and combating poverty and social exclusion, with particular emphasis on eliminating poverty traps; ( 1 ) OJ L 337, 13.12.2002, p. 3.

        "35. Considers that employment is a decisive factor in achieving social inclusion; therefore, calls for reforms that direct public spending towards raising employment rates and return-to-work rates and provide incentives to work by eliminating poverty traps and other forms of social exclusion, and address as a matter of urgency the numbers of women and of persons from some ethnic minorities who are unemployed, many of whom face societal and/or structural barriers to entering the labour market; further considers that the specific problems faced by women from ethnic minorities and immigrant women should be studied and addressed; 36. Recognises that, in the \u2018 flexicurity \u2019 approach, creating and maintaining adequate social protection mechanisms is an indispensable prerequisite of flexibility, as is firm protection against unfair dismissal; The external dimension 37. Reaffirms that only if the EU can preserve its economic and social cohesion will it be able success- fully to defend EU interests at international level; 38. Recognises that, despite its positive effects, globalisation is producing economic and social imbal- ances, thus arousing deep apprehension in the citizens of Europe, especially in Member States with high unemployment rates and the regions most affected by company relocations; calls on the Member States, accordingly, to undertake the structural reforms that are needed if the EU is to remain attractive on the world stage, with high-value products and services; 39. Stresses that the EU should confidently promote its social values of solidarity and social justice in all trade and development negotiations and agreements; 40. Calls on the EU and the Member States to adopt political actions in relation to third countries with high economic growth (Brazil, Russia, India and China) in order to attain a development model which provides for the respect of human rights, democracy, freedom, labour and environmental standards and social justice; urges the EU to help in finding a global equilibrium between economic growth and high social and environmental standards; 41. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to adopt a consistent line in fora such as the ILO, the OECD, and multilateral environmental agencies; believes, in particular, that the work of the ILO should be more closely integrated into WTO agreements and considers that ILO core labour standards should be integrated into EU strategies towards WTO and bilateral negotiations; calls on the Commission to ensure, through bilateral agreements, that ILO standards are, as a minimum, respected so that child labour is elimi- nated and humane working conditions are guaranteed; 42. Welcomes the introduction of the Generalised System of Preferences Plus (GSP+) scheme, which provides incentives for higher social and environmental standards, and calls for this approach to be extended to bilateral trade agreements; notes the need for the Commission to monitor closely the implementation of the scheme with a view to ensuring that compliance with these standards is being achieved; * * * 43.

        "F. whereas, in view of the assignment of competences in the EC Treaty, the added value of a Community strategy on the mental health of the people of Europe lies primarily in the field of prevention, G. whereas in some European countries up to 85 % of the money devoted to mental health is spent on maintaining large institutions, H. whereas a lack of understanding and investment in mental health promotion has contributed to dete- riorating health and disabilities among individuals and societal problems, I. whereas approximately 40 % of all prisoners have some form of mental disorder and whereas they are up to seven times more likely to commit suicide than people in the community, and whereas inappropriate imprisonment can worsen the disorder and prevent rehabilitation, J. whereas throughout the European Union not enough attention or resources have been given to the mental health of children and young people, even though mental ill health is increasing significantly among the young, K. whereas there is a clear gender dimension to the issue of health, particularly as regards eating disorders, neurodegenerative disorders, schizophrenia, mood disorders, anxiety, panic, depression, abuse of alcohol and other psychoactive substances, as well as suicide and delinquency, areas which also require systema- tic research, L. whereas women tend to seek assistance from services more than men and are prescribed twice as many psychotropic drugs as men; whereas pharmacokinetic studies have shown that women have less toler- ance to such products, M. whereas the prevention, early identification, intervention and treatment of mental disorders significantly reduces the personal, financial and social repercussions, N. whereas a great number of people suffer from neurodegenerative disorders and this number is expected to grow on account of, inter alia, longevity and the concomitant increase in the elderly population, O. whereas in most European Union countries there has been a move from long-term institutionalised care, both for children with developmental and behavioural problems which jeopardise their normal development, particularly in the educational sphere, and for adults with chronic and severe disorders and for those with learning disabilities, towards supported community living, but whereas this has been without proper planning and resourcing of community services, P. whereas mental health problems related to violence against women and girls are poorly identified; whereas accounts of victimisation are routinely not taken into account and many women and girls are reluctant to disclose a history of violent abuse unless doctors and medical personnel ask about it directly, Q. whereas the precondition for good mental health is an upbringing in a healthy family environment providing both material and psychological security and parental love, 1. Welcomes the Commission's commitment to mental health promotion; calls for greater priority for this in health policies, with the emphasis on prevention, and in the Union's research policy, and believes this should be mainstreamed into the policies and legislation of all Commission Directorates and all Member State ministries, which should make a commitment to harmonising the current national and international mental health indicators, with a view to ensuring a comparable set of data at EU level; 14.12.2006 EN C 305 E/149 Official Journal of the European Union Wednesday 6 September 2006 ",
        "2. Considers that the gender dimension has not been duly taken into account in the Green Paper; calls, therefore, for this dimension to be systematically considered in the measures proposed to promote mental health, in preventive measures and in research, in which studies have to date been insufficient and inade- quate, to such an extent that progress on the prevention and cure of mental illness has been significantly less great than in the case of other diseases; 3. Considers the role of doctors in monitoring patients to be of paramount importance; 4. Believes that good mental health is a prerequisite for the overall health and well-being of European citizens and for a healthy economic performance in the EU; encourages and supports all measures which aim to help prevent mental disorders; 5. Stresses the need to think about the best way to use the available Community instruments, such as the 7th research framework programme, in order to build up a capacity capable of supporting research into mental health in the Union; 6. Believes that any future proposal by the Commission relating to mental health should involve partner- ship and consultation with and the participation of those who have experienced or are experiencing mental health problems, their families and carers and advocacy NGOs, associations of family members and other interested parties, so as to make decision-making processes more representative and inclusive, and should promote networking among members of the families of psychiatric patients; 7. Highlights the sizeable differences in mental health expenditure in individual Member States, both in terms of the absolute amount and as a proportion of health care expenditure as a whole; 8. Believes that different actions will be needed to achieve the three aims of mental health promotion, mental health improvement and mental disorder prevention; believes that the aims of such actions should be to provide appropriate information, to obtain relevant knowledge and to develop appropriate attitudes and skills in order to safeguard the mental and physical health and improve the quality of life of European citizens; 9. Stresses the need for careful use of terms such as \u2018 Mental Ill Health \u2019 , \u2018 Mental Health Disorders \u2019 , \u2018 Severe Mental Illness \u2019 and \u2018 Personality Disorder \u2019 ; 10. Stresses the importance of the need for early screening, detection and diagnosis and of integrated, tailor-made treatment; 11. Stresses the need to combat, through appropriate action, inequalities in the treatment of mental diseases which are evident in this field; 12. Calls for people with learning disabilities to be included within any future strategy, as they face similar issues as people with mental disorders, including social exclusion, institutionalisation, abuse of human rights, discrimination, stigma and lack of support for themselves and their families and carers; calls, at the same time, for greater efforts to recognise cognitively gifted children and young people as such and to provide better support for them; 13. Stresses the importance of mutual help and the leading role played by people's experience of treat- ment, illness and recovery; 14. Welcomes the Commission's highlighting of children, employees, older people and disadvantaged members of society as key target groups, but would extend this to include, for example, those with severe mental illness, those with long-term and terminal illnesses, the disabled, prisoners, ethnic and other minor- ity groups, rough sleepers, migrants, persons in precarious jobs and the unemployed, and the range of mental health and care issues of specific reference to women; 15. Recognises that personality disorder presents particular challenges of diagnosis, treatment or manage- ment and care, requiring more research and distinct policies; calls on the Commission also to devote atten- tion to aggression, the determinants of aggressive behaviour and its psychological consequences; C 305 E/150 EN 14.12.2006 Official Journal of the European Union Wednesday 6 September 2006 ",
        "16. Acknowledges that men and women may have different mental health needs, and calls for more research particularly into the link between compulsory in-patient care and self-harm and the higher rate of prescription of psychotropic drugs among women; 17. Stresses the need for research into the proven variations in structure and activity between the brains of men and women, in order to develop separate approaches and treatments for the two sexes in the field of mental health; 18. Calls for support for mothers during the prenatal and postnatal periods in order to prevent depres- sion or other psychopathological conditions which manifest themselves in significant numbers of cases in these situations; 19. Believes that good mental health of mothers and parents helps children to develop without hindrance and grow into healthy adults; 20. Calls for a multi-disciplinary and multi-agency response to tackling complex mental ill health situa- tions, such as how best to support children or adolescents with developmental or behavioural problems or eating disorders, and/or whose parents in many cases themselves suffer from mental ill health (or are kept in long-term institutions); 21. Notes that socially-defined images of how girls' and women's bodies should look have an impact on women's and girls' mental health and well-being, resulting inter alia in an increase in eating disorders; 22. Points out that mental ill health and mental disorders commonly have their roots in early childhood and stresses the importance of research into a healthy early childhood; 23. Stresses the importance of continuing training and in-service training of the intermediaries: teaching staff, care workers, social and judicial services and employers; 24. Welcomes the fact that the Green Paper recognises that social and environmental factors, such as personal experiences, family, and social support; living conditions such as poverty, living in big cities, and rural isolation; and working conditions, such as job insecurity, unemployment, and long working hours, play a role in the mental health of people; stresses that mental disorders are one of the reasons for early retirement and disability pensions; 25. Considers that good working conditions contribute to mental health and calls for employers to introduce \u2018 Mental Health at Work \u2019 policies as a necessary part of their health and safety at work responsi- bility, with a view to ensuring the \u2018 best possible jobs \u2019 for and best possible incorporation into the labour market of persons with mental disorders, and that these should be published and monitored within existing health and safety legislation, while also taking workers' needs and views into account; 26. Welcomes the social initiatives within social policy and employment policy to promote the non- discriminatory treatment of individuals with mental ill health, the social integration of individuals with mental disabilities, and the prevention of stress in the workplace; 27. With regard to the EU employment strategy, emphasises the influence of mental health on employ- ment as well as the influence of unemployment on people's state of mental health; 28. Believes Member States should work together to find and implement effective strategies to reduce suicide, particularly among young people and other at risk groups; 29. Calls for greater recognition of the connection between discrimination, violence, and poor mental health, which underlines the importance of combating all forms of violence and discrimination as part of the strategy for the promotion of mental health through prevention; 14.12.2006 EN C 305 E/151 Official Journal of the European Union Wednesday 6 September 2006 ",
        "30. Sees one of the greatest challenges in mental health as being the ageing of Europe's population and urges that more emphasis is given to research into the mechanisms and causes of neurodegenerative diseases or other psychiatric illnesses in the elderly and to their prevention as well as their care, including the development of new therapies; 31. Further believes that emphasis should be placed on the link between the consumption of alcohol and illegal drugs and mental disorders; considers that alcohol and drug addiction cause serious mental and physical health problems and problems for society as a whole; calls on the Commission to review without delay what detoxification programmes and methods of treatment are the most effective; 32. Stresses that people with mental disorders should be treated and cared for with dignity and humanity and that medical care and support services should be effective and of a high quality, accessible to all sufferers and universal; that there should be a clear understanding as to their rights to be or not to be treated; that they should be empowered wherever possible to participate in decisions about their own treat- ment and consulted collectively on services; that, when prescribed medicines, they should have the fewest possible side effects; and that there should be information and advice for those who wish to withdraw safely from medication; 33. Believes that the use of force is counterproductive, as is compulsory medication; believes that all forms of in-patient care and compulsory medication should be of limited duration and should, wherever possible, be regularly reviewed and subject to the patient's consent or, in the absence of such consent, to authorisation by the appropriate authorities used only as a last resort; 34. Takes the view that any restriction of personal freedoms should be avoided, with particular reference to physical containment, which requires monitoring, verification and vigilance by democratic institutions responsible for upholding individual rights, in order to guard against abuses; 35. Calls for the defeat of stigma to be at the heart of any future strategy, e.g. by establishing annual campaigns on mental health issues in order to combat ignorance and injustice, as the stigma attached to mental ill health leads to rejection by society in every field from employment to family, and from commun- ity to health professionals; considers furthermore that with a view to improving the mental health and conditions of patients, basic social and civil rights should be guaranteed, such as the right to housing and economic support for those unable to work and the right to marry and manage one's own affairs; further believes that stigma is in fact a form of discrimination and should be tackled by anti-discrimination laws; 36. Recognises that an element of the stigma is a widespread perception that mental health disorders are acute and lifelong, whereas it is important to stress that, with appropriate help, people can recover, while others will achieve remission or a sufficient level of functionality or stability; 37. Emphasises the need to reform mental health services so that they are based on high-quality com- munity care at home or in sheltered accommodation with access to proper health and social care; with regular monitoring and assessment; with respite care for people with mental health problems and their carers; with a one-stop-shop approach to accessing health, social, housing, training, transport, benefits and other services; stresses that this should be backed up by a range of in-patient services for acute, chronic or secure needs but always with independent monitoring of anyone who receives compulsory in-patient care; 38. Stresses, with this in mind, the need to support cooperatives formed by psychiatric patients and all activities geared to the inclusion of users and former patients and to earmark resources for the training of staff, so as to enable them to take account of all the needs of psychiatric patients; 39. Stresses the need for continuous training on mental health matters for general and family practi- tioners and other professionals in primary health care services; C 305 E/152 EN 14.12.2006 Official Journal of the European Union Wednesday 6 September 2006 ",
        "40. Recognises that local government has an integral role to play in promoting good mental health, supporting those in poor mental health within their local communities and bringing together the various strands of a multi-agency approach to mental health service delivery; 41. Believes that dual diagnosis of people with mental health and addiction problems should normally lead to concurrent treatment; 42. Stresses that mental and physical aspects of health are interlinked, that mental disorders can have a biological, social, emotional or historical basis which must be addressed in order for other approaches to be successful, and that some psychiatric medicines can actually worsen the underlying biological condition; 43. Calls for greater attention to the psychological consequences and symptoms of somatic diseases; stresses the need to give equal importance to mental and physical well-being in hospital care protocols, including for the treatment of serious and/or incurable illnesses; and believes it is essential for medical and paramedical personnel working in other specialised fields to undergo continuous training in psychopathol- ogy since disorders often remain undiagnosed or are underestimated; 44. Supports the Commission's comments on deinstitutionalisation, as long-term stay in psychiatric insti- tutions can lead to the protraction and exacerbation of psychopathological conditions, reinforcement of stigma and social exclusion, but acknowledges that greater efforts must be made to convince the public of the better results achieved when people with severe mental or learning disorders receive care in the com- munity; 45. Suggests that the Commission should collect, through the Public Health Programme, data on mental illness, recovery rates of treated patients and the effectiveness of their reintegration in society; 46. Suggests the Commission identify sites and examples of good practice and disseminate details of these to all Member States, these \u2018 Demonstration Sites \u2019 being comparable to WHO sites under their \u2018 Nations for Mental Health \u2019 programme; considers that demonstration sites, \u2018 demonstration treatments \u2019 and \u2018 demon- stration prevention strategies \u2019 could be important ways of reducing mental health inequalities between Member States; calls on the Commission to involve knowledge institutes in identifying demonstration sites, demonstration treatments and demonstration prevention strategies; 47. Believes that, because all persons (according to UN General Assembly Resolution A/RES/46/119 of 17 December 1991 on the protection of persons with mental illness and the improvement of mental health care) have the right to the best available mental health care, best practice and relevant information should be disseminated and be available to all citizens; 48. Believes that the term \u2018 treatment \u2019 should be interpreted broadly, with the emphasis on identifying and eliminating social and environmental factors, while the use of medication should be a last resort, particularly in the case of children and young people; criticises the growing medicalisation and pathologisation of life stages, without a comprehensive search for causes; calls for account to be taken of factors such as personal experiences, family, social support and living and working conditions which play a role in mental illness as well as genetic factors; 49. Draws attention to the large number of children who grow up in state care institutions in some Member States, especially in some of the new ones; urges the Commission to support more effectively the creation of alternative systems, which would help parents from risk groups to care for their children prop- erly; calls for the \u2018 Child and adolescent mental health in an enlarged Europe: development of effective policies and practices \u2019 project, which would coordinate progress in children's mental health strategy in the Member States, to be started as quickly as possible and effectively implemented; 14.12.2006 EN C 305 E/153 Official Journal of the European Union Wednesday 6 September 2006 ",
        "50. Further believes that in addition to treatment, an appropriate social and work environment as well as family and community support are required to prevent mental health problems and improve and promote mental well-being and the therapeutic strategy for and rehabilitation of sufferers of mental disorder; stresses the need for research into environments conducive to mental health and recovery; 51. Urges the Commission to support continuing reforms in any Member State that practised the abuse of psychiatry, over-use of medication or incarceration, or inhumane practices such as caged beds or exces- sive use of seclusion rooms, particularly in some of the new Member States; stresses that in some of the new Member States mental health indicators in society are as a rule drifting in the wrong direction, with a lot of suicides, violence and dependencies, especially on alcohol; underlines that these countries inherited inadequate mental health care systems and large psychiatric and care institutions which increase social exclusion and stigma, while at the same time there is a lack of community services which need to be integrated into general health and social protection systems; calls on the Commission to place the reform of psychiatry on the agenda for EU accession negotiations; considers that prison is not a suitable environ- ment for those suffering mental ill health and that alternatives should be actively pursued; 52. Calls for more research into therapeutic and psychological interventions, into the development of more effective drugs with fewer side effects, into determinants of mental disorders and suicide, into outcome measurements for investment in mental health promotion and into methods contributing to successful recovery and remission; calls, in particular, for special attention to be devoted to research into medicines more suitable for children; stresses, moreover, that research must not be confined to pharmaceuticals but must extend to epidemiological, psychological and economic studies on the community and the social determinants of mental illness; further calls for an increase in the involvement of service users in all aspects of mental health research; 53. Believes further that more research is needed into stigma and ways to counter it; the experience of individual service users and their carers; working relations between different services and professions and former service users; and cross-border provision; 54. Believes that mental heath services should receive sufficient funding to reflect the cost of mental disorders to individuals, health and social care services, and society as a whole, so as to be effective and command public confidence; 55. Believes that it is essential to apply high quality, individualised methods of promoting mental health, taking into account the particular needs of individuals and target groups; 56. Recognises the valuable contribution that family members and informal carers make to supporting people with mental health problems, and equally recognises that many of them will have their own care needs, and will need information and support from professionals if they are to continue providing care; further recognises the valuable contribution that service users can make in supporting each other; 57. Stresses the need to use vocabulary and terminology which will help to combat stigma, e.g. measures to eliminate prejudice, change attitudes and criticise stereotypes in regard to every category of mental dis- order; 58. Calls for a \u2018 Mental Health Coordinating and Monitoring Group \u2019 to be established by the Commission to collect information on mental health practice and promotion in the EU, to assess the adequacy (in terms of numbers and training) of existing mental health professionals and infrastructure, and to disseminate information on best practice to all Member States and all parties involved in the treatment of mental health; stresses that patients' organisations, those providing treatment, care institutions and knowledge institutes must be involved in this Coordinating and Monitoring Group; C 305 E/154 EN 14.12.2006 Official Journal of the European Union Wednesday 6 September 2006 ",
        "59. Calls on the Commission to follow up the Green Paper with a proposal for a directive on mental health in Europe and the defence of and respect for the civil and fundamental rights of persons suffering from mental disorders; 60. Urges the EU and ACP countries to work closely on investing in good mental health through devel- opment and Cotonou policies; 61.

P6_TA(2006)0342 Simplifying and improving the Common Fisheries Policy (2006-2008) European Parliament resolution on the 2006-2008 Action Plan for simplifying and improving the Common Fisheries Policy (2006/2053(INI)) The European Parliament , \u2014 having regard to the Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parlia- ment entitled \u2018 2006-2008 Action Plan for simplifying and improving the Common Fisheries Policy \u2019 (COM(2005)0647), \u2014 having regard to the Commission Communication entitled \u2018 Perspectives for simplifying and improving the regulatory environment of the Common Fisheries Policy \u2019 (COM(2004)0820) and the Commission staff working document entitled \u2018 Analysis of the possibilities of simplification and improvement of the regulatory environment of the Common Fisheries Policy and of its implementation \u2019 (SEC(2004)1596), \u2014 having regard to the Commission Communication to the European Parliament, the Council, the Euro- pean Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions entitled \u2018 Implementing the Community Lisbon Programme: a strategy for the simplification of the regulatory environment \u2019 (COM (2005)0535), \u2014 having regard to the Council conclusions of 15 April 2005 concerning the Commission Communica- tion entitled \u2018 Perspectives for simplifying and improving the regulatory environment of the Common Fisheries Policy \u2019 (8077/2005), \u2014 having regard to the interinstitutional agreement on better law-making which was concluded on 16 December 2003 by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission ( 1 ), \u2014 having regard to Rule 45 of its Rules of Procedure, \u2014 having regard to the report of the Committee on Fisheries (A6-0228/2006), A. whereas improving and simplifying the legislative environment with a view to making it more efficient and transparent is a priority task for the European Union which will benefit ordinary people and help to increase competitiveness, growth and sustainable development, thereby contributing to the achieve- ment of the Lisbon objectives, B. whereas administrative bodies in the Member States and those who work in the fisheries sector deplore the dispersal and the juxtaposition of measures, the lack of clarity and accessibility in the case of existing texts and the difficulties stemming from the administrative burden created by a multitude of requirements, some of which are superfluous, C. whereas the task of simplifying the rules governing the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) calls for the extensive involvement of fishermen and of the other parties concerned, ( 1 ) OJ C 321, 31.12.2003, p. 1. 14.12.2006 EN C 305 E/155 Official Journal of the European Union Wednesday 6 September 2006 ",
        "D. whereas the fishing industry must be consulted within deadlines which will allow its effective participa- tion and upstream involvement in the decision-making process, E. whereas the effectiveness of the CFP is closely linked to the introduction of a harmonised inspection and monitoring system applicable to all who work in the fisheries sector, 1. Warmly welcomes this sectoral action plan designed to simplify and improve the CFP; 2. Fully supports the objectives established by the Commission, in particular those concerned with making existing texts simpler, clearer and more accessible, reducing the workload and the administrative costs shouldered by the administrative bodies responsible for fisheries, and reducing the burdens and the restrictions imposed on fishermen; 3. Welcomes the methodology proposed by the Commission, in particular the drawing up of a three-year action plan covering the 2006-2008 period; 4. Agrees with the Commission's view that simplification efforts must focus on conservation policy and the monitoring of fishing activities; 5. Considers that there must genuinely be more extensive pre-legislative consultation of all the parties affected by the measures envisaged and that such consultation should be carried out as far as possible at an early stage, in order to enable the interested parties to make an effective contribution to the preparatory work prior to any legislative proposal; 6. Considers that all legislative proposals must be preceded by impact analyses and that the latter must be based on accurate, objective and comprehensive information and must be made public at the appropriate time; 7. Considers that there must be an adequate period of time between the date of adoption and the date of implementation of any new rules, in order to enable the parties concerned to adapt; 8. Considers that regulatory texts must be drawn up more precisely and in a way that can be understood by stakeholders; 9. Considers that assessments concerning the effectiveness and the implementation of the measures adopted must be carried out systematically on the basis of objective and clearly defined indicators; 10. Insists that the advisory bodies (in particular the Regional Advisory Councils and the Advisory Com- mittee on Fisheries and Aquaculture) must play an integral role in the process of simplification and of assessing the effectiveness and implementation of existing and new measures; considers that closer consulta- tion with these bodies would undoubtedly result in those involved in the fisheries sector identifying more closely with fisheries legislation; 11. Considers that the legal structure of the provisions relating to technical measures, to fisheries man- agement measures, to monitoring measures and to catch limits must be revised with a particular view to clarifying texts, making them more consistent and easier to read, deleting obsolete provisions and both condensing and consolidating the provisions relating to each aspect of the CFP; 12. Supports the simplification guidelines set out in the action plan for regulating the total allowable catches (TACs)/quotas and the fishing effort, in particular the separate treatment of the various existing components, the targeting of decisions at uniform groups and the development of multiannual approaches; 13. Welcomes the Commission's intention to reform existing legislation by gradually bringing together technical measures relating to each fishery, whilst at the same time clarifying the provisions in force and ensuring that the rules as a whole are more consistent and better coordinated; C 305 E/156 EN 14.12.2006 Official Journal of the European Union Wednesday 6 September 2006 ",
        "14. Rejects the possibility outlined by the Commission of submitting a \u2018 short \u2019 regulation on technical measures to the Council, which would be followed by detailed Commission regulations, since such vital aspects as the body of technical measures by which the Community fleet is to be governed cannot be removed from debate and approval by the European Parliament and the Council; 15. Takes the view that special attention should be paid to the possibility whereby the Member States may be authorised to adopt certain locally applicable technical measures; considers that, with a view to preventing such arrangements from having an adverse environmental impact, the use thereof should be periodically assessed; 16. Notes that Article 9 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 of 20 December 2002 on the con- servation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the Common Fisheries Policy ( 1 ) already permits Member States to adopt non-discriminatory measures for the conservation and management of fisheries resources and to minimise the effect of fishing on the conservation of marine eco-systems within 12 nautical miles of their baselines; urges that the Commission proceed cautiously with any extension of this principle, as an authorisation to adopt certain locally applicable technical measures could result in the emergence of discriminatory conditions in the Member States concerned; 17. Approves of the development on a case-by-case basis of targeted approaches for individual regions or individual fisheries, duly based on scientific resource-protection criteria and thorough socio-economic impact analyses, and considers that all the parties concerned should be closely involved in the development of such approaches; 18. Considers that the recovery and management plans proposed by the Commission as part of the CFP need to be made flexible in line with the actual circumstances for fishing in the various Member States; 19. Approves of the increased use of computers, of information technologies and of automation in order to facilitate access to Community legislation and to facilitate and rationalise the collection and the transfer of data intended both for administrators in the Member States and for people who work in the sector; 20. Considers that information on legislation must not be forwarded only through institutional channels but must also reach the interested parties directly, in particular through associations, Regional Advisory Councils, the Internet and the drafting of codes of conduct; 21. Considers that the use of new technologies on board fishing vessels should be increased gradually, with exemptions to be made in the case of the smallest vessels and with sufficiently long transition periods to be established in order to enable the sector to adapt; 22. Considers that Community aid should be granted for the development of the new technologies and for the specific training required; 23. Considers that the provisions concerning all aspects relating to the monitoring and surveillance of fishing activities must be consolidated and recast; 24. Calls upon the Commission to revise the Community provisions relating to minimum sizes with a view to harmonising them; 25. States once again that a harmonised inspection and monitoring system applicable to all who work in the sector and accompanied by a uniform set of interpretation provisions and penalty procedures should be established as a matter of urgency in order to bolster fishermen's trust in the basic principle of equal treatment; considers that the Community Fisheries Monitoring Agency should contribute to the achievement of this objective; 26. Welcomes the general principle concerning the rationalisation of the reporting requirements imposed on the Member States and on the sector but emphasises the crucial role played by certain Commission reports, in particular those which serve to monitor the implementation of the CFP; ( 1 ) OJ L 358, 31.12.2002, p. 59. 14.12.2006 EN C 305 E/157 Official Journal of the European Union Wednesday 6 September 2006 ",
        "27. Considers that the administration of authorisations outside Community waters (and of catch and effort data relating to such activities) should be clarified, improved and computerised, and welcomes the initiatives which the Commission has already undertaken in this area; 28. Agrees with the Commission that the complex and lengthy procedures applied by the European Union in order to transpose the provisions adopted by Regional Fisheries Organisations into Community legislation are completely undesirable, but takes the view that most of the complexity in transposition stems from excessive bureaucracy within the Commission itself and therefore categorically rejects the possibility that any simplification process should be carried out at the expense of robbing the European Parliament of its responsibilities as regards intervening in legislative procedures; 29. Calls, furthermore, upon the Commission to finalise a \u2018 standard agreement \u2019 for the two main cate- gories of fisheries partnership agreement (mixed and tuna) on the basis of which the rights and the obliga- tions of the two parties (Community and third country) will be enshrined; 30. Considers that the process of negotiating and monitoring fisheries partnership agreements should be reworked and simplified as a matter of priority and welcomes the efforts which the Commission has recently made in this area; 31. Is willing to contribute actively to the effort required to implement the simplification process and calls for an on-going interinstitutional dialogue on better law-making in relation to the CFP; 32.

Notes that the Commission has altered its proposal pursuant to Article 250(2) of the EC Treaty and, in particular, that the principle of proportionality, the demand for more transparency, the excluded-participants database and the Member States' annual reports have been incorporated, as called for by Parliament in its amendments adopted on 15 March 2006; 2.

        "C. whereas the conclusion of the SAA with Albania places relations between the European Union and Albania on a new contractual basis that provides new opportunities for Albania to promote the rule of law, strengthen its democratic institutions, contribute to its stability, which is of the utmost impor- tance for the whole region, and deepen cooperation with the European Union, D. whereas the Thessaloniki European Council of 19 and 20 June 2003 reiterated its determination to fully and effectively support the European perspective of the Western Balkan countries, which will become an integral part of the EU once they meet the established criteria, E. whereas Albania is still facing serious challenges in tackling corruption and organised crime, achieving full implementation of adopted legislation, improving public administration and fighting trafficking in human beings and drugs, F. whereas the last parliamentary elections in Albania were criticised as being not wholly in line with OSCE/ODIHR commitments and other international standards for democratic elections, 1. Welcomes the SAA, which holds out the prospect of a close and far-reaching contractual relationship between the EU and Albania and which will be instrumental in achieving political, economic and institu- tional stability in the country as well as in the whole region and in promoting the transformation of Albania into a pluralist democracy respecting the rule of law, with a functioning market economy; 2. Believes that progress in achieving the standards laid down in the SAA should be monitored by means of concrete measurable benchmarks by the SAA Council and the relevant joint parliamentary committee; 3. Draws attention to the long-term benefits of the SAA for both the Albanian people and the EU; notes that the major advantages of the SAA lie in the achievement of the goal of a complete free trade area and the establishment of a clear legal commitment to cooperation in the areas of common concern, as well as the promotion of a more stable legal environment for investors; 4. Urges the EU and Albania to use the SAA as a mutually beneficial opportunity; furthermore advises Albania to exploit the opportunity to find its own niche on the European market and develop competitive- ness in targeted sectors; 5. Recommends that Albania focus more strongly on developing its economic potential, not least through the improvement and possibly the expansion of its existing transport infrastructure and the devel- opment of environmentally and socially sustainable tourism; regrets the recent cuts in external action assist- ance as provided for in the Financial Framework; calls on the Commission to earmark sufficient funds for the improvement of the country's infrastructure, in particular for the development of public transport; 6. Confirms, in line with the conclusions of the Thessaloniki European Council of 19 and 20 June 2003, its full support for Albania's European perspective and future integration into the European family; believes, however, that the Albanian commitment to European values and standards is first and foremost for its own benefit and should also be pursued as a goal in itself; 7. Notes the reforms Albania has undertaken in order to create a state based on principles of democracy, the rule of law, the free market economy and the protection of human rights and good governance; stresses, however, that Albania needs to expand these reforms and show more tangible results, in line with the provisions set out in the European Partnership, and establish a sustained record of successful implementa- tion of the SAA in order to move to a further stage in European integration; is particularly concerned about the lack of substantial progress as regards full implementation of adopted laws; considers it vital to con- siderably strengthen administrative capacity, to reform the judiciary and strengthen its independence, to protect women's rights, to fight organised crime and to promote media freedom, while the media them- selves should strive for transparency; C 305 E/160 EN 14.12.2006 Official Journal of the European Union Wednesday 6 September 2006 ",
        "8. Notes that the government has committed itself to cracking down on organised crime, including the decision to ban the use of speedboats in order to combat trafficking in human beings and drug smuggling, but insists that Albania must demonstrate further substantial progress in combating all forms of organised crime, in particular trafficking in women and children for the purposes of sexual exploitation, exploitation at work or compelling them to beg, as a prerequisite for intensified cooperation with the EU; calls on the Commission to continue and reinforce its support to the Albanian authorities in this regard; 9. Notes the efforts of the government in the fight against corruption and organised crime; observes that corruption is one of the main obstacles to the economic and social development of Albania and therefore expects the government's campaign to continue to show tangible results; is of the opinion that corruption has no political colour and should be fought irrespective of any political affiliation; 10. Encourages Albanian governmental bodies to empower civil society by providing it with greater opportunities to participate in the formulation of policy and in the monitoring of its implementation and effectiveness at all levels of government, to improve the quality and credibility of reform, as well as to increase transparency and accountability; 11. Notes with respect the efforts undertaken by the Education Minister to reform the education sector but urges the government to guarantee equal education opportunities for children all over the country; 12. Stresses that there are still significant violations of human rights in Albania which should be addressed; urges the Albanian Government to implement the necessary reforms to give detainees access to defence in legal proceedings and to combat torture, brutality or inhuman or degrading treatment; calls on the government to carry out the relevant legislative reforms required for the full implementation of the 2003 Family Code, particularly as regards making domestic violence a criminal offence; 13. Reiterates its call on the Commission to help Albania to put an end to the persistence of the \u2018 blood feud \u2019 , which constitutes a failure of the rule of law and is fundamentally at odds with European values; 14. Notes that the current electoral system was used during the last parliamentary elections in 2005 to distort the principle of proportionality, also known as the \u2018 Dushk phenomenon \u2019 , and urges the Albanian Government and Parliament to further reform the system before the forthcoming local elections following the recommendations formulated by the OSCE/ODIHR, in particular as regards the accuracy of voter lists and of civil registers; 15. Calls on Albania to make further efforts to protect minority rights, including the rights of the Greek minority in Albania, and to complete and implement its minority-related legislation so that it supports the implementation of the relevant international conventions ratified by Albania; observes that further efforts are needed, in particular, as regards increasing the use of minority languages in citizens' dealings with the authorities and the display of traditional local names, improving access to the media for members of min- ority groups and extending minority language education; notes the shortage of accurate statistical informa- tion on national minorities; 16. Expresses its concern at the recent threats by the opposition to boycott the forthcoming local elec- tions; calls, in this respect, on all parties to act in a responsible manner, making every effort to reach an agreement on delicate issues such as the law governing the media and the list of voters; 17. Welcomes the positive and constructive role that Albania has played in multilateral regional initia- tives; underlines, however, the need to continue to promote regional cooperation and good neighbourly relations with regard to key issues affecting South East Europe, such as cross-border cooperation, the free movement of persons, fighting organised crime and trafficking, establishing a free trade area capable of attracting foreign investment, sharing environmental resources and developing integrated trans-border net- works; 14.12.2006 EN C 305 E/161 Official Journal of the European Union Wednesday 6 September 2006 ",
        "18. Takes the view that, on account of economic under-development, Albania should devote special attention to developing economic cooperation in the region, in particular with its direct neighbours; con- siders that Montenegrin independence, the negotiations on the future status of Kosovo, and the opening of negotiations on EU membership with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in the near future should be seen as additional opportunities for economic cooperation and development in Albania and the region as a whole; 19. Takes the view that Albania has a particularly important role to play in the stabilisation of South East Europe with regard, in particular, to the final status of Kosovo; urges the Albanian Government and its leaders to continue to adopt a constructive approach in this respect; 20. Underlines the importance of the Union's assistance missions for capacity building and welcomes the results achieved by the police assistance mission (Pameca), customs assistance mission (EU-CAFAO Albania) and the judicial assistance mission (Euralius); taking into account the extensiveness and complexity of the fight against organised crime in the Western Balkans, calls on the Commission to substantially increase and strengthen EU assistance in the police (Pameca) and rule of law (Euralius) area; calls on the EU and Albania in this context to take advantage, by means of twinning and secondment programmes, of the extensive knowledge and experience gained by the new Member States in reforming their societies and economies in the EU integration process, in particular as regards adopting and implementing the legislation on land and property restitution, including for religious communities, and strengthening the border guard and customs authorities; 21. Welcomes the conclusion of the readmission agreement with Albania in November 2005 and calls for a visa facilitation agreement between the EU and Albania within the framework of visa facilitation for all the countries of the Western Balkans in order to facilitate cross-border exchanges for the business commun- ity, social partners, academia and students as a first step; stresses, however, that the ultimate objective must be to facilitate travel for all citizens; 22. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission and the Govern- ment and Parliament of the Republic of Albania.

Looks forward to the advent of the EU-China Strategic Partnership and the closer cooperation which this will entail on a wide range of issues; urges the Council and the Commission to formulate a consistent and coherent policy towards China; 2. Welcomes the work of the Commission in the sectoral dialogues with China, which currently cover a wide range of issues, ranging from environmental issues to social affairs and human rights, and requests that Parliament be briefed at regular intervals on progress made; 3. Calls on China and the EU to establish their partnership and bilateral relationship on the basis of mutual openness and on the fundamental basis of credibility, stability responsibility and mutual understand- ing; urges both China and the EU to improve their cooperation on this basis in order to play a stable, responsible and credible role within the international community; 4. Regrets that increased trade and economic relations with China have brought about no substantial progress in the field of democracy, human rights and the rule of law, which are basic components of the political dialogue between China and the EU; takes the view, in this respect, that the development of trade relations with China must go hand in hand with the development of a genuine, fruitful and effective politi- cal dialogue; 14.12.2006 EN C 305 E/223 Official Journal of the European Union Thursday 7 September 2006 ",
        "Economic situation 5. Notes that the EU, after enlargement, overtook Japan to become China's largest trading partner and that, at the same time, China rose from being the EU's third trading partner to become its second largest, after the US; 6. Notes that in 2005, the Chinese trade balance amounted to USD 102 billion, which is more than twice as much as in the previous bench-mark year (USD 32 billion); that in 2005, currency reserves amounted to approximately USD 819 billion \u2014 an increase of USD 209 billion compared to the previous year; that if this trend continues, China is likely to have at its disposal over USD 1000 billion in foreign reserves at the end of 2006, making it the world's largest holder of foreign currency; that initial predictions for 2006 point to a capital inflow of some USD 50 billion, primarily in long-term direct private invest- ments; welcomes in this connection the fact that China has started to relax pegging its currency (Renminbi) to the US dollar and is thus not opposed to a possible currency revaluation; considers that warnings about insufficient risk surcharges for lending operations should be taken seriously; 7. Takes note of China's rapid economic development, making it the world's fourth biggest economy in dollar terms, even at its current undervalued rate; accordingly calls on the Commission to exert political and economic pressure aimed at bringing flexibility to bear on the exchange rate of the Chinese currency, which is being pegged at an artificially low value, a situation that runs counter to gradual world trade liberalisation; calls on China to gradually float its exchange rate; calls on China to replace the fixed linking of its currency to the dollar with a linkage to a basket of currencies including the euro; 8. Is concerned about the development of inequality and unfair distribution of wealth, mass unemploy- ment and uncontrolled urbanisation, the rising crime rate and corruption and not least the environmental problems of China; 9. Recognises that China is more than a fast-growing market; underlines the fact that the on-going technological revolution of a country of this size has huge implications in a global economy; 10. Considers that balanced economic development is of great importance to both China and the EU; underlines the fact that stagnation of the Chinese economy due to uncontrolled growth is a serious threat both to China's internal stability and to the wellbeing of the global economy; recognises that rapid eco- nomic growth in China presents a huge challenge to global efforts to tackle climate change, with CO 2 emissions from coal-fired power stations set to double by 2030; 11. Welcomes the fact that in autumn 2006 the Commission took the initiative of publishing a strategy paper on the Union's long-term economic and trade relations with China in order to anticipate more adequately the impact of China's economic rise and to avoid ad hoc decision-making, thus helping to ensure that China will no longer be considered a threat, but be perceived as a challenge and an evolving partner; 12. Stresses that an increasingly positive trade relationship should also result in human rights reforms and recognises that, until there is a legally binding code of conduct on arms exports and until the situation regarding human rights and civil and political freedoms \u2014 including the Tiananmen Square issue \u2014 has been properly addressed, the EU should not lift the arms embargo; 13. Calls on China to develop a solid and credible investment climate for foreign trade and industry and to give absolute priority to improving legal security for foreign companies; 14. Reminds China that a further opening of its markets to foreign companies and investment, especially in the telecommunications, banking and financial services sectors, is to be seen as an integral part of the strategic partnership; calls on China to reform its market and its economic system accordingly, and to comply more rigorously with the anti-dumping rules and enforce them more strictly; C 305 E/224 EN 14.12.2006 Official Journal of the European Union Thursday 7 September 2006 ",
        "15. In the light of the findings of the anti-dumping investigation in the footwear sector, which proved that China had been practising State intervention and social dumping, and of the steps taken by the Com- mission to correct this distortion of competition, urges the Union to make its trading partners, such as China, comply with fair and equitable international trade rules; calls on the Commission, when considering, as it is shortly due to do, how the anti-dumping measures should be used, to simplify the procedures so that anti-dumping mechanisms can be employed more readily by SMEs; furthermore, calls for the anti-dumping procedure to be made more transparent; 16. Takes the view that, within the framework of efforts to modernise and liberalise the Chinese banking system, the EU should continue to work closely with the Chinese authorities with a view to adopting international accounting standards and the Basel II standards, which would ensure greater security for EU investors; 17. Welcomes the rapid modernisation of the Chinese financial sector; stresses, however, the utmost importance of ensuring a smooth transition so as to avoid any financial instability with possible repercus- sions across global financial markets; suggests, in particular, that a \u2018 race to the bottom \u2019 involving harmful regulatory competition between global financial marketplaces should be avoided; suggests, on the contrary, that major regulators worldwide should promote standards of the highest quality; recalls that the EU itself is committed to the global convergence of standards in the areas of accounting (International Financial Report- ing Standards), audit (International Standards on Auditing), capital requirements for credit institutions (Basel II), money laundering and the fight against financing terrorism (Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) recommendations) and securities market regulation (International Organization of Secu- rities Commissions standards); points out that the EU would be ready to offer its experience and assistance to the Chinese authorities to implement convergence where necessary; 18. Considers that China is faced with considerable regional development disparities and more general income disparities, and that the new Chinese leadership must commit itself to tackling these problems with the help and expertise of the Commission; 19. Calls on China to use a transparent and fair procedure in the award of public procurement contracts which gives foreign undertakings equal opportunities to participate; 20. Considers that the pirating and counterfeiting of European products and brands by Chinese industries constitutes a serious violation of international trading rules; urges China to considerably improve the pro- tection of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) with regard to both Chinese and foreign inventions; calls on China to uphold current laws regarding the protection of IPR; welcomes the creation of an IPR chair at the University of Beijing; 21. Recognises the importance of MES for China; underlines, however, the fact that MES is an economic rather than a political instrument; urges China to reduce state interference in the economy and to improve its performance as regards its uneven compliance with corporate governance and accounting systems and its ineffective bankruptcy framework; 22. Notes that the recent problems in the footwear sector show the need for China to adopt a more adequate anti-dumping policy; stresses the urgency of such a policy in the light of China's WTO member- ship; 23. Calls on the Council and the Commission to recognise that the difficulties faced by the textile, clothing, and footwear sectors are systemic, and calls on the Commission, when revising its economic and trade strategy in relation to China, to correct the current imbalances and anticipate the challenges; 24. Calls on China to adopt an economic policy based more on social (education, health, pensions, etc.) and household consumption and less on investment and exports; 25. Calls on the Commission to support the Chinese authorities in their campaign against intellectual property rights violations and product piracy; 14.12.2006 EN C 305 E/225 Official Journal of the European Union Thursday 7 September 2006 ",
        "Internal situation 26. Shares the view that the future development of China is currently difficult to predict and will mainly depend on domestic issues such as the further smooth development of the economy and the gradual improvement of the living standards of the majority of the population; 27. Wholly agrees with the conclusion in the above-mentioned White Paper that the concept of democ- racy and awareness of legal concepts inside the whole of Chinese society will need subsequent strengthen- ing; 28. Underlines the fact that the rapid socio-economic modernisation of the PRC should be combined with the necessary political pluralism and institutional modernisation and that it can amply nurture itself from indigenous sources such as the works of the liberal reformers of the late 19th century, and especially the basic thinking of Sun Yat-sen; 29. Notes that social security, health and safety in the workplace, the right to form trade unions, indus- trial relations and social dialogue represent major challenges for China's future; calls on China to ratify key International Labour Organization Conventions, particularly Convention 87 concerning Freedom of Asso- ciation and Protection of the Right to Organise and 98 on Collective Bargaining and to comply with the framework provisions of the International Labour Organization regarding effective measures to combat all forms of modern slavery, child labour and exploitation, particularly of female workers, so as to ensure respect for the fundamental rights of workers and discourage social dumping; invites the Commission to intensify and to report back regularly on the structured dialogue with its Chinese counterparts in these fields; 30. Takes the view that the denial of the right to form independent trade unions is counter-productive in the light of the increasing protests and demonstrations by workers throughout China against forced lay-offs, unpaid wages and other benefits, official corruption and mismanagement; therefore calls on the Chinese government to recognise and to guarantee the basic right to freedom of expression and association and the right to strike; 31. Draws attention to the increasing problem of child labour in China and the adverse working condi- tions faced by child workers in the country despite the fact that child labour is prohibited under Chinese labour law; therefore urges the Chinese authorities not only to improve the enforcement of the law but also to tackle the root causes of the problem of child labour, such as growing economic disparities, the rapidly changing social structure and the failure of the educational system to provide adequate and affordable education for all children; 32. Expresses its concern about the appalling socio-economic discrimination against China's 150 million migrant labourers from the countryside, takes note of the measures taken by the Chinese government to solve the problem, signalled by the new government guidelines officially published on 28 March 2006, and expresses its intention to follow the results of the implementation of this new policy carefully; 33. Calls on the European Union to continue to keep the situation in Macao and Hong Kong under careful review and hopes that the encouraging aspects of the two experiences will serve as an example and a stimulus to move the Chinese political process forward; 34. Postulates that as long as the CCP is not subjected to the order of a constitutional state, the party will remain a state within the state and thus very vulnerable to serious instances of abuse of power such as the national evil of cadre corruption, such a situation undermining the chances of creating a society based on the rule of law; 35. Joins its voice to the criticism, expressed in Chinese lawyers' journals, that Article 126 of the Chinese Constitution should also include a prohibition on interference by the CCP or the Chinese Government in the course of justice; 36. Expects fresh efforts to be made to strengthen the independence of the judiciary, and trusts that the gradual replacement of unqualified judges by competent jurists will curb the endemic corruption inside the judiciary and thus enhance popular trust in this fundamental state institution; C 305 E/226 EN 14.12.2006 Official Journal of the European Union Thursday 7 September 2006 ",
        "37. Welcomes the promise made by the President of the Supreme People's Court at the 10th National People's Congress that from July 2006 appeals against sentences imposing the death penalty will be con- ducted in open court; expects this promise to be acted upon; 38. Urges China to abolish the death penalty and declare an effective moratorium in respect of persons already sentenced; takes note of the significant signal given by Chinese jurists that the death penalty should be imposed only in cases of serious, violent crimes, by contrast with the present situation, in which 68 offences are punishable by the death penalty, of which half do not involve capital offences; is concerned that China carries out far more executions than any other country in the world; calls on China to release its official figures for executions in the year 2005/2006; 39. Strongly supports the demand made by Professor Liu Renwen, jurist and member of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, for the illegal trade in the organs of executed people to be brought to an end, by imposing strict provisions and controls; 40. Is seriously concerned about the harsh action taken by the authorities against \u2018 agitators \u2019 ; notes that, according to a Blue Paper emanating from the Beijing Academy of Social Sciences, reasons for mass protests have included especially grave environmental problems that have endangered the health and existence of many farmers in newly industrialised regions, and also shameful expropriations of farmland for building purposes, not to mention the arbitrariness and corruption of local authorities; 41. Welcomes the intention of the Chinese Government to bridge the growing income gap between the populations of the coastal regions and of the countryside, to tackle serious environmental problems, to demonstrate better stewardship of natural resources and to develop and stimulate more efficient technolo- gies; 42. Draws attention to the impact of China's economic growth on natural resources and on the local and global environment notably as a result of CO 2 emissions; calls on the Chinese Government to take all the necessary measures to protect the environment and in particular to ensure supplies of drinking water for the populace and take action in response to atmospheric pollution, and to conserve biodiversity; calls for an intensive dialogue between China and the European Union on natural resources and the environment; 43. Urges the authorities to supervise their investment programmes in favour of the countryside very carefully, in the light of the fear expressed by Chinese researchers that local party cadres interpret references to \u2018 new villages \u2019 as a call for building projects at the expense of the farmers, and in view of the established fact that, hitherto, only one fifth of state subsidies for the agrarian sector has actually reached the farmers entitled thereto; 44. Is very concerned about recent reports of continuing serious human rights abuses in Tibetan areas of China, including torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, house arrest and other non-judicial surveillance of dissidents, detention without public trial, repression of religious freedom and arbitrary restrictions on free movement; is deeply concerned about the intensification of the so-called \u2018 patriotic education \u2019 campaign since October 2005 in Tibet's monasteries and nunneries, forcing Tibetans to sign declarations denouncing the Dalai Lama as a dangerous separatist and proclaiming Tibet to be \u2018 part of China \u2019 , including the arrest of monks from the Drepung Monastery in November 2005 for refusing to denounce the Dalai Lama; calls upon China to allow an independent body to have access to Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, the Panchen Lama of Tibet, and his parents, as requested by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child; calls upon the Chinese Government to intensify its positive engagement in substantive negotiations regarding the demands of the Dalai Lama for autonomy for Tibet; 45. Takes note that China's \u2018 one-child \u2019 policy has resulted in an imbalance in population distribution; urges China to recognise the fact that the future balance between the working and the non-working parts of the population will have huge economic effects; underlines the fact that the EU is also confronted with the problem of ageing; calls on China to rethink the concrete implementation of its \u2018 one-child \u2019 policy in order to tackle the economic and social disadvantages inherent in that policy; 14.12.2006 EN C 305 E/227 Official Journal of the European Union Thursday 7 September 2006 ",
        "46. Urges the Chinese authorities to provide for measures in national legislation to protect the welfare of, and prevent cruelty to, animals, especially as regards the rearing of animals farmed for their fur; urges China to stop the abuse of animals for purposes of traditional medicine, as exemplified by the use of rhinoceros horn and bear bile; Human rights 47. Underlines the fact that the upholding of basic rights by the PRC requires the setting-up of a Con- stitutional Court, without which constitutional amendments, such as that of March 2004 on human rights, remain largely symbolic; 48. Stresses that Chinese citizens should have a legal entitlement to their basic rights, and urges courts to fully address clear iniquities on the basis of the Constitution, thereby pursuing a healthy judicial process that is now, little by little, gaining momentum; 49. Draws attention to the need for the state to abstain from regulating religion and expressions thereof; affirms the need, particularly in the light of the discussions among Chinese officials about the definition of \u2018 religion \u2019 and especially \u2018 legal religion \u2019 , for a comprehensive law on religion meeting international standards and guaranteeing genuine religious freedom; 50. Deplores the contradiction between the constitutional freedom of belief (enshrined in Article 36 of the Constitution) and the ongoing interference of the State in the affairs of religious communities, in par- ticular as regards the training, selection, appointment and political indoctrination of ministers of religion; deplores especially the fact that the State accords the right of legal existence to only five religions and, moreover, places them under the control of the corresponding Chinese \u2018 patriotic \u2019 religious associations, protecting only \u2018 normal \u2019 (zhengchang) religious activities and making their official registration subject to acceptance of the principles underlying the umbrella organization the \u2018 Three Autonomies \u2019 ; 51. Calls on the Council to inform it regarding the measures taken to follow up the declaration made in its above-mentioned resolution of 8 September 2005 regarding the fates of various bishops incarcerated in the PRC for their religious convictions; moreover, calls on the PRC's authorities to release forthwith all members of the Christian Church who are still unfairly incarcerated and persecuted; 52. Notes that there are currently more Christians across China worshipping in \u2018 illegal \u2019 places of worship (whether at Protestant house-churches or in underground Catholic groups loyal to the Vatican) than attend- ing at \u2018 patriotic \u2019 places of worship, and that both groups of worshippers, composed as they are of law- abiding citizens, constitute no threat whatever to public security; calls on the Chinese Government to cease its persecution and imprisonment of such Christian groups; maintains that Christians who do not identify with the \u2018 patriotic churches \u2019 have the right to worship freely; 53. Deplores the serious violation of religious freedom brought about by the recent unlawful ordinations of bishops (30 April 2006, Kunming \u2014 Yunnan; 3 May 2006, Wuhan \u2014 Anhui), stemming not least from the strong pressures and the threats to which the Catholic clergy loyal to the Vatican was subjected by non- Church bodies; 54. Considers that the latest ordinations detract from the recent assertions by the Chinese authorities of their willingness to pave the way for a sincere and constructive dialogue between the PRC and the Holy See; points, therefore, to the need to respect the freedom of the Church and preserve the autonomy of its institutions from any external interference, which, as well as finding expression in gestures disavowing the demands negotiated by both sides, undermines confidence in reciprocal dialogue and advances in freedom in China; 55. Points out that the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, after completing his mission, thanked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for its cooperation, but rebuked the Ministries of State Security and Public Security for obstructing or restricting his attempts at fact-finding; 56. Is deeply concerned by the statement made by the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture that the prac- tice of torture remains widespread in China, a reprehensible situation that is indeed increasingly recognised by government officials and in reports, and also by the \u2018 palpable level of fear and self-censorship \u2019 observed by him during interviews with detainees; C 305 E/228 EN 14.12.2006 Official Journal of the European Union Thursday 7 September 2006 ",
        "57. Endorses the preliminary recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur to the Chinese Govern- ment, e.g. on reforming criminal law by adding the crime of torture in accordance with the definition contained in the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and also establishing an independent complaints mechanism for detainees subjected to torture and ill treatment; 58. Calls on the Chinese Government to revise the verdicts handed down for the crime of \u2018 threatening public security \u2019 , given that, in an overwhelming majority of cases, the accused had done no more than courageously exercise their fundamental constitutional rights by openly criticising the policies of the govern- ment and the CCP; 59. Once again calls on the Government of the PRC to improve the conditions of imprisonment in its jails and to cease and abolish the torture of detainees; 60. Regrets that no substantial progress has been made regarding the release of political prisoners incar- cerated for their involvement in the Tiananmen Square demonstrations and, similarly, regrets that the Chi- nese authorities continue to ignore calls for a full and impartial inquiry into the events of 1989; calls for an official reassessment of the Tiananmen Square incident by the Chinese authorities, publication of the list of political prisoners and their unconditional release; 61. Deplores the recent crackdown by Chinese officials on defence lawyers aimed at stamping out legal challenges to their authority; calls upon the Chinese authorities to reveal the whereabouts of human rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng, one of China's most outspoken lawyers and dissidents who is held on suspicion of criminal activity, and to release him unless he is to be charged with a recognised criminal offence; similarly calls for the release of Chen Guangcheng, a peasants' rights advocate who has helped citizens in their attempts to sue their local authorities for carrying out forced abortions and sterilisations and who was sentenced to more than four years in prison, and of Bu Dongwei, who has been assigned to two and a half years of \u2018 Re-education through Labour \u2019 (RTL) and who is detained at an undisclosed location; therefore urges the authorities to ensure that all human rights defenders can carry out peaceful and legitimate activ- ities without fear of arbitrary arrest, torture or ill-treatment and that they be given access to proper legal representation in the event of arrest; 62. Joins with the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in urging the Chinese Government to abolish \u2018 Re-educa- tion through Labour \u2019 and similar forms of forced \u2018 re-education \u2019 of detainees in prisons, pre-trial detention centres and psychiatric hospitals; 63. Rejects the nationwide Ankang system of police psychiatry applied to political and social dissidents, which purports to promise \u2018 health through rest and peace \u2019 , but in fact breaks its \u2018 patients \u2019 ; admonishes the authorities against extending Ankang from 22 to 125 clinics, but, on the contrary, to erase this national stain; 64. Condemns in particular the existence of the Laogai labour camps across the country, in which the PRC detains pro-democracy activists, labour activists and members of minorities without a fair trial, forcing them to work in appalling conditions and without medical treatment; urges China to ratify ILO Conventions 29 and 105 on the Elimination of forced and compulsory labour; calls on China to give a written under- taking in relation to any given exported product that it has not been produced by forced labour in a Laogai camp and, if no such assurance can be given, insists that the Commission prohibit its importation into the EU; 65. Calls on the PRC to respect its international obligations under the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol thereto, and to allow the United Nations High Commis- sioner for Refugees full access to North Korean asylum seekers who may be in need of international pro- tection; 66. Strongly condemns the detention and torture of Falun Gong practitioners in prisons, \u2018 Re-education through Labour \u2019 camps, psychiatric hospitals and \u2018 legal education schools \u2019 ; is concerned about reports that organs of detained Falun Gong practitioners have been removed and sold to hospitals; urges the Chinese Government to end the detention and torture of Falun Gong practitioners and to release them immediately; 14.12.2006 EN C 305 E/229 Official Journal of the European Union Thursday 7 September 2006 ",

Expresses its deep disquiet at the numerous violations of women's and girls' rights resulting from forced compliance with the Chinese Government's family planning policy, including selective abortions, forced sterilisations, and the abandonment of girls on a massive scale; 68. Urges China without any further delay to ratify and implement the ICCPR; 69. Agrees with the important message conveyed in the above-mentioned Reuters/BBC open letter \u2014 which was unfortunately withheld from the general public in China \u2014 that the current policy of censorship is hampering China's political development; 70. Expresses deep disquiet at the current clamp-down in the PRC on freedom of expression and free access to the Internet; repeats its requests to Beijing to refrain from intimidating, cracking down on or imprisoning those who advocate freedom of expression, whether the repression is directed at journalists or human rights activists or whether it makes information impossible to use by blacking out websites that do not conform to state censorship; condemns, therefore, the Internet censorship law passed by the National People's Congress and the existence of systems of Internet censorship collectively known as the \u2018 Great Fire- wall of China \u2019 ; calls in particular for the AsiaNews.it site to be allowed back onto the Web without delay \u2014 or in any event no longer be blacked out \u2014 bearing in mind that, in addition to being an excellent source of information about Asia and human rights advocacy, it also helps to foster dialogue between the Vatican and the PRC and hence the unity of the Chinese Church; 71. Expresses its concern at the irresponsible policies of major Internet firms Yahoo and Google which have bowed directly and indirectly to Chinese Government demands for censorship; 72. Calls on the Chinese authorities to re-open the office of the Friedrich Naumann Foundation in Beij- ing, so as to allow the Foundation to continue its work on development and democracy; 73. Recognises the rising influence of China globally but in particular in countries as diverse as Belarus, Venezuela, Sudan, Zimbabwe, Burma/Myanmar, Iran and North Korea, of whose human rights records the EU remains deeply critical; 74. Asks the Chinese authorities and the Council to improve the human rights dialogue by introducing simultaneous interpretation at meetings; requests that Members of the European Parliament be more actively involved in the human rights dialogue along with their Chinese parliamentary colleagues; 75. Regrets that the authorities in Xinjiang regularly group together individuals or organisations allegedly involved in the \u2018 three evils \u2019 , making it difficult to determine whether particular raids, detentions or judicial punishments are targeted at those peacefully seeking to express their political and religious views or at those who have engaged in violence; regards as counterproductive the destruction by officials of Uighur books with a view to distorting historical facts and advocating ethnic separatism; 76. Looks forward to seeing the Chief Executive and all members of the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region elected by means of an electoral system based on the principles of multi-party democracy, accountability of the government to the legislature and genuinely effective govern- ance, which will confer a clear benefit on all the people of Hong Kong; 77. Acknowledges the increasing role that China is playing as a global power on the world stage; in this regard, urges the Chinese government to be fully committed to its growing responsibilities and to actively engage in international organisations and fora so as to promote peace and peaceful conflict-resolution and to support the universal values of democracy, human rights and the rule of law; C 305 E/230 EN 14.12.2006 Official Journal of the European Union Thursday 7 September 2006 ",
        "Foreign policy/Relations with neighbours 78. Draws attention to the concerns of the outside world, especially of Beijing's regional neighbours, concerning the double-digit increase in China's military spending every year since the mid-1990s; strongly recommends \u2014 as endorsed by numerous of its resolutions \u2014 that the EU arms embargo against China remain intact until greater progress is made on human rights issues; recalls in this context the need to include in further negotiations regarding the European Neighbourhood Policy and the Partnership and Cooperation Agreements, adherence to the EU embargo on arms trading with the PRC; 79. Stresses the direct link between the obvious Chinese interest in gaining access to European military high technology and the lifting of the arms embargo against the PRC, a connection with significant con- sequences for the cohesion of the transatlantic relationship and the market position of the high-tech weap- ons industry in Europe; 80. Expresses concern at the depth of cooperation with China on the Galileo programme and calls for further safeguards to be introduced to ensure that China, or other partners, cannot transfer sensitive tech- nologies used in the programme to military applications; 81. Observes that China's Anti-Secession Law of 14 March 2005 and the present stationing of more than 800 missiles on the south-east coast of the PRC facing Taiwan belie the principle of peaceful reunification; calls on China and Taiwan to establish mutual trust and respect and to seek common ground while setting aside differences, to put in place the necessary political basis for a peaceful and steady development of cross- Straits relations, to resume dialogue on those relations and to strengthen economic exchanges and coopera- tion, making progress in particular on the \u2018 three direct links \u2019 across the Taiwan Strait (mail, transport and trade); 82. Takes the view that, with regard to the possible option of a peaceful reunification process with the Chinese mainland, the will and approval of the 23 million citizens of Taiwan must surely be respected and taken into account, as must Taiwan's territorial sovereignty and integrity, in negotiations with China on Taiwan's status; points out that the beginning of a genuine democratic process in the PRC would help to ease tensions and pave the way for the resumption of a substantive dialogue between the two sides; 83. Calls on China to support the possibility of observer status for Taiwan within the World Health Assembly of the World Health Organization, in order to protect the health of the people of Taiwan, of international representatives and foreign employees on the island, and of the entire population of the globe; recalls in this context that infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, SARS and, recently, avian influenza know no borders and require world-wide cooperation \u2014 also, and especially, with Taiwan as one of the most important international hubs in the Western Pacific; reiterates its call for Taiwan to be better represented in international fora and organisations, so as to put an end to the on-going unfair exclusion of 23 million people from the international community; 84. Concludes that the problematic relationship between Beijing and Tokyo springs from a sense of mutual challenge: Japan feels challenged by China's economic rise and China by Japan's pursuit of a larger and more active political role in the region; calls on each country to refrain from any action which might offend the historic memory or the sensibilities of the other; 85. Welcomes the American initiative of starting a strategic dialogue with Europe on China's rise \u2014 a central new element in the policy of the \u2018 new \u2019 world towards the \u2018 old \u2019 \u2014 and encourages the European Union and its Member States to develop a strategic consensus for dealing with China; 86. Highlights the global importance of China's existing and emerging energy relations; draws attention to the impact on the global energy market of the increase in China's energy consumption that will accom- pany its economic growth; calls on the Commission and the Council to include energy issues in their long- term strategy for EU-China relations and to raise this issue in their contacts with China where appropriate; 14.12.2006 EN C 305 E/231 Official Journal of the European Union Thursday 7 September 2006 ",

Recognizes the special economic importance of the African Continent for the PRC (30 % of its oil imports, a growing market for Chinese military hardware), but also urges the Chinese leadership to uphold China's responsibilities as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and to promote good governance, democracy, the rule of law, respect for human rights and conflict prevention in its rela- tions with African states; 88. Encourages the authorities in China to play an active role in bringing about respect for human rights and democratic change in Burma/Myanmar; 89. Expects the PRC to apply its proclaimed opposition to terrorism and nuclear proliferation in a con- crete manner in China's influential relations with Iran; emphasises that a decisive stance by the PRC on Iran would demonstrate China's willingness and ability to take on international responsibility; 90. Welcomes China's commitment to the Six-Party Talks, and urges the Chinese Government to do more to promote security and stability in East Asia, particularly on the Korean Peninsula, and to play a more pro-active role in the promotion of democracy and respect for human rights in North Korea; Conclusions 91. Concludes that a credible, stable and responsible economic and trading relationship between the EU and China should be based, on the European side, on the development of a long-term strategy and, on the Chinese side, on the development of a solid investment climate, on improving legal security for foreign firms, on continuing to open its markets and, above all, on observance of fair and equitable trade rules and on implementation of the WTO rules, including compliance with the TRIPs agreements as regards the protection of IPR; 92. Underlines the importance of addressing the concept of corporate social responsibility and the need to promote economically, socially and ecologically sustainable development in economic and trading rela- tions between the EU and China; calls on the Commission to take care that these principles are applied; 93. Draws the conclusion that China's internal situation should be improved by strengthening the indi- genous process of democratisation, increasing the professionalism of the judiciary, completely abolishing the death penalty and above all, by implementing the government's social programme, endorsed by the 10th National People's Congress, in favour of the backward countryside in order to serve the Chinese population and to promote stability in the region, and also by minority protection and cultural diversity, especially in the regions of Tibet and Xinjiang; 94. Concludes that a credible and responsible human rights policy can be restored in China only by respecting the basic rights of its citizens, as enshrined in the Constitution of the People's Republic; 95. Comes to the conclusion that China can greatly contribute to credible, stable and responsible foreign and neighbourly relations by acknowledging its key position as a serious stakeholder in the international law- and peace-promoting system, a major step that the EU can significantly promote by formulating a new common strategy on China; * * * 96. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the governments and parliaments of the Member States and the accession and candidate countries, the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese National People's Congress, and the Taiwan authorities.

        "G. whereas eco-labelling for fisheries products may serve to improve the gathering of information on specific fisheries (improvements to the quantity and reliability of data), H. whereas the numerous eco-labelling schemes and criteria relating to eco-labelling that are emerging, together with the lack of confidence and sense of confusion that this generates among consumers, may lead to the discrediting of this mechanism, I. whereas the European Community recently signed the Agreement on the International Dolphin Con- servation Program and the associated eco-certification scheme (Dolphin Safe), J. whereas it has also been shown that there is confusion regarding the difference between an ecological label and a quality label, K. whereas, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002, all European Union fisheries should, by definition, be sustainable, since they should conform to Community standards, 1. Welcomes the communication from the Commission launching a debate on a Community approach towards eco-labelling schemes for fisheries products; 2. Regrets, however, the delays on the part of the Commission in coming forward with its communica- tion, which have in the meantime allowed privately initiated eco-labels to proliferate without any form of public control, giving rise to issues of credibility and confusion for producers and consumers; 3. Draws attention, furthermore, to the real objectives of many of these labels which, given the growing importance that consumers place on sustainable development, are simply used as a means to increase sales, denying the consumer any real guarantee that the products actually contribute to sustainability; 4. Believes that the range of schemes currently in place adds to the complexity of the issue and that any future proposal must not be designed in such a way that those already operating in the market are given a commercial advantage; 5. Understands that the sole purpose of the communication is to launch a general debate and not at this stage to consider the details of the criteria on which Community eco-labelling is to be based; regrets, however, that the Commission's communication brings little to the debate which the Commission itself is seeking to initiate, and which now appears to have been left wide open, with little thought being given to it; 6. Deplores the communication's lack of ambition and considers that the chosen option (which consists of establishing minimum requirements for voluntary eco-labelling schemes) does not fully address the issues in question; considers that whatever labels are used in the marketplace must be independently monitored in order to be absolutely reliable and credible for the consumer; 7. Calls for better recognition at European level of non-industrial fishing; before the possible establish- ment of an eco-labelling scheme, calls for the parties concerned, including representatives of the non-indus- trial fishing sector, to be consulted and their suggestions taken into account; 8. Believes that a label will be fully effective only if it is uniform and easily comprehensible to consumers, allowing them to choose products that maintain the sustainability of fisheries resources; 9. Encourages the Commission consequently to develop further a broad debate in which all parties con- cerned can participate and in which serious thought can be given to the volume and importance of the issues that still require discussion; 10. Agrees in principle with the objectives of sustainability, harmonisation, traceability, transparency, objectivity and non-discrimination, mentioned in point 4 of the communication; considers that establishing a single EU eco-label is bureaucratically cumbersome; C 305 E/234 EN 14.12.2006 Official Journal of the European Union Thursday 7 September 2006 ",
        "11. Is convinced that the use of reliable eco-labels could be a very effective tool in combating illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing, since it requires very clear documentation evidencing the provenance of the fish, which would make it much more difficult for illegal fish to enter the marketplace; 12. Asks the Commission to clarify its understanding of a public Community label, since its analysis of option 2 ( \u2018 Creating a single Community eco-labelling scheme for fish and fishery products \u2019 ) and option 3 ( \u2018 Establishing minimum requirements for voluntary eco-labelling schemes \u2019 ) in the communication makes it unclear as to whether account has been taken of considerations in international fora regarding the owner- ship of an eco-labelling scheme; 13. Takes the view that, once an eco-labelling and certification scheme has been set up, the Commission will need to promote and explain it to all those involved in the process; takes the view that the Commission will also need to ensure that confidence can be fully guaranteed with regard to compliance with the rules laid down by the bodies responsible for labelling and certification so that consumers are not misled; 14. Urges the Commission to draw up a communication to the European Parliament and to the Council within six months, subject to developments in the broad debate, detailing the minimum requirements and guidelines with which a Community eco-labelling scheme for fisheries products must comply; 15. Urges the Commission, further, to take into account international criteria relating to this matter, in particular the criteria set out by the FAO, when it comes to laying the foundations of an eco-labelling scheme for fisheries products in the EU, so that the scheme, amongst other things; (a) is consistent with both the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries and the resolutions adopted by other international organisations, including the UN and the WTO; (b) is voluntary and guarantees greater protection of the environment without any suggestion that non- labelled products are of an inferior quality; (c) is transparent in every way, including its organic structure and financial provisions; (d) is non-discriminatory and does not pose obstacles to trade, particularly as regards developing countries, whilst at the same time guaranteeing fair competition; (e) is promoted by the Commission, which would be responsible for establishing rules governing its operation and guaranteeing the independence of specialist accreditation and certification bodies, key components in the procedure, as well as the credibility of the claims made by the label; (f) incorporates sustainability criteria, based on serious scientific analysis, which must be set out with a greater level of stringency than the criteria governing the Community resources management system; the aforementioned criteria may be both general and specific depending on the various fisheries pro- ducts; (g) ensures that labels carry accurate information, which means guaranteeing the chain of custody for the product from fishing vessel to final consumer, i.e. it should be possible to track certification and check that the labelled product complies with the relevant specifications; (h) incorporates independent and reliable auditing and verification procedures; (i) receives the vital degree of publicity; (j) opts for a label that includes the final result of the product's assessment in a way that is visible and easily understood by consumers; 16.

Calls on Member States to respect strictly the Code of Conduct on Arms Export as regards all deliveries of weapons to the region; 12. Calls on the European Union to undertake to work with all the parties involved and calls on these parties to honour their commitments scrupulously, with a view to the full implementation of UNSC Resolu- tion 1701, so as to allow access for emergency humanitarian assistance and the return of displaced persons under the safest possible conditions; urges, in this context, the lifting of the air and sea blockade of Lebanon and recalls, in the light of the relevant provisions of Resolution 1701, that establishing effective measures in the area of arms, related materials, training or assistance, is a priority; 13. Points out that strong, quick and effective efforts are needed for the reconstruction of Lebanon; welcomes, in this regard, the conclusions of the Stockholm Conference for Lebanon's Early Recovery, in which donor countries decided to contribute substantively to the reconstruction of the country, and the Commission and Member States announced the grant of EUR 120 million in humanitarian aid; 14. Calls on the Council and the Commission to continue their efforts to establish a living partnership with democratic political forces and civil society, in order to support further democratisation in Lebanon after the events of March 2005; 15.

Calls on the Council and the Commission to restart a genuine dialogue with Syria in order to engage this country in peace efforts for a comprehensive settlement of the conflict; expects that the UN Secretary- General's report provided for in UNSC Resolution 1701 on the delineation of the international borders in Lebanon, including the dispute over the Shebaa farms area, will contribute to progress in this issue; 17. Calls for a comprehensive international high-level inquiry to be conducted with the good offices of the UN Secretary-General in Lebanon and Israel with a mandate to investigate reports of serious human rights violations, the plight of victims and the violation of humanitarian law; 18.

Stresses the need to bring the Middle East peace process back to the top of the international political agenda; calls on the Quartet (UN, EU, USA and Russia) to revive the implementation of the Roadmap with a view to the annual UN General Assembly session in September 2006; reaffirms that the two-state solution, with an Israeli and a Palestinian state co-existing in peace and security, is a key condition for a peaceful and lasting settlement in the Middle East; 22. Calls on the Council and the Commission to continue to guarantee, together with the international community, essential humanitarian aid for the Palestinian population; demands that the TIM be reinforced and extended in terms of duration and resources; calls on the Israeli Government urgently to resume the transfer of withheld Palestinian tax and customs revenues; calls on Israel to permit the movement of people, respecting the Agreement on Movement and Access in Rafah and at other border crossings in Gaza; 23. Restates its support for the President of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, in his efforts to promote a national dialogue between the various Palestinian parties, with the aim of setting up a new Palestinian government; 24. Considers that the presence of a multinational force in Lebanon could be taken as an exemplary model to be followed in the negotiation process for a settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; 25. Calls on the Council to make every effort to convene an international peace conference \u2014 such as the Madrid Conference in 1991 \u2014 in order to find a comprehensive, lasting and viable solution to the problems in the area, based on the relevant UNSC resolutions, which includes the right of Israel to live within secure and recognised borders and the right to a viable state for the Palestinians based on the Occupied Territories, and to deal in full with security and disarmament issues; considers that a unilateral approach by any of the parties concerned must be rejected; 26. Considers the involvement of the League of Arab States to be essential in this context; considers the \u2018 Beirut Plan \u2019 of 2002, agreed by the member countries of the League of Arab States, and the Geneva Initiative, as important contributions to the negotiations, which should be duly taken into account; 27. Takes the view that the EMPA, as the Barcelona Process' only parliamentary institution for elected representatives of the peoples of the southern Mediterranean shore and the European Union, must assume its responsibility for facilitating the resumption of dialogue and cooperation between the parties to the Middle-East situation; supports the EMPA Bureau's request to convene an extraordinary meeting of the Euromed Council of Foreign Ministers of the Barcelona Process as soon as possible; 28. Believes that in the medium to long term, the building of institutions uniting the countries of the Mediterranean basin, such as a Euro-Mediterranean Development Bank, will be the best guarantor of lasting peace and human development; and calls on EU Member States to strive for the creation of such institu- tions, rather than to seek bilateral agreements; 29. Is in favour of sending a fact-finding delegation to Lebanon, Palestine and Israel in order to monitor the situation, with special focus on the humanitarian and political conditions; 30.

Expresses its solidarity with the relatives of those who lost their lives and with residents in the affected areas, in particular Galicia, and thanks everyone \u2014 professionals and volunteers \u2014 who helped extinguish fires and rescue people from floods; 2. Acknowledges the solidarity shown by the European Union, its Member States and other countries with the affected regions in both Member States and candidate countries and the praiseworthy help provided to their authorities and rescue services; considers that the dimensions of these phenomena and their con- sequences go beyond the regional and national scale and urgently call for an effective European commit- ment; 3. Is concerned at the growing number of disasters, something which, according to experts, may be attributed largely to climate change; calls, accordingly, on the Member States to do what is necessary to attain the Kyoto goals, and calls on the Commission to take initiatives to guarantee compliance with the Kyoto commitments and the follow-up to them; believes that the damage caused by recent events further emphasises that mitigation will be much less costly than the consequences of global warming; 4. Considers that its above mentioned resolution of 15 June 2006 contains key elements and principles to be taken into account and calls for the timely implementation of the strategy; 5. Believes that global and regional preventive measures must play the key role, rather than damage reparation; further notes that the damage caused by these natural disasters could have been partly prevented and that this should provide an incentive for developing and implementing prevention policies and adequate legislation on conservation and appropriate land use, including sustainable farm and forestry practices and efficient risk management; 6. Believes that such disasters can be handled efficiently only at Community level, subject to the subsi- diarity principle: they call for an effective response at European level, with, if necessary, new Community instruments for preventing and dealing with the problem; 7. Asks the Commission to mobilise the European Union Solidarity Fund in a flexible fashion, facilitating its implementation, in order to tackle serious damage caused by fires, bearing in mind that such damage affects the way of life of the population, especially in the less prosperous regions that have to cope with adverse effects on infrastructure, economic potential, employment, the natural and cultural heritage, the environment and tourism, which in turn will badly affect economic and social cohesion; 8. Calls for adequate resources to be allocated to civil protection against major emergencies and regrets the Council's lukewarm response to the proposal for creating a European civil protection corps (the Barnier report); C 305 E/242 EN 14.12.2006 Official Journal of the European Union Thursday 7 September 2006 ",

Urges the adoption and the prompt implementation by the Member States of the proposed legislation establishing a Community civil protection mechanism and concerning the assessment and management of floods (the latter under codecision); 12. Calls on the Finnish Presidency-in-Office to pay particular attention to the development of the Union's rapid response capacity for major disasters and to the proposals made by the Commission and Parliament for reinforcing the Community's civil protection capacity and to propose the adoption of the relevant legal instruments by the end of 2006, in line with the mandate given by the European Council of 15 and 16 June 2006; 13. Urges the Commission to create a programme for the exchange of experience of the implementation of new technologies for controlling and following up the risks and effects of forest fires and to prepare a European approval procedure for the qualifications of technical personnel, to improve their training; 14. Expresses its concern that the aims of the \u2018 Forest Focus \u2019 regulation in the field of prevention have not been attained; notes that the number of fires and the areas which have been burned, rather than decreasing, have increased since it entered into force; calls on the Commission to include specific proposals to solve these problems in the report that it is to present before the end of 2006; 15. Notes that, despite the fact that the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS) has managed to harmonise data on fires within Member States and to provide updated information on the natural risk factors, it does not permit investigation of the anthropogenic origins, does not determine socioeconomic risk factors and does not evaluate the repercussions of fires; calls on the Commission to submit a proposal to supplement this system with other data that make it possible to correct these shortcomings; 16. Urges the Commission to present, within the Action Plan on Biomass, concrete proposals for the forests in southern Europe concerning the use of forest biomass for energy purposes, entailing a new source of income for the owner and at the same time contributing to better management of forests; 17. Calls on the Commission, in the new EU Action Plan for the sustainable management of forests, to step up the European forest policy and give greater emphasis to the multiple functions of European agri- culture, with a twofold aim: to maintain and provide employment for the rural population and to substan- tially increase the mass of forests; calls likewise for support measures for fire prevention in silviculture to help the owners and their organisations implement such activities as pollarding, non-commercial pruning, slashing, clearing the forest biomass, creating control lines and fire breaks, building forest roads and depos- iting water; 18. Calls on the Commission to issue a Communication to make society aware of the value of our forests and their resources and the benefits of their conservation, promoting the involvement of civil society through organised volunteering or other methods, such as involving associations for the protection of forests and natural areas; 19. Calls on the Member States to strengthen penalties for criminal acts that damage the environment and in particular those for causing forest fires, and believes that prompt and effective investigation that determines responsibilities, followed by proportionate punishment, would discourage negligent and deliber- ately criminal behaviour; 20. Reiterates its call on the Commission to submit specific proposals for a directive on combating forest fires and droughts in the Union, with a view to improving the coordination of Member States' policies and optimising the existing Community instruments; 14.12.2006 EN C 305 E/243 Official Journal of the European Union Thursday 7 September 2006 ",

Calls on the Commission to undertake an in-depth analysis of the consequences and repercussions of natural disasters, especially those affecting the Union's forests, including the impact on the Natura 2000 Network, and to submit proposals for the development of a Community policy for controlling forest fires and for a joint protocol on preventing and combating such fires; 22. Advocates a Community strategy for the coordination of fire prevention measures in the framework of the rural development regulation; calls for a reforestation policy based on respect for bio-climatic and environmental characteristics, using plant varieties that resist fire and drought better and are better adapted to the climate; 23. Calls on the Commission to reintroduce aid to farmers for creating and maintaining firebreaks as part of the implementing rules for the new European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD); 24. Considers that voluntary civil protection action should be promoted and supported without delay, with basic training and equipment that might harness advanced technologies, since this is one of the major resources available to the Member States when dealing with states of emergency arising from natural dis- asters; 25. Regrets that Russia neglected to cooperate with its neighbouring countries during its recent forest fires; calls for the Commission to raise this issue in the framework of the EU-Russia Partnership and Coop- eration Agreement; 26. Calls on its Bureau to authorise a delegation to the worst-affected areas ahead of the public hearing planned for October 2006, during which the Barnier report will be considered; 27.

Reiterates its full commitment to the multilateral approach to trade policy and the role that the WTO should play as the guarantor of a rules-based international trade system; regrets, therefore, the suspension sine die of the Doha Round negotiations in July 2006 and is especially disappointed that insufficient flex- ibility on the part of some of the major players led to deadlock; 2. Is concerned that a failure to reach agreement on the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) could lead to the collapse of the present multilateral trading system; stresses that a shift to bilateral/regional agreements would lead to unequal and less transparent negotiations, often putting the poorer countries at a disadvan- tage; 3. Stresses that the short- and medium-term consequences of this suspension will affect the developing countries and the LDCs most, especially if pro-development commitments entered into in Hong Kong are no longer respected; 4. Is concerned that the suspension of the multilateral negotiations could result in the expansion of trade disputes, whereby WTO members would try to achieve by litigation what could not be achieved by negotia- tion; 5. Urges a strong commitment on the part of all major players, including the EU, the US and the G-20, to come to a balanced agreement on each of the Round's main negotiation topics, putting development at the heart of the conclusions and further evaluating the outcome in order to ensure that the DDA ultimately results in meaningful and sustainable economic gains, particularly for the developing countries; stresses that, in order fully to implement the Doha mandate, the positive achievements of the negotiations must be preserved and offers made to date on various elements of the negotiating agenda should form the basis of the negotiations; 6. Considers that the developed countries should continue to create more favourable trading conditions for the developing countries and the LDCs, independently of the final outcome of the round; calls on the developed and advanced developing countries to follow the EU Everything but Arms initiative, guaranteeing 100 % duty- and quota-free market access for the LDCs; 7. Underlines the need for institutional reforms to improve the functioning of the WTO and reiterates the importance of enhancing the accountability and democratic legitimacy of the WTO negotiations and orga- nisation; is convinced that the multilateral process based on the bottom-up and transparent approach should be at the core of the negotiations; stresses at the same time the need for an inclusive process involving all members; 8. Is convinced that the suspension of negotiations must be used as a call to reflect on the conditions necessary to improve future trade negotiations; 9. Calls on the Commission and the Council to establish an agreement to ensure full participation of the European Parliament in the European Union's international trade negotiations; 10. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the governments and parliaments of the Member States and the Director-General of the WTO. 14.12.2006 EN C 305 E/245 Official Journal of the European Union Thursday 7 September 2006 ",

Counterfeiting can apply to both branded and gen- eric products and counterfeit products may include products with the correct ingredients or with the wrong ingredients, without active ingredients, with insufficient active ingredients or with fake packa- ging \u2019 , C. whereas counterfeit medicines are primarily circulating in developing countries and are used to treat fatal conditions such as malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS, D. whereas the WHO estimates that the counterfeiting of medicines now affects 10 % of the world market, and whereas the US Food and Drug Administration puts the figure at more than 10 %; whereas up to 70 % of anti-malaria drugs circulating in Cameroon are counterfeit, a figure confirmed for six other African countries by the WHO in 2003; whereas 25 % of all medicines used in developing countries are apparently counterfeit (50 % in Pakistan and Nigeria), E. whereas, according to the WHO, 200 000 of the one million deaths a year from malaria are attributable to medicines wrongly administered or the administration of counterfeit medicines, F. whereas the counterfeiting of medicines is rife in all continents but mainly in Africa, Asia, Latin Amer- ica and Russia, G. whereas the most common factors identified by the WHO as encouraging the appearance of counterfeit medicines are: the lack of legislation prohibiting counterfeiting of medicines, weak penal sanctions, weak or non-existent national drug regulatory authorities, shortages/erratic supply of medicines, lack of control of drugs for export, trade involving several intermediaries, corruption and conflict of interest, C 305 E/246 EN 14.12.2006 Official Journal of the European Union Thursday 7 September 2006 ",
        "H. whereas this trafficking in fake medicines is also a consequence of the lack of political awareness and commitment, weak regulatory systems, inadequate enforcement capacity and, especially in developing countries, the lack of public access to genuine medicines supervised by the public authorities, I. regretting that the European Union became involved only at a late stage in the international fight against counterfeiting, when more open borders and new technologies (Internet) were likely to exacer- bate the problem of piracy, 1. Considers that the European Union should equip itself as a matter of urgency with the means to combat effectively illicit practices in the area of piracy and the counterfeiting of medicines; 2. Calls on the Commission to go beyond its communication \u2018 Strategy to enforce intellectual property rights in third countries \u2019 ; in particular, urges the European Union to take adequate measures to combat the scourge of counterfeiting of medicines in its territory; 3. Calls on the European Union to take steps to strengthen the regulatory and quality-control capacity for medicinal products and medical equipment put on the market in countries with inadequate resources and to improve access to affordable medicines; 4. Urges the European Union to play a key role in promoting an international convention to create a specific criminal offence of counterfeiting or the receiving and distribution of counterfeit medicines in the legislation of every country; 5. Calls for greater cooperation at both national and international level between the various authorities involved in anti-counterfeiting measures; 6. Emphasises the importance of preventive measures in action programmes, more specifically, the estab- lishment of structures, cooperation, awareness campaigns, preferably carried out by the public authorities, and finally the political will to carry through such measures successfully; 7.

Reiterates its conviction that a uniform internal market cannot be fully functional without further steps towards the harmonisation of civil law; 2. Recalls that the initiative on European contract law is the most important initiative under way in the field of civil law; 3. Strongly supports an approach for a wider CFR on general contract law issues going beyond the consumer protection field; 4. Underlines that, besides the work on revision of the consumer acquis, the work on a wider CFR should go on; calls on the Commission to proceed, in parallel with the work on revision of the consumer acquis, with the project for a wider CFR; 5. Underlines that \u2014 even though the final purpose and legal form of the CFR is not yet clear \u2014 the work on the project should be done well, taking into account the fact that the final long-term outcome could be a binding instrument; all the various possible options for the purpose and legal form of a future instrument should be kept open; 6. Calls on the Commission to take into account the long-term perspective of a CFR when presenting new legislative proposals; 7. Calls on the Commission continuously to involve Parliament in the work on the CFR; 8. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and the Commission.

Calls on the Council and the Commission to ask Parliament to give its views on a case-by-case basis on the need for the Community to accede to the existing conventions which have been ratified by a significant number of Member States; 2.

        "\u2014 in the case of the US, even after long negotiations with the Commission and some goodwill stated in the \u2018 undertakings \u2019 , there is still no legal US data protection in the field of air transport; therefore, all PNR data can be accessed, with the sole exception of \u2018 sensitive \u2019 data, and the data can be retained for years after the security check has been carried out; furthermore, there is no judicial protection for non-US citizens, C. considering that since the atrocities of 11 September 2001, a host of single security measures has been introduced worldwide, which often involve the systematic collection and monitoring of personal data of all citizens, notably data on money transfers and telecommunications and passenger data; considering that, in the absence of a coherent EU security policy, the position of the individual citizen vis \u00e0 vis the state risks being undermined; D. recalling that Parliament brought proceedings before the Court of Justice of the European Communities seeking the annulment of Council Decision 2004/496/EC ( 1 ) on the conclusion of an agreement with the USA, negotiated on the basis of Commission Decision 2004/535/EC ( 2 ), on the grounds that the decision lacked both a legal basis and legal clarity and because the collection of personal data authorised under the agreement was excessive when weighed against the need to combat organised crime and terrorism, E. welcoming the annulment by the Court of Justice of Council Decision 2004/496/EC and Commission Decision 2004/535/EC ( 3 ), F. regretting that the Court of Justice did not respond to Parliament's concerns about the legal structure of the agreement and the congruency of its content with the data protection principles laid down in Article 8 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR); G. taking into account the fact that the Court of Justice held that Council Decision 2004/496/EC could not be adopted validly on the basis of Article 95 of the EC Treaty in conjunction with Directive 95/46/EC ( 4 ), because the transfer to and the use of PNR data by the US Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) relates to data processing operations concerning public security and state activities in areas of criminal law, which fall outside the scope of Directive 95/46/EC and the first pillar; H. taking into account the expressed willingness of the Commission and the Council to cooperate closely with the Parliament in order to ensure full compliance with the Court's judgment; however, regretting that the Council has failed to involve the Parliament in the ongoing negotiations; I. sharing the opinion adopted on 14 June 2006 by the Article 29 Working Party on the necessary follow- up to the Court's judgment ( 5 ), J. considering the importance of the issue to be such that the EU should, in any event, come to an arrangement with the USA on a proper international agreement which, with due respect for fundamen- tal rights, would lay down: (a) which data are necessary for identification purposes and should be transferred systematically in an automated way (APIS) and which data relating to passenger \u2018 behaviour \u2019 could be transferred on a case-by-case basis in respect of people recorded on public security \u2018 watch lists \u2019 as \u2018 dangerous \u2019 on account of criminal or terrorist activity, ( 1 ) Council Decision 2004/496/EC of 17 May 2004 on the conclusion of an Agreement between the European Com- munity and the United States of America on the processing and transfer of PNR data by Air Carriers to the United States Department of Homeland Security, Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (OJ L 183, 20.5.2004, p. 83).

        "As regards the content of the short-term agreement (e) to overcome, in the first instance, the shortcomings outlined in the first joint EU/US review of the agreement ( 1 ) and to take into account the recommendations of the European Data Protection Super- visor and the Article 29 Working Party ( 2 ); (f) to include the content of the undertakings in the body of the agreement so that they may become legally binding, thereby making it necessary for the two parties to establish or modify any existing legislation and for the judiciary to protect persons covered by the agreement; (g) to incorporate immediately, as proof of good faith on the part of the US administration, into the new agreement the commitments, which are still not fully implemented over two years after the entry into force of the agreement, as follows: \u2014 the strict purpose limitation, as formerly provided for in Undertaking 3, so that behaviour data may not be used for checking financial crimes or to prevent avian flu; such a limitation should also be laid down for the onward transfer of such data; \u2014 the shift to a PUSH system (as provided for in Undertaking 13), as in the case of EC agreements with Canada and Australia, since all the technical requirements are in place and this is already done, for instance by SITA; \u2014 provision of information to passengers on the PNR rules, and the introduction of proper judicial complaint procedures, as provided for in Undertakings 36-42 and by the PNR agreements with Canada and Australia; \u2014 the need to ensure adequate instructions and training of the staff who handle the data, and the need to secure the IT systems; \u2014 the annual joint review, as provided for in Undertaking 43, which should indeed take place annually, be conducted in cooperation with the national data protection authorities and be pub- lished in full and must assess not only the implementation of the undertakings but also the results of the agreement in terms of eliminating terrorism and crime; As regards the content of the medium-term agreement (h) to provide the EU with a clear legal framework, namely by adopting, as a matter of urgency, the Draft Data Protection Framework Decision; (i) to avoid an artificial division between the \u2018 pillars \u2019 by creating a consistent cross-pillar data protection framework in the Union by activating the passarelle clause under Article 42 of the Treaty on European Union in order to ensure that the new agreement is concluded in association with Parliament and is subject to the scrutiny of the Court of Justice; (j) to limit the amount of data that may be requested and to filter at source sensitive data as required by Article 8 of Directive 95/46/EC; notes that carriers are required to submit only the data available to them, so that, in practice, the CBP rarely receives all 34 categories of data requested; concludes that for the purposes of the agreement, namely to prevent and combat terrorism and transnational crime, including organised crime, even APIS data would be sufficient; calls on the Council Presidency and the Commission to raise this matter in the negotiations; 2.

Calls on the Member States, in cooperation with the Commission, to promote the protection and conservation of their cultural heritage through the Structural Funds and existing Leader +, URBAN II and Interreg III initiatives which will, in the forthcoming financial period (2007-2013), be incorporated in the new political cohesion and common agricultural policy financial instruments; 11. Calls on the Member States to bear in mind that financial incentive strategies must involve coordina- tion between central and local authorities and other local bodies and institutions (not forgetting that much of the listed heritage is religious in nature) while seeking to protect and improve the natural and cultural environment of the localities concerned; 12. Considers that significant use can be made of the natural, architectural and cultural heritage of Europe through the development, in rural and insular areas, of alternative forms of tourism, such as cultural, walking, ecological and maritime tourism; stresses the need to promote policies which enable all European citizens to enjoy the benefits of alternative tourism; C 305 E/256 EN 14.12.2006 Official Journal of the European Union Thursday 7 September 2006 ",

Calls on the Commission, within the framework of existing Community programmes, to adopt mea- sures to facilitate greater accessibility and encourage small companies, traditional crafts and trades and local traditions and customs, by a large-scale campaign to promote villages and communities within the Member States, so as to contribute decisively to the development of the local economy and to stem the rural exodus; 19. Calls on the Commission to promote the sharing and exchange of experiences in this field through international conferences and meetings; 20. Calls on the Commission, principally within the framework of the Culture (2007-2013) Programme, to give partner networks in the various Member States the opportunity of implementing multiannual pro- jects to promote well-preserved traditional communities, with a population of, say, less than 1000; 21. Considers that such measures will make it possible to organise cultural activities seeking to develop the cultural heritage of these communities with the more long-term aim of strengthening cooperation between traditional communities in Europe and enabling them to develop their specifically local cultures together with their European dimension; 22. Wishes for the future development of an action in favour of small, traditional communities along the lines of that instituting the culture capitals; 23. Considers that the \u2018 European Union Cultural Heritage Prize \u2019 administered by \u2018 Europa Nostra \u2019 is a valuable initiative which should be followed up in future; considers that, in this connection and in a wider context, a new category of awards for the best overall restoration of a traditional community should be introduced to encourage those communities which have managed to conserve all or part of their traditional configurations to step up their efforts in this direction; 24. Welcomes the recent proposal within the framework of the Council for the drawing up of a Euro- pean Heritage list and calls on the Commission to support it; takes the view that in this context, particular importance should be given to the local cultural heritage of rural and island regions, taking account also of the intangible aspects of the cultural heritage; takes the view that candidate countries must also be invited to participate in this initiative; 14.12.2006 EN C 305 E/257 Official Journal of the European Union Thursday 7 September 2006 ",

        "A. whereas, in the past few months, the situation in Sri Lanka has deteriorated miserably with hundreds of deaths, some 200 000 people displaced from their homes, 500 000 civilians in the Jaffna peninsula deprived of essential food and water supplies, and vital post-tsunami reconstruction work disrupted, B. whereas the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission (SLMM) has found that the LTTE was responsible for the bombing of a civilian transport bus in a land mine attack on 15 June 2006 that killed 64 people and injured more than 80 in Kebetigollewa in northern Sri Lanka and declared the incident to be a gross violation of the Cease Fire Agreement, C. whereas the failure to seize the opportunity for the resumption of peace negotiations has diminished severely the possibility of real political progress, D. whereas the SLMM has found that 17 aid workers employed by the French humanitarian agency Action Against Hunger had been shot dead by government forces in Muttur, E. whereas the SLMM has been depleted and many of its monitors have been withdrawn from northern and eastern Sri Lanka following the ultimatum issued by the LTTE, F. recalling the primacy of respect for human rights and humanitarian norms by all parties to the conflict, not only as an immediate response to the worsening situation but as a fundamental building block in a just and enduring resolution of the conflict, G. whereas a deal to share international aid in the aftermath of the tsunami has never been properly implemented, reconstruction has been slow and there is real concern that funds may have been mis- appropriated, 1. Deplores the resumption of large-scale and widespread violence and the breakdown of peace negotia- tions; is alarmed by the deterioration of the security situation with military clashes in the east and the north; stresses that the immediate reintroduction of the nominally extant Cease Fire Agreement is essential for any progress towards a political solution and a lasting peace; 2. Condemns the daily attacks in and around Jaffna, Trincomalee and Batticaloa, which have resulted in enormous humanitarian suffering and the deaths of hundreds of civilians and military personnel; notes that the Muslim community in the east of the country has suffered disproportionately from the renewed fighting with the displacement of 50 000 people in Muttur alone; 3. Deeply deplores the murder of the 17 Sri Lankans working for the French NGO Action Against Hunger in Muttur; acknowledges the Government's initiation of a full investigation into the incident and the participation of a forensic expert seconded by the Government of Australia; reiterates its demand for effective and impartial investigations into all alleged atrocities and serious human rights violations and for the full force of the law to be brought to bear against those found to have been complicit in such activities; 4. Condemns the operation on 14 August 2006 against Mullaitivu which resulted in the deaths of 51 children and young people; 5. Welcomes the announcement by Sri Lanka's President Mahinda Rajapaksa of his intention to invite an international independent group of eminent persons as observers of investigations into abductions, disap- pearances and extrajudicial killings in Sri Lanka; considers the setting-up of an independent, credible and effective commission, in the interim, to be a courageous move that could break the vicious cycle of violence in Sri Lanka; recommends that the Government of Sri Lanka seek the advice of UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour in establishing the commission, so as to ensure its independence and effec- tiveness; 6. Underscores the long-term need for a wide-ranging human rights agreement between the parties and its facilitation by an effective, independent international monitoring mission, complementing the agreement on the ground, as recommended by UN Special Rapporteur Philip Alston, with unhindered access to both Government and LTTE controlled areas; 14.12.2006 EN C 305 E/259 Official Journal of the European Union Thursday 7 September 2006 ",
        "7. Emphasises the need for Government forces engaged in counter-insurgency and domestic security operations to exercise maximum restraint in accordance with international law in order to minimise any risk of innocent civilian casualties, and to behave impeccably in all their actions; recommends that the Government of Sri Lanka strengthen its National Police Force to ensure effective police investigation of all extrajudicial killings; recommends the immediate appointment of members of the National Police Commis- sion by the Constitutional Council, as provided for by the Constitution, and that its key role in promoting and disciplining police officers be confirmed; recommends programmes to recruit Tamil and Tamil-speaking police officers, especially to work in the North and East, and programmes to train all police reservists in criminal detection and investigation; 8. Reiterates its condemnation of the appalling abuse of children through the recruitment of child sol- diers, which is a war crime, and calls on all rebel groups to stop this practice, to release those whom they are holding and to make a declaration of principle that they will not recruit any children in the future; urges the Government of Sri Lanka to put into place legal measures to prevent and criminalise the practice; welcomes the appointment of Ambassador Alan Rock of Canada as a Special Advisor to Radhika Coomar- aswamy, UN Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict, to conduct a fact-finding mission to Sri Lanka on this issue; 9. Condemns the intransigence of the LTTE leadership over the years, which has successively rejected so many possible ways forward, including devolution at the provincial level or Provincial Councils; devolution at the regional level or Regional Councils; as well as the concept of a federation with devolution at the national level; 10. Expresses its concern that elements on both sides of the divide in Sri Lanka are intent on conflict and insists, for the sake of all the people of Sri Lanka, that they pull back from the brink; 11. Calls therefore for an immediate, comprehensive and verifiable end to hostilities, including political assassinations and suicide bombing, and calls on Prabhakaran and Karuna to resume peace negotiations on a constructive basis with the Government of Sri Lanka without delay; 12. Calls for respect for human rights and humanitarian norms by all parties to the conflict, not only as an immediate response to the worsening situation but as a fundamental building block in a just and endur- ing resolution of the conflict; 13. Calls on all parties to the conflict to guarantee the security of the SLMM at all times; regrets the LTTE's insistence on the withdrawal of EU nationals from the SLMM; commends the departing Danish, Finnish and Swedish monitors for their invaluable work; supports Iceland and Norway for increasing the number of monitors they each provide to the SLMM and expresses the hope that the SLMM will be able to perform its duties without fear of hostile action; calls on the Council to provide financial or technical support for any measure that could make up for the loss and to adjust the SLMM equipment to match the challenges of its task; 14. Calls on the Government and the LTTE to grant unhindered access for humanitarian aid workers, UN organisations and truce monitors to all parts of the country and to ensure their security; 15. Calls on the Government of Sri Lanka to clearly set out what the requirements are for NGOs to be active in the North and East and to speed up the process of issuing work permits for international staff working with NGOs, ensuring that the process is efficient and transparent; 16. Whilst the LTTE remains proscribed, calls upon EU Member States and the wider international com- munity to take robust and determined action actively to investigate the agents of the LTTE; considers that this should include a properly enforced travel ban to inhibit movement of recruiters and couriers; the arrest and repatriation of those involved in terrorist support activities; confiscation of assets associated with the LTTE, such as its commercial shipping fleet; freezing of suspect bank accounts; and closing companies or undertakings associated with the LTTE; consideration can be given to lifting proscription if there is an effective ceasefire, an end to terrorism and resumption of serious negotiations on a constructive basis; C 305 E/260 EN 14.12.2006 Official Journal of the European Union Thursday 7 September 2006 ",
        "17. Notes the closure of the Tamil Rehabilitation Organisation in the UK and the current investigations into the Tamil Rehabilitation Organisation and the World Tamil Coordinating Committee offices in the United States and Australia; 18. Insists that more effective measures be taken by all governments of EU Member States to prevent the indoctrination and intimidation of Tamils resident in their countries and the extortion of money to fund LTTE activities; 19. Reiterates its call, as an immediate gesture of goodwill, for both sides to cease the use of anti-person- nel landmines and to assist in their removal and, to this end, calls on the Government of Sri Lanka to set an example by signing the Ottawa Convention banning the use of such mines and on the LTTE to sign the Geneva Call \u2018 Deed of Commitment \u2019 ; 20. Notes the decision of two Tamil political parties, the Ceylon Workers Congress and the Up-Country People's Front, to join the governing coalition; 21. Calls on the Government of Sri Lanka, the United National Party and other parties to agree to work in close cooperation to take robust action against terrorism and to address legitimate Tamil grievances, and to come forward with a bold gesture of reconciliation towards the Tamil peoples of Sri Lanka; considers that a major step in creating the right framework for such action would be early revision of the Constitution of Sri Lanka, as one of Asia's longest-standing democracies, to define the state as a secular, democratic republic in which all religions are respected; 22. Welcomes President Rajapaksa's expressed commitment to \u2018 maximum devolution \u2019 for the Tamil peo- ples and calls for this to be given substance; accordingly, urges the work of the All Party Representative Committee to be expedited in order to produce realistic and acceptable proposals within weeks rather than months, which would win the hearts of the Tamil communities in the interests of an agreed solution; reiterates the Co-chairs' statement of 30 May 2006, calling for the Government of Sri Lanka to \u2018 show that it is ready to make the dramatic political changes to bring about a new system of governance which will enhance the rights of all Sri Lankans \u2019 ; calls on the Government of Sri Lanka and the Co-Chairs to reiterate the Tokyo Declaration, and the LTTE to abide by it; 23. Expresses concern at the impact of the renewed conflict on reconstruction and the delivery of inter- national aid, noting that although the EU has allocated almost EUR 125 million in post-tsunami humanitar- ian and reconstruction aid for Sri Lanka, the enduring political gridlock on the \u2018 Post-Tsunami Operations Management Structure \u2019 continues to delay the release of a further EUR 50 million in aid, hindering vital reconstruction work in the north and east of Sri Lanka; notes also the decision of the Asian Development Bank to reschedule some funding and the difficulties in taking forward many infrastructure projects; 24. Supports the current action plan of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs for the benefit of the displaced population; 25. Calls on the Council, the Commission and the Governments of the Member States to redouble their efforts to help bring a stable and just peace to Sri Lanka and restore security and prosperity; 26. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the Secretary-Gen- eral of the United Nations, the Government of Norway and the other Co-Chairs of the Tokyo Donor Con- ference, the President and Government of Sri Lanka and other parties to the conflict. 14.12.2006 EN C 305 E/261 Official Journal of the European Union Thursday 7 September 2006 ",

Deplores, as it has done in its previous resolutions, the fact that thousands of North Korean citizens flee their country because of repression, hunger and economic decline; 2. Urges the Thai authorities not to repatriate the North Korean refugees, since they and their families will face dire consequences; C 305 E/262 EN 14.12.2006 Official Journal of the European Union Thursday 7 September 2006 ",
        "3. Calls on Thailand, which is well-known for its long tradition of hospitality towards refugees and which is a responsible member of the international community, to seek, in close cooperation with the UNHCR and other humanitarian organisations, to find a rapid and acceptable solution for the North Korean refugees by sending them to a third country of their choice after the expiry of their 30-day jail sentence; 4. Calls on countries able to take the refugees in to make this known at the earliest opportunity in order to ensure that they are not kept in detention; 5. Calls on the Commission closely to monitor the situation of North Korean refugees in collaboration with the UNHCR and, if necessary, to provide appropriate financial aid; 6.

        "C. whereas the Senate elections of 26 November 2005 were a cynical act of political patronage designed to consolidate Zanu-PF's authoritarian grip on Zimbabwe, D. whereas the main political opposition in Zimbabwe, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), regrettably split into two factions in October 2005, E. whereas the development of Africa is a priority for Western democracies; recognising, however, that aid alone can achieve little and that African governments are expected to deliver their side of the bargain through a commitment to democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights, F. whereas Zimbabweans suffer from an unemployment rate of over 70 per cent and the highest inflation rate in the world, G. concerned at reports by human rights organisations that migrants from Zimbabwe are vulnerable to mistreatment and abuse in South Africa, H. whereas the African Union (AU), the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and, in par- ticular, South Africa have failed to take a strong enough stand against the reprehensible Mugabe regime, 1. Condemns the Mugabe dictatorship for its relentless oppression of the Zimbabwean people and expresses its profound disappointment at the refusal of regional actors such as the AU, the SADC and South Africa to take a more robust stance against the regime's abuses and the failure to insist that the Zimbabwean Government should mend its ways and restore democracy and the rule of law; 2. Demands that the Mugabe regime fulfil its pledge to provide housing sufficient for all those forced out of their homes during the atrocious Operation Murambatsvina campaign; 3. Regrets that Zimbabwe's progress in the fight against HIV-AIDS is being undermined by the govern- ment's abusive practices such as its eviction programme, which has disrupted access to healthcare, and inadequate social welfare policies, which have further heightened the vulnerability of AIDS patients; 4. Notes with great concern that Zimbabwe is currently experiencing one of the world's worst HIV-AIDS epidemics, with over 3 200 people a week dying from the disease; calls for the Zimbabwean Government to take urgent action to improve access to anti-retroviral treatment, which is currently received by only 8 % of those infected with the disease; 5. Refuses to recognise the legitimacy of the recently created Senate in Zimbabwe because a mere 15 % of Zimbabweans participated in the discredited election process, the result of which was also guaranteed beforehand to favour Zanu-PF; 6. Calls for the withdrawal of the Interception of Communications Bill, the Suppression of Terrorism Bill and the Non-Governmental Organisations Bill, all of which are likely to be used as pretexts for even tougher crackdowns on any opponent of the Mugabe regime; 7. Expresses great consternation at the Mugabe regime's covert attempts to take control of the Zimbabwe Red Cross Society (ZRCS) by forcibly recommending the employment of regime members and supporters; notes that the ZRCS's largest donors are Denmark, the UK and other Member States; is fearful that this move will herald the use of ZRCS food support as a political weapon, thus depriving many vulnerable Zimbabweans of vital assistance; 8. Strongly insists that the Mugabe regime must derive absolutely no financial benefit or propaganda value from either the run-up to the 2010 World Cup or the tournament itself; in this regard, calls on South Africa, the host nation, and on FIFA, to exclude Zimbabwe from participating in pre-World Cup matches, holding international friendly games, or hosting national teams involved in the event; C 305 E/264 EN 14.12.2006 Official Journal of the European Union Thursday 7 September 2006 ",
        "9. Calls on Robert Mugabe to comply with his own promise to stand down, sooner rather than later, which would be the largest single step possible towards reviving Zimbabwean society, politics and economy, and for the commencement of positive transitional negotiations between Zanu-PF, MDC parties and other opposition movements; 10. Welcomes the meeting that took place between the two MDC factions in South Africa on 26 August 2006 and calls upon all those opposed to the deplorable Mugabe regime to come together and to ensure that their activities provide the people of Zimbabwe with a firmly democratic, representative and united opposition, ready in all respects to assume the responsibilities of government, and to bring about political and economic change for the better in Zimbabwe; 11. Applauds the Zimbabwean Congress of Trade Unions for its forthcoming protests against the appal- ling living conditions imposed on the people of Zimbabwe by the Mugabe regime and insists that such demonstrations should be allowed to proceed without police harassment; 12. Recognises that the EU's targeted sanctions against both Zimbabwe and certain individuals in Zim- babwe have failed to have the desired impact on those directly responsible for the impoverishment of Zimbabwe and the hardships endured by its people; calls on the Council to ensure that all Member States rigorously apply existing restrictive measures, including the arms embargo and the travel ban, erring on the side of exclusion rather than permissiveness; 13. Further calls on the Council to expand the scope of the sanctions and further to enlarge the list of individuals \u2014 which currently stands at 120 \u2014 so that it encompasses many more Zimbabwean govern- ment ministers, deputies and governors, Zanu-PF members, supporters and workers, in addition to their family members, and businessmen and other prominent individuals associated with Zanu-PF; 14. Calls on China and other countries that continue to supply weaponry and other support to the Mugabe regime to desist from this and to join the international community in its efforts to bring about change for the better in Zimbabwe; 15. Deplores the fact that at the same time as the United Nations is appealing for USD 257 million in humanitarian aid for Zimbabwe, the Mugabe regime has completed the USD 240 million procurement of twelve K-8 military aircraft from China; notes also that the Zimbabwean army has announced the purchase of 127 vehicles for senior officers, with another 194 to be purchased in coming months; 16. Urges the UN Security Council to report on the human rights and political situation in Zimbabwe as a matter of urgency; 17. Reiterates its demand for the SADC to close its regional peacekeeping training centre in Harare and relocate it within the territory of another SADC member state; 18. Insists that all aid destined for Zimbabwe must be delivered through genuine non-governmental organisations and must reach the people for whom it is intended, with the least possible involvement of the Mugabe regime; expresses unease that the EU funded seven projects in Zimbabwe in 2005 at a cost of EUR 70 million, and further projects in 2006, including EUR 3,7 million through the EU Water Facility , and asks the Commission to give its assurances that none of the aid benefited the Mugabe regime; 19. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the governments of the Member States, the governments of the G8 countries, the governments and parliaments of Zimbabwe and South Africa, the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the Chairmen of the Commission and Executive Council of the AU, the Panafrican Parliament, the Secretary- General of the SADC, and the President of FIFA. 14.12.2006 EN C 305 E/265 Official Journal of the European Union Thursday 7 September 2006 "
