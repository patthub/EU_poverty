        "Communicable Diseases: EU Response to HIV, Tuberculosis and Hepatitis C PE 578.977 5 WORKSHOP PROCEEDINGS On 17 February 2016, the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI) of the European Parliament held a workshop on \"Communicable Diseases: EU response to HIV, TB and Hepatitis C\". The workshop was hosted by Ms Glenis WILLMOTT (MEP) and Mr Alojz PETERLE (MEP), co-Chairs of the Health Working Group of the ENVI Committee of the European Parliament. Ms WILLMOTT opened the discussion by sharing some worrying statistics about Europe which has the fastest growing rate of HIV AIDS infections and multidrug-resistant TB in the world and Hepatitis C which affects 2% of the EU population. She acknowledged the progresses made with the Riga declaration on TB 1 from last year but stressed that there is still a lack of political involvement in the EU. Ms WILLMOTT also welcomed the commitment of Slovakia to hold a second ministerial meeting on this topic during its Presidency of the EU in the second half of 2016. The presence of all stakeholders on this meeting - the Commission, the Council, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and civil society organisations has been seen as a positive sign for the preparation of an EU Action Plan to combat these diseases. Mr PETERLE continued by thanking Ms WILLMOT for her excellent opening speech and expressed his delight that he is a member of a panel that is results oriented and also his hopes that the whole workshop will bring positive changes. Policy tools in Europe to fight against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and Hepatitis C. Mr Martin Seychell, Deputy Director-General for Health in DG Health and Food Safety of the European Commission \u2212 HIV/AIDS - still too many people become HIV positive every year. Figures from 2014 show 29,000 new reported cases (ECDC figures). What is even more worrying- almost half of them (47%) are diagnosed late. This problem has been with us for decades. \u2212 Viral Hepatitis - 19,000 new cases of Hepatitis B and nearly 32,000 cases of Hepatitis C in 2013. In the EU-EEA area the estimate are that 4.4 Million people live with Hepatitis B and 5.5 Million live with Hepatitis C. Most probably these numbers are very much an underestimation as hepatitis is often asymptomatic and has the tendency to affect marginalised groups. For Hepatitis B there is a vaccine, but there is none for Hepatitis C. \u2212 TB in EU and EEA countries in 2013 has seen 65,000 new reported cases. There are big differences across MS up to 25 fold. The most frightening aspect of all is the emergency and increasing prevalence of multidrug-resistant TB. The EU has a range of existing instruments that are being mobilised to assist the core activities of the Member States: 1. The EU HIV/AIDS Action Plan 2 - setting out a very clear EU Policy framework. A very much operational Action Plan with a focus on key deliverables. Emphasis has been placed on the following three aspects: 1 http://www.vm.gov.lv/images/userfiles/Prezidentura/tb_declaration_en.pdf 2 http://ec.europa.eu/health/sti_prevention/docs/ec_hiv_actionplan_2014_en.pdf ",
        "Policy Department A: Economic and Scientific Policy 6 PE 578.977 a) Integrated prevention and treatment for HIV and co-infections such as TB and Hepatitis; b) Increased access to treatment also as a preventive measure; c) Address stigma and discrimination; 2. The EU Health Programme 3 . The new Programme 2014-2020 will finance projects to combat those three diseases for a total value of over \u20ac6 million. 3. To foster the exchange of best practices and dialogue among Member states and also with the civil society. 4. The vital role of the EU agencies both in surveillance and scientific advice, in particular - the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA). 5. Support for treatment. The EU could enhance the access to treatment, also with the help of the European Medicines Agency (EMA). There are three major challenges, which although different have distinct common elements which should be addressed not only by creating new instruments but more by using the available ones. Questions from FTI Consulting (Andr\u00e9 Corrazo): 1. Regarding the new HIV/AIDS action plan - are TB and Hepatitis C going to be an integral part of HIV action plan or will be treated as co-infections? 2. When will the Action Plan be adopted? Answers from Mr SEYCHELL : 1. The three diseases are seen together as major communicable diseases with some common elements - tend to impact specific groups, there is a lack of awareness about the seriousness of the problem, they are all pandemic. There is a need to renew the communication approach and start to properly utilise new tools. Questions from a representative of M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res : 1. Regarding the EU Health Programme - there are \u20ac 1.1 million for the early diagnostic and treatment of Hepatitis C. Are there any intentions to address affordability of treatment for Hepatitis C as these amounts will be enough for the treatment of just 22 people? 2. More information about the 5 new products coming to the market. Question from European Aids Treatments Group and JTG Civil Society: How can the Commission support MS to get access to cheaper medicines? Answers from Mr SEYCHELL : It is not possible to provide direct treatment through the Health Programme. The budget will be used to ensure information exchange between MS. Access to treatment is also a 3 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/;jsessionid=5Qj3TvyCyBqbhfLZzzBttjDGh3gyXkQWYrjhrt36mChMJJlp02XX!2060916514?uri=uriserv:O J.L_.2014.086.01.0001.01.ENG ",
        "Communicable Diseases: EU Response to HIV, Tuberculosis and Hepatitis C PE 578.977 7 Human rights issue. At the moment in Europe there are new vulnerable groups with which it is difficult to establish communication. As a result their access to treatment is significantly reduced. Tuberculosis and HIV in the EU/EEA \u2013 Evidence for action Dr Andrea AMMON, Acting Director, ECDC The long term goal of the EU action plan to fight TB is to eliminate it. With the current rate of decline in TB it will be eliminated in 2092. To reach the goal set by the WHO - elimination of the disease by 2050 is necessary to double the annual rate of decline, so that it reaches 6 %. In 2013 in the EU/EEA countries 64,844 have been diagnosed with TB which translates into around 180 cases each day. The infection rate is ranging from 3.4 to 83.5 cases per 100,000. The most alarming situation is with the multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB where the chances of a successful treatment are very low. 4 Regarding HIV in the EU/EEA countries in the year 2014, 29,992 people have been diagnosed. The infection rate is ranging from 1.6 to 22.1 cases per 100,000. The only vulnerable group with an increase of cases is that of homosexuals while the other groups have seen a decrease. This gives one more reason for a targeted approach towards the high risk groups of the population. 5 The proportion of people co-infected with HIV and TB seems to be going down to 4.9 % in 2013 compared to 8.2 % in 2008. However, it has to be noted that not all countries have given such statistics and also not all of the patients infected with HIV have been tested for TB. The burden of TB is substantial in the EU and more needs to be done to reach elimination. MDR TB remains an issue in the whole European region. HIV/AIDS also remains a major public health concern in the EU/EEA countries. There is a need for a more tailored approach to the high risk groups of the population. Action plan for the prevention and control of viral hepatitis in the WHO European Region 2016\u20132021 Dr Antons MOZALEVSKIS, Medical Officer for viral hepatitis, WHO Regional Office for Europe. Viral Hepatitis is one of the major public health threads globally and in 2013 it was estimated as the 7th highest cause for mortality globally. There are about 240 million people living with chronic Hepatitis B 6 and 150 million living with chronic Hepatitis C. There had been a serious problem with statistics on Hepatitis as it was not taken as such a problem as HIV. However things have changed in the last years following the 2014 4 More details on the TB in the EU/EEA countries and the complete presentation can be found here: http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/healthtopics/Tuberculosis/epidemiological_data/Pages/tuberculosis-situation- 2013.aspx 5 More details on the HIV/AIDS in the EU/EEA countries can be found here: http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/healthtopics/aids/Pages/publications.aspx 6 Data regarding Europe: http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/283356/fact-sheet-en-hep- b.pdf?ua=1 ",
        "Policy Department A: Economic and Scientific Policy 8 PE 578.977 resolution of the World Health Assembly, WHA 67.6 7 of WHO and the adoption in 2015 of the UN General Assembly of the Sustainable Development Goals 8 . The WHO has set a goal to eliminate viral hepatitis as a public health threat by 2030. For the first time global targets have been set for incidence and mortality from hepatitis B and C. The strategy identifies five key interventions for this elimination: 1. Vaccination (hepatitis B, A and E); 2. Prevention of mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B; 3. Injection, blood and surgical safety; 4. Harm reduction for people who use injectable drugs; 5. Hepatitis C treatment (high cure rate of >90 %, 3 months orally), hepatitis B treatment (often lifelong); It is estimated that in Europe 1 in 50 people are infected with hepatitis B and the same incidence is valid for hepatitis C. The number of people who have died because of viral hepatitis in Europe is higher than the combined number of deaths from HIV/AIDS and TB. Although there are successful treatments available a great part of the infected people are not aware that they have the virus. The vision of the WHO European Region for 2016-2021 is to have it \"free of new hepatitis infections, where all people living with chronic hepatitis have access to care, and affordable and effective treatment\" 9 . Civil society perspective on the EU response to communicable diseases Ms Fanny Voitzwinkler Head of EU Office, TB Europe Coalition Coordinator, Global Health Advocates The funding from the Global Fund stops as soon as a country becomes a 'middle income country'. That is why it is not investing anymore in European regions. And this is an issue for many countries. In our view, the role of the EU is to be a political convenor. Also, the European Commission services should work increasingly with MS. 7 http://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA67/A67_R6-en.pdf 8 http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/ 9 http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/communicable-diseases/hepatitis ",
