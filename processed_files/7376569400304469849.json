        "Hope, excellence and innovation We are fast approaching the launch of Horizon 2020, the most ambitious EU research and innovation programme to date, and so it is timely to take stock of what we have achieved so far under the current research framework pro- gramme, and look to the future. There can be no doubt that research is transforming our lives, and Europe\u2019s citizens see maintaining support for cutting-edge research on health as a top priority. Through the Seventh Research Framework Programme (FP7), the EU provides substantial funding for collaborative, cross-disciplinary research involving teams from across Europe and beyond. This interim overview is presented two years before the end of FP7, when 690 research grants have already been awarded under the Health theme, amounting to a substantial 3.2 billion euro investment. Projects funded under the Health theme demonstrate that research really does lead to innovation. New knowledge has improved patient health and quality of life. Novel drugs and diagnostic tools are also making their way to the market \u2014 in fact a recent evaluation found that roughly one quarter of FP7 project participants apply for at least one patent. Research and innovation are essential drivers of the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, and in October 2010 the Commission launched the Innovation Union flagship initiative as a cornerstone of this strat- egy. We are determined to create the conditions to ensure that excellent research is turned into products and services that create growth and jobs in the EU. The Innovation Union explicitly identifies health as one of the major challenges facing us today, alongside demographic change, energy, resource efficiency and climate change. The Innovation Union initiative has also set the scene for the launch of Horizon 2020, which will bring together all EU research and innovation funding within a common strategic framework when existing programmes come to an end. It will cover the whole cycle from research, through to innovation and exploitation in the marketplace, and will offer more effective support to innovative small and medium sized enterprises that are particularly active in the health sector. This brochure outlines the current key priorities of EU funded health research, as well as the most recent achievements giving the reader some insight into our policies, programmes and projects. The ambition and drive of our policy and the wide range of success stories coming from our health research programmes are truly remarkable.

        "Health needs collaborative research EU-funded research projects typically include many scientists from Europe and beyond. They work in universities, research centres, hospitals, companies and associations, collaborating towards ambitious objectives, which would be impossible to achieve by a single group or a single country. This brochure provides a brief overview of the objectives and the scope of the health research funded by the EU\u2019s Seventh Framework Programme for research and technological devel- opment (FP7) in the period 2007 to 2013. Specifi c chapters are devoted to the various components of the Health theme under that programme; genomics and systems biology, medical re- search, infectious diseases and epidemics, public health and health biotechnology, as well as to overarching issues. The research funded is characterised by its excellence. A strict evaluation process is applied to ensure that only the best research projects are selected for funding \u2013 and that ethical standards are adhered to. By pursuing excellence in education, research and innovation, we are targeting lifelong health and well-being for all, both in Europe and beyond. An additional, complementary goal, is competitiveness within Europe\u2019s health related industries and businesses. The EU\u2019s commitment is backed by over EUR 6 billion in funding for health research. This represents a signifi cant contribution to the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and control of disease. Independent evaluations suggest that this investment is paying off. Now two thirds of the way through FP7, research results are benefi tting patients directly. In addition, project participants believe that much of their research would not have been possible \u2014 at least in the scope achieved \u2014 without EU funding. This is partly due to its signifi cant leverage effect on other sources of fi nance, ultimately allowing scientists to be more ambitious, go further with their investigations, and acquire even greater knowledge. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are just one of the benefi ciaries of this leverage effect. In recognition of their potential within the European research landscape, tailor-made measures are in place to facilitate participation. As global health challenges require action at the level of the global research community, the scope for international cooperation has been extended in FP7 beyond earlier framework programmes. Another important change is the greater emphasis on translating basic knowledge into clinical applications, including the rigorous scientifi c validation of results, prior to regulatory approval of new products. The project \u2018Translating Molecular Knowledge into Early Breast Cancer Management: Building on the Breast International Group\u2019 (TRANSBIG) paints a very encouraging picture of what can happen when science and innovation meet. The 40-partner venture is using the results of laboratory experiments to develop tools enabling doctors to treat breast cancer more effectively. Central to the project are clinical trials to identify which follow-up treatment is required \u2014 if any \u2014 after surgery. This emphasis on translational research ties in with the Europe 2020 strategy and its focus on innovation, employment, education and social inclusion, as well as climate and energy, as key contributors to the construction of a smart, sustainable and inclusive economy. Health research is an important player within the strategy, helping to build a more inclusive society, as well as creating jobs and start-ups, and driving innovation. Europe 2020 has also seen the launch of a pilot European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing, which aims to add two years to the average healthy lifespan in the EU by 2020. The partnership is designed to help more EU citizens; remain healthy, active and independent as they age, make social and health care systems more sustainable and effi cient, and contribute to the emergence of a market for innovative products and services in Europe and beyond. A snapshot of the various activities taking place in Europe is, however, all we can provide in this publication. Further information on EU-funded health research is available from our websites, publications and information services. We hope that you fi nd the brochure both stimulating and inspiring.

        "What are genomics and systems biology? Examples of completed genomes Genomics and systems biology 10 Human Mouse Fruit fl y Round worm nematode Estimated number of genes 25 000 25 000 13 600 19 100 Number of chromosomes 46 40 8 6 The three billion \u2018letters\u2019 that make up our genetic code or genome contain all the information needed to turn a fertilised egg into an adult human being. Thanks to the human genome project, we now know the sequence of the letters. The next challenge lies in discovering the function of all our 25 000 genes and understanding how the human genome works. Genomics researchers are drawing on new scientifi c tools to investigate in minute detail the function of every single stretch of our DNA. For example, if a stretch of DNA is identifi ed as a gene which codes for a certain protein, researchers will investigate the structure of the protein and its function in the body. As a result of these advances, research is entering a new era with proteomics, a discipline aiming at the detailed study of our proteins, the building blocks of our cells. Early results from these exciting new fi elds of research have already challenged estab- lished views about the nature of the genome. For example, it was once thought that a large proportion of our genome was inactive \u2018junk DNA\u2019. However, we now know that many regions once thought of as junk are in fact regulatory sequences, which are respon- sible for telling genes whether or not to be active. This is important for health research as mutations in regulatory sequences have been implicated in a number of diseases. The rise of genomics has also played a role in moving biological research towards a more systems-based approach as large amounts of data began to be available. Researchers are increasingly realising that our bodies cannot easily be subdivided into individual, independent components. Rather, genes, proteins, cells and organs interact with each other and the environment in numerous, complex ways. Systems biology aims to shed new light on these interactions, which are vital for the holistic understanding of many major diseases, such as cancer and diabetes. In this new era of biology, scientists combine data from different disciplines into biological models with the power of computer science, mathematics or engineering to under- stand the phenomena of life. Systems biology studies the phenomena of life in a holistic way. A surprising result of the human genome sequencing experiments is that only a very small proportion (less than 2 %) of the entire genome encodes for proteins. What may be hiding behind the remaining 98 % of the human genome? Genomics and systems biology Organism 46 40 8 6 KI3111251ENC_001.pdf 10 20/12/11 16:45 ",
        "New tools \u2014 new data for new fi elds of research When researchers fi rst started investigating the human genome, analysing the sequence of a stretch of DNA and working out its role was a long, slow process. Now, new tools and technologies for high- throughput research are helping researchers speed up this process and, crucially, handle the vast amounts of data created. The microarray One important tool of the genomics technologies is the microarray, which is also known as a nucleic acid array or a DNA chip. In a microarray, thou- sands of DNA molecules are distributed as \u2018spots\u2019 on the surface of a piece of glass or plastic. A solution containing fl uorescently labelled DNA from specifi c cells, such as malignant tumours, is then poured over the array. If a DNA molecule in a solution fi nds a \u2018matching\u2019 partner on the surface, they pair up and the activity level of that gene can be measured by the intensity of the fl uorescent marker on that spot. In this way, researchers are able to identify the activity of many genes involved in diseases. A similar array can be used to study the proteins present in a healthy or diseased cell. The applications of these new high-throughput technologies are es- sential for the identifi cation of potential novel genes involved in diseases. Bioinformatics The research tools outlined above are capable of generating vast amounts of data, very quickly, ranging from gene sequences and protein structures to experimental results and patient statistics. Bioinformatics involves de- veloping the computing tools necessary to manage and analyse this sea of information. Biobanks Biobanks consist of tissue samples from a broad cross section of people coupled with information on their lifestyle and medical history. With biobanks, scientists can identify the small differences in our genetic make- up which are linked not only to our physical characteristics, but also to our chances of developing certain diseases or reacting to certain drugs.

By studying these genes in these animal models, scientists can learn a great deal about human health. A common technique involves \u2018knock- ing out\u2019 and hence inactivating a spe- cifi c gene to determine the impact this has on the organism. Structural genomics The way in which molecules such as proteins and ribonucleic acids (DNA, RNA) interact with one another and with other molecules such as drugs is determined by their three-dimensional (3D) structure. Structural genomics researchers use a range of imaging techniques to study the 3D structure of these molecules. These include fi ring high-intensity X-ray beams at crystallised proteins and studying the structure and dynamics of proteins with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods. Meanwhile, advances in electron microscopy are now enabling researchers to view proteins in their working environment in unprecedented detail. KI3111251ENC_001.pdf 11 20/12/11 16:45 ",
        "APO-SYS \u2014 Using a systems biology approach to study cancer and AIDS When our cells age or become damaged, our bodies destroy them in a process called apoptosis, or programmed cell death. This is a perfectly normal process, and in a healthy adult, millions of cells may undergo apoptosis every second. However, in certain diseases, the apoptotic process breaks down, with disastrous results. In cancer, it is the suppression of apoptosis that allows malignant cells to thrive. In AIDS, in contrast, the apoptosis speeds up, killing off our immune cells faster than they can be replaced. The \u2018Apoptosis systems biology applied to cancer and AIDS\u2019 (APO-SYS) project is using the latest re- search tools to study cell death both in the lab and in animal models such as fruit fl ies and mice. The proj- ect is also analysing clinical samples from patients with cancer and AIDS. The results of these experiments are being fed into computer models, which will be able to predict the likelihood of apoptosis in different situations. The project results will boost doctors\u2019 understanding of clinical data and hopefully lead to the development of new diagnostic tools and drugs to treat these serious diseases. For further information, see http://www.apo-sys.eu EDICT \u2014 Picturing membrane proteins Membrane proteins are our cells\u2019 gatekeepers; they decide what is allowed in and out, and some of them are capable of converting light energy into chemical energy. They play a key role in every process in the body. Faulty membrane proteins have been implicated in diseases as diverse as diabetes, heart disease, epilepsy, depression, osteoporosis, stomach ulcers and cataracts. In addition to this, patho- gens such as bacteria and parasites also rely on interactions with membrane proteins for their survival. However, our current understanding of membrane proteins is poor. The \u2018European drug initiative for channels and transporters\u2019 (EDICT) project is using advanced imaging techniques to investigate the structure of some 80 membrane proteins involved in a range of diseases. High-resolution images coupled with sophisticated computational methods are helping the researchers to identify new drug targets. EU-funded projects on genomics and systems biology Genomics and systems biology 12 EUCOMM \u2014 Studying human health through mice Over 90 % of mouse genes have a human equivalent, making mice ideal model organ- isms for the study of human health and diseases. Using \u2018knock-out\u2019 techniques, the \u2018European conditional mouse mutagenesis program\u2019 (EUCOMM) is creating a \u2018library\u2019 of mouse stem cells, each of which contains a mutation in one of the mouse\u2019s 20 000 genes. With these cells, any laboratory can make mouse mutants in a standardised, cost-effective way. Crucially, the system is set up in such a way that researchers can switch the genes off in individual organs or at a given phase of development. This is important because certain genes have different functions in different tissues at differ- ent times.

The HYPERGENES project is applying the latest genomics tools to 4 000 people to identify the genes responsible for hypertension and tease out their complicated interactions with each other and the environment. The data gathered is being used to develop a simple, inexpensive diag- nostic chip which will help to identify those most at risk of developing high blood pressure. Furthermore, as hypertension is recognised as a common complex disorder, the fi ndings of the HYPERGENES project will be of use to researchers trying to disentangle the factors involved in other diseases.

        "Health research focus: International scientifi c cooperation Improving public health and the delivery of health care, tackling disease, coping with epidemics \u2014 all countries, everywhere in the world, are confronted with health challenges. And, as disease knows no borders, all countries potentially stand to benefi t when major breakthroughs are made. As one of the world leaders in health research, the EU has been en- couraging international cooperation to achieve such breakthroughs for decades. Successive framework programmes have increasingly emphasised the need to bring together complementary competencies from around the world and foster constructive collaborations across borders to optimise the results of R&D efforts. Since 2002, the EU\u2019s research framework programmes have provided opportunities for international cooperation with countries that are neither EU Member States nor associated to the framework programmes. All health research topics are now open to such cooperation, which in fact is mandatory in some cases. The Health theme under FP7 has the objective to support research aimed at improving people\u2019s health and boosting the competitiveness of health- related industries. Furthermore, it addresses global health issues. Project consortia are invited to include research partners from around the world, including International Cooperation Partner Countries (ICPCs) and countries with scientifi c and technological (S&T) cooperation agreements with the EU. International cooperation under FP7 is unique in that its focus, besides combining global S&T activities, is to bring thematic and geographical goals to fruition. A number of third countries have already taken a step forward and created contact points which develop and strengthen knowledge transfer and networks with the scientifi c communities within the EU. The EU is also using its good standing in international organisa- tions such as the World Health Organization to raise awareness, promote common interests, foster scientifi c excellence and con- tribute to shared global commitments such as the Millennium De- velopment Goals (MDGs). These efforts in science diplomacy are other vital contributions to creating partnerships and intensifying collaborations with researchers around the world. Thus, interna- tional cooperation has the objectives of supporting European sci- entifi c and economic development through strategic partnerships with third countries and also addressing specifi c problems that third countries face or that have a global character.

        "AsiaFluCap: Building the capacity to deal with pandemic infl uenza Avian fl u and the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus have been headline news for several years \u2014 with good reason, considering the dire consequences of successive outbreaks in Asia and around the world. And, in the wake of sporadic cases of human infection, concerns about the emergence of a human form of the virus have also been growing. This latest challenge is a new battle in mankind\u2019s ongoing war against an age- old enemy. Seasonal infl uenza epidemics are estimated to claim more than a quarter of a million lives worldwide every year, and they also translate into substantial fi nancial losses for national economies. The EU has been supporting infl uenza research since 2001 and has shortlisted an initial round of 11 collaborative projects to pursue this effort under the current framework programme. \u2018Health system analysis to support capacity development to respond to pandemic infl uenza in Asia\u2019 (AsiaFluCap) is one of these projects. Funded for a period of three years, it brings together partners from Germany, Indonesia, the Netherlands, Taiwan, Thailand, the United Kingdom and Vietnam. The partners will develop a framework enabling them to evaluate a health system\u2019s operational capacity to contain and mitigate a hypothetical outbreak of pandemic infl uenza. This framework will then be used to identify capacity gaps and areas for action in Indonesia, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. 15 Health research focus: International scientifi c cooperation International cooperation in FP7: three avenues 1) A general opening of all topics to any country Research entities from third countries have been encouraged to participate in EU- funded health research projects since the beginning of the previous framework programme. FP7 aims to intensify this particular strand of cooperation. Research entities from any country are potentially eligible under any health research topic. 2) Specifi c International Cooperation Actions (SICAs) SICAs explicitly address health issues requiring cooperation with particular re- gions or countries. Topics are chosen in view of the characteristics, priorities and needs of these regions or countries. SICA projects are based on the principles of partnership and dialogue; the involvement of at least two participants from ICPCs is mandatory. Key research areas for health-related SICAs include MDG-related research topics such as maternal and child health, reproductive health, neglected infectious diseases, and health systems and health policy. 3) Programme-level cooperation This type of cooperation involves coordination and co-fi nancing between the European Commission and funding authorities in other countries. Topics are defi ned jointly with research and funding agencies in the target countries. The cooperation starts with a selection of an area and the planning of independent calls. It aims to support individually funded projects working towards a common goal. This option is useful both for smaller initiatives between the EU and a single third country or for very large projects which no individual region or country could reasonably be expected to take on single-handedly. The unity of such projects is secured through purpose built management and reporting procedures, but in fact such projects essentially involve separate grants. European & developing countries clinical trials partnership \u2013 EDCTP The EDCTP, as an innovative model for product development public-private partner- ship, co-fi nances projects in vaccine and drug development, where African and Euro- pean academia and pharmaceutical industry are equal partners.

        "Medical research 18 Medical research Many families in Europe, indeed many families around the world, will have fi rst-hand ex- perience of the tragic consequences of major diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, neurological conditions or diabetes at some point in their lives. Cancer, to take one example, claimed about 1.7 million lives in 2006 in Europe alone. Other diseases, both infectious and non-infectious, compound the heavy burden on societies and health care systems around the world. Medical research is unceasing in its efforts to identify means of prevention, improve diagnostics, explore promising avenues for new medicines and therapies, and assess their effi cacy. Signifi cantly increased patient survival rates for many types of cancer bear testimony to the potential of this particular area of research, and work on other major diseases has delivered similar success stories. However, many signifi cant leads remain to be investigated, and research, powered by technological and medical progress, is regularly uncovering new clues. Once discoveries are made, further effort is needed to translate them into marketable products and introduce them to clinical practice. EU funding is supporting many of the world\u2019s leading projects determined to tackle this challenge. This fi nancial backing enables research entities to pool their expertise and resources, across borders and across competencies, to pursue lines of research that individual entities could not reasonably be expected to address on their own. Diabetes and obesity In Europe, about 30 million are estimated to suffer from diabetes. Precise fi gures are, however, diffi cult to ascertain, as many cases remain undiagnosed. A serious disease in itself, which can reduce a patient\u2019s life expectancy, diabetes also raises the risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Despite signifi cant progress in the management of the disease, diabetes has been gaining ground over the past two decades. This fact is largely attributed to a similarly sharp rise in the prevalence of obesity, which is known to be linked to the more common form of diabetes. The EU\u2019s research efforts in this area are twofold, with one strand studying the aetiology, prevention and treatment of the different types of diabetes and another investigating the genetic, lifestyle and epidemiological aspects of obesity.

        "Upgrading clinical practice in the fi ght against cancer Aetiology, prevention, diagnosis, therapy: every new insight gained on the origins and pro- gression of a disease like cancer is potentially life-changing for millions. Collaborative projects across the EU are working to deliver updates on disease aetiology, new medicines and thera- pies, better methods of prevention, early diagnosis and treatment, and a clearer view of the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions. Breast cancer, a disease which one in eight women in the developed world will face in their lifetime, is one of the areas where health research is expected to make a spectacular differ- ence. If detected early and treated in quality-assured, specialist breast cancer units, 90 % of these cancers could be treated successfully. Breakthroughs in our understanding of the best ways to prevent, diagnose and treat this disease will help to save more lives. The TRANSBIG project assessed ways of determining the need for a patient with breast cancer to receive follow-on treatment. The proposed approach involves developing a detailed molecular knowledge of the patient\u2019s tumour. The ability to assess if the cancer of a specifi c patient is likely to recur will not only improve the effectiveness of the therapy, but also reduce the burden of over-treatment \u2014 as currently experienced by an estimated 12 % to 20 % of patients \u2014 on the patient herself and on the health care system. TRANSBIG is a European Network of Excellence dedicated to \u2018Translating molecular knowledge into early breast cancer management building on the Breast International Group (BIG) network for improved treatment tailoring\u2019. The RATHER project (Rational Therapy for Breast Cancer: Individualized Treatment for Diffi - cult-to-Treat Breast Cancer Subtypes) is expected to deliver proof-of-concept for novel thera- peutic interventions, together with matched personalised diagnostic approaches for patients for whom there are no targeted therapies available. The project will focus on protein kinases and their signalling pathways in two diffi cult-to-treat subtypes of the breast cancer - triple negative (TN) breast tumours (15% of all breast cancer cases) and invasive lobular carcinomas (ILC) of the breast (10% of all breast cancer cases). If successful RATHER will initiate a phase I/II clinical trial to examine patient responses to drugs in a clinical setting.

        "Understanding schizophrenia Schizophrenia is still one of the most mysterious mental disorders. Cost-of-illness indications uni- formly point to disquieting human and fi nancial costs. Symptoms typically emerge in adolescence and early adulthood. Vulnerability for schizophrenia is partly genetic, but is also due to environmental effects. The diagnosis of the disease is associated with demonstrable alterations in brain structure and changes in dopamine neurotransmission. Pharmacological treatments blocking the dopamine sys- tem provide control rather than cure. A hundred years after being so named, researchers are begin- ning to understand the biological mechanisms underlying the symptoms of schizophrenia and the psychosocial factors that moderate their expression. Two new projects on schizophrenia funded by the European Commission started in 2010. The aim of the European Network of National Schizophrenia Networks Studying Gene-Environment Interactions (EU-GEI) is to identify the interactive genetic, clinical and environmental determinants in- volved in the development, severity and outcome of schizophrenia. EU-GEI will employ family-based, multidisciplinary research paradigms, which allow for the effi cient assessment of gene-environment interactions. In order to go beyond old fi ndings from historical convenience cohorts with crude mea- sures of environmental factors and clinical outcomes, the focus in EU-GEI will be on recruitment of new, family-based clinical samples with state-of-the-art assessments of environmental, clinical and genetic determinants as well as their underlying neural and behavioural mechanisms. The partners in EU-GEI represent the nationally funded schizophrenia/mental health networks of the UK, Netherlands, France, Spain, Turkey and Germany as well as other partners, with a total of 26 institutions involved. The second project, named OPTiMiSE (OPtimization of Treatment and Management of Schizo- phrenia in Europe) focus on two goals: optimising current treatment and explore novel therapeutic options. Indeed, despite nearly fi fty years of pharmacological and psychosocial research, the overall prognosis of schizophrenia has improved only marginally. While the antipsychotic effi cacy of most antipsychotics is generally uncontested, their overall functional impact has been modest. The OPTi- MiSE project therefore intends to address both basic, but so far unanswered, questions in the treat- ment of schizophrenia and the development of new and experimental interventions. It is expected that the project will lead to evidence directly applicable to treatment guidelines, will explore the devel- opment of novel treatments and will identify potential mechanisms for new drug development. The OPTiMiSE project builds on the combined expertise of 18 partners from 12 countries.

        "Rare diseases In Europe, rare diseases are defi ned as diseases affecting less than one person in 2000. Rare diseases tend to be very serious, but due to their low prevalence in any given population, they are particularly challenging areas of research. This is a context where the multidisciplinary, collaborative, cross-border approach en- couraged by the EU is proving particularly valuable. Substantial funding, coupled with the opportunity to pool expertise, resources, patient data and biological material is giving research into rare diseases a much-needed boost. Other chronic diseases Functional and sensorial impairments and chronic diseases such as arthritis, rheuma- tism, musculo-skeletal conditions, respiratory problems or allergies are another priority area of EU-funded health research. Many of these conditions may not, in themselves, be life-threatening, but all are potentially disabling and seriously affect the patient\u2019s quality of life. EU projects are devising improved diagnostics and intervention strategies in order to delay the onset of such diseases, treat them or alleviate their symptoms. New projects launched in 2010 notably explore the following areas: n Genetic factors of osteoporosis; n Hearing or visual impairment and degeneration; n Innovative concepts in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; n Intervertebral disk degeneration: prevention and repair; n Osteoarthritis; n Osteoporosis: signalling pathways in bone formation and homeostasis, genetic factors of osteoporosis; n Understanding and combating age-related muscle weakness; n Treatment of urinary incontinence; n Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; n Chronic kidney disease; n Mechanisms of development of allergy and asthma; n Role of infection and dysbiosis in development of allergies and autoimmune diseases. Cardiovascular disease Diseases of the heart and circulatory system (cardiovascular disease or CVD) remain the main causes of death in the EU, killing over 2 million people per year. Of all deaths in the EU-27, mortality from CVD reaches 42 % (45 % of deaths in women and 38 % of deaths in men). Despite the progress of medical science of the past 30 years, many disorders of the cardiovascular system remain unsolved. Even though some forms of CVD are becoming less frequent causes of death, continued research is needed to produce further improvements. EU-funded health research strives to improve the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of these diseases, including the vascular aspects of stroke. Emphasis is placed on translational CVD research, where basic research discoveries are moved into clinical applications using broad multidisciplinary approaches. The latest wave of EU-funded CVD research is investigating the following areas: n heart failure; n arrhythmias; n cardiomyopathies; n cardioprotection etc. Medical research 21 KI3111251ENC_001.pdf 21 20/12/11 16:45 ",
        "Health research focus: Ethics Health research focus: Ethics 22 Ethics at the centre of research Public attitudes towards science and technology are overwhelmingly positive. The confi dence gen- erated by messages such as \u2018scientifi cally tested\u2019 or \u2018scientifi cally proven\u2019 is testament to society\u2019s support of scientifi c endeavour. It also highlights the social responsibility that accompanies research. As science advances and the relationship between science and society evolves, new challenges are created for the scientifi c community. Today, there are more scientists than ever before. Every day, exciting research opportunities spring into existence. Projects are larger, more complex, and more expensive. The role that science plays in our lives continues to gain in importance, and society, in turn, has a stake in science. Conse- quently, the relationship between science and society continues to change and intensify in the pursuit of progress. Excellence in science means addressing ethical concerns \u2014 to improve the quality of the science itself, but also to highlight the importance of its outcomes to the wider community. The EU\u2019s commit- ment to ethics in research is refl ected in explicit requirements, and more specifi cally in the evaluation of project proposals. Ethics may be context-dependent, but any research team\u2019s approach to ethical matters is taken as an indication of the honesty and the clarity of its proposal. While there are rarely clear-cut answers when it comes to ethics, some areas are excluded from EU funding by defi nition. These are human cloning for reproductive purposes, altering the genetic heri- tage of human beings, and creating human embryos only to conduct research or obtain stem cells. For further information, see http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/ethics_en.html Key concepts of European research ethics All research activities supported by FP7 should respect fundamental ethical principles, includ- ing those refl ected in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Research on human stem cells (both adult and embryonic) may be fi nanced, depending on the scientifi c proposal and the legal framework of the Member State(s) involved. The principle of precaution requires projects to conduct a careful assessment of predictable risks and potential benefi ts at the outset, establish proportionality between these, and imple- ment appropriate safety measures.

        "23 Health research focus: Small & medium-sized enterprises SMEs for a healthy future Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of the economic future of the EU, and main drivers of innovation in medicine. Dynamic, fl exible and keen to identify promising niches, SMEs are usually among the fi rst to respond to emerging challenges and seize new market op- portunities. Many engage in cutting-edge research. Recognising this crucial contribution to the EU\u2019s economy and to the excellence of research, the frame- work programmes have increasingly aimed to involve high-tech, research-intensive SMEs in collabora- tive research projects. Therefore a number of topics targeted to SMEs are included in the calls for pro- posals. The Commission has adopted measures to change the legal and fi nancial regulations, aligning them explicitly on the needs of smaller enterprises. The rules regarding intellectual property rights have been revised to offer more clarity and to account for the particular requirements of SMEs. Furthermore, a special guarantee fund covers the fi nancial risk of defaulting project participants, thereby reducing the need for fi nancial checks and bank guarantees. In addition to the network of National Contact Points, the main structure providing information and assistance on all aspects of participation in FP7, the European Commission has also set up the dedicated support scheme Fit for Health to facilitate SME participation (www.fi tforhealth.eu). Experts in 22 countries are on hand to offer tailor-made assistance, in particular through a project-matching database enabling SMEs and other participants to locate partners for FP7 Health proposals. A new support action, SM-BIO-POWER, specifi cally targets SMEs working in the medical technology and biomedical engineering sectors. Helping SMEs to make a success of their framework programme participation is a priority of the Health theme. Several initiatives are in place to support SMEs with the valorisation of funded project results. For example, the KAPPA-Health project (www.kappa-health.org) assesses the success factors which lead healthcare companies to generate value from their participation in EU-funded research projects, and what elements to take into account when to applying for cooperative research grants. A recent study fi nanced by the European Commission (project \u201cKAPPA-Health\u201d) indicated that over 90% of research-intensive SMEs having participated in a FP6 co-fi nanced research project considered their participation as a success and 50% of these have already generated commercial return. The increased emphasis on SMEs in FP7 will open up new avenues, enabling them to expand their research activities. In forming collaborative partnerships with other SMEs, larger companies and academia from Europe and beyond, SMEs can drastically reduce their fi nancial exposure, boost their expertise and maximise the outcome of their R&D efforts.

        "Infectious diseases For some of us, the threat of infectious diseases conjures up images of a bygone era centuries ago when the menace of disease swept through cities, destroying livelihoods and ravaging lives. Nevertheless, infectious diseases remain a major threat to this day. They still account for more than two-thirds of disease affl iction in poorer parts of the world, and recent threats to public health on a global scale, such as avian infl uenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), have also reminded us of human susceptibility to emerging threats, and the danger of resting on our laurels. Infectious diseases, diseases transmitted from one living being to another, are responsible for around 15 million human deaths worldwide every year. These diseases are largely preventable and are a major cause of disability, death and economic upheaval. Unprecedented strides in science have brought forward new technologies and applications, resulting in breakthroughs that offer renewed hope in combating infectious diseases. Many of these scientifi c advances, unfortunately, have yet to be translated into drugs, microbicides and vaccines. While it is true that scientifi c progress in this area is unparalleled, there is still much to be done, as for example with \u2018neglected\u2019 infectious diseases, such as sleeping sickness and leishmaniasis. Furthermore, ongoing research is required into new and (re-)emerging epidemics that have the potential to affect human populations in the future. Europe\u2019s seven-year priority plan The EU encourages research into infectious diseases by pursuing four major lines of enquiry: n poverty-related diseases, n potentially new and (re-)emerging epidemics, n antimicrobial drug resistance, n neglected infectious diseases infectious diseases. The European research environment for infectious diseases has focused on the provision of resources, whereby highly innovative ideas may be conceived, and new approaches may be developed for the prevention, treatment and management of these diseases. The approach is a pragmatic one, facilitating the means of driving basic knowledge through to clinical application. This has meant integrating European expertise from a range of disciplines, forming partnerships between public and private organisations, and collabo- rating with international research groups on other continents. The European Commission has committed signifi cant resources in support of translation- al research and intervention activities to combat infectious diseases under the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7). The commitment builds on a body of rigorous European research efforts established through previous framework programmes.

        "Infectious diseases 27 Is poverty a trigger for disease? Unsurprisingly, yes it is. Circumstances such as overcrowded living conditions, insuffi cient access to proper health care and poor nutrition make those affected by poverty more vulnerable to infectious diseases. However, the reverse is also true. While poverty can be attributed to the rampant spread of communicable diseases in developing countries, the crisis of disease in turn brings with it a socioeconomic toll that is debilitating to a country\u2019s growth and prosperity. Infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, known as poverty-related diseases (PRDs), account for over 5 million deaths every year, mainly in developing countries. This global emergency unites European and international research efforts in a stronghold for the development of therapies as well as diagnostic and preventive tools. New approaches are required to confront these infectious diseases, and the European Commission provides wide-reaching support to a range of policy areas, including trade, development and research. Since 2002, the Commission has almost quadrupled its overall annual support to research activities for PRDs. Under the Sixth Framework Programme (FP6), this support amounted to more than EUR 400 million specifi cally for discovery and translational research activities as well as the \u2018European and developing countries clinical trials partnership\u2019 (EDCTP). This commitment continues under FP6\u2019s successor, with research efforts focused on combating PRDs at global level, as well as on Europe-specifi c aspects of the three major diseases and hepatitis. European resources under FP7 are used to support the integration of expertise from different disciplines, the formation of partnerships and the involvement of research groups from developing countries. International commitment to address a global crisis Established by the European Union in 2003, the \u2018European and developing countries clinical trials partnership\u2019 (EDCTP) was the largest single initiative introduced under the Sixth Framework Programme (FP6). Its aim is to accelerate the availability of new or improved drugs, vaccines and microbicides against the three major PRDs (HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis) by focusing on phase II and III clinical trials in sub-Saharan Africa, the world\u2019s worst-affected region. Besides a devastating loss of lives, the diseases are responsible for impeding development and contri- buting to a crippling cycle of poverty in these countries. The EDCTP is a collaboration be- tween 16 European and 47 African countries in sub-Saharan Africa. It is the fi rst initiative based on Art 185 of the EU treaty (ex-Article 169), which allows the EU\u2019s participation in research programmes undertaken by several EU Member States. It is fund- ed with EUR 200 million by the EU and co-funded with EUR 200 million from the 16 European partner coun- tries. Additional co-funding comes from third parties. Since 2003, EDCTP supported 163 projects with a total value of approximately EUR 311 million. for further information, see http://www.edctp.org KI3111251ENC_001.pdf 27 20/12/11 16:45 ",
        "Infectious diseases 28 How does this research affect me? Research funding for newly emerging epidemics is critical. In the mid-1990s, the European Commission issued a special call for proposals that confronted the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) crisis, otherwise known as \u2018mad cow disease\u2019. In addition to contributing to successful products, such as the development of tests for the disease, this action led to the founding of solid European research capacity in this area. Similarly, the Commission responded to the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 with funding support that generated a number of scientifi c advances. Between 2000 and 2007, funding support of over EUR 90 mil- lion was allocated specifi cally to infl uenza research and has contributed to a number of successful results, such as vaccines for both humans and poultry, new diagnostic tests and the early discovery of the emer- gence of drug-resistant viruses. Support for scientifi c research into these and other zoonoses continues, an indication of the very real health threat that emerging dis- eases pose to the world. The pandemic threat: the emergence of new disease While the European Commission has a long tradition of funding research into emerging epidemics, a dedicated activity for this area was established for the fi rst time under FP7. The decision to support a specifi c strategy for potentially new and (re-)emerging epidem- ics is a response to the threat of emerging zoonoses, such as SARS and the recent spread of the highly pathogenic avian infl uenza virus H5N1, and other pathogens with pandemic potential. The programme is designed to respond to research needs in two ways: n a long-term planning and consistent funding stream for researchers; n a fl exible approach to respond to new threats in the rapidly changing fi eld of emerging epidemics. Resources aimed at accelerating the development of new diagnostics, drugs and vaccines will continue to be made available for large and obvious threats, such as pandemic infl uenza. At the same time, support has also been committed to target pathogens that pose a less imminent threat, with the aim of developing a more methodical approach to integrating European scientifi c excellence. This strategy also means that early identifi cation of new pathogens will afford European scientists and authorities precious time to prepare emergency measures. In both instances, the call topics for EU funding support will cover the entire range of health research, from innovative basic research and early-stage clinical trials to implemen- tation research that supports public health responses.

        "Determining priorities, addressing gaps Neglected infectious diseases (NIDs) result in chronic disability or premature death for millions of sufferers. The diseases, 90% of which originate in low-income countries, are also shrouded in social stigma that af- fects human potential and quality of life. Lymphatic fi - lariasis, for example, is endemic in over 80 countries. A classic late-stage sign of this disease is elephantia- sis, a painful, disfi guring swelling of the limbs. Research into NIDs has been identifi ed as one of the four priority pillars under the infectious diseases strategy of FP7. In addressing this research gap, the European Commission aims to improve current methods and develop new approaches for the pre- vention, diagnosis, treatment and control of NIDs. European involvement in this area is critical to ad- dressing needs and redirecting attention to a chal- lenge requiring international participation. The Com- mission\u2019s aim is to fund gaps in research, specifi cally targeting neglected tropical diseases, including NIDs within parasitic (e.g. trypanosomiasis, leishmaniasis and Chagas\u2019 disease), bacterial (e.g. Buruli ulcer and leprosy), and helminths (schistosomiasis and fi lari- asis) disease groups. For each of these disease groups, research gaps such as diagnostics, drugs to overcome drug resis- tance and vaccine development may be addressed. Funding support for prevention and control strate- gies for these and other NIDs has also been identi- fi ed as a priority in European research. The genomic age: confronting the problem of drug resistance Once easily mastered through the administration of antibiotics, severe bacterial infections are again sharply increasing in Europe due to increasing resistance against available antibiotics. Hospitalised patients today run a signifi cant risk of becoming infected by multi- or even pan-resistant infections against which virtually no drugs are effective. Lately, community- acquired infections are also becoming a serious concern. At the same time, the drug development pipeline for new antibiotics is virtually empty due to a lack of incentives for the pharmaceutical industry to invest in this fi eld. In the longer term, diffi culties in effectively treating bacterial infections pose a threat to many modern diagnostic and treatment modalities. Research on antimicrobial drug resistance has been a high priority on the agenda of the EU Framework Programmes, with more than EUR 300 million of EU support provided to the fi eld in the last 10 years. A profound knowledge of the basic molecular mechanisms of resistance forms the basis for more translational research approaches. These address key pathogens causing major drug resistance problems, bringing forward basic research either through clinical research into improved patient management or product-oriented research on new diagnostic tests and novel antimicrobial drugs. European Antibiotic Awareness Day Use and misuse of antibiotics generates antimicrobial resistance, which re- duces the effectiveness of the drugs in the treatment of disease. Antibiotics must, therefore, be valued as a lifesaving, but scarce resource and should, thus, be used cautiously. The lack of adequate diagnostic tests in combina- tion with patients\u2019 expectations of receiving antibiotics are strong drivers of overuse. Considering that only 40% of Europeans know that antibiotics are not effective against viral infections (Eurobarometer), the general awareness of the increasing drug resistance problem needs to be raised. An annual European Antibiotic Awareness Day has, therefore, been organised on 18 November since 2008 to highlight key aspects of the problem and addressing different target populations.

        "HEALTH-NCP-NET National Contact Points - The ambassadors of FP7 The main objective of the EU funded Health-NCP-Net is to maximise the quality of the proposals that are submitted to the framework programmes, including international cooperation at all levels. Many re- searchers applying for FP7 funding appreciate personalised guidance. They can rely on the support of an extensive network of officially nominated National Contact Points (NCPs) which informs prospective applicants of suitable opportunities and helps them to find partners, prepare documentation and deal with contractual matters. Contact points operate as part of wider NCP networks for individual countries or particular themes. Health-NCP-Net , an EU-funded network launched in 2008, aims to take this approach to the next level for European health research. Like all NCPs, the partners of Health-NCP-Net support research entities submitting proposals for EU- funded projects. But this is just one of the project\u2019s goals. Another is reinforcing the network itself, by pro- moting the nomination of new NCPs around the world and mentoring them throughout the early stages, but also by identifying good practice and disseminating it through recommendations, meetings and train- ing sessions. Health-NCP-Net started out with 19 partners in the core consortium, including NCPs in Egypt, Israel and South Africa. But the network is much bigger in practice, as all Health NCPs are associated to the project and the network is growing steadily. New NCPs have, for example, just been created in Taiwan, and re- gional contact points are being established in Africa. It is not necessary for all countries to have NCPs for all themes, but information regarding the FP7 Health theme is important to most. Countries that did not nominate official Health contact points, do participate with the national NCP coordinators in the network\u2019s activities.

        "Public health Helping decision-makers to optimise Europe\u2019s delivery of health care Public health 34 The EU\u2019s health care systems are an integral part of the robust social protection for which Europe is well known, refl ecting the values of universality, access to high-quality health care, equity and solidarity. But ensuring that a health care system delivers out- standing services to all is a complex challenge. This is refl ected in FP7\u2019s Health theme by the third pillar \u2018Optimising the delivery of health care to European citizens\u2019. Research selected for funding will assist decision makers and stakeholders by providing them with the information that they need to make informed choices. The projects will contribute to the design of effective strategies for health promotion, disease prevention, diagnosis and therapy. At the same time, health system issues such as accessibility, quality and effi ciency will be focused on, while striv- ing to ensure that health care is patient-centred and responsive to individual needs. Turning clinical research into clinical practice Here the aim is to determine how clinical research fi ndings can be used best in clinical diagnosis and treatment, and to improve understanding of decision-making procedures in health care settings. There is a special emphasis on patient safety, a topic close to European citizens\u2019 hearts, on the benchmarking of strategies, and on investigating the effects of interventions, including continuity of care, patient self-management of dis- eases and better use of medicines. Ensuring our health systems are effective and open to all Research in this area aims to provide tools that will help stakeholders and decision makers to learn from other health systems, with the goal of ensuring quality, effi ciency, solidarity and sustainability. Particularities of national health systems and differences in population health will be taken into account. This research will have a particular focus on organisational, fi nancial and regulatory aspects to establish their impact on effective- ness and equity of access, important for systems in transition. Addressing the determinants of health Research in this area cannot be undertaken without an approach that also addresses health promotion and disease prevention. Here the intention is to support research that will deliver evidence for effective public health interventions addressing the wider deter- minants of health, including mental health and healthy behaviour, and aspects such as stress, diet or environmental factors as well as health inequalities. While most people know that lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking or taking up regular physical ac- tivity could improve their health, many struggle to make and sustain these changes.

It will contribute to initiatives such as the Millennium Development Goals and the 2004 Mexico Ministerial Summit Statement on Health Research. Based on the principles of fair part- nership and dialogue, joint research in the form of Specifi c International Co- operation Action (SICA) projects will address key problems such as high maternal, perinatal and child mortality as well as lifestyle-induced diseases.

Does it strive to be equally accessible to all its users? Is it able to address the specifi c needs of particularly vulnerable user groups? Answer \u2018yes\u2019 to all three and you may be looking at a system that has truly mastered the principle of equity in healthcare. But the answers are unlikely to be straightforward. The EQUITABLE project, a consortium of partners in the EU and Africa, is putting the healthcare systems of Malawi, Namibia, South Africa and Sudan to the test in order to identify the barriers they may need to overcome on the road to genuine equity. The example of these developing systems is yielding valuable insights for emerging and es- tablished healthcare systems everywhere. There is a lot of rhetoric around the idea that healthcare should be equitable, but that\u2019s really not possible unless health services are equally accessible to everyone. And there are many reasons why that may not be the case. The barriers may be physical, psycho- logical, administrative, fi nancial or cultural, to name but a few. They may be linked to the distance patients must travel to receive treatment, or to the fact that they are displaced, minority or otherwise vulnerable groups that often struggle to obtain the services they need. These challenges affect different systems to varying degrees, but there is one in- dicator that can be applied to all: their ability to address the needs of system users with disabilities. All health system users should have equal access to crucial services such as immunisation, dentistry or antenatal care, but only a system specifi cally designed for equity will be able to offer this level of inclusiveness. A mud road to an immunisation clinic, for instance, can become an insurmountable ob- stacle to a wheelchair user. If health provision for people with disabilities can secured and they are able to access services, then it will be secured for the rest of the population, because the concern is to maximise the inter-sectoral relationships between education, transport, healthcare and so on, on which peoples\u2019 health depends. EQUITABLE is as- sessing health systems and the policies on which they build. To do so, it has developed its very own methodology: EquiFrame, an analytic tool for evaluating and developing inclusiveness in healthcare policies. The project is also profi ling system users and con- ducting a survey of 8000 households to analyse their uptake of healthcare services. One of the aims is to identify people who do not use such services at all, and to establish why. Due to be published by the end of 2012, these case studies will give non-users of the healthcare system a voice, and should give policymakers ample food for thought.

        "Growing up \u2026 The loss of a child is a tragedy without equal. The World Health Orga- nization estimates that almost 10 million children under the age of 5 die each year, most of them in the developing world and due to preventable or treatable conditions such as malnutrition, pneumonia, diarrhoea, malaria, measles and HIV/AIDS. Protecting children from illness is a priority underpinning human existence itself, one of mankind\u2019s guiding principles. This imperative cuts across all aspects of EU-funded health research. The EU is committed to the promo- tion of child health through research into appropriate treatment, protection and prevention measures. Developing medicines and standards that are specifi cally suited to children is one of the main priorities. The EU supports research into paediatric me- dicinal formulations, including suitable vaccines and drugs to fi ght some of the world\u2019s most fatal infectious diseases. In this regard, legislative efforts are bolstering the work of researchers. Under FP7, research funding will continue to encourage transnational partnerships. Childhood cancer, for instance, requires the cooperation of researchers from across the EU. Other, more common diseases, such as childhood diabetes, will also benefi t from European cooperation. Of course, prevention is better than cure, which is why special emphasis is also being placed on the promotion of healthy behaviour among children. Actions targeting immunisation and screening will have another major role to play. Examples of specifi c topics targeted under FP7 include: n innovative approaches for the development of vaccines; n paediatric formulations of drugs against HIV/AIDS, malaria and tu- berculosis; n type 1 diabetes, a life-threatening chronic disease which usually starts during childhood; n adapting off-patent medicines to the specifi c needs of children; n childhood and adolescent mental disorders; n promoting healthy behaviour; n improving prenatal and maternal care. TEDDY \u2014 Task-force in Europe for drug development for the young Medical research powers the develop- ment of increasingly effective and so- phisticated drugs \u2014 which are often formulated for adults, and cannot be assumed to be safe or even effective in paediatric use. Suitability for chil- dren has only been established for some 30 % of the products currently marketed in the EU. The TEDDY project, a network of ex- cellence involving 17 partners from 9 Member States, Romania and Israel, was launched in 2005. It aims to op- timise the paediatric use of existing medicines and stimulate the develop- ment of new ones, a process in which it is involving a broad range of stake- holders active in drug development and in paediatric clinical practice, alongside regulatory authorities and patients\u2019 associations.

        "\u2026 and growing older Current trends indicate that by the year 2050 the number of people aged 60 and over will have more than doubled worldwide to 2 billion people. Remarkable ad- vances in science and knowledge have meant that we are now living longer and more fruitful lives than ever before. This achievement is not without its challenges, however, as longer life expectancy impacts on all aspects of 21st century society. Governments across the globe must manage the economic and social implications of an ageing population. They must also prepare for increasing demands on health care, as a rapidly ageing society signals large populations with chronic diseases, disabilities, and heightened health needs. Among developed countries, Europe is expected to bear one of the most pro- nounced shares of this ageing demographic \u2014 37 % of Europe\u2019s citizens will be over 60 years of age by 2050. The EU recognises that confronting this change is essential. The goal is to support healthy, active and productive lifestyles for Europe\u2019s older people, and the challenge is one that requires comprehensive and integrated activities. The health of the ageing population is a consideration emphasised across FP7\u2019s entire Health theme. Research into the process of healthy ageing and age-related illnesses, biomedical advances as well as prevention and disease management strategies are examples of the activities supported. Where FP7 research into the health of the ageing population is concerned, activities will relate to unravelling the basic mechanisms of human development and ageing, as well as to prevention, diagnostics and treatment of most common age-related conditions, and the impact on the quality of life of older people, including: n biomarkers of normal and diseased ageing; n clinical trials for elderly patients with multiple diseases; n systems biology of most common human diseases; n \u201c-omics\u201d technologies applied to ageing and most common age-related diseases; n impairment of touch and proprioception at old age; n improving the organisation of health service delivery; n new methodologies for health technology assessment. Research into these topics will contribute to the efforts of the pilot European Partner- ship on Active and Healthy Ageing. 37 Health research focus: Promoting health across generations MARK-AGE\u2014 Unravelling the mysteries of ageing Why do some of us age faster than others? Any reply to this question will have to consider a vast set of complex, interrelated factors ranging from genetic heritage to environmental infl uences. Of course, these factors have been the focus of intense research for many years. Candidate biomarkers of biological age have been proposed, notably as a means of detecting vulnerability to age-related disease. However, a single biomarker taken in isolation is unlikely to provide all the answers. The \u2018European study to establish biomarkers of human ageing\u2019 (MARK-AGE), an integrated project supported by FP7, is assessing existing biomarkers, identifying new ones and determining their relative importance in order to propose a weighted system which will determine biological age with a high degree of accuracy.

        "Health biotechnology 40 New tools for new therapies Advances in biotechnology research have led to the development of tools and tech- niques which enable us to manipulate genes, cells and tissues in a variety of ways. In the health fi eld, doctors and researchers are using these tools to create new therapies for a wide range of diseases and conditions, many of which are currently untreatable. The EU is supporting a broad range of projects exploring their potential. These exciting new therapies are already being used in hospitals and clinics to treat patients with a variety of diseases. Meanwhile, researchers from many disciplines are working to improve their effectiveness and see how they can be exploited to treat other diseases. The safety of these new therapies is another key focus of research. Regenerative medicine As the name implies, the fi eld of regenerative medicine is focused on developing treat- ments which replace and repair damaged cells, tissues or organs. An important tool in regenerative medicine is the stem cell. What makes it special is its ability to produce many different kinds of cell. For example, in adults, haematopoietic stem cells are able to produce all the different kinds of blood cell. Scientists are also extremely interested in em- bryonic stem cells, as these have the potential to produce any kind of cell in the body. In cell therapy, patients receive new cells to replace diseased or damaged ones; a good example is the use of adult stem cells from bone marrow to treat leukaemia. It is also being used to develop treatments for Crohn\u2019s disease, a condition which affects the bowels. Meanwhile tissue engineering involves using stem cells to regenerate tissues such as skin, bone, cartilage and blood vessels. Burn victims are already benefi ting from these techniques to repair or replace burnt skin, and cell therapy products can be used to replace knee cartilage which has been damaged by disease or injury. By using the patient\u2019s own cells to create new cells and organs, regenerative medicine also helps to avoid the rejection problems associated with traditional transplants. Ultimately, scientists hope to be able to harness these techniques to develop treat- ments that will repair the heart after a heart attack, and even treat spinal cord injuries and brain damage.

        "Gene therapy Many diseases and conditions are caused, at least in part, by mistakes in our genes which prevent the affected tissue, organ or system from working properly. Gene therapy involves the addition of a healthy working copy of the faulty gene into the appropriate cells of the body. Instead of treating the symptoms of the disease, gene therapy has the potential to correct the underlying cause. The objective of gene therapy is to deliver therapeutic DNA molecules to the inside of cell nuclei in an effi cient, specifi c and safe way. One approach uses a virus to trans- port the gene. However, while this method is effective at transferring the genes, there is concern that the virus may trigger immune or infl ammatory responses or, once inside the patient, may recover its ability to cause dis- ease. Non-viral methods present certain ad- vantages with simple large-scale production and low host immunogenicity, but the main disadvantage is low levels of transfection and expression of the therapeutic gene. Gene therapy has already been used to treat conditions such as severe combined immu- nodefi ciency (SCID) and rare eye diseases. Researchers are now working to improve the effi cacy of these therapies and also ap- ply them to new conditions, including cystic fi brosis and cancer. Stem Cell Therapy in Neurodegenerative Diseases - NeuroStemcell Parkinson\u00b4s disease (PD) and Huntington\u00b4s disease (HD) are two devastating neurodegenerative brain diseases for which there is currently only limited or no treatment available, respec- tively. The NeuroStemcell project is investigating the potential to take stem cell based therapies for both diseases to the clinic. PD and HD are ideal candidate diseases for restorative stem cell-based therapies. Both diseases are characterized by a slow and progressive loss of one specifi c type of neuron in the brain. The cell replacement strategy aims at substituting the lost neurons by implantation of new functional cells. Experimental evidence obtained in animal models, as well as the experience gained from clinical trials using grafts of foetal cells, indicates that effective restorative therapies may be possible to achieve by neural transplantation in these two diseases. Further devel- opment of this approach, however, will critically depend on the development of alternative sources of therapeutically effective cells derived from stem cells. NeuroStemcell is focused on the identifi cation and systematic comparison of cell lines with the most favourable character- istics, generated either directly from human embryonic stem cells or form other stem cells, such as for example the recently discovered induced Pluripotent Stem (iPS) cells. The consortium will engage in parallel into a number of educa- tional activities and promote the development of resources for patient groups, regulators and lay public. The regulatory, ethi- cal and societal issues associated with the use of stem cells for therapy will be carefully considered as science progresses from bench to bedside.

        "Health biotechnology 42 Diagnostics and imaging For many diseases, such as cancer, early diagnosis greatly improves the patient\u2019s chances of making a full recovery. With this in mind, a good deal of research is focused on developing diagnostic tools and imaging techniques which will help doctors pick up on diseases while they are still in the early stages. The same tools can also help doctors to track their patients\u2019 progress and choose the most appropriate treatments. New imaging systems are being developed which combine two different systems, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound, or ultrasound and optical techniques. These hybrid systems allow doctors to take advantage of the strengths of both systems. For example, X-rays are very good at revealing details of bones or showing up surgical implements, notably during an operation, while MRIs are good for producing images of softer tissues. Combining different imaging technologies into one machine poses signifi cant technical challenges; in the example of the combined X-ray/MRI machine, scientists had to get round the way the magnetic fi elds produced by the MRI part of the machine interfered with the X-rays. For patients, the main advantage of these hybrid systems comes from reducing the number of imaging appointments. Biomarkers Biomarkers are defi ned as indicators of a particular biological state, and they are widely used to detect diseases and track the progress of an illness. They can be analysed through imaging techniques or laboratory tests. An example of a biomarker is prostate specifi c antigen (PSA), which is detected in high levels in men with prostate cancer. Researchers are busy identifying the physiological and molecular changes associated with a wide range of disorders, with the goal of developing highly sensitive, accurate and cost-effective diagnostic tests.

        "Medical research and animal experiments \u2014 following the three Rs Growing awareness of animal welfare issues means that researchers are increasingly under pressure to reduce the use of animals in their ex- periments. Nevertheless, the safety of new treatments, particularly those based on experimental or innovative concepts, must be ensured before they are tested on patients. The EU is a strong supporter of research based around the so-called \u20183 Rs\u2019, which encourage scientists to reduce, refi ne and replace the use of laboratory animals. Recent years have seen the development and regulatory approval of non-animal tests for skin irritancy, phototoxicity and skin and eye corrosion and irritation. Further alternative tests are awaiting approval from legislators and yet more are under development. While most of these new tests take place in the test tube ( in vitro ), an increasing number of tests are being developed which are based on computer modelling ( in silico ). Between them, these new approaches promise to substantially reduce the number of animals used in experi- ments in Europe. Children and patient safety The vast majority of medicines in use today were developed for use in and tested on adults, and just a third of the medicines currently marketed in Europe are known to be suitable for children. The EU provides support to a range of projects designed to remedy this situation. For more information on child health, please go to page 36. Health biotechnology 43 The MolDiag-PaCa project \u2014 picking up on pancreatic cancer Although it is relatively rare, pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest forms of the disease, killing around 40 000 people per year in Europe alone. One of the reasons for the low survival rate is the fact that most people are not diagnosed until the tumour is too large to treat. This problem is exacerbated by the inability of standard imaging techniques to reliably detect the cancerous lesions. The \u2018Novel molecular diagnostic tools for the prevention and diagnosis of pancreatic cancer\u2019 (MolDiag-PaCa) project is working to develop new tools which will ensure that pancre- atic cancer patients are diagnosed as soon as possible. These tools include methods to identify those most at risk of developing can- cer, and screening techniques which could identify pre-cancerous lesions or early stage tumours. Novel diagnostic tests will enable doctors to detect ge- netic and molecular changes linked to pancreatic changes in samples of pan- creatic juice, serum and urine.

        "Health research focus: From evaluation to management Funding excellence in research The European Commission implements a thorough and transparent evaluation process to identify proposals worthy of funding. The process is fi rmly grounded in the principle of access for all and the codes of fairness, impartiality, confi dentiality, effi ciency and ethics. Only excellent research is to be funded. Independent experts from all over the world assist the Com- mission in the selection of proposals in a rigorously monitored peer-review process. The proposals are analysed and ranked by the experts according to several selection criteria, of which the most important is their scientifi c and technical excellence. The reviewers also identify potential issues and make recommendations to refi ne the proposals. After a negotiation phase with the selected candidates, a grant agreement detailing the fi nancial and scientifi c aspects of the project will be signed. The projects will then run typically from three to fi ve years, and their development will be monitored by the Commission services from a fi nancial and administrative point of view to ensure good management and good value-for-money use of public funds. Independent reviewers may assist the scientifi c offi cers from the Commission in the assess- ment of the scientifi c results that will defi ne the success of the project. For more information on the European Commission\u2019s proposal evaluation process, consult Rules on submission of proposals, and the related evaluation, selection and award procedures . The publica- tion is available from http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/fi nd-doc_en.html During the first half of FP7, 2800 proposals competed for funding. Only the 557 best projects were funded, for a total amount of more than EUR 2.5 billion. Who evaluates research proposals? Most of the evaluators are leading fi gures in their fi elds. They are typically experienced researchers, university professors, clinicians, company managers, etc. from Europe and abroad. Evaluators work under confi dentiality and in a personal capacity, not representing their organisation. A careful selection is made to avoid direct or indirect confl icts of interests, in order to ensure the impartial evaluation of every proposal. Each one is analysed by 3 to 10 experts, selected by the Com- mission services according to the expertise required and the complexity of the project. After a remote phase of individual evaluation, consensus meetings are held in Brussels to discuss each group of proposals for a given domain. Public funds devoted to research must be adequately spent. The principles of sound financial and administrative management must be guaranteed in all EU-funded projects.
