        "1 1. Introduction 1.1 Scope and objectives The aim of this note is to provide information on state of play of gender equality in chosen countries in the Mediterranean Region (Egypt, Turkey, Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Mauritania, Palestinian Authority Albania, and Bosnia and Herzegovina). The analysis and recommendation prepared in the study shall serve for the purpose of drafting report for the next Union for the Mediterranean Ministerial Meeting on Strengthening the Role of Women in Society by the Euro-Mediterranean Regional and Local Assembly (ARLEM). The report is divided in three sections, covering: 1. Overview of legislation on gender equality and state of play in practice, focusing on the following core domains: i) access to education, ii) access to labour market and gender pay gap, iii) access to economic/finance resources, iv) access to and participation in political life, v) demography and family policies, and vi) combating violence against women. 2. Ongoing major cooperation programmes and projects between the EU (or its Members States) and the South Neighbourhood in the field of women\u2019s empowerment. 3. Conclusions and recommendations. 1.2 Methodology and work progress During the first stage of this project, our team gathered necessary background information and key data from both international (OECD, IMF, UN, WEF, IDEA \u2013 see Sources for details) and national (statistical offices and relevant ministries) databases and repositories. Lack of up-to-date, detailed gender statistics has long been an issue for researchers studying the subjects (e.g. Juzoor, 2010; Unece, 2014) and it likewise created certain obstacles for our team. All effort has however been made to gather all the latest statistics available. We have also created a list of 18 main cooperation projects and programmes funded or co-funded by the European Union or its Member States and South Neighbourhood. In order to prepare a review of the most promising projects and in the absence of necessary information online, we sent email inquiries to institutions or individuals managing each of the project and received replies from 11 of them (one project turned out not to be co-funded by the EU). In total, seven ",
        "2 interviews regarding eight projects were conducted, with additional information in writing also provided in some cases. The information gathered was used to create an overview of those project and programmes which, based on the pre- established criteria (impact and outputs expected, monitoring tools, field of work, risk management, lessons learnt), were assessed to be the most promising.

        "3 Despite legislation on minimum age for marriage in most of the countries in the region, child marriage is still prevalent (usually in rural areas) in Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon (where the number of early marriages is rising, mostly among Syrian refugees), Mauritania, Morocco, Palestinian Authority (where the number of early marriages is slowly decreasing) and Turkey.

Overview of the gender equality legislation and the state of play 2.1 Demography and family policies and access to services Legislation Women are still discriminated against under personal status laws when it comes to divorce and child custody in most countries in the region In Algeria, Jordan, Egypt and Mauritania they are seriously disadvantaged when it comes to legal guardianship of a child during marriage and custody rights after divorce (score 0 on a WEF\u2019s scale 0-1, where 0 is the worst and 1 the best score), and somehow disadvantaged in Lebanon, Morocco, and Tunisia (score 0.5) (WEF Gender Gap Report, 2016). Only in Israel, Turkey, and Bosnia and Herzegovina women have equal rights to men in this regard (or indeed privileged in custody proceedings as in the latter; Halilovi\u0107 and Huhtanen, 2014) (see Table A1 Annex 1). In all the countries under review, women have access to paid maternity leave (in Lebanon and Egypt paid for by the employer, not the state). Additionally, everywhere apart from Mauritania governments support or provide childcare, while child allowance is paid by the state in all countries but in Jordan, Lebanon and Egypt.

        "4 The application of religious law remains a problem for a number of countries where Sharia dictates (fully or in part) the Personal Status Code, often leading to segregation against women in matters of divorce, inheritance, child custody and marriage. Instances of discrimination include the ease of men in Jordan to divorce their wives \u2013 pronouncing three times \u201cyou are divorced\u201d will suffice; women\u2019s limited access to inheritance (only half of the man\u2019s share) in Mauritania; the impossibility of a Palestinian woman to divorce without her husband\u2019s consent; the obligatory four-month waiting period before a divorced woman in Morocco is able to remarry; and the asymmetric treatment of women in Egypt and Lebanon in matters of matrimony \u2013 men may initiate divorce without their wife\u2019s consent but women must turn to courts for dissolution. Sources: OECD. Box 2. Civil vs. Religious law State of Play On average, women in the region have their first child between their 27 th (Albania and Egypt) and 31 st (Tunisia, Israel, Algeria) birthday, and on average they have two or three children (with the exception of Mauritania, with an average of four children, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, where the average is one [WEF, 2016]). 2 Access to family planning was reported by the majority of women in the region (between 93/94% in Tunisia and Turkey and 87% in Albania), although in Mauritania, 32% of women reported having unmet demand for family planning (and related high fertility rates). Maternal mortality also remains high in the country (602 deaths per 100,000 births). In the rest of the region (apart from Israel) it is significantly lower, although still above developed-country levels (see Table A1 Annex 1). When it comes to division of housework, women are still at a disadvantage compared to men. According to UN Gender Statistics, women in Albania (2010), Algeria (2012), Morocco (2011), and Tunisia (2005) spend over 5 hours a day, and women in the \u201cState of Palestine\u201d 3 (2012) and Turkey (2014) around 4.6 hours a day on unpaid domestic work. Men, conversely, spend less than one hour a day on unpaid work irrespective of the country of residence. Among two out of three countries where a cross-time comparison is available we observe only a marginal decrease in unpaid hours worked by women. Morocco (1997-2011) and the State of Palestine (1999-2012) record a 5% decrease; Turkey (2006-2012) records 25% decrease. Public Sentiment In Morocco and Algeria, respondents either agreed or strongly agreed that husbands should have final say in all decisions concerning the family (57.6% and 2 Data for the Palestinian Authority was not available. 3 Name used by the data source.

Similarly, in 2011, when asked by PEW if a husband should by chosen by a woman herself, 85% of Tunisians and 63% of Turks agreed. Among the latter, 16% thought it is the woman\u2019s family who should have the final say, and 19% thought both opinions are equally important. Roughly half of the Lebanese (46%) and Jordanians (49%) also felt both the future bride and her family should have a say (but one quarter of Jordanians also though it is solely the family\u2019s decision). When asked a more general question on if women should have equal rights with men, the majority of respondents agreed (including 58% of Egyptians, 63% of Jordanians, 74% of Tunisians, 84% of Turks and 93% of Lebanese).

        "6 FGM remains a significant problem in Egypt, where 87% of women aged 15-49 and 14% of girls aged 0-14 years have undergone the procedure between 2004- 2015 and 2010-2015 respectively \u2013 despite the fact that the procedure is illegal since 2008 and penalties for it were increased in August 2016. In Mauritania, in 2008 an estimated 71.3% of all women have undergone FGM (60% in urban and 84% in rural areas). In both countries local and international organizations, as well as religious leaders, are working together to end the practice. In Lebanon and Turkey, FGM is not believed to be commonly practiced while in Gaza some percentage of women and girls is believed to had undergone the procedure (no data is available, though). In the remaining countries, there is no evidence that FGM is practiced. Sources: UNICEF, HRW, OECD. Box 1. Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) 2.2 Combating violence against women Legislation Legislation on domestic violence exists in Albania, Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, Tunisia, Mauritania, Turkey, and Bosnia and Herzegovina (World Bank, 2016). Rape is a criminal offence in all the countries under investigation. However, in none of them with the exception of Israel (1988), Albania (2013) and Turkey (2004) is marital rape specifically mentioned in the legislation, and in general, cases of rape \u2013 as well as of sexual harassment which remains widespread all over the region (HRW, 2016) despite being criminalized everywhere apart from Lebanon and Mauritania \u2013 are believed to be rarely reported in all countries under review, mostly due to social stigma still associated with being violated (U.S. Department of State, 2016). Related to the stigma and the notion of family honour being tarnished as a result of a rape on one of its female members, a practice of pardoning the rapist should he marry his victim and therefore \u201crestore her family honour\u201d has been widespread in the region and is still legal in Algeria, Tunisia, Palestinian Authority and Lebanon. In the latter, activists have been actively campaigning against the law (Article 522 of the penal code), most recently (April 2017) staging protests in Beirut that were widely commented on by the media (BBC, 2017). In Tunisia in December 2016, a case of a 21-year-old man being allowed by court to marry a 13-year-old girl he raped sparked widespread protests (MEMRI, 2016). Such an eventuality is now impossible in Jordan, where marrying a rape survivor by a perpetrator in order to avoid punishment was made illegal in April 2017, and discussions are intensifying regarding reduced sentences for those who committed the so-called \u201chonour crimes\u201d; in December 2016 the Iftaa (religious rulings) department announced that \u201chonour killings\u201d are against sharia law and recently (21 March 2017) a court doubled sentences for two brothers who killed their sister because she run away from home with a man she fell in love with (Begum, 2017).

        "7 Syrian and Iraqi women displaced by war and military conflicts are in particular risk of violence, including forced (child) marriages, rape, sex trafficking, and slavery \u2013 both in their respective countries of origin and in temporary host countries. In Lebanon, throughout 2015 and 2016 police raids found \u201cdozens\u201d of Syrian women in brothels in the north of the country (HRW, 2016). In Turkey, young girls are reportedly being sold as prostitutes and brides (especially into illegal polygamous marriages). Sources: UN, HRW, Council on Foreign Relations, Associated Press (AP), OHCHR. State of play According to numerous reports (HRW, 2016; UN, 2013; CAPMAS, UNFPA, NCW, 2016; U.S. Department of State, 2016) violence against women \u2013 including sexual and domestic violence \u2013 remains a serious problem in the region, with HRW (2016) calling it outright \u201cendemic\u201d in case of Egypt and \u201cwidespread\u201d in case of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In Albania, the 2013 national population-based survey on domestic violence showed that 59.4% of women aged 18-55 have experienced domestic violence at some point in their lives and 53.7% were still experiencing it when the survey took place. Less educated and rural women were at greater risk of being victims of abuse than better educated and urban ones with women on maternity leave reporting abuse especially often (77.9% compared to 52.9% of women working outside of home and 64.2% of housewives) (Albanian Statistical Office, 2014). The same year, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 41% of women aged 15+ reported experiencing psychological violence, 24% physical violence, 6% sexual violence and 5% economic violence (B&H Statistical Office, 2016). Rural women were slightly less at risk of abuse (49.2% compared to 44.3% urban women), and as in Albania more educated women were less often victims of domestic violence. In Turkey, the percentage of women who have ever experienced physical or sexual violence decreased slightly between 2008 and 2014 (by 3.3 pp in urban areas and 7.7 pp in rural ones down to 37% and 39% respectively) (Turkish Statistical Institute, 2015). Public sentiment 83% of Tunisian men and 88% of Tunisian women agree or strongly agree \u201cthat the government should provide safe houses for the victims of domestic violence\u201d and 81% of men and 87% believe that combating domestic violence should be a high priority in order to improves lives of Tunisian women (AWLI, 2015).

Note: estimated data for Israel for 2011. 2.3 Access to education Legislation Legislation in all the analysed countries ensures equal access to education for women and men. State of play Access to education at primary and higher levels increases chances of female participation in the labour market and financial independence (A. Abdel Mowla, 2009; Palestinian Women Research Documentation Center, 2008). Literacy rates in the region are much lower among women than men with the female literacy rate among adult (15+) females ranging from 42% in Mauritania to 97% in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania, and for males from 63% in Mauritania to close to 100% in Bosnia and Herzegovina 4 . The situation looks more favourable amongst young people aged 15-24, confirming a trend towards more equal access to education. The gender parity index (expressed as a female-to-male ratio) for youth literacy rate equals 1 or even more in Albania, Jordan, Lebanon, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, and exceeds 0.96 in all remaining countries (with the exception of Mauritania (0.79), where women\u2019s access to education is especially 4 Data for Israel and Palestine was not available.

        "9 restricted among the agrarian-based, poorly educated population). Across the region, the access to all levels education for women improved in recent years (see Table A1 in the Annex 1). The gross enrolment rate in secondary and tertiary education in 2014 was much higher for females than for males in Albania, Israel, Algeria, Tunisia, Lebanon, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the remaining countries, the gap is in favour of men, with the highest one noted in Turkey (12 pp higher gross enrolment ratio in tertiary education than women). Moreover, an analysis of the national- level data reveals within-country heterogeneity. In Albania, 23% of women in urban areas have a tertiary education, but only 5.2% of women in rural areas do. Furthermore, 30% of females in urban areas have primary or below-primary education in comparison to 60.9% women in rural areas (data for 2013). In Jordan 14.3% of adult females living in rural areas and 8.8% of those in urban ones are illiterate (data for 2014). In Palestine, the average number of years of schooling differs by region, although they converge for both sexes, see Figure 4. To summarise, there is unequal access to education mainly in Mauritania and Turkey, especially for higher than primary levels. In other countries, there is a positive trend towards more equal enrolment ratios, and the illiteracy rates in younger cohorts are lower than in the past. One of the frontrunners in the field of women\u2019s education is Morocco. In recent years the country has recorded a significant narrowing of the gender gap in school enrolment (World Bank, 2015b), making strides towards eliminating illiteracy among women. Most notably, implementation of literacy training programmes has had a positive impact among women in rural Morocco (Moroccan Ministry of Solidarity, Women, Family and Social Development, 2016). 10,35 10,39 10,5 10,55 10,56 10,59 10,59 9,64 9,8 10,01 10,08 10,15 10,32 10,41 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 10,47 10,56 10,67 10,74 10,74 10,77 10,77 9,83 10,01 10,24 10,34 10,4 10,56 10,66 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 10,68 10,86 10,98 11,08 11,04 11,09 11,07 10,17 10,4 10,65 10,82 10,82 10,98 11,09 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Males Females Figure 4.

        "10 2.4 Access to labour market Legislation Discrimination on the basis of gender in employment (hiring, promotion, and sometimes wages) is prohibited according to law in Albania, Algeria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Egypt, Israel, Morocco, Palestinian Authority, Tunisia and Turkey. In Mauritania, Jordan and Lebanon, no such provisions exist. In Lebanon, in 2000 the Labour Code was amended to ensure more equal pay for women. In Jordan, married women need their husbands\u2019 consent to work outside the house, while in Tunisia women are prohibited from working at night (with few exceptions), and the Turkish Civil Code specifies that \u201cthe harmony and welfare of the marriage union should be borne in mind when choosing and performing a job or profession\u201d. In Algeria, in February 2016 the parliament proclaimed its aims to achieve \u201cparity between women and men in the job market\u201d and \u201cencourages the promotion of women to positions of responsibility in public institutions and in businesses\u201d (HRW, 2016). State of play In all the analysed countries, there exists a gap between economic activity of men and women which cannot be explained by differences in education level alone. Except for Albania, Israel, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, the female labour force participation rate does not exceed one-half or one-third of the male participation rate, and even higher enrolment rates by females into tertiary education (discussed in the previous section) do not translate into higher female employment. Among those who are economically active, women are also at much higher risk of unemployment (apart from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Israel, and Albania) and they more often work part-time (see Tables A2 and A3 Annex 1). The main reasons for the gender gap in employment are: lack of work-life balance, gender discrimination, and socio-cultural norms regarding female work, as well as practical issues such as lack of safe, reliable, and affordable transport to workplace (World Bank, 2011; Momani, 2016; World Bank, 2009). Time spent on domestic work (including that on childcare) is in all countries much higher for women. National statistics shows that e.g. in Albania 25% of inactive adult women Source: Own preparation based on: World Bank Gender Indicators database; 2010 and 2015 estimations for Palestine based on national data. 0 0,1 0,2 0,3 0,4 0,5 0,6 0,7 0,8 0,9 A l b a n i a A l g e r i a E g y p t J o r d a n L e b a n o n I s r a e l M o r o c c o T u n i s i a M a u r i t a n i a T u r k e y B & H P a l e s t i n e 2010 2015 2016 Figure 5.

        "11 and only 1% of men declare housework as the main reason for inactivity. In Turkey, the shares are respectively 71.2% and 0.4%. In Jordan, 74% of married women and around 15% of those never married are inactive due to household duties. Differences also exist in terms of the structure of employment and characteristics of jobs occupied by men and women (including remuneration). Men more often work in the industry and females in services and agriculture (see Table A0 Annex 1). Segregation of women in other sectors and jobs than men, as well as discrimination in the labour market result in a gender wage gap that ranges from 45% in Morocco to 18% in Albania. The wage gap in Turkey is broader for professionals and qualified agriculture-, husbandry-, hunting-, forestry- and fishing workers, and relatively narrow for non-qualified workers. In sum, the low labour market participation of women is an important issue in the majority of the analysed countries. Even in countries with equal access to education, many women face institutional and socio-cultural barriers to enter the labour market. Public sentiment Beliefs on the traditional role of women as caregivers or housewives that should not have a paid job outside the home also may contribute to female inactivity. In Albania, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, the majority of both men and women agree that women can have a paid job should she wish to, while in Lebanon, Israel and Turkey men are in favour of this statement less often than women. In all other countries, there is a much weaker acceptance of female economic activity. Figure 6. Wage for similar work - sex ratio (f/m) by country. Source: The Global Gender Gap reports 2016.

In all the investigated countries, women have a legally-enforceable right to inheritance, however, while in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Israel, and Mauritania women enjoy the same rights to inheritance as men, in Palestinian Authority, Figure 7. Public perceptions on women\u2019s participation in the labour force by sex and country. ",
        "13 Egypt, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco and Turkey (only when Islamic law applies) women are only entitled to half the share of their male counterparts. In Albania, civil law prescribes equal rights to inheritance for both men and women but traditional law, which only allows men to inherit, often takes precedence in parts of the country. In Lebanon, the law discriminates against women married to a foreign spouse, in which occasion the wife needs to forego her right to inherit and own property. In all countries reviewed, with the exception of Algeria, women have equal rights to property as men. In Algeria, while Article 38 of the family code vests women with the right to property, Article 39 limits their capacity to dispose of their income and property independently by prescribing that a wife needs to obey her husband. Moreover, in Palestinian Authority, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Jordan and Egypt, socio-cultural norms, inheritance laws, and costs of property registration significantly impair women\u2019s capacity to own assets. Across the countries investigated, no direct legislation barring women from accessing financial services exist. However, in Palestinian Authority, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Algeria, Jordan, Morocco and Egypt limited access to assets significantly impairs on women\u2019s capacity to secure credit due to a lack of collateral. State of play According to the Global Gender Gap Report 2016 (WEF), it will take MENA counties 356 years to close the economic gender gap, making it the second-slowest (after South Asia) progressing region of the world in this regard. Amongst MENA region countries, Israel has the smallest gender economic gap; in 2016 Israel ranked 49 (out of 144 countries), with the next MENA countries Qatar and Algeria far behind in 119 th and 120 th place respectively. Israel also performs best among the countries investigated in terms of women\u2019s economic participation and opportunity. Compared to the same group of 144 countries, Israel ranked 62 nd , with Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Mauritania following in 73 rd , 113 th and 128 th place respectively. Significant differences among the investigated countries also exist in terms of equality of opportunity that corporations offer to men and women in pursue of positions of leadership. Here, Albania, Algeria and Jordan perform best, while Mauritania, 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 Firms whose ownership includes women Firms whose top management includes women Figure 8.

        "14 Turkey, and Bosnia and Herzegovina present the most adverse environment towards career advancement for women. In 2016, seven out of twelve countries for which data was available offered no rights to inheritance for daughters, however all countries in the region performed above average in terms of women\u2019s access to both land and non-land assets (WEF, 2016). Financial inclusion is a significant component of economic participation, removing boundaries to economic growth and allowing people to profit from a greater level of financial stability. Between 2011 and 2014, all countries expanded financial inclusion, although gender remained a central factor affecting people\u2019s ability to access credit and other financial instruments. According to the WB Global Findex Database, Israel is the only country where gender has little impact on a person\u2019s capacity to borrow money, as in 2014, 40.2% of women and 40.8% of men were said to have borrowed money from a financial institution over the past 12 months (see Table A4 Annex1). Conversely, 25.3% of men borrowed money from a financial institution in 2014 in Turkey and only a meagre 6.1% of women did the same during 2014 \u2013 other countries presented less pronounced differences across the two sexes. Instead, women across most of the countries examined here seem to turn towards informal forms of accessing credit (see Tables A5 & A6 Annex 1). In Albania, Mauritania, Egypt and Turkey between 45.5% and 25.6% of women access credit through family and friends, while between 44.3% and 29% of men gain access to credit the same way. Access to credit is not the only important aspect of financial inclusion. Access to formal forms of saving is of equal importance as it contributes to the development of an individual\u2019s credit history, a significant determinant of access to (inexpensive) formal forms of borrowing. In this category, Israel significantly outperforms all other countries, reporting small differences between the two sexes across all variables of interest, including holding an account at a financial institution, owning a debit card, and saving at a financial institution. For the rest of the countries surveyed here, gender is an important determinant of having access to savings, both in terms of having an account at a financial institution and owning a debit card. In 2014, the respective average gender gap was at 15.4 and 14.7 pp for having access to an account at a financial institution and owning a debit card; the gap drops to 5.5 pp when comparing the rates of men and women using a financial institution to store their savings (see Tables A3, A8, A9 and A10 Annex 1).

On the contrary, Albania, Algeria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Mauritania, and Tunisia have legislated quotas for women on candidate lists for the lower/single house (Quota Project, 2014). Moreover, the first three also have quotas at the sub-national level (see Figure 10). In Algeria, Jordan and Morocco the law requires that seats are reserved for women in the lower/single house (31.6%, 12% and 16.7% respectively). Voluntary political party quotas can be found in Israel (Israel Labor Party, Meretz-Yachad, Likud, the Jewish Home, National Democratic Assembly) and Turkey (The Republican People\u2019s Party, Peace and Democracy Party). In order to ensure the gender quota provisions are respected, in Albania, Algeria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia various types of sanctions are imposed for non-compliance (Quota Project, 2014). State of play In 2016, women held seats in national governments of all the countries under investigation. However, the actual numbers varied greatly, between only 3.1% seats held by women in the Lebanese parliament and roughly one third in Algerian (31.6%) and Tunisian (31.3%) ones (IPU, 2017; for details see Annex 1).

        "16 Unlike unmarried men, unmarried women cannot pass on their nationality to their children if the child was born in a country (Jordan) or outside of it (Jordan, Lebanon, Mauritania, Tunisia). In Jordan and Lebanon married women face the same problem and with a few exceptions their children cannot inherit their citizenship the way they can from their father, regardless whether the child was born in or outside the country. In the latter case the same is true for women in Mauritania and Tunisia. Moreover, in Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Mauritania (with few exceptions) and Morocco women cannot pass their citizenship to their foreign born husbands (while men are allowed to do that). The laws are actively campaigned against, especially in Jordan and Lebanon. Sources : RefWorld, 2016; Equality Now, 2016; Open Society Foundation, 2017. Box 4. Transferring nationality to spouses and children Similarly, the number of women in ministerial positions was diverse, from less than one-tenth in Jordan (7.1%), Turkey (3.8%), and Lebanon (3.4%), to 30.8% in Mauritania and 40% in Albania. Moreover, Bosnia and Herzegovina stood out having one of the world\u2019s 53 female Speakers of parliament. In the Palestinian Authority, where, due to an ongoing political conflict, the last elections to the Palestinian Legislative Council last took place in January 2006, municipal elections were recently (13 May 2017) held for the first time in five years. However, due to an ongoing political conflict between Fatah and Hamas, elections were only held in the occupied West Bank but not in the Gaza Strip. Regardless, female candidates won 19.8% seats (Central Elections Commission \u2013 Palestine, 2017), securing between 17.6% (Hebron) and 22.9% (Jericho) of seats in each of 11 districts. In general, in all countries the proportion of female representatives in lower or single houses increased between January 2010 and May 2017 (with the exception on Lebanon and Palestinian Authority where no parliamentary elections were held in this period), with biggest increase noted in Algeria (up by 23.9 pp), moderate progress in Morocco (10 pp), Israel (8.3 pp), Albania (6.5 pp), and Turkey (5.5 pp), and some increase in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Egypt, Jordan, Mauritania and Tunisia (4.7, 2.2, 4.6, 3.1 and 3.7 pp respectively) (see Table A0 Annex 1).

        "17 When it comes to ministerial positions held by women, only in Lebanon and Turkey did their proportion, compared to those held by men, decrease between 2010 and 2017 (by 3.5 pp and 3.9 pp respectively). The biggest increase in proportion of female ministers was noted in Albania (33.3 pp), Bosnia and Herzegovina (22.2 pp) and Tunisia (19.3 pp) (see Table A2 Annex 1). Unfortunately, limited data on the participation of women in national justice systems and diplomatic corps is available from national statistical offices. Bosnia and Herzegovina reported that in 2014, 25.9% of its ambassadors and general consuls were female (a small increase from 25% in 2013). In Turkey, the number of female ambassadors more than doubled between 2010 and 2016 (from 21 to 43) in absolute terms, however they still constitute only 18% of all Turkish ambassadors (up from 11% in 2010). In Albania in 2013 17% of all ambassadors were female, however women constituted almost half of heads of missions of lower ranks and 60% of all first and second secretaries. Finally, in Jordan, 10.9% of all ambassadors were female in 2015 (up from 7.3% in 2010 and 5.1% in 2011), and 19.9% of the diplomatic corps at all levels (increase by 2.2 pp from 2010). Moreover, in 2015, almost one-fifth (18.9%) of all the judges and almost one fourth (23.7%) of all lawyers in the Kingdom were female (up from 8.8% and 9.7% in 2010 respectively). In Morocco, roughly a quarter (23%) of all judges were female in 2014. In Albania, Algeria, and Turkey their share was roughly 42% (in 2014, 2013 and 2016 respectively). In Albania, this number remained Sources: WEF, 2016; IDEA Gender Quotas Database, 2013. Figure 10.

        "18 unchanged since 2010, but both in Algeria and Turkey the percentage of female judges increased during this period (by 3 pp and 12 pp respectively). Interestingly, in Bosnia and Herzegovina there were more women (62%) than men among judges in 2014. Public sentiment Scarce recent data is available when it comes to public views on women in politics. Interesting results were seen from Tunisia, usually seen as an example for other countries in the region in terms of female empowerment, where a 2015 poll by Arab Women\u2019s Leadership Institute found that men appeared to be more supportive of female candidates than women themselves; according to this poll, 66% of men and 44% of women would vote for a female candidate to parliament out of two equally qualified candidates. That said, they more strongly oppose an idea of a woman as a president (63% versus 51% of women) or prime minister (45% versus 25% of women); for the lower level positions (ministers, mayors, political party leaders) as well as judges the support for female candidates is decidedly higher. Roughly the same number of men and women (63% and 67% respectively) think that since the 2011 revolution \u201cthings are moving in the right direction\u201d for women\u2019s political participation in the country, and that women are allowed to freely and fully participate in the society (55% and 54%). 2.7 Summary Overall, it can be concluded that, while legislation promoting gender equality is still missing in many areas (such as family law), what is more crucial in the region is its lack of its adequate implementation. For instance, although in almost all countries under investigation (apart from Mauritania, Jordan and Lebanon) some kind of laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of gender in employment (hiring, promotion, and sometimes wages) exists, women are still less economically active; moreover, those who are at much higher risk of 0 0,05 0,1 0,15 0,2 0,25 0,3 0,35 Don't know Lack of desire to participate Family resistance Security fears Economic independence Cultural traditions Islamic law Lack of money Lack of education Men Women Source: Arab Women\u2019s Leadership Institute 2015 Figure 11.

        "19 unemployment (apart from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Israel, and Albania) and earning less than men for performing the same tasks. These differences cannot be explained solely by gaps in educational attainment, albeit admittedly access to education does remain to be a problem (especially in rural areas). However, it is rather socio-cultural norms regarding women, their place in family and society, and resulting discrimination in workplaces (including a preference for employing men [World Values Survey]) that causes discrepancies between the relative gender positions in the labour market. The fact that the gender gap in unemployment is lowest in three countries with a socialist past (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Albania, and Israel), where it is perfectly acceptable that women work outside of home (especially in the first two, see Figure 7), confirms that view. That said, more practical issues, such as lack of work-life balance, problems with commuting to work, and difficulties is accessing financing in order to start a business constitute significant obstacles as well. Importantly, lack of economic independence is not only a result of but also a factor contributing to the disadvantaged position of women in families; for instance, research in Albania shows that women working outside of the house are at a lower risk of experiencing domestic violence. The problem of violence against women is exacerbated by the societal concept of women as bearers of family honour and perception of husbands as final decision makers in the family (related to that is lack of conception of marital rape in the legislation of the majority of countries in the region). When it comes to participation in political life, a number of governments proactively (and with success) encourage female candidates by virtue of setting various quotas. However, it is too early to determine whether higher number of female MPs does translate in any way into more gender sensitive legislation, especially that \u2013 just as in business environment \u2013 women tend to occupy positions of power (e.g. ministerial ones) far less often than men, and the public is not fully supportive of female leaders yet. In the judiciary, a high percentage of female judges appears to have some positive impact on treatment of gender- related issues; for instance, the Association of Women Judges in Bosnia and Herzegovina prepared a report with recommendations on Sextortion (2011). In general, governments do not seem to focus on gender-related issues sufficiently, although a number of initiatives, such as an ongoing Tunisian programme fostering female economic empowerment, can be found. Most recently, Egypt declared 2017 the \u201cYear of Egyptian Women\u201d and created a 2030 National Woman\u2019s Strategy, which goal is \u201cachievement of equality between woman and man in terms of all civil, political, economic, social and cultural ",

        "21 3. Overview of existing main cooperation programs and projects State of play Currently, 17 existing major cooperation projects and programmes funded or co- funded by EU agencies or one or more of the Member States, could be identified. Tables with detailed information on each of the projects can be found in Annex 2. As it can be seen from these tables, there is a considerable variation in the number of ongoing projects in each of the states under review. The countries where the most initiatives were being implemented ranged from Egypt (10) to Jordan (9) and Morocco and Tunisia (8). A further 6 projects and/or programmes were undertaken on both Lebanese and Palestinian territories, 4 in Israel, and 3 in both Turkey and Algeria. No initiatives could be identified in Albania, Mauritania or in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Similarly, some domains related to women\u2019s empowerment were more often addressed than other. The plurality of projects (8) and programmes focused on women\u2019s economic and professional empowerment, while 4 projects focused on political and civic empowerment. Gender-based violence, poverty and gender stereotyping, as well as health issues, were tackled by 1 projects each. 10 of the 17 projects and programs that are currently being implemented started only recently, in either 2016 or 2017, with the longest running among them being \u201cEconomic Integration of Women in the MENA region\u201d (starting in 2010 and running through 2018). Similarly, the \u201cShe Entrepreneurs\u201d programme has been running since 2011 and has no definite date of completion set. In terms of funding sources, apart from EU agencies, France, the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Germany were among the Member States most active in the region. Budgets allocated on EU-level to each individual initiative varied from \u20ac150 thousand (for action grants) to \u20ac1.8 million (for EU Neighbourhood projects), with the average funding of approximately \u20ac550 000 per project. Member States in turn allocated between \u20ac970 thousand (co-funding from Italy) to \u20ac36.8 million (programme sponsored by the UK). Most promising projects and programmes For a number of projects and programmes we received written feedback from project managers, and many of these had very promising aspects. At the same time, the political and economic situation in the region was identified as a major obstacle to realization of these projects by the majority of interviewees (for ",
        "22 instance significant limitations facing NGOs in Egypt and Turkey negatively affected collaboration on the ground). In the field of women\u2019s economic empowerment (WEE), it is worth noting the considerable efforts of the Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), who has been implementing a number of mutually complementary projects in Jordan, Tunisia, Egypt and Morocco. Especially promising are \u201cPromoting Employment of Young Women through Applied Gender Diversity Management in Companies in the MENA Region\u201d 2015-2020 (GDM) and \"Economic Integration of Women in the MENA region (EconoWin)\" 2010-2018. In the former, GIZ works with large international companies in order to promote women-friendly policies (e.g. flexible working hours, childcare services, gender neutral communications) that are beneficial both to female employees and companies themselves, as well as proving companies that the latter is true also in the MENA region. In-depth evaluations that were carried out at the beginning and during the programme to track the change in attitudes of both management and employees at all levels showed significant progress in how female employees are perceived. Successful pilot projects involving large, well- known and respected companies are now being used to promote WEE in other workplaces, including SMEs. The second project focused on raising awareness among different sectors of society; short films were directed by local artists to show various problems women face in labour market. Thanks to working with local CSOs, a wide spectrum of communities \u2013 from Jordanian Bedouins to Egyptian farmers \u2013 were approached. Different approach is being undertaken by DAI in their project \u201cArab Women's Enterprise Fund\u201d (AWEF), which aims at improving access to markets of poor women in Egypt, Jordan and the Occupied Palestine Territories. Interestingly, instead of using microfinance (whereby husbands may highjack their wives\u2019 loans), the project uses market systems approach. Thus far, AWEF managed to find 24 partners that promised to leverage an estimated \u00a3877,853 (AWES contributes \u00a3220,656) to various interventions focusing on different sectors of economy. A particular strength of the programme is the development of sophisticated impact measuring tools such as AWEF Empowerment Mapping tool (in the making) and Disadvantage Assessment Tool (designed to replace PPI Index). Financial literacy and enhancing entrepreneurial capacities are a focus of another project in the field of WEE, namely \u201cPromoting women empowerment for inclusive and sustainable industrial development in the Mena region\u201d implemented by United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) (2015-2018). Under the project, around 2,000 women are expected to be trained and roughly 800 new jobs are to be created. Importantly, the project addresses ",
        "23 problem of lack of access to funding by virtue of working with selected International Finance Institutions to facilitate access to banking loans for women. Female entrepreneurs are also the target audience of \u201cSHE Entrepreneurs\u201d, which is funded by the government of Sweden and has been providing trainings for 30 female social entrepreneurs a year since 2011ir. The preliminary results of their ongoing evaluation show that 80% of project alumnae were still running their businesses after graduating from the programme. Importantly, SHE Entrepreneurs is not a business incubator but an accelerator, focusing on businesses that contribute to improvement of the overall well-being of women in entrepreneurs\u2019\u2019 communities. Outside of the field of economic empowerment, an important and promising project entitled \u201cImproved protection and promotion of the rights of extremely vulnerable, marginalized and discriminated children, young women and men in street situation in Cairo\u201d is being implemented by SAMU Social International Egypt. Under the project, homeless children and youth (roughly 1,000 a year) are provided with medical, legal and ad-hoc assistance. Their mobile units are being used as a model by the government, among whose representatives they conducted awareness raising campaigns. Currently, the project is co-run by Banati (Arabic for \u201cgirls\u201d) Foundation to focus more on less visible homelessness among girls and young women. Along slightly different, albeit related lines, a promising attempt at bringing together different actors in the field of female empowerment (CSOs, local authorities, media, private sector, academia, research institutes and society in general) and at increasing their trust each other (at least in the field in question) is undertaken under Axis 1 of the project \u201cWomen for the future in the Mediterranean\u201d, \"Strengthening the capacity of equality actors\u201d, implemented by the IE Med institute. Finally, a project in Turkey \u201cA significant beginning in preventing violence against women: developing and spreading a model of collecting data\u201d, implemented by Mor \u00c7at\u0131 Women\u2019s Shelter Foundation, specifically focuses on collection of data of cases of violence against women. The goal is to develop free-of-charge software that will enable this collection in a secure, consistent, and systematic way. ",

        "25 4. Conclusions and recommendations Data gathering, synthesis and dissemination In-depth, rigorous, and comprehensive analysis of the situation of women in the region is difficult without access to complex, up-to-date data on gender-sensitive issues. Moreover, its absence negatively affects awareness raising campaigns that \u2013 in order to be effective and trustworthy \u2013 need to be based on real-life numbers. While the majority of projects and programmes examined contain a data collection and knowledge building element, the information gathered is not disseminated as widely as it could be and, as a result, not only wider public but also creators of respective databases remain unaware of the existence of their colleagues\u2019 efforts. Coordination between funding agencies Another related issue is a lack of comprehensive database of all the projects and programmes in the field of female empowerment that are conducted in the region, which makes coordination between the implementing entities very difficult and has adverse effect on the overall efficiency of assistance delivered by various funding agencies, creating space for overlapping and \u201cprogramme-hopping\u201d among end beneficiaries (while leaving others without any help at all). Coordination between different projects and programmes would also allow for undertaking a more holistic approach towards the issue of female empowerment \u2013 currently certain aspects seem to be overlooked (e.g. health) while others benefit from intensified attention. Changes in public sentiment Neither adjustments in national laws, nor nationally or internationally funded projects and programmes aimed at empowering women will not work as well as they could as long as public sentiment regarding women\u2019s role in family and society changes. For instance, socio-cultural (as well as religious) norms and focus on women\u2019s role as the guardians of families\u2019 honour make addressing issues of domestic violence difficult. Similarly, in case of access to financial resources (inheritance, ownership of assets) and labour force participation, even if adequate laws are passed, they often cannot be fully enforced due to social constraints. Awareness building campaigns need to be designed for each country\u2019s specific needs, and should involve religious as well as local community leaders in order to be effective (for instance Jordan\u2019s attempts to tackle the issue of \u201chonour ",
        "26 killings\u201d by both adjusting the state laws and issuing religious ruling (fatwa) are a good example). These efforts should be enforced by extensive engagement of the media; their powerful role can be illustrated by the outrage that followed a segment of popular Moroccan show teaching how to use make up to conceal bruises after a beating. A role of schools and teachers, as well as local imams (and priests), should also not be underestimated in awareness building efforts. Working with a variety of stakeholders Engaging a wide variety of stakeholders is crucial for the success of all activities in the field of women\u2019s empowerment, not least while attempting to change public sentiment. It is therefore important to not focus solely on the \u201cusual suspects\u201d, but also identify less obvious groups of audiences while dealing with various issues (for instance, taxi drivers in case of sexual harassment, popular soap opera celebrities in various awareness raising campaigns, female shopkeepers and beauticians to spot domestic violence victims). Public transport development Commuting to work is a major problem both for women and men, however in case of the former additional issues arise, such as harassment in public transport, the fact the women less often than men possess both driving licences and cars, have less disposable income, and finally fact that long commutes may make combining paid work and childcare responsibilities impossible. Indeed, one study in Jordan found that \u201ctransportation challenges are one of the most significant barriers to youth participation in the workforce, especially for females\u201d, especially in rural areas, and were a reason why they were forced to \u201cleave jobs within six months of being hired\u201d (International Youth Foundation, 2014). Therefore, projects addressing the issue of insufficient, expensive, and unreliable public transport should be developed (World Bank, 2009; World Bank, 2011; Momani, 2016). Access to finance Focusing on financial inclusion is crucial not only because it facilitates female labour force participation (by providing access to funding for their businesses) but also due to its improvement of their standing in family and society in general. For instance, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, one study showed that domestic violence perpetrators are less likely to be jailed by the judges if \u201cthe defendant is the primary breadwinner\u201d (Halilevi\u0107 and Huhtanen, 2014). Indeed, even from theological point of view in Islam, the dominance of men over women stems from their privileged access to financial resources (Quran 4:34, ",
        "27 \u201cMen are in charge of women, because Allah hath made the one of them to excel the other, and because they spend of their property (for the support of women\u201d) 5 . It can therefore be argued that if a woman is providing for her own sustenance herself, she is not subjugated to a man (see Masoud et al., 2016; Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars & RAND Corporation, 2005). This could also potentially be used as an argument for equal inheritance rights (sons inherit more since they need to provide for their wives and children) and equal rights in marriage (wife does not \u201cowe\u201d obedience to her husband in exchange for his financial support) 6 . 5 According to the Islamic law, it is the husband who is responsible for providing for the family, and women\u2019s salary (if she is bringing any) is traditionally seen as her own property, although naturally under economic hardship this is not a case . 6 Naturally this argumentation serves for the purpose of adjusting state laws (as was a case in Tunisia), as changes in religious laws (in this case: sharia) are out of scope not only of this study, but out of politicians\u2019 reach (at least in the countries under investigation, although not for instance in Iran). In any case, due to lack of official clergy hierarchy in Sunni Islam any alterations to commonly accepted interpretations of religious laws are extremely difficult. ",

        "57 Outcomes As a result of its action, the project succeeded in engaging and empowering 10,125 stakeholder groups (women and young people). The 2013 annual project report states as a success that during the first 12 months many stakeholders accessed the Deauville MENA Transition Fund activities. However, the Transition Fund remains relatively unsuccessful in terms of supporting reform in transition countries, where the pace of implementation has eluded expectations. The 2014 annual project report highlights progress in reinforcing inclusive growth in countries such as Morocco, Tunisia, Jordan and Egypt through the introduction of more effective policies and economic institutions. Nevertheless, the the pace of change often remains constrained by political uncertainty and growing regional instability. The 2015 annual report states that mainly due to the nature of certain reforms progress is more obvious in some categories than others (e.g. governance). 5) Programmes and projects financed by agencies in EU Member States Making homes violence-free in Albania.
