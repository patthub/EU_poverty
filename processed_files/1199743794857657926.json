Commission on the Status of Women Established on 21 June 1946, the UN Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) is the principal global intergovernmental body exclusively dedicated to the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women . As one of the functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council, it is also responsible for monitoring and reviewing the implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, and for mainstreaming a gender perspective in UN activities. Each year, CSW holds a two-week session where representatives of UN Member States, civil society organizations and UN entities gather to discuss the annual priority theme based on the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and on the outcome of the 23rd special session of the General Assembly held in 2000 (Beijing +5), and to evaluate progress in implementing agreed conclusions from previous sessions as a review theme: \uf0b7 2013: Priority theme: Elimination and prevention of all forms of violence against women and girls. 1 Review theme from the 53rd session of the CSW: the equal sharing of responsibilities between women and men, including caregiving in the context of HIV/AIDS. \uf0b7 2014: Priority theme: Challenges and achievements in the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for women and girls. Review theme from the 54th session of the CSW: Access and participation of women and girls to education, 1 For more information, please see the following publications of the European Parliament, Directorate General for Internal Policies, Policy Department C: Citizens' Rights and Constitutional Affairs, Women's Rights & Gender Equality:\"The issue of violence against women in the European Union\", author: Claire Genta, 2010, http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/note/join/2010/419623/IPOL-FEMM_NT(2010)419623_EN.pdf and \"Violence against women\", author: Dessislava Velikova, 2005. http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/note/join/2005/365967/IPOL-FEMM_NT(2005)365967_EN.pdf ",

For the last 20 years, the BPfA has been the world\u2019s most powerful framework for international and national gender equality policies and practices. 7 As a defining framework for change, the Platform for Action makes comprehensive commitments under 12 critical areas of concern : (A) women and poverty, (B) education and training of women, (C) women and health, (D) violence against women, (E) women and armed conflict, (F) women and the economy, (G) women in power and decision- making, (H) institutional mechanisms for the advancement of women, (I) human rights of women, (J) women and the media, (K) women and the environment and (L) the girl child. 2 For more information on women's empowerment in the field of education, please see \"Empowering women and girls through education\", European Parliament, Directorate General for Internal Policies, Policy Department C: Citizens' Rights and Constitutional Affairs, Women's Rights & Gender Equality, authors: Katie McCracken, Elaine Unterhalter, Sergio M\u00e1rquez and Agata Che\u0142stowska, February 2015. http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2015/510022/IPOL_STU(2015)510022_EN.pdf 3 For more information, please see also \"Review and appraisal of the implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and the outcomes of the 23rd special session of the General Assembly\", UN Economic and Social Council, Report of the Secretary General, E/CN.6/2015/3, 15 December 2014. http://www.unwomen.org/~/media/headquarters/attachments/sections/csw/59/ecn620153.pdf 4 For more information, please see \"Evaluation of the Beijing Platform for Action +20 and the opportunities for achieving gender equality and the empowerment of women in the post-2015 development agenda\", European Parliament, Directorate General for Internal Policies, Policy Department C: Citizens' Rights and Constitutional Affairs, Women's Rights & Gender Equality, author: Petra Debusscher, March 2015. http://www.unwomen.org/~/media/headquarters/attachments/sections/csw/59/ecn620153.pdf 5 Commission on the Status of Women, http://www.unwomen.org/en/csw 6 For more information, please see also \"Gender mainstreaming in Committees and Delegations of the European Parliament\", European Parliament, Directorate General for Internal Policies, Policy Department C: Citizens' Rights and Constitutional Affairs, Women's Rights & Gender Equality, author: Istituto per la Ricerca Sociale, March 2014. http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/etudes/join/2014/493051/IPOL-FEMM_ET(2014)493051_EN.pdf 7 \"Evaluation of the Beijing Platform for Action +20 and the opportunities for achieving gender equality and the empowerment of women in the post-2015 development agenda\", European Parliament, Directorate General for Internal Policies, Policy Department C: Citizens' Rights and Constitutional Affairs, Women's Rights & Gender Equality, author: Petra Debusscher, March 2015. http://www.unwomen.org/~/media/headquarters/attachments/sections/csw/59/ecn620153.pdf ",
        "Policy Department C: Citizens' Rights and Constitutional Affairs ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 10 1. WOMEN'S EMPOWERMENT KEY FINDINGS \uf0b7 Women\u2019s empowerment means women gaining more power and control over their own lives . \uf0b7 According to UN World Survey on the Role of Women in Development 2014, there are proven synergies between women's empowerment and economic, social and environmental sustainability. \uf0b7 The chronic underinvestment in gender equality has been aggravated by the austerity measures adopted in many countries in the post-crisis context. 1.1. The concept of empowerment Empowerment can be defined as a \"multi-dimensional social process that helps people gain control over their own lives. It is a process that fosters power (that is, the capacity to implement) in people, for use in their own lives, their communities, and in their society, by acting on issues that they define as important\". 8 1.2. Empowering women Women\u2019s empowerment means women gaining more power and control over their own lives . This entails the idea of women\u2019s continued disadvantage compared to men which is apparent in different economic, socio-cultural and political spheres. Therefore, women\u2019s empowerment can also be seen as an important process in reaching gender equality , which is understood to mean that the \"rights, responsibilities and opportunities of individuals will not depend on whether they are born male or female\". 9 According to the UN Population Fund, an empowered woman has a sense of self-worth. She can determine her own choices , and has access to opportunities and resources providing her with an array of options she can pursue. She has control over her own life , both within and outside the home and she has the ability to influence the direction of social change to create a more just social and economic order, both nationally and internationally. 10 Gender role expectations are institutionalized through legislative, educational, political and economic systems. Women need to be \"empowered\" in order to narrow the \"gender gap\" and to create an equal playing field between women and men before gender equality can be reached and maintained. 11 8 Page and Czuba, Extension Journal, October 1999. http://www.joe.org/joe/1999october/comm1.php For a more detailed description of empowerment, please see also \"Empowerment of Roma Women within the European Framework of National Roma Inclusion Strategies\", European Parliament, Directorate General for Internal Policies, Policy Department C: Citizens' Rights and Constitutional Affairs, Women's Rights & Gender Equality, authors: Niall Crowley, Angela Genova and Silvia Sansonetti, September 2013. http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/etudes/join/2013/493019/IPOL-FEMM_ET(2013)493019_EN.pdf 9 \"Fact sheet on Important Concepts underlying Gender Mainstreaming\u201d, OSAGI 2001. http://www.un.org/womenwatch/osagi/pdf/factsheet2.pdf 10 Idem. 11 \"Empowering women for sustainable development\", Economic Commission for Europe, March 2011. http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/commission/2011/Informal%20document%20No.%202.pdf ",
        "Women's empowerment and its links to sustainable development ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 11 Empowerment should not be seen as a zero-sum game where gains for women automatically imply losses for men. 12 In fact, according to UN World Survey on the Role of Women in Development 2014, there are proven synergies between women's empowerment and economic, social and environmental sustainability. 13 Women's active participation in decision-making facilitates the allocation of public resources to investments in human development priorities, including education, health, nutrition, employment and social protection. For example, as female education levels rise, infant and child mortality rates fall and family health improves. Education also increases women's participation in the labour force and their contributions to household and national income. Women's increased earning capacity, in turn, has a positive effect on children's nutrition, health and educational prospects. 14 Box 1: The economic empowerment of women Facts and figures \u2013 economic empowerment Benefits of economic empowerment: \u2022 When more women work, economies grow: If women\u2019s paid employment rates were raised to the same level as men\u2019s, the USA gross domestic product would be approximately 9 % higher, the Euro zone\u2019s would climb by 13 %, and Japan\u2019s would be boosted by 16 %. In 15 major developing economies, per capita income would rise by 14 % by 2020, and by 20 % by 2030. \u2022 Evidence from a range of countries shows that increasing the share of household income controlled by women, either through their own earnings or cash transfers, changes spending in ways that benefit children. Women in the world of work: \u2022 In the majority of countries, women\u2019s wages represent between 70 % and 90 % of men\u2019s, with even lower ratios in some Asian and Latin American countries. \u2022 If women had the same access as men to productive assets, agricultural output in 34 developing countries would rise by an estimated average of up to 4 %. This could reduce the number of undernourished people in those countries by 17 %, translating to up to 150 million fewer hungry people.

        "Policy Department C: Citizens' Rights and Constitutional Affairs ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 12 1.3. Global review of progress on women's empowerment 15 In December 2014, the UN Secretary-General issued a report entitled \"Review and appraisal of the implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and the outcomes of the 23rd special session of the General Assembly\" 16 which bundles national and regional reviews and discusses progress, challenges and opportunities at the global level. The main findings of the report are the following: Over the past two decades, governments have increasingly removed discriminating laws and have adopted laws promoting gender equality and addressing violence against women. Significant gains are also noted in the enrolment of girls in primary and secondary education. In several regions, women\u2019s participation in the labour market has increased, while some regions have made progress in increasing access to birth control. Harmful practices such as female genital mutilation and child, early and forced marriages have started to decline in some contexts. Furthermore, some countries have made major gains in women\u2019s representation in national parliaments. Nevertheless, global progress has been slow , uneven and limited. Despite expanded normative commitments, equality is often undermined by a lack of implementation , institutional barriers and discriminatory social norms. In addition, increased access to education, for instance, has not been matched by policies to increase women\u2019s access to decent work, good employment conditions, promotion and equal pay. Progress is also hampered by the low levels of participation and leadership of women in decision-making , at all levels \u2013 household, local, regional and national governments, the management of environmental resources 17 , national planning and development structures, national parliaments and global governance. There continues to be a chronic underinvestment in gender equality globally, a tendency which has been aggravated by the austerity measures adopted in many countries in the post-crisis context. In addition, aid focused on gender equality is typically concentrated in social sectors such as education and health, while only low levels of aid have been targeted to economic and governance sectors. Women\u2019s organisations at all levels remain significantly under-resourced. Gender mainstreaming remains limited, and key institutions and mechanisms for promoting gender equality are often under-resourced and lack political support. In addition, monitoring progress is challenged by a severe lack of comparable data of high quality. Many countries are still not producing regular statistics that are of critical importance for gender equality such as time use, asset ownership, women\u2019s participation in decision- making at all levels, or data on gender-based violence and poverty. 15 This section has been reproduced from the study \"Evaluation of the Beijing Platform for Action +20 and the opportunities for achieving gender equality and the empowerment of women in the post-2015 development agenda\", European Parliament, Directorate General for Internal Policies, Policy Department C: Citizens' Rights and Constitutional Affairs, Women's Rights & Gender Equality, author: Petra Debusscher, March 2015. http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2015/519191/IPOL_STU(2015)519191_EN.pdf 16 UN Economic and Social Council, Report of the Secretary General, E/CN.6/2015/3, 15 December 2014. http://www.unwomen.org/~/media/headquarters/attachments/sections/csw/59/ecn620153.pdf 17 See in more detail the in-depth analysis \"The Gender Dimension of Climate Justice\", European Parliament, Directorate General for Internal Policies, Policy Department C: Citizens' Rights and Constitutional Affairs, Women's Rights & Gender Equality, author: Anne Bonewit, 2015. http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/IDAN/2015/536478/IPOL_IDA(2015)536478_EN.pdf ",

SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT KEY FINDINGS \uf0b7 Sustainable development has been defined as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs . \uf0b7 The three core elements of sustainable development are economic growth, social inclusion and environmental protection . \uf0b7 The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development entails 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 targets which came into force on the 1st of January 2016 and apply to all countries . \uf0b7 SDG 5 \"Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls\" contains five targets. 2.1. The concept of sustainable development Sustainable development has been defined by World Commission on Environment and Development as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs . It contains two key concepts: \uf0b7 the concept of \"needs\", in particular the essential needs of the world's poor, to which overriding priority should be given; and \uf0b7 the idea of limitations imposed by the state of technology and social organization on the environment's ability to meet present and future needs. 18 There are three core elements that need to be harmonised in order to achieve sustainable development : economic growth, social inclusion and environmental protection . Sustainable development aims at eradicating poverty through, in particular, creating greater opportunities for all, reducing inequalities, raising basic standards of living and fostering equitable social development and inclusion. 19 Figure 1: Sustainable development Source: http://www.thesustainableleader.org/ 18 \u201cOur Common Future\u201d, Report of the UN World Commission on Environment and Development, March 1987. http://www.un-documents.net/our-common-future.pdf 19 https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org.

Sustainable Development Goals The UN General Assembly adopted in New York on 25 September 2015 the resolution on the post-2015 development agenda entitled \"Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development\". 20 The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (\"the 2030 Agenda\") entails 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 targets which came into force on the 1st of January 2016. The specific targets of each SDG are to be achieved by 2030. The 2030 Agenda goes hand in hand with the so-called Addis Ababa Action Agenda, an agreement reached by the 193 UN Member States attending the UN Third International Conference on Financing for Development in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia on 27 July 2015 (for more details on Addis Ababa Action Plan, see below point 3.3). The SDGs are built on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). However, contrarily to the MDGs that were intended for action in developing countries only, the SDGs apply to all countries . They cover the three above mentioned dimensions of sustainable development: economic growth, social inclusion and environmental protection. UN has also put forward the idea of six essential elements that help frame and reinforce the universal integrated and transformative nature of the Sustainable Development Agenda (Figure 2). 21 Figure 2: Six essential elements for delivering the SDGs Source : \u201cThe Road to Dignity by 2030 \u2013 Synthesis report of the Secretary General on the post-2015 Agenda\u201d, UN, 4 December 2014. http://www.un.org/disabilities/documents/reports/SG_Synthesis_Report_Road_to_Dignity_by_2030.pdf 20 Resolution 70/1 adopted by the General Assembly on 25 September 2015 \"Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development\". http://cil.nus.edu.sg/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Ses2-1.-A.RES_.70.1-Transforming-our-world-the-2030- Agenda-for-Sustainable-Development-Goal-14.c-14.4.pdf 21 \u201cThe Road to Dignity by 2030 \u2013 Synthesis report of the Secretary General on the post-2015 Agenda\u201d, UN, 4 December 2014. http://www.un.org/disabilities/documents/reports/SG_Synthesis_Report_Road_to_Dignity_by_2030.pdf ",

There is a strong focus on implementation through mobilising financial resources, capacity-building and technology. Resources need to be mobilized from domestic and international sources, as well as from the public and private sectors. The UN Member States have recognised the importance to align private investment with sustainable development, along with public policies and regulatory frameworks to set the right incentives. All stakeholders, including governments, civil society and the private sector, are expected to contribute to the implementation of the SDGs. 22 At the global level, the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) has the central role in overseeing the follow-up and review processes, as regards 22 https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org ",

To this end, it works together with the General Assembly (GA), the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) and other relevant organs and forums. The HLPF will meet every four years at the level of Heads of State and Government under the auspices of the GA and once a year under the auspices of ECOSOC. 23 The countries themselves are responsible for follow-up and review at national, regional and global level. This is will be done by collecting quality, accessible and timely data on the implementation. An efficient follow-up and review mechanism for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda will require a solid framework of indicators and statistical data . 24 On 6 March 2015, at its 46th session, the UN Statistical Commission created an Inter-agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs), composed of Member States and including regional and international agencies as observers.

EMPOWERING WOMEN AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT KEY FINDINGS \uf0b7 Women have a critical role to play in all SDGs , with many targets specifically recognizing women\u2019s equality and empowerment as both the objective and part of the solution. \uf0b7 The choice of appropriate indicators to monitor the implementation of the SDGs it has an important impact on determining whether policy efforts towards women's empowerment are channelled adequately. \uf0b7 The Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development , endorsed on 27 July 2015 by 193 UN Member States, provides a foundation for implementing the 2030 Agenda. It states that women\u2019s empowerment is vital for sustainable development as well as for sustained, inclusive and equitable economic growth. \uf0b7 The Addis Ababa Action Plan on Transformative Financing for Gender Equality and Women\u2019s Empowerment was launched in July 2015 in the context of Addis Ababa Conference. It calls for accelerating the implementation of existing commitments in the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. \uf0b7 The EU has an active role in promoting women's empowerment and sustainable development, in particular through Official Development Assistance (ODA). \uf0b7 In October 2015, the Council adopted the Gender Action Plan 2016\u20132020 which establishes a new gender framework to be implemented jointly by the Commission and the European External Action Service (EEAS). 3.1. Empowering women in the context of the 2030 Agenda \" The 17 Sustainable Development Goals and 169 targets which we are announcing today demonstrate the scale and ambition of this new universal Agenda. They seek to build on the Millennium Development Goals and complete what they did not achieve. They seek to realise the human rights of all and to achieve gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls . They are integrated and indivisible and balance the three dimensions of sustainable development: the economic, the social and environmental.\" 27 Gender equality and women's empowerment figure prominently in the 2030 Agenda. They are reflected in an integrated manner throughout the Agenda, and also considered critical for its achievement: in the Resolution on the Agenda, the General Assembly declares that \" realizing gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls will make a crucial contribution to progress across all the goals and targets \". The role of women's empowerment in the 2030 Agenda can be further concretised by looking at the SDG 5 \"Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls\" and its 27 Resolution 70/1 adopted by the General Assembly on 25 September 2015 \"Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development\" (preamble, paragraph 4). http://cil.nus.edu.sg/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Ses2-1.-A.RES_.70.1-Transforming-our-world-the-2030- Agenda-for-Sustainable-Development-Goal-14.c-14.4.pdf ",

As a significant step beyond the MDGs that emphasized only equality of opportunity , the 2030 Agenda acknowledges that equality must be based on both opportunity and outcome . This is written out in target 10.3 of SDG 5: \u201cEnsure equal opportunity and reduce inequalities of outcome, including by eliminating discriminatory laws, policies and practices and promoting appropriate legislation, policies and action in this regard\u201d. Not only the targets of SDG 5 but also many targets of other SDGs are linked to women's empowerment : there are targets on gender dimensions of poverty, health, education, employment and security, for example. In fact, gender equality and the empowerment of women are essential across all SDGs and their targets. Therefore, it is crucial to take a holistic view of gender equality throughout the entire framework. As a result of a wide-ranging consultation process with the UN, Member States, civil society and international organizations, UN Women have put forward a position paper setting out suggestions for global indicators to effectively monitor how the SDGs are being implemented for women and girls. In their paper, UN Women call for including additional gender indicators for the relevant targets, as well as a systematic disaggregation by sex of all relevant indicators across all SDGs and targets . 28 3.2. Empowering women in the context of Addis Ababa Action Agenda The Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development, endorsed on 27 July 2015 by 193 UN Member States, 29 provides a foundation for implementing the 2030 Agenda. Women's empowerment is very visible also in this agreement: in their resolution, the Heads of State and Government and High Representatives reaffirm that \"gender equality , women\u2019s empowerment, the full realisation of their human rights and their full and equal participation and leadership in the economy are vital to achieve sustained, inclusive and equitable economic growth and sustainable development \". In order to achieve women\u2019s empowerment for sustainable development, the Heads of State and Government and High Representatives propose, in particular the following actions and means: \uf0b7 targeted actions and investments in the formulation and implementation of all financial, economic, environmental and social policies; \uf0b7 adoption and strengthening of sound policies and enforceable legislation and transformative actions for the promotion of gender equality and women\u2019s and girls\u2019 empowerment at all levels; \uf0b7 promotion and enforcement of non-discriminatory laws, social infrastructure and policies for sustainable development, as well as women\u2019s full and equal participation in the economy and their equal access to decision-making processes and leadership; 28 \"Monitoring Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women and Girls in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development: Opportunities and Challenges\", Position Paper, UN Women, 2015. http://www.unwomen.org/en/digital-library/publications/2015/9/indicators-position-paper 29 Resolution 69/313 adopted by the General Assembly on 27 July 2015 \"Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development (Addis Ababa Action Agenda)\". http://www.un.org/esa/ffd/ffd3/ ",

Addis Ababa Action Plan on Transformative Financing for Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment In July 2015, in the context of the Addis Ababa Conference, UN Women launched an Addis Ababa Action Plan on Transformative Financing 30 for Gender Equality and Women\u2019s Empowerment together with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Women\u2019s Working Group on Financing for Development and the governments of Brazil, Sweden, Switzerland and United Kingdom. The Action Plan calls for accelerating the implementation of existing commitments in the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. It also aims to ensure that the gender commitments that were included in the agreed text on Addis Ababa Action Agenda will be turned into actions. The Action Plan proposes policy and financing actions for five different areas of commitments: 31 Areas of commitment Policy and financing actions 1. Domestic policy actions and public resources for gender equality and women\u2019s rights \uf0b7 Ensure fair and progressive tax systems by addressing explicit and implicit gender biases in tax policies. \uf0b7 Provide tax incentives to support ownership of assets/property by women. \uf0b7 Cost and adequately resource national policies, strategies and plans on gender equality across all sectors of public expenditure, and ensure they are integrated or closely linked to national sustainable development financing strategies. \uf0b7 Prioritize investments in accessible, affordable, and quality social infrastructure and essential services that reduce and redistribute women\u2019s unpaid care and domestic work and that enable their full participation in the economy. 2.

Enabling environment for women\u2019s economic empowerment and sustainable development \uf0b7 Promote and enact legislative and administrative reforms to ensure women\u2019s equal rights to economic and productive resources, including to inheritance and access to, control over and/or ownership of land and other property, credit and other financial services, information and communication technologies and other forms of technology and capacity building to utilize and maximize the potential of these services/assets. \uf0b7 Develop strategies to support women entrepreneurs and women-owned businesses, including by improving women\u2019s equal access to finance and expanding trade opportunities for women producers. \uf0b7 Enforce core labour standards and antidiscrimination laws for decent work, including ensuring minimum wage legislation and equal pay for work of equal value. \uf0b7 Ensure women\u2019s equal rights, access and opportunities for leadership and decision-making in all sectors. 4. Multi-stakeholder partnerships for gender equality and women\u2019s rights at country, regional and international levels \uf0b7 Use all available opportunities and processes to build political commitment \u2013 from governments, international organisations, civil society organisations, academia, and the private sector \u2013 in support of transformative financing for gender equality and women\u2019s rights. \uf0b7 Adequately resource local, national, regional and global women\u2019s rights institutions and organisations to advance gender equality, women\u2019s empowerment, and the human rights of women and girls. \uf0b7 Track and publish allocations to and public spending on gender equality. 5. Data, monitoring and follow-up \uf0b7 Close data gaps by investing in national statistical capacity to systematically collect, analyse, and use data disaggregated by sex and age through appropriate financial and technical support and capacity-building. \uf0b7 Develop and enhance national standards and methodologies to close data gaps. 3.4. The EU as an actor in empowering women in the context of sustainable development The Lisbon Reform Treaty considers gender equality among its key values and objectives: according to Article 2(3) of the Treaty, the EU \"shall combat social exclusion and discrimination, and shall promote social justice and protection, equality between women and men , solidarity between generations and protection of the rights of the child\". 32 The EU has also committed to mainstreaming gender considerations into all aspects of its operations and policies, including its external and development policy. 32 Treaty of Lisbon amending the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community, signed at Lisbon, 13 December 2007, Article 2. http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=OJ%3AC%3A2007%3A306%3ATOC ",

Gender equality is fully integrated in development cooperation programmes as a core pillar and a prerequisite for socio-economic development and poverty eradication. 33 For the year 2013, around 39 % of the EU ODA (EUR 13 700 million) was allocated to gender sensitive objectives. The European Commission has five instruments for the financing of development cooperation: \uf0b7 the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) for candidate countries, \uf0b7 the European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI), \uf0b7 the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR), \uf0b7 the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) for geographic and thematic \uf0b7 programmes worldwide, and \uf0b7 the European Development Fund (EDF) for African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) \uf0b7 countries (Cotonou Agreement). The mid-term review of the programming period (2014\u20132020) will take place in 2017. This will give a possibility for a new analysis from a gender equality perspective of the allocation of the resources and the efficiency of the programmes. 34 3.4.2 The Gender Action Plan 2016\u20132020 On 26 October 2015, the Council adopted the \"Gender Action Plan 2016\u20132020\", based on the Commission and the European External Action Service (EEAS) Joint Staff Working Document on \"Gender Equality and Women\u2019s Empowerment: Transforming the lives of Girls and Women through EU External Relations 2016-2020\" . 35 The new Gender Action Plan stresses \"the need for the full realisation of women\u2019s and girls\u2019 full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and the achievement of gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls\". 36 The Gender Action Plan 2016\u20132020 is a continuation to the previous \"EU Action Plan for Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment in Development 2010\u20132015\". It establishes a new gender framework to support partner countries, in particular developing, enlargement and neighbouring countries, to achieve tangible results towards gender equality. The indicators proposed in the framework will be reviewed in 2016 to fully align with the finalised set of SDG indicators. The new gender framework focuses on four areas: \uf0b7 ensuring girls' and women's physical and psychological integrity, \uf0b7 promoting the social and economic rights / empowerment of girls and women, \uf0b7 strengthening girls' and women's voice and participation, \uf0b7 shifting the institutional culture to more effectively deliver on EU commitments. 33 \u201cFact Sheet \u2013 Sustainable Development Goals and the Agenda 2030\u201d, European Commission, Brussels, 25 September 2015. http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-15-5709_en.htm 34 \"Policy Hub \u2013 Transformative financing and goals for gender equality and women's and girls' empowerment \u2013 Addis Ababa and New York 2015\u201d, European Parliament, Directorate General for Internal Policies, Policy Department C: Citizens' Rights and Constitutional Affairs, Women's Rights & Gender Equality, July 2015. http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/IDAN/2015/519237/IPOL_IDA(2015)519237_EN.pdf 35 21.9.2015, SWD(2015) 182 final. https://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/joint-staff-working-document-gender-equality-and-womens-empowerment- transforming-lives-girls-and_en 36 Council Conclusions on the Gender Action Plan 2016-2020, 26 October 2015. http://www.consilium.europa.eu/press-releases-pdf/2015/10/40802204150_en_635814753600000000.pdf ",
