        "Targeted Surveys on application of core labour standards, Vietnam 5 Targeted Surveys on application of core labour standards, Vietnam This report has been developed to provide a picture of the application of core labour standards in Vietnam. The report is based on a combination of desk research and stakeholder interviews. The assessments of the issues covered in the report are based on the views of credible international organisations, national governments, employer organisations, trade unions, experts and other stakeholders. Key context Vietnam is a one-party state under the leadership of the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV). The CPV formally retains control over the only permitted national trade union federation, the Vietnam General Confederation of Labour (VGCL), to which all unions must affiliate. This unitary trade union system severely restricts freedom of association. However, the potential adoption of an amended Labour Code, under consideration by the National Assembly in 2019, would significantly reform Vietnam\u2019s legal and institutional framework concerning industrial relations, including provision for independent Workers\u2019 Representative Organisations (WROs) and stronger guarantees of trade union autonomy. Vietnam\u2019s external trade relations have been and remain an important factor in the labour reform process, with key reforms developing in the context of multilateral trade negotiations with Pacific countries (CP-TPP) and the EU (EVFTA). Both agreements were signed (EVFTA) or ratified (CP-TPP) in 2018-19 and commit parties to promote and uphold core labour standards. The EVFTA also commits parties to make efforts towards ratifying ILO conventions. In this context, Vietnam ratified C98 in July 2019 and pledges to ratify C105 by 2020 and C87 by 2023. A series of government, ILO, and other donor initiatives (including in relation to the CP-TPP and EVFTA) are underway to support the development and implementation of Vietnam\u2019s wider industrial relations reform agenda. Although the state remains a prominent economic actor \u2013 state-owned enterprises accounted for almost 30% of GDP in 2016 \u2013 reforms since the 1980s have partially opened the country to private interests and foreign investment. Transition towards a Progress \u2022 Ratification of C98 and pledge to ratify C105, C87. Improved reporting to ILO CEACR. \u2022 New draft labour code would improve legal framework (especially freedom of association) \u2022 Ratification / signing of CPTPP & EVFTA \u2013 commitment to core labour standards development of implementation programmes \u2022 Some increase in coverage / quality of CBAs \u2022 Recent improvements and ongoing policy efforts to address forced labour, child labour, discrimination (although issues remain).

        "Targeted Surveys on application of core labour standards, Vietnam 6 more market-oriented economy, together with relative political stability and a young population, have contributed to rapid economic growth in recent decades and supported significant improvements in social indicators (poverty reduction, provision of basic public services, school enrolment rates). Vietnam\u2019s successful efforts to encourage FDI have resulted in multinational enterprises establishing manufacturing operations across the country. However, although FDI enterprises are important contributors to growth (18.6% of GDP in 2016), they have also become the focus of allegations of labour rights abuses. Almost three-quarters of the labour force are employed in the informal sector, where enforcement of labour laws is challenging. Many reports of labour rights concerns \u2013 including freedom of association, child and forced labour, and discrimination \u2013 relate to workers in the informal economy. Despite progress, Vietnam\u2019s labour market profile also indicates gender-based horizontal and vertical segregation in employment (women clustered in low-paid sectors and more junior positions) and a persistent gender pay gap. In general, in-force national legislation does not fully align with international standards pertaining to core labour standards, with limitations/omissions concerning forced labour, freedom of association, and collective bargaining. Freedom of association is a particular concern, effectively precluded by Vietnam\u2019s unitary trade union system. The new draft labour code and other reforms may partially address some issues. There are wider concerns about the enforcement of labour rights, especially in the informal economy. Limited resources, gaps in official awareness/expertise, broad mandates for labour authorities, and inconsistent interagency coordination are among key constraints. Freedom of association and collective bargaining Vietnam ratified C98 in July 2019 and the government has pledged to ratify C87 by 2023. However, the current legal framework continues to preclude freedom of association as defined by relevant ILO Conventions. The law establishes the VGCL as the sole national trade union federation, to which all unions are required to affiliate, and formally places the VGCL under the CPV\u2019s leadership. The law also fails to distinguish between workers and management, allowing managers to serve as union officials and reportedly interfere in union affairs for the employers\u2019 benefit. In contrast, the new draft labour code would permit the formation of independent WROs unaffiliated with the VGCL and strengthen protections against undue interference in WRO/trade union affairs. However, there remains a lack of clarity concerning some secondary legislation. In practice, there are reports of anti-union discrimination by employers, especially against independent workers\u2019 representatives, and concerns remain about restrictions on public assembly and association more broadly. Strikes are prohibited in essential services and at sector level. The draft labour code does not substantially alter these restrictions. The law permits collective bargaining for non-state employees at the enterprise and multi-employer/sectoral levels, but it is silent on the right to collective bargaining in the public sector. In practice, only a small proportion of eligible workers are covered by collective agreements (CBA), many of which simply replicate legal minimum conditions. However, there has been some notable improvement in both the coverage (number of workers) and scope (issues covered) of CBAs in recent years, and the draft labour code is conducive to wider collective bargaining. Nevertheless, limited consultations between employers and unions, a lack of participation of grassroots members, and the absence of sectoral employers\u2019 associations are among wider constraints on collective bargaining.

        "Targeted Surveys on application of core labour standards, Vietnam 7 Forced labour Vietnam has not ratified C105 but has committed to do so in 2020. Overall, extant legislation provides adequate protection against forced labour, albeit with some exceptions. For example, there is no express prohibition on bonded labour (addressed by the draft labour code), while anti-trafficking provisions do not clearly prohibit all forms of human trafficking. Despite government denials, allegations persist about the forced labour of detainees in state-run drug rehabilitation centres. Enforcement of forced labour laws is inconsistent. Limited resources, poor interagency coordination, and insufficient understanding among officials about pertinent indicators, procedures, and legislation constrain enforcement and policy implementation. High pre- departure fees and deposit requirements increase migrant workers\u2019 vulnerability to debt bondage and exploitation in third countries. However, areas of progress include stronger anti-trafficking criminal provisions; expanded international cooperation activities (anti- trafficking, migration); and ongoing initiatives to regulate recruitment agencies and fees, build capacity and raise public awareness, and coordinate monitoring and enforcement. Child labour Child labour laws are adequate and in line with international standards. However, child labour exists across the country, primarily in the informal economy (agriculture, street hawking, hospitality, home-based enterprises), reflecting key enforcement challenges. In the formal sector, adolescents may use false identity papers to gain employment on the same terms as adults, exposing young workers to hazardous working conditions. To address child labour concerns, the government has established new criminal offences related to child labour, adopted integrated national policies and programmes (including cooperation with international partners/donors), stepped up data collection efforts, and conducted awareness-raising projects for officials and communities. However, resource constraints impede policy implementation and enforcement efforts. A lack of awareness among families and employers about the risks associated with child labour, as well as broader structural factors such as poverty and internal migration, are further constraints. Discrimination In general, Vietnam has developed a strong legal framework concerning employment discrimination. However, there remain some gaps in coverage that are only partially addressed in the new draft labour code. For example, new draft provisions eliminate prohibited occupations/roles for women, add \u2018nationality\u2019 to the expressly prohibited grounds of discrimination, and clearly define workplace sexual harassment. However, they continue to omit express prohibition against discrimination based on \u2018political opinion\u2019 and lack clarity on sanctions in relation to sexual harassment. In practice, non- discrimination laws are inconsistently enforced. There are reports of discrimination affecting recruitment, promotion, and pay, especially for women. The use of gendered language in job advertisements, the practice of asking female job candidates about family status and plans, and employers\u2019 negative bias against women in their 30s due to assumed family responsibilities, are among reported discriminatory practices. Sociocultural gender norms and work-related stereotypes, as well as limited awareness and understanding of non-discrimination law (and the underlying concepts) are further constraints on efforts to address discrimination in employment.

        "Targeted Surveys on application of core labour standards, Vietnam 8 Other working conditions Beyond core labour standards, several factors affect wider working conditions in Vietnam. High levels of informality leave many workers with irregular and inadequate incomes, exposure to unsafe working conditions, limited opportunity for skills development, and without social or employment security. Precarious employment is also a concern in the formal and semi-formal sector due to the increasing prevalence of on-site contracting, temporary agency work, and short-term casual work. The new draft labour code may improve protections for workers in some forms of non-standard employment by relaxing the legal criteria for establishing an employment relationship. Occupational safety and health . Relevant laws are generally adequate, but issues remain concerning application/enforcement. There is limited awareness and capacity to apply OSH standards among employers, especially in SMEs, and enforcement is uneven. Few informal workers are covered by occupational injury insurance. Working time . Excessive overtime is a repeated concern across industrial sectors, especially export-oriented enterprises such as garments and electronics. Nevertheless, the new draft labour code proposes an extension to annual overtime limits. Employment protection . Employers often omit full terms and conditions in copies of contracts provided to employees. Some employers may incentivise resignations of employees they wish to dismiss, thereby avoiding severance pay if workers accept. Social security . There is limited coverage in the informal economy and in the \u2018missing middle\u2019 \u2013 those who fall between (contributory) social security and (non-contributory) social assistance. Employers\u2019 evasion of social security contributions is a concern. Status of ratification and reporting Vietnam has ratified six ILO fundamental Conventions, excluding C87 and C105. The government has committed to ratify C105 by 2020 and C87 by 2023. The ILO Committee of Experts has recently cited Vietnam\u2019s \u2018serious failure\u2019 to respect its reporting obligations (ILO CEACR, 2017), although most outstanding state-party reports have been received as of 2019.
