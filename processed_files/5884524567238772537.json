        "C. whereas the Members of the European Council, in their statement of 29 June 2012, urged the Member States to step up efforts to increase youth employment with \u2018the objective that within a few months of leaving school, young people receive a good quality offer of employment, continued education, apprenticeship or a traineeship\u2019; D. whereas a Youth Guarantee would contribute to the attainment of three of the Europe 2020 strategy objectives, namely that 75 % of the of the population aged 20-64 should be employed, that early school-leaving rates should be below 10 %, and that at least 20 million people should be lifted out of poverty and social exclusion; E. whereas the crisis has led to a rise in precarious forms of employment for young people, with short-term and part-time contracts and unremunerated work placement schemes all too often replacing existing jobs; F. whereas the cost to the EU of inaction on the problem of young people with no employment, education or training (NEETs) is estimated to be about EUR 153 billion, corresponding to 1,2 % of the EU\u2019s GDP, and whereas there are currently 7,5 million NEETs under 25 in the EU; G. whereas the Commission demands, in its Youth Employment Package, a Youth Guarantee; 1. Strongly supports the initiative by the Commission to propose a Council Recommendation on Youth Guarantee schemes; 2. Calls on the Member States\u2019 ministers for employment and social affairs to agree on a Council recommendation during the EPSCO Council in February 2013 aimed at implementing Youth Guarantee schemes in all Member States; emphasises that the Youth Guarantee is not a job guarantee but an instrument ensuring that all young EU citizens and legal residents up to the age of 25 years, and recent graduates under 30, receive a good-quality offer of employment, continued education or apprenticeship within four months of becoming unemployed or leaving formal education; stresses that Youth Guarantee schemes should effectively improve the situation of NEETs; underlines that Youth Guarantee schemes should be eligible for specific forms of European funding, especially in the Member States with the highest youth unemployment rates; 3. Takes the view that Union funding of Youth Guarantee schemes should play a key role, that the European Social Fund (ESF) in particular should be structured to enable the Youth Guarantee to be financed, and that the ESF should therefore be allocated at least 25 % of Structural and Cohesion Funds; believes, however, that an appropriate balance between EU and Member State funding should be striven for; 4. Recognises that young people are not a homogenous group, that they face different social environments and, therefore, that Member States have different levels of readiness for the adoption of a Youth Guarantee; in this context, all young people should first receive a personalised assessment of their needs, which should be followed up with specifically tailored services; 5. Emphasises that close cooperation between the Commission and the Member States and, at national level, among (sectoral) social partners, local and regional authorities, public and private employment services and local and regional education and training institutes is essential to the effective implementation of Youth Guarantee schemes; 6. Notes that Youth Guarantee schemes should be accompanied by a quality framework in order to ensure that the education, training and jobs offered include appropriate pay, working conditions and health and safety standards; 7. Welcomes the Commission\u2019s suggestion to provide, through an \u2018Employment Committee\u2019, multilateral surveillance of the implementation of the Youth Guarantee schemes, and asks to be associated with this committee; 8. Calls on the Member States to reform, in particular, education and training standards for young people, in order to significantly increase their employment and life opportunities; C 440/68 EN Official Journal of the European Union 30.12.2015 Wednesday 16 January 2013 ",
        "9. Recognises that Member States have different level of readiness for the adoption of Youth Guarantee and calls on the Commission, in particular, to support those Member States which are undergoing financial constraints; urges the Commission, within the framework of the European Semester, to closely monitor and report on the implementation of Youth Guarantees and, where needed, to name those Member States who fail to establish Youth Guarantees; 10. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Commission and the Council.
