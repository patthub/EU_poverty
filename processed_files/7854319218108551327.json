        "5 Introduction The work on smart grids and wearable sensors was produced inside of the Action that was looking at the ethics of new and emerging technologies (SETICS). The major part of this work was the EPINET project, an FP7 project (2012-2015), where JRC participated as one of the partners. Its main objectives were to provide assessment of new and emerging technologies, guidelines for good governance in the context of EU policies and recommendations for the improved integration of technology assessment methodologies, and consequently to support a socially stronger and sustainable development of technology. In order to do this, the project looked at several cases of on- going technological development in Europe namely Smart Grids, Wearable Sensors, Robotics and In Vitro Meat. I joint the team in November 2012, several months after the initiation of the project and it represented the main part of my postdoc here at JRC. The specific focus of JRC as a partner in the project was on the quality of knowledge produced around these technologies and used by policy makers and other stakeholders. We were looking at narratives coming from the policy sphere, industry and other actors in order to assess the quality of claims produced. Besides using knowledge assessment methodology for analyzing policy papers and similar documents, we are conducting interviews with stakeholders in the field, that help us deepening issues from knowledge assessment, such as motivations and reasoning behind adopting particular views or evidence about this issue. We were looking at rhetoric around new technologies and worldviews enacted through such rhetoric. Another study on wearable sensors and quantified self community that emerged from EPINET became later a part of another institutional (TRUDI) project that will be published as an article in the special issue of Science and Engineering Ethics, edited by our JRC colleagues. ",
        "6 Also emerged from EPINET but oriented more towards public engagement was a wearable sensors\u2019 part of a project on ethics dialogues and new technologies that was published in 2014 as the Scientific and Policy Report \u201cEthics Dialogues. Experiencing Ethics through \u201cThings\u201d: Open IoT, Civil Drones and Wearable Sensors\u201d (JRC93162). This report has two parts. In Part I, I present the results, conclusions and recommendations from the study on smart grids. In Part II, I present the results, conclusions and recommendations from the study on wearable sensors. The conclusions and recommendations are based on seven scientific papers we have produced as well as the EPINET deliverables and final report. In the Annex, three scientific papers that served as a basis of this report are presented. ",
        "7 Part I: Smart Grids 1.1 Definition and Approach We have used the definition of Smart Grids (SG) provided by the European Smart Grids Technology Platform (European Commission, 2006) as \u201can electricity network that can intelligently integrate the actions of all users connected to it [\u2026] in order to efficiently deliver sustainable, economic and secure electricity supplies\u201d. Other definitions suggest that the energy grid will become \u201csmart\u201d when Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) become a part of the grid, that is, the electrical network will be upgraded into an intelligent grid that will lead to a more sustainable and efficient electricity system. Although there are many big promises linked to the smart grids technology, propagated as technological and financial necessity, there is still great uncertainty of how smart grids will function in practice. In addition, smart grids are said to have an impact on users\u2019 daily lives, as well as that their implementation depends on users and not only on the producers. In our research on smart grids, we started with the analysis of the Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of Regions \u201cSmart Grids: from innovation to deployment\u201d (COM (2011) 202 final), published in 2011, in order to explore how different views, visions and opinions on Smart grids get entrenched in policy documents and to assess the quality of knowledge used and produced in the policy making process. Following our review of the Communication and in order to answer our research questions, explore and examine different visions of smart grids, we have used semi-structured in-depth interviews with stakeholders from the field of smart grids. In-depth interviews are a qualitative research method, whose main goal is to provide insight into individual perspectives on a specific issue, idea or situation. Finally, we have looked at citizens\u2019 blogs and ",
        "8 forums in order to understand their views and visions on the deployment of smart grids and to see their connection with the EU policy documents and promises of main stakeholders. 1.2 Results and conclusions Smart grids are presented to citizens of the EU as supporting a more sustainable energy system, a goal that is positioned high on the EU agenda and through the innovation and growth narratives that sustain it. We have explored how knowledge assessment methodologies may help with looking into quality elements of the discourses that sustain the \u201csmart grids\u201d project, namely assumptions, justifications, claims, narrative voices and what one can call the disconnect between the discourses and action of different members of the epistemic network that sustains the smart promises of future electric grids. In our analysis of policy documents (for more details and the in depth analysis, see Annex 1), in particular the Communication, as well as the in-depth interviews we have conducted, we see that the knowledge that is used in policy discourses is mostly knowledge that supports and celebrates the proposal, and it is aligned with industry discourses In the Communication that supports this initiative in the European Union, the discussion of \u201crisks and losses of technological development\u201d or the discussion of alternatives is very limited; instead SG are heralded as the smart, reliable, competitive and innovative breakthrough, as well as, the means to solve our growth, sustainability and energy security challenges. Smart grids are therefore a project that serves outright the public good. Our pedigree analysis of the Communication (policy document) shows that the main sources that support the document are either European Commission or industry publications. By studying further the knowledge production around this theme, we realize that there is a debate going on that ",
        "9 focus on the tangible object that connects citizenry to this enterprise: the smart meter. The smart meter is a constitutive element of the implementation of smart grids. As we have seen earlier there are ethical issues raised with its adoption as the interface between citizens and the energy grids. Yet, this proposal (SG) is strongly reliant on public engagement and citizenship. In fact, on one hand, engagement is the condition sine qua non for the proposal to thrive as argued by many, but on the other hand, we see that the concerns of citizenry are downplayed, that the rhetoric of empowerment with which smart meters are presented to citizens is discussible. Empowerment of citizens is described as happening through the interactions between consumers and producers that will be possible through smart grids. What seems to be missing is the clear vision of how this will happen. The results have shown that on some levels, there is a disconnect between different stakeholders, especially between policy makers and industry on one side, and citizens on the other. Citizens\u2019 views as expressed online show concerns for issues such as their rights, surveillance, health, safety, etc., which, as we have seen in some EU countries, results on public resistance to the dominant visions. Policy makers see the convincement of citizens about the safety, predictability, security, privacy, data protection of smart grids\u2019 operations as one of the major challenges to enact these systems. However, the dialogue with the publics is rather poor or non-existing. In fact our policy maker interviewees think of themselves as citizens\u2019 representatives; but can this claim be really sustained? For example, with knowledge assessment methodologies we see that the quality of knowledge produced by different actors of the epistemic network is ensured in different ways, but we also see what knowledge is enacted and which is not. While the industry relies mostly on academic sources and their own research, policy makers mostly use the industry sector, as source to document their claims. In the Communication, many claims are made without reference or they originate from other European Commissions\u2019 documents, therefore representing the homemade rhetoric. In referring to the publics, little is said about their concerns, expectations; public issues are described through issues ",
        "10 of \u2018privacy\u2019 and \u2018security\u2019 as if public dimensions of such \u2018critical infrastructures\u2019 could be reduced to these aspects. As our study shows, the socio-technical imaginaries that are being privileged come from the industry and are then echoed by policy makers; they are coherent with and fueled by the innovation narrative. The discourse on SG can be well described by these standard imaginaries, not only we want and we need SG because they promise to solve many of the human current challenges, but also we can. But, how are the questions arising from those who are heralded as the key actors to implement these systems crafted in the overall proposal? Our in-depth interviews seem to indicate that there are pragmatic, practical and political questions unanswered, especially by the policy documents, for example who is actually benefiting from the \u2018smart\u2019 on the grids? What regulatory means exist or will be developed to protect citizens from potential corporate wrongdoing when it comes to their rights? What is made of citizens\u2019 hopes and fears? What grids and energies are we supporting with smart grids? Are there alternatives? Finally, as for other collective challenges of our times, the debate on energy governance needs not to be relegated to specific powerful elites and their agendas, but should be a matter of permanent debate and of shared responsible action, as frameworks like Responsible Research and Innovation seem to sustain. 1.3 Recommendations 1. From knowledge assessment of smart grids policy documents we see that there is strong alignment between the policy proposals and the aspirations from industry; we suggest that these alignments are made totally transparent in policy documents and not masked with grand justifications of sustainability, security and the like. ",
        "11 2. Knowledge assessment of policy documents also suggests that more technical studies carried out outside the industry realm and social studies are used to support the claims made. In fact, there is a great deal of stakeholders\u2019 knowledge that is not being considered in the policy discussions or proposals. 3. Knowledge assessment also showed that there is poor involvement of the civil society in these discussions. As the smart grids model precludes an important involvement of citizens, the model should be open to more discussions. ",
        "12 Part II: Wearable Sensors 2.1 Definition and approach Wearable sensors (WS) \u2013 that is wearable devices that allow activity and physiological monitoring - are used in a wide spectrum of health related aspects by citizens. The types of sensors addressed here are mainly used for fitness, sports and self-monitoring, but the growing attention is primarily due to their potential applications in the area of healthcare monitoring. Whilst many individuals use these devices to monitor their personal fitness, there is an expectation of the usage of these devices in medical contexts, especially regarding eldercare or people with chronic medical conditions. The growing usage of WS in everyday life activities is paving the way for a need for further regulation, despite many WS fields of application already being highly regulated and normalized, e.g. health sector. Governments and the European Union (EU) institutions have become involved in several ways. Imaginaries of main stakeholders, especially those of policy makers and industry about the potential and further applications of WS are relevant driving forces that push the development of these technologies. But other active and relevant voices from, e.g. NGOs, academics and citizens are co-shaping the ways in which these tools are developed, deployed, normalized and eventually regulated. The responsibility for providing care is shifting from public institutions to individuals and towards more personalized care, patient choice and individuals being themselves in charge of their care needs, through the use of wearable and sensor technologies to support them, as they provide data related to measuring and monitoring- which is often seen as a reductionist model of healthcare practice. In order to apply knowledge assessment to the study of WS for health and wellness we have tried to identify policy documents issued in the European Union; yet, this technology and its application is really in its infancy with regards to the policy realm. For that reason we analyzed the documents that ",
        "13 have some relation to WS applications in health, such as the EC staff paper on Telemedicine, the green paper on mHealth and the EC Work program 2011 and 2013 on Information and Communication Technologies. As far as the industry sector is concerned, we analyzed white papers from the company Zephyr and blog entries of FitBit. After the analysis of the documents we conducted in-depth interviews with relevant social actors in the field of WS and telemedicine, which gave us more insight in the construction of specific visions and narratives. In order to select relevant social actors for the interviews, we looked at the authorship of relevant policy papers, scientific papers, articles in specialized media (for example, Wired Magazine) and persons that are involved in projects related to e-health. Hence, we conducted nine semi-structured in-depth interviews with three persons from academia, one policy maker, one journalist, one policy adviser, one medical doctor, one IT developer/researcher and one person involved in the Quantified Self movement. 2.2 Results 2.2.1 Documents and interviews A great deal of promises (resulting on expectations) is made through the policy documents (including the research calls sponsored by the EC) and industry papers looked at in this paper (for a detailed analysis, see Annex 2 and 3). For example, in policy papers we have found a great deal of lack of references for rather important claims, self-referencing within and across few nodes of the epistemic networks, reference to poorly conducted studies and other types of practice that make knowledge claims amenable to skepticism. A great deal of the knowledge used in policy papers come from industry and not so much from citizen led projects (e.g. \u201cquantified movement\u201d, etc.); in fact, industry is leading the experience of ",
        "14 WS in health and wellness through their purposeful interactive platforms, collecting not only data but also the qualitative experience of users (e.g. fitbit maintains a blog among users that share their experience through a myriad of threads). By assessing knowledge production loci, one can also see that there are disconnects between what the imagination of the current and future uses of these sensors. There are several spontaneous experiments of self-care, self-veillance both by industry but also by citizen movements, where it is unlikely that professional monitoring of what the impacts of these objects are in received notions of care, health and wellness are being carried out \u2013 with what criteria anyway? As with other technological developments put out there with a narrative, WS are also the object of unanticipated appropriations both by institutions and citizens; \u201cdo it yourself\u201d, makers, hackers movements are doing their own thing whilst the healthcare establishment is also looking into the opportunities. The views that we have presented through the in-depth interviews with different social actors show a great number of disconnects, not only with regards to different imaginations of the role and function of these devices with regards to health and healthcare, but also with regards to supporting evidence that these devices can deliver what they are expected to. While some researchers that we interviewed had provided their advice to EC policy makers, they were unsure about to what extent their input had made a difference to the policy making process. As in the policy papers we looked at, many claims have no references or include a reference to a EU institution it is difficult to see where the information came from in the first place. Moreover, besides the disconnect of different epistemic networks, there is a lack of research on the impact of wearable devices and e-health on society. The vision that it is being put forward on the policy level develops in specific spheres but the deeper meanings are not being adequately scrutinized or are scattered around, not really being given a lot of attention in specific loci. ",
        "15 WS and e-health (or m-health) are certainly part of the techno-scientific imaginary that precludes that through technology health and healthcare issues can be fixed. This salvific role of technology is visible through the discourses of patient empowerment, effective and efficient healthcare and improved certainty (i.e. better and more complete health related data which imply better diagnosis and cures). At the same time there are a number of unknowns and concerns, expressed in different ways by different members of the epistemic network, such as unresolved ethical issues, namely with privacy, inequalities, namely with digital divide, or new ideas of care where face-to-face interaction is substituted with digital interfaces. In addition a number of uncertainties about quality of data and data ownership, responsibility, inadequacy of current regulation, besides the actual economic effectiveness of deployment of these types of sensors for health purposes add on challenges. These \u2018simple\u2019 devices are designed and delivered to us as \u2018healthy\u2019, giving us the idea of what needs to be shared and measured, how we should be ageing and also how our wellness, happiness and health are better dealt with through digital smart artefacts. The WS that are the focus of our research are not (yet) medical devices, but in a number of the discourses that we have analyzed they are suggested to become integral part of the medical practice, preventative medicine, personalized medicine, mobile health, cure and care. All current narratives for the EU place science and technology at the heart of its future but also its identity; for some time the EU has been associated with the term innovation. In fact, \u201cinnovation\u201d is presented in a salvific role, used to justify and encourage techno-science development. WS are part of that answer that is still looking for the questions. 2.2.2 Forums We have also analyzed the forums of Quantified Self and Fitbit , one of the devices, where users gather to discuss and share their experiences as well as to ask for an advice. The entries in the ",
        "16 threads analyzed are quite competent and reasoned upon, often based on personal experience; often however, the context in which the experience is told is not described or accounted for; hence, albeit these exchanges may fit the purpose of maintaining a dialogue where other users can intervene, adding, rectifying or other, they might not entirely respond to the issue launched in the thread. The posts are mainly auto-ethnographic and are mostly relevant for other participants of the forum. The types of legitimacy sought by users varies and includes other sources of information, allusion to well-known public figures and work and not necessarily peer-reviewed scientific sources. We would argue that the value of these threads is precisely on the experiential facts brought in the dialogues and also on the issues raised around the thread\u2019s theme, around the particular wearable sensor technology and ultimately about the overall use of wearable health technology. Knowledge assessment also allows us to examine the motivations of citizens to engage with self- tracking, self-care and health self-veillance through wearable sensors. For many citizens, monitoring their own health, through different devices or apps available in the market, such as Fitbit, is a response to actual needs, health related but also because these devices respond to other needs when it comes to health and wellness, that of conviviality. These devices belong to a generation of devices that are packed with lifestyle narratives implying strong normativities and imaginaries in the form of tempting proposals for how one should live one\u2019s life. But, in an interview with the authors, the London coordinator of the Quantified Self movement in London, stated: \u2018The people that I work with are constantly pushing the boundaries of what can be done and how they experiment and they do not care about data per se but about solving their problems. Let us say that you have diabetes or you are interested in running an ultra marathon or you have Parkinson\u2019s Disease and you need to measure certain markers, you want that. You want to make your life better and do not really care about fancy marketing, such as with Fitbit, which is banking on lifestyle marketing and wellbeing and so on. \u2018 ",
        "17 These self-tracking gadgets attract different audiences, including those trying to lose weight, athletes, hypochondriacs and so on. Hence, by sharing their experience citizens may be just focusing on resolving their own problem and not necessarily buying into a lifestyle and consumption narrative sold with the devices they use. Another important narrative with which these devices are proposed to citizens is empowerment; this is also visible through many of the discourses in the threads as we have seen and aligns well with policy discourses in healthcare in the European Union (see for example the mHealth green paper (European Commission, 2014)). In what seems to be a transition to an era of do-it-yourself healthcare, citizens seem to be implicitly and explicitly asked into relying more and more on their own observations and search for information online instead of consulting a doctor, and given the price of healthcare which has been growing considerably, the patient-driven healthcare model is finding its place in policies on healthcare worldwide (Wolbring & Lashewicz, 2014). Wearable sensors, social media, ubiquitous computing, VoIP are seen as a leading technologies in home health monitoring and care (see e.g. Wolbring and Lashewicz, Op. cit.; Afshar, 2014). In fact, there seems to be a co-produced need and agreement for a \u2018do-it-yourself\u2019 strategy to tackle one\u2019s health; but what the analysis of these threads show is that the \u2018community\u2019 forming around the discussion of wearable sensors related issues is as important as the self-monitoring. Whilst self- tracking, i.e. reducing to a small number of parameters our health and fitness is seen as an improvement of quality in care, the ideas of socializing and sharing experience about health issues changes fundamentally the experience of \u2018do-it-yourself\u2019 care and knowledge production around health issues. Furthermore, it is worth noting that users seem to be engaged in an experiment with multiple purposes: whilst they actually and objectively contribute to the fine tuning of the technology, they ",
        "18 also are engaging with the deeper experiment of non-medical devices being used to perform a health function giving the user a sense of agency with regard to their health. The added agency is provided by, on one hand the use of the personal(ised) device and on the other hand by the emphasis placed on sharing and on the idea that self-tracking is a \u2018collective endeavor\u2019 to address common health issues. Wearable sensors serve therefore purposes other than just self-monitoring and DIY health, including social purposes, such as sharing, mutual learning, going deeper in issues and companionship. This is transformative of the prevalent narrative of healthcare, which seeks for efficient, cost-saving, technology driven, virtual connectivity and patient-centered approaches away from the clinical settings. In this way the wearable experience becomes actually the testing out in vivo of health and wellbeing narratives at a broader level. But there are more alignments that emerge from the pedigree analysis that we have conducted; as explained in the introduction, policy makers and other stakeholders argue that there is a need for reducing healthcare costs. According to the efficiency narrative that supports healthcare in the EU, this is possibly achievable through greater engagement of citizens in self-care practices. There seems to be no evidence, however, about how knowledge produced in realms such as citizen online forums actually reach or are heard by policy and business actors. Yet, what needs to be understood is that healthcare is no longer in the hands of institutions that practice, regulate or provide healthcare but also in the hands of citizens who resolve their problems in proactive ways, acting sometimes as guarantees of quality of the healthcare system. In fact, citizen initiatives like the quantified self- movement claim the right to \u2018own\u2019 the sensor generated data. But how these data are fit for purpose in traditional healthcare systems is an open question. Funtowicz (2006) argues that for the policy-relevant scientific problems, there is a need for an \u2018extended peer community\u2019 to be included in the process of decision and policy making through an ",
        "19 open dialogue that would include diverse stakeholders including citizens. Current disconnects on practice, expectations and actual appropriation of these technologies show that the main postulates of post-normal science, quality assurance through deliberation among different partners in the process, still need to be accepted by not only researchers and citizens but also policy makers and the industry. 2.3 Recommendations 1. There is a need for connecting multiple visions and practice of different stakeholders, as our interviews showed the disconnects between policy makers, researchers, user communities and their visions of what WS should or can do; there is a growing DIY movement at all fronts of techno- science that will substitute the call for dialogue as institutions get more hermetic. 2. Other sources of knowledge should be used as well and the process should be more open by engaging and including more stakeholders by allowing the process of extended peer review to take place. Our research has shown that policy papers predominantly reflect research from industry and neglect other sources. 3. There is a need for more responsible and not so na\u00eff big promises of healthcare revolution suggesting that electronic devices and services are key developments for improved care, while there are still high uncertainties of social and ethical nature. 4. A less technologically deterministic approach could be used while discussing and questioning technological fixes through offering alternative insights in the problematic. Consequently the innovation narratives would not over-simplify and offer a reductionist approach to the relationship patient-doctor or even people\u2019s relationships with their own bodies. ",

In this paper we focus on how smart grids (SG) are portrayed in European policies and through social actors' discourses, as well as, what their significance for citizens is claimed to be. Drawn upon the concept of socio-technical imaginaries we explore the discourses of social actors regarding the implementation of SG in the European Union, from policy makers, industry and consumer perspectives. In order to do so, we use knowledge assessment, a qualitative approach that looks into the pedigree of the knowledge input in policy processes and its quality in terms of fitness for purpose and function. Through the analysis of EU policy documents related to SG and interviews conducted with relevant social actors, we looked at the official visions about SG coming from the policy sphere, the main supporters of the SG vision and proposal. We looked into discourses, factual or imaginary argumentation and justifications, promises, motivations, appeals to the public and other narrative elements that scaffold the SG vision in Europe. We conclude that the SG proposal is aligned with current innovation narratives in the EU but presents some disconnects with citizen debates.

        "22 1 Introduct ion We can start with the question: \u201cWhat are smart grids?\u201d and soon discover that the answer to this basic question is not so simple. There are no clear definition of the term \u201csmart grids\u201d (SG) and scholars (eg. Spaeth, 2011) mostly agree that the defini tions given are very general and abstract. For the purposes of this paper, we will use the one provided by the European Smart Grids Technology Platform (European Commission, 2006) that defines SG as \u201can electricity network that can intelligently integrate the actions of all users connected to it [\u2026] in order to efficiently deliver sustainable, economic and secure electricity supplies\u201d. Other definitions suggest that the energy grid will become \u201csmart\u201d when Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), including artificial intelligence become a part of it, i.e., the electrical network will be upgraded into an intelligent grid that will lead to a more sustainable and efficient electricity system (Verbong, Beemsterboer & Sengers, 2012). This seems to be co nnected to a wider trend of characterizing new technologies as \u201csmart\u201d. Strengers (2013) defines it as \u201can ultimate desired state across all aspects of contemporary life [\u2026] employed by its proponents as a means of imagining and realising social and techno logical progress, while simultaneously solving a range of social and environmental problems\u201d (p. 1 ). Although we see that there are many big promises and justifications linked to the SG technology, propagated as technological and financial necessity (Ver bong et al. , 2012), there is still great uncertainty of how SG will function in practice (e.g. De Castro & Dutra, 2013; Guizani & Anan, 2014). In addition, smart grids are said to have an impact on users\u2019 daily lives, as well as that their implementation d epends on users and not only on the producers. ",
        "23 In this paper, we look at visions of SG permeating Europe through EU policy initiatives, as well as in the discourses of stakeholders. When the notion of SG first appeared, it created a buzz and it was followe d by large promises. This innovative technology should provide more sustainable, efficient and secure electricity systems with lower loss of energy. Strengers (2013) refers to SG as \u201csmart utopia\u201d. Large quantities of money have been invested in R&D progra ms around the world to deal with research and practical implementation. Not surprisingly, there is still a great deal of uncertainties, namely about how SG will work when they are implemented; for the moment only limited demonstration projects exist (Mah e t al. , 2013 ). It is believed that SG and other emerging technologies, placed under the broader concept of the Internet of Things 2 , - because of the expected high degree of ubiquitous connectivity among billions of devices - will have considering impacts on people\u2019s lives. While creating a tension between the public and the private, they try to redefine our everyday lives and consequently raise a series of ethical and societal issues that we need to deal with (Guimar\u00e3es Pereira, Benessia and Curvelo, 2013 ). As the success of the new energy system depends on users and not only on the producers, it often happens that \u201cselected\u201d benefits of such systems are emphasised and confidently communicated to the public, while the challenges and risks are often kept away from the larger population\u2019s ears. This is actually described by Jasanoff and Kim, (2013, p. 190) as a known quality of the North American sociotechnical imagination about technology. Such \u201cselected\u201d benefits are seldom articulated as economic benefits for the corporations that will run the sustaining businesses. Instead, as we will see they appear in guises of societal welfare. 2 The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the integration of \u201creal\u201d physical world with the virtual one and can be defined \u201cas a global network infrastructure, linking uniquely identified physical and virtual objects, things and devices through the exploitation of data capture (sensing), communication and actuation capabilities\u201d (Guimar\u00e3es Pereira, Benessia & Curvelo, 2013, p.8) ",
        "24 As we will see further on, while talking about citizens, different authors of SG documents, papers or interviewees use different n otions. Some refer to \u201cconsumers\u201d, \u201cusers\u201d or even \u201cparticipants\u201d in the grid, while others insist on \u201ccitizens\u201d or they use interchangeably the terms \u201ccitizens\u201d and \u201cconsumers\u201d. This difficulty to distinguish between these terms has already been noticed b y Livingstone et al. (2007) in connection to media policies where the notions of \u201ccitizen\u201d, \u201cconsumer\u201d, \u201ccitizen - consumer\u201d and \u201cpublic\u201d were used interchangeably (Livingstone, Lunt and Miller, 2007). Livingstone et al. (2007) argue that the blurring notion s are more than only semantics, but have to do with differences between citizen interest and consumer issues. Similarly, in an essay on the changing role of participation in social policy, Cornwall and Gaventa (2000) noted that there is \u201ca shift from a foc us on clients or consumers of social policies as users and choosers to a more active engagement of citizens as agents in the making and shaping of the social policies that affect their lives\u201d (p.6). Based on these two arguments and the fact that in our stu dy the agency of citizens is important, as well as the citizens\u2019 interests that are broader than consumers\u2019 ones, we chose to use the term \u201ccitizens\u201d . In this paper, we are looking at SG from the perspective of science and technology studies, i.e. social sciences, which is not commonly found in energy research publications, but rather marginalized (Sovacool, 2014). Sovacool (2014) argues that there is space and potential for broadening the field to topics and methods that are more of interest to social sci entists, such as energy poverty, behaviour, social construction of technology systems, interviews, focus groups and so on. This is important as the social context that surrounds energy system cannot be neglected as they mutually influence and depend on eac h other. The paper starts with the analysis of a EU policy document on SG, the Communication on Smart Grids. A Communication is an important policy document of the European Commission, because it serves as basis for the regulation that is later adopted in the European Parliament. After ",
        "25 its adoption, it affects the entire European Union and consequently the rest of the world. At the EU level, the conversations about SG started slightly before 2005 when the European Commission Directorate General for Researc h created the European Technology Platform for the Electricity Networks of the Future, also called European Technology Platform SmartGrids (www.smartgrids.eu), with more than 100 stakeholders and the support of Framework Programs 5 and 6. The Platform cons ists of industry and academia. If we look at members of three working groups listed on the website, we see that the majority come from industry, especially in the WG3 Demand side, metering and retail, where out of 43, 39 are from industry, 1 from the Europ ean Commission and 3 from academia. 1.2 Social constructionism and sociotechnical imaginaries Contrary to the concept of technological determinism, social constructionism considers technologies as socially constructed (Bijker and Pinch, 1983). Following t he social constructivist theory, one could argue that technologies represent an outcome of the discussion and negotiation between relevant social groups, i.e., stakeholders that have their own interests grouped in alliances. These stakeholders include, in this case, scientists and technologists, but also economists, policy makers, entrepreneurs, citizens being an important category of stakeholders. Different stakeholders have different interpretations of technology. Interesting for our discussion here is wh at is designated by \u201csociology of expectations\u201d; it explores what is possible for the future and how expectations are structured, how they appear, disappear or resist and influence different stakeholders (Van Lente, 2012; Skjolsvold, 2014). Borup et al. (2 006) argue that the scientific and technological change depends on the expectations and visions that are key for mobilizing resources. Here, the terms \u201cexpectations\u201d and \u201cvisions\u201d are used to a great extent as synonyms with the only difference of the latte r as having a more normative character (Borup et al., 2006). Skj\u00f8lsvold (2014), for instance, is ",
        "26 looking at the implications of the expectations in technology development for shaping policy regulations. Similarly, we are interested in exploring which stake holders\u2019 groups decide about which technologies are meaningful, i.e. useful (for them) in any way, by for example, bringing profit or giving more comfort to their professional and/or private lives, since, through powerful discursive forces, stakeholders co - create values about a specific technology. While the social constructivist theory focuses mainly on knowledge production, we find more useful for our endeavour the concept proposed by Jasanoff (1996) of co - production \u2013 i.e. \u201cthe simultaneous production o f knowledge and social order\u201d, in other words, \u201cthe production of mutually supporting forms of knowledge and forms of life \u201d. As we are interested in the \u201ccomplex relationships among knowledge, its application and power\u201d, the \u2018co - production\u2019 of science, tec hnology embedded in the broader socio - cultural and political context (Kim, 2010) inspires our work on knowledge assessment. Moreover, \u2018co - production\u2019 is at the core of the concept of sociotechnical imaginaries, which will be further discussed. Skj\u00f8lsvold ( 2014 ) also looks at the concept of co - production when discussing how \u201cfuture visions [of energy system in Norway] impact technology development and policy making while technology development shape visions\u201d (p. 35 ) The concept of socio - technical imaginaries was introduced by Jasanoff and Kim (2009); they studied energy policies in the USA and South Korea through the exploration of the imaginaries that guided past energy policies in those countries. This concept explains how visions about possible futures are produced being defined as \u201ccollectively imagined forms of social life and social order reflected in the design and fulfilment of nation - specific scientific and/or technological projects\u201d (Jasanoff & Kim, 2009, p.120). For example, a dominant imaginary rela ted to energy future is based on alternative sources of energy \u201cthat promise to be clean, efficient, and superabundant\u201d (Jasanoff & Kim, 2013, p.189). The study Jasanoff and Kim conducted in 2013, adds the cross - national ",
        "27 comparison among the USA, South Kor ea and Germany, which eases the identification of these imaginaries and explains similarities and differences among them and their further implications. Imaginary is understood as an important cultural resource, as it projects new goals and \u201cforms of lif e\u201d. In order to characterise different stakeholders\u2019 visions, we use here the concept of sociotechnical imaginaries which are mostly visible at moments of co - production and linked to this concept (Jasanoff, 2004), by explaining why \u201csome envisioning of sci entific and social order tend to win support over others - in other words, why some orderings are co - produced at the expense of others.\u201d (The Sociotechnical Imaginaries Project, 2011). As Jasanoff and Kim (2009) suggest, imagining futures is a constitutive element of social and political life as it gives collective visions of what a good society should look like. Also, the political culture and practices can have an important role in stabilising imaginaries and producing systems of meanings, leading to the shared interpretation of social reality and the co - production of social order. Several scholars (e.g. Casper & Clarke, 1998; Star & Griesemer, 1989) showed how ambivalences among actors may still allow the development of new technologies and sometimes even reinforcing and sustaining it. In a study of small modular reactors Sovacool and Ramana (2015) argue that the visions are \u201cfull of contradictions, erasures and tensions\u201d (p.116); yet, different visions together create convergence and cater for different n eeds, thus obtaining support from other social actors. Therefore, we can say that in many cases these processes continue despite controversies and heterogeneous visions of different stakeholders. In Europe the innovation narrative seems to be gearing poli tical action; the Innovation Union 3 has been heralded as the way out for political and social cohesion in the Union. By looking at the discourses of policy - makers, one can tap into the imaginaries that sustain the innovation hype; for example, innovation i s hardly critically presented in the discourse, being used instrumentally to justify 3 See for example, http://ec.europa.eu/research/innovation-union/index_en.cfm . ",
        "28 the \u2018desirability\u2019 of specific paths in development and deployment of technology. The discourses we looked at mostly serve the purpose of justifying new investments in fie lds of science and technology that could benefit from a deep interrogation with regards to their usefulness (social purpose) in relation to grand challenges as well as their ethics \u2013 see for example van den Hove et al. (2011). Civic epistemologies \u2013 i.e. t he grounds and ways in which public knowledge develop (Jasanoff, 2005; Miller, 2005) \u2013 interest what we see as the grounds for potential disconnects between publics\u2019 and policy views and knowledge around SG . Hence, it is important for our remit to investig ate how knowledge in this field is negotiated among all relevant parties if and when policy makers make room for citizen engagement. Ideally, imagining energy futures (including their governance) ought to be a co - construction necessarily involving societal partnerships. Hence, we use the two inter - linked concepts of imaginaries and civic epistemologies for questioning the relationship between policies and cultural practices and question what techno - scientific imaginaries (values and normativities) get insti tutionalised in this sector, in addition to exploring the normative challenges arising from the technological design following Burri\u2019s ( 2009 ) suggestion. 1.3 The citizen in SG Some scholars (e.g. Mah et al. , 2013) believe the State plays a central role in technological and industrial innovation. Mah et al. (2013) start from the monopoly power of the State and argue that its two main roles are \u201cfirstly, to introduce policies that facilitate structural changes by overcoming information, coordination and ex ternality issues; and secondly, to introduce policies that aim at protecting some selected firms and industries\u201d (p.6). Based on this, Mah et al. (2013) further suggest that governments have an important and central role in the early stage of SG developmen t, because they facilitate the sustainability transition process and introduce new technologies to citizens ",
        "29 through visioning, policy formulation and regulating the electricity market. Also, the business sector and consumers play a role in the reinforcemen t of the transition capacity. When it comes to the European Union, the technology optimism is present but lately there are some initiatives for acknowledging the citizen perspective as well. For sometime the Commission has in place a system for online cons ultations, and more recently \u201ccitizen initiatives\u201d whose goal is to have proposal from citizens about what to legislate; in addition the Horizon 2020 framework program of research main lemma is Responsible Research and Innovation whose main pillars include public engagement. However they present many limitations and are not applied to all fields, as we will see further. In the governance of the energy distribution sector, the focus of our paper, one of the biggest governing challenges in relation to the SG is the emergence of new business models and new actors, but above all the new two - way utility - consumer relationship (Mah et al. , 2013). In fact, a distinguishable aspect of this case is the requirement for citizens\u2019 participation in the SG model implementa tion. Therefore many stakeholders speak of empowerment of citizens through new technologies such as SG, by which the proactive role of consumers is implied (Mah et al. 2013). One of the preconditions, as well as the biggest challenge, according to Mengolin i and Vasiljevska (2010) is the transformation of consumer culture. However, \u201clittle is known yet on how to change and shape active participation of users in SG, thus in supporting them in achieving their active role of co - player in the future electricity system\u201d (Mengolini & Vasiljevska, 2013, p.16). In order to increase the acceptance of SG among consumers, Stern (2013) suggested three measures: easing and simplifying the use of the technology; greater visibility of information connected to the benefits of use and; increased observability through pilot projects. According to the Technology Acceptance Model (Davis, 1989), two major factors for the formation of opinion about new technologies among citizens is the perceived ease of use and the perceived usef ulness - ",
        "30 this is also valid for SG, as the study of Stragier, Hauttekeete and De Marez (2010) showed. So, in other words, the idea of empowerment seems to be substituted by a version of the \u2018public deficit model\u2019 often used to describe public\u2019s resistance or refusal to some technological projects (see Wynne, 2007 ). In a study conducted by Hargreaves et al. (2010) on British households and the use of smart energy monitors, one of the main questions that remained unanswered was whether it would be really poss ible to change the citizens\u2019 behaviour about energy consumption. One of the questions they asked was: \u201cIf the wind fails to blow, would households be willing to go to bed in the dark?\u201d (p.6118). What their study revealed is a strong resistance to such idea s. Also, they found that smart energy monitors could promote a feeling of both empowerment and disempowerment, depending on users\u2019 perceptions, as well as the social and political context in which they are placed. In the same vein, Aune (2007) questions th e understanding of \u201clinear\u201d behavioural and technological change. She uses the concept of domestication (Silverston et al. 1991) that evolved from the appropriation of technologies in everyday life. Aune (2007) argues that the image of rational consumer is not suitable and that \u201cadvice about behavioural change and technologies directed towards the \u201chome market\u201d have to meet the requirements of different images and practical constructions of the home and not expect a simple diffusion process of either inform ation or energy - efficient technologies\u201d (p.5464). However, the role of the citizen as a consumer is often neglected by policy makers, as well as their opinions, attitudes, drivers and barriers towards the acceptance of the new energy system (Stragier, Haut tekeete, De Marez, 2010); yet, they are \u201chighly relevant\u201d in the case of SG (Nyborg & Ropke, 2011, 1859). Nyborg and Ropke (2011) question if the transition towards new models of energy system will turn passive consumers into engaged citizens or to be mor e precise, if the new system will require active engagement, extending the traditional consumer role. In fact, we argue, SG ",
        "31 are not about consumers and users, but about the active role of citizens, not only as consumers but also in shaping policies in the area of energy, i.e. the \u201cenergy citizenship\u201d. In a paper on Energy Citizenship, Devine - Wright (2007) argues that in the deficit view of the public as energy \u201cusers\u201d or \u201cconsumers\u201d, we can talk about scepticism in broader deliberation about energy systems, in the sense that decision - making processes should be left to experts or technocrats and not be opened to the public. At the same time, he suggests an alternative way of representing the public: as \u201cenergy citizens\u201d, \u201cwhere the potential for action is fra med by notions of equitable rights and responsibilities across society for dealing with the consequences of energy consumption\u201d (p.71). Although this idea is not new (Schumacher, 1974), it has been revisited in the 2000 when the deficit model started to be questioned. More recently, Goulden et al. (2014) refer to \u201cenergy citizen\u201d, suggesting that the engagement of citizens is key for SG. In a similar tone, Nyborg and Ropke (2011) suggest the inclusion of citizens in creating visions of energy futures throug h participatory exercises. 1.4 Research Questions In this paper we are exploring techno - scientific imaginaries of SG embedded in different stakeholders\u2019 discourses and how they are further incorporated in the European Union policy documents. In order to d o this, we look into knowledge produced around SG, motivations and reasoning stated by different epistemic communities that sustain the introduction of this technology in our daily lives, as well as storylines developed around these issues embedding partic ular views of different stakeholders. By identifying relevant discourses for the case of \u201cSG\u201d, we also aim at identifying key policy and corporate players, technology developers or other businesses, agencies, or other forms of relevant organisation. Our ma in research questions are: 1. What are the stakeholders\u2019 visions and knowledge about SG? What are they based on? ",
        "32 2. How is the quality of knowledge on SG ensured by different actors? 3. What kind of grand narratives are SG associated with? 4. What are the similaritie s and differences between citizens\u2019 and other stakeholders\u2019 visions of SG? 5. Whose imaginaries are dominant and whose are excluded? 2 Approach and methodology Knowledge assessment is a systematic approach to the evaluation of fitness for function of knowledge inputs in decision -\u00ad\u2010 making processes. \u201cKnowledge\u201d here is not limited to \u201cscientific knowledge\u201d, but includes other types of knowledge created in spheres of life and experience other than the techno -\u00ad\u2010 scientific one. As Funtowicz (2006) noted a new conception of knowledge is emerging, based on a new enriched awareness of complexity, in which a plurality of legitimate perspectives is acknowledged and appreciated. In this context, the traditional procedures of quality control in scientific research do not meet the challenges (Funtowicz & Ravetz 1990); the criteria and tasks of quality assurance must explicitly involve additional values and interests brought by the other spheres of knowledge production, as well as, the recognition that policy relevant science resonates with specific worldviews and value commitments that may include ontological commitments of groups other than scientists. This new configuration has been termed \u201cpost -\u00ad\u2010 normal science\u201d (Funtowicz & Ravetz, 1990) being the basis of a new conception of knowledge assessment. In this paper, we use the concept of \u201cpedigree\u201d 4 . The concept of \u201cpedigree\u201d, was initially conceived for quantitative information. Funtowicz & Ravetz (1990) argue that where quality is crucial, a pedigree is essential. Here \u201c pedigree does not show ancestry, but it is an evaluative description of the mode of production (and 4 Which is one of the NUSAP categories; NUSAP is a notational system developed by Funtowiz and Ravetz (1992) that is based on 5 categories: Number, Unit, Spread, Assessment and Pedigree to evaluate the significance of quantitative information. See http://www.nusap.net ",
        "33 where relevant, of anticipated use) of the information. Each special sort of information has its own pedigree; and we have found that research workers can quickly learn to formulate the distinctions around which a special pedigree is constructed. In the process they also gain clarity about the characteristic uncertainties of their own field .\u201d Ten years later, Corral Quintana (2000) has extended this concept to qualitative information proposing several categories to assess the quality of qualitative assertions used to formulate policies or to support decision -\u00ad\u2010 making. This extension has been applied to contexts of foresight, technology development and environmental policy making (Guimar\u00e3es Pereira & Lonza Ricci, 2005), most of the times in participatory ways, i.e. involving the relevant extended peer community. Through a \u201cpedigree\u201d evaluation, we look at the genealogy of the knowledge perpetuated in the stories told by social actors whose narratives invoke techno -\u00ad\u2010 scientific claims or other authoritative arguments. This methodology allowed us to understand how knowledge is co-produced. 2.1 Research design For the purposes of this paper, we have analysed the Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of Regions \u201cSmart Grid s: from innovation to deployment\u201d (COM (2011) 202 final) 5 , published in 2011, in order to explore how different views, visions and opinions on SG get entrenched in policy documents and to assess the quality of knowledge used and produced in the policy maki ng process in terms of its pedigree . A Communication from the Commission is a mechanism to set a policy issue before the other European institutions. It has no legal effect but it contains the Commission\u2019s own thinking about the issue of concern. As far a s the cycle of policy making is concerned a Communication is a crucial step. 5 Hereafter we will refer to this policy document as the Communication. ",
        "34 So, we have outlined assumptions, claims, framings implicit in the discourse and investigated the sources of knowledge underpinning those elements. Following, our review of the Co mmunication and in order to answer our research questions, explore and examine different visions of SG, we have used semi - structured in - depth interviews. In - depth interviews are a qualitative research method, whose main goal is to provide insight into indi vidual perspectives on a specific issue, idea or situation (Boyce & Neale, 2006). As an ethnographic method it can provide in depth information around the topic that is discussed between the interviewer and the interviewee through the participant\u2019s experie nce (McNamara, 1999 ). We have conducted nine semi - structured in - depth interviews with EU stakeholders in the field of SG, in order to further assess knowledge used and produced to support the SG proposal. The preliminary identification of stakeholders was based on the citations of the Communication, but subsequently we asked the interviewees to suggest other relevant persons that they deemed relevant for our endeavour. Unintentionally, but perhaps not by chance, the majority of the interviewees are members or are somehow connected to the European Commission\u2019s Smart Grid Task Force 6 . However, as the names of the persons involved in the Task Force were not public at the time we did the interviews, our choice being led by the relevance and position of each pers on in the field of energy and smart electrical systems in the European Union. The interviews lasted between 45 minutes and 1hour and 15 minutes being conducted through the phone/Skype by three trained interviewers. They were further transcribed and analyse d. Finally, we have looked at citizens\u2019 blogs and forums in order to understand their views and visions on the deployment of SG and to see their connection with the EU policy documents and promises of main stakeholders. For the purposes of this work, no au dience research in the classical sense, was 6 The Task Force was established by the European Commission in 2009 with the goal of providing policy and regulatory directions for the use of smart grids as well as recommendations for standardisation, consumer data privacy and security. See http://ec.europa.eu/energy/gas_electricity/smartgrids/taskforce_en.htm. ",
        "35 conducted; as we considered citizens\u2019 views crucially important, we chose to look at the online sphere, a relatively new discursive space where the great deal of communication takes place nowadays (Witschge, 2007 ; Fisher, 2012) in many countries. Albeit, not representative, insights into this perspective have been important for our work because, except for one consumer organization, citizens have not been included in the Task Force for SG or the European Technolog y Platform, where they could have impacted the policy sphere. Neither have they been confronted with the issue in another way (for instance, in Italy the smart meters have been installed without citizens being informed about it). 3 Results The results are structured according to the research questions they answer to in the following categories: 1. Origins of knowledge: where we explore the sources of knowledge used by stakeholders and in policy documents 2. Visions: where we examine the visions discussed through the interviews and also written in policy documents 3. Major arguments against SG: where we explore citizens\u2019 dissatisfaction with SG and check whether these issues have been addressed by stakeholders 4. Whose views: where we examine whose views are mostly presented in the EU policy documents. 3.1 Origins of knowledge: Sources used Different stakeholders use different sources in order to build their knowledge. These sources are sometimes overlapping. One of the policy makers with whom we talked and who deals with SG seems to be using above all material produced by the industry sector: ",
        "36 \u201cOne of the main sources of information is the portfolio of projects that I have where I meet with quite a number of stakeholders dealing with the electricity system. I therefore meet with generators, distribution network operators and researchers and from that I get an understanding of what is going on in the energy field and in power distribution. However, I of course also read various reports and articles issued in the field as well as the different policy documents in this area.\u201d (Policy maker 1, 28/8/2013) Our industry interviewee, however, sustains that they rely to a great extent on academic research, cooperating with universities e.g. having master students doing their apprenti ceship in companies and making the concepts developed there more concrete for their application in the everyday life: \u201cOf course, we used our contacts with the university to basically understand the concepts they are researching and investigating. A coup le of master students were working with us, not only in setting up the concept, but also trying to make that concept more concrete in terms of how we should implement that concept in real life, so that was one source of information we used. Basically ther e were the contacts with the technical university in Delft and Eindhoven who worked with us on how the concept should look in terms of technology and also on what kinds of business models should be run on the demonstration side and the kind of user interac tion we wanted to have.\u201d (Industry 1 , 24/6/2013 ) Different sources are used by researchers who work on the issues of SG but at the same time work in collaboration with policy makers: \u201cI would divide them mostly into two big categories. One is typical res earch, reading papers, peer reviews, publications, etc.; of course I would include written work in this, the scientific work my colleagues from JRC, very often in my unit, are doing. This is one main part. The other very important part is to deal with th e other people, ",
        "37 mostly the project promoters and our colleagues from DG - Energy [European Commission]. Yesterday I was in a meeting with professors from different parts of the world who wanted to develop a cost - benefit analysis methodology to be applied wo rldwide; this was a very interesting experience, because you can exchange views on the assessments, and on the electricity networks on the basis of which SG are being deployed. Therefore, there is a very interactive part, which is dealing with other peopl e involved in the field, and another part which is purely research.\u201d (Researcher 1 , 4/7/2013 ) Despite the basis of their own knowledge mentioned by the interviewed stakeholders who were involved in the development of the Communication, it seems to us that this document makes a series of claims and assumptions which are poorly referenced and justified. These claims are all very positive about the future that SGs will bring to our electrical systems and there are no negative aspects mentioned. Here is one ex ample: \u201cWithout serious upgrading of existing grids and metering, renewable energy generation will be put on hold, security of the networks will be compromised, opportunities for energy saving and energy efficiency will be missed, and the internal energy market will develop at a much slower pace.\u201d (Communication, 2011 , p. 2 ) This sentence is not supported by any reference, coming from scientific research or any other body of knowledge. In total, the whole Communication contains 39 references (Figure 1). Exp loring further the origins of them, we have found that 26 referenced documents originate from the European Commission, 9 from Industry, 2 from consumer associations and 2 from professional consultancies. What is interesting to note here is that the majorit y of these documents are regulatory documents, such as mandates published in the Official Journal of the European Union, L series (legal documents). We argue that what seems to be missing, instead, is up to date scientific or ",
        "38 technical publications that sh ould have been a basis for so many of the claims written in this document. Figure 1 . The pedigree. 3.2 Imaginaries As we have discussed earlier, also in the SG case, visions of policy and industry stakeholders are mostly aligned among policy and industry actors; this observation has been recognised by industry actors that we have interviewed, for example: \u201cI always think about my vision of how the energy system has to work in the future, in 2020, 2030, etc. Personally I am not working on the current probl ems we have, so I think about how the energy system has to work in the future and what functions or roles we need in the future to have a sustainable energy supply, and at this level you could speak very well to the Dutch Government, because they have the same goal. They want to have a more sustainable energy supply. We all have the same problems; we do not know how we can arrange this sustainable energy supply. We have the same vision and roadmaps.\u201d (Industry 2 , 27/6/2013 ) The \u2018subscribed\u2019 visions are j ustified within the grand challenges our society is facing today, namely on energy futures and are offered as responding to our collective needs . This is in correspondence to 9 2 2 26 ",
        "39 what Benessia (2013) has described as the imaginaries of innovation: \u201cWonder\u201d: we want and of \u201cUrgency\u201d: we need. Another expression of these imaginaries is the emphasis of the rhetorics on the need for inclusion of citizens and their participation in the energy distribution systems as the main protagonists. \u201cThere are several needs th at can be met by SG. One very important one, which I am working on now with my colleagues from DG - Energy, is consumer empowerment through smart metering, demand response, the development of electricity markets and specific contracts. The consumer today i s not interacting with the electricity system; it is just switching on the light when needed, and not really thinking about the consequences of this electricity behaviour in terms of consumption. First of all, it is very important for me that people are e mpowered and endowed with the choice to decide when to consume [\u2026].\u201d (Researcher 1, 4/7/2013) Besides empowerment of citizens, competitiveness, reliability, security and sustainability, key ingredients of innovation and growth narratives are also outlined in our interviews. For example, the connection between renewable energy and SG is made as renewable sources of energy can be used more efficiently within a \u201csmart\u201d electrical grid that ideally should have no energy losses. However, all these issues are of ten present nowadays in rhetoric that is connected to the new and emerging technologies. \u201cLooking at the main policy objectives of the EU in terms of the energy system, the EU and the European Commission are trying to reach the objective of having an energ y system which is competitive, which is reliable or secure, and which is more sustainable than it is now. Therefore, in order to reach that, the European Commission tries to bring forward market principles in these sectors to reach a more ",
        "40 competitive ener gy system. In order to reach a more secure energy system, the EU is trying to decrease the dependency on foreign energy sources and to increase dependency on domestic producer - generated energy. That is why the European Commission tries to accelerate the d evelopment of renewable energy production.\u201d (Industry 1 , 24/6/2013 ) Another issue where both policy makers and industry developers we have interviewed had common visions was energy price. According to them energy will become cheaper through SG (and theref ore more competitive), although it is not exactly explained how this will happen. \u201cWe can also facilitate all the sustainable energy in a conventional way, just to build grids, but it\u2019s much too expensive. So, SG are the way to make it not too expensive. We want to make things smart and not just conventional grids [\u2026].\u201d (Industry 2 , 27/6/2013 ) In this context, what seems to be agreed is that SG can lower energy losses and the electricity can be used more efficiently, but the price of the electricity that t he consumers will have to pay is still, to a great extent, unknown. Consumer organisations agree that the SG\u2019 rhetoric is to a great extent related to the costs and savings, but they argue that it is not explained how consumers would save out of it. For ex ample, through their research Torriti (2012) and Giampietro & Kovacic (forthcoming) suggested that energy consumption has not diminished after the introduction of smart meters, but on the contrary it has even increased such as in Northern Italy, for instan ce. In the USA, experience suggests that costs could be lessen by SG applications, but as one of our interviewees suggested, caution should be taken when transposing such assumptions to the EU context: \u201cIt\u2019s about cost and also savings potential. Because very often it is presented that Smart meters will help consumers save energy. But the ways in which consumers will save are actually not that clear. Demand - response should be better defined. We need ",
        "41 to bear in mind that consumption patterns are different in the US and the EU.[\u2026] It\u2019s not only that they will get smart meters and information but it has to be provided in some way consumers can understand and actually respond to. So the biggest challenge is how to involve consumers\u201d (Consumer association repre sentative 1 , 19/7/2013 ) Nevertheless, if we look at the Communication, visions are not exactly visions of stakeholders we had a chance to hear. They are mostly a part of a homemade rhetoric taken from the EU2020 agenda, where its principal goals are stated . \u201cThe EU2020 agenda comes across with a clear message for Europe. The EU\u2019s future economic growth and jobs will increasingly have to come from innovation in products and services for Europe\u2019s citizens and businesses. Innovation will also contribute to ta ckling one of the most critical challenges Europe is facing today, namely ensuring the efficient and sustainable use of natural resources.\u201d 3.3 Citizens\u2019 views on SGs and policy makers response Despite the very positive views of policy makers and indust ry regarding the possible implementation of SG, citizens are seen as having a great deal of concerns about it. One of their main concerns is related to surveillance and privacy of citizens in their homes and what is usually described as \u201cbig brother\u201d 7 . The data provided by the smart meter (a device necessarily associated with SG) about the citizens\u2019 habits and electricity consumption in every moment of their lives (e.g. Blake Levitt & Glendinning, 2011; Regalado, 2012; Edes, 2013) is collected by the compan ies that run the electrical system. In the account of the policy maker interviewee, this controversy lead to the inclusion of 7 George Orwell\u2019s term in his famous book Nineteen Eighty-Four . ",
        "42 consumer associations in the expert group on security and privacy of smart meters and SG lead by the European Commission. \u201cI invit ed a consumer association from the Netherlands to participate in our expert group on security and privacy, and with the smart meter manufacturing associations, we came to an agreement on some principles. One of the principles was privacy by design, and th is was stressed in the deliverables and explained there.\u201d (Policy maker 2 , 21/6/2013 ) Through different material posted online, blogs, forums and social media 8 , we have identified several main issues arising in the discussions and commentary. The focus of all the posts is smart meters, even if the discussion is led around SG, as a broader topic. Based on this, the consumer organisations seem to agree that citizens should be free to decide whether they want a smart meter at home or not: \u201cConsumers should alw ays have the choice whether they want to have a smart meter or not, especially if they are going to pay for it. [...] Consumers should not be obliged to take part in such programmes as demand - response for instance.\u201d (Consumer association representative 1, 19/7/2013 ) One of the most discussed issues that emerges on the forums is health effects from the introduction of smart meters at home because of the radiofrequency signals they emit, based on the concern that the radiofrequency electromagnetic fields are potentially carcinogenic 9 . The possible health issues are mentioned in the ANEC/BEUC Position Paper on Energy Efficiency (ANEC/BEUC, 2011). 8 We have analyzed the following blogs and fora: Smargridawareness http://smartgridawareness.org/; Citizens for Safe Technology: Smart Meter Petition https://cstorg.wufoo.com/reports/smart-meter-petition/; Wij vertrouwehn slimme meters niet http://www.wijvertrouwenslimmemetersniet.nl/; Regalado\u2019s article \u201cRage Against the Smart Meter\u201d published in MIT Technology Review http://www.technologyreview.com/news/427497/rage-against-the-smart- meter/page/2/and comments of readers below; Zon Jonge http://zonjonge.nl/slimme-meters/ 9 Smart meters emit radiofrequency waves, which are a type of electromagnetic radiation that can be potentially cancerogenous, based on the classification of the International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organization that radiofrequency electromagnetic fields are possibly carcinogenic to humans (group 2B) (IARC, 2011) ",
        "43 However, this issue does not come up in any of the interviews we conducted or in the policy document we analysed. Ot her issues discussed in the fora we looked at include environmental effects, construction of grids as profit - oriented enterprises as well as, the accuracy and invasiveness of smart meters, connected to the issues of security and privacy. According to the E U policy makers with whom we talked, there are antagonist stakeholders\u2019 views that need yet to find a space to be articulated in policy making : \u201cThere are different ways in which this can be done. Each consumer has a different interest. Even if you found a consumer who would agree to take part in the project it would not help you a great deal because there would be thousands of other consumers with different views. If you look at citizen associations or consumer associations, they do not easily represent co nsumers\u2019 views as such because there are different views on this matter. What ADRESS 10 tried to do was to enter into a dialogue and present its findings in an open manner and try to see how this could work in the real environment. They had separate interact ions with consumers associations to discuss how this would work in the real environment. There are different interests in this area. For instance, some consumers would like to have cheaper electricity, whereas that does not align with the direct interest o f generators and network operators, who of course would like to establish a more stable business case for themselves. The question is, therefore, how can we deal with these different interests and find ways of being able to represent each view fairly?\u201d (E C official, 27/8/2013 ) 10 ADRESS is an European project funded under FP7 of research: http://www.addressfp7.org/ ",
        "44 Nevertheless, one of the biggest issues both among citizens and other stakeholders concerns the calls for empowering citizens. The industry and policy makers promise users\u2019 empowerment through energy consumption \u201cfree choice\u201d that th e user will be entitled through the SG model. \u201cWe try to empower customers not only to produce their energy but to choose when they want to consume their energy\u201d (Industry, 24/6/2013 ) But, if we critically assess this statement, it remains unclear what exa ctly will change, because many EU citizens already have the opportunity to choose when to consume energy, a choice driven by time based pricing. At the same time, if we take a look at the raise of photovoltaic panels in residential houses, we can see that the technology is driving the increase of electricity usage and not its decrease as it had been predicted (Durrenberger, 2012 ; Lambert et al., 2014 ). The Communication also talks about the empowerment of citizens without specifying how this will be done or what it actually means. \u201cWith the transition towards smart energy systems come new opportunities for EU citizens, but as with any new technology, increasingly sophisticated functionalities can result in unintended consequences. Great emphasis is given b y European policy - makers to the need to implement more active transmission and distribution systems. Central to the future development of this smart energy system is nevertheless consumer acceptance through enhanced consumer protection and empowerment. Eff ective regulatory and policy measures to address personal data handling, safety and consumer protection are, in our views, still lacking.\u201d However, the consumers association representative that we interviewed outlines some uncertainties and possible probl ematic issues. They do not believe consumers will change their behaviour by engaging more with the electrical system than they do for the moment, mostly because of the complex energy market whose functioning often remains unclear to citizens. ",
        "45 \u201cPersonally, I do not really believe in massive consumer activation, because what we see on the market very much depends on consumers. However, what we see now is that the energy market is one of the worst - performing markets when we look at different surveys: people d o not understand their energy bills, in some countries there is tax complexity and so many that people get confused, and they do not really engage with the market.\u201d (Consumer association representative 1 , 19/7/2013 ) This was also suggested in our interview with an industry developer who explained his personal experience with the smart meter in following words: \u201cThe first week I had the smart meter, I looked at the app and saw I had used the same amount of energy as yesterday, and after a couple of weeks I d id not look at the app anymore. Therefore, I am not so convinced that it is very useful in the long term; that is my personal point of view.\u201d (Industry 2 , 27/6/2013 ) We see that this opinion is very similar to the opinion of consumers associations who fea r citizens will not engage in the long run with smart meters. In this context, some policy makers are aware of this sort of disconnect and see a need to know more about citizens\u2019 opinions and feelings regarding smart meters, not least because smart meters have been subject of a great controversy in many countries, namely in The Netherlands 11 (Hess & Coley, 2012; Hess, 2014) but also outside Europe 12 . \u201cWhat I definitely also want more of in the future is to understand how individuals feel about this choice, w hich is also a very expensive choice as we know very well, or let us call it an important investment decision for the future. We need to consult and understand how people feel about it a lot more.\u201d (Policy maker 3 , 24/7/2013 ) 11 The Dutch government refused the initial regulation of the use of smart grids for all due to privacy issues and supported the possibility for opt out (TransAtlantic Consumer Dialogue, 2011) 12 The same type of controversy is present in countries outside of the EU, such as California in the US (e.g. Chavannes, 2009, Senia, 2011) ",
        "46 3.4 Whose views? Through the in terviews and the analysis of policy documents, we have seen that opinions of different stakeholders are often not taken equally into account in those policy documents. While both the interviewed policy makers and industry representatives argue that consume rs\u2019 views are more present in policy documents than industry, the consumer organisation\u2019s representative that we have interviewed highlights the fact that industry\u2019s views are predominant in the work of the Task Force on SG and its policy documents; they a rgue that the simple fact that industry\u2019s budget is higher than that of consumer organisations sets a priori the affordability to regularly participate in the Task Force, make their voice heard and ultimately influence policy making. Hence, it is interesti ng to see that the interviewed policy officer sees it differently, as the following quote illustrates: \u201cIf you ask the members of the Task Force whether they think that the Commission is taking on board consumer views or industry views, I believe that most of the members would say that it would be consumer views.\u201d (Policy maker 3 , 27/8/2013 ) But in the view of one of our interviewees, consumer organisations might be stronger than the industry because of their united position, while the industry is divided. This interviewee also suggests that regulators should be representing a \u201ccommon interest\u201d, which should be the same as citizens\u2019 views. \u201cConsumer organisations are sometimes even stronger than the industry because they are quite compact with their position . The industry is very divided; there are people from the industry who are against and people from the same industry who are absolutely in favour. Therefore, in the end, consumers and other stakeholders are making their voices heard even more in this case . There are also regulators, typically independent, who oversee the electricity market, who have the purpose of supporting the common interest.\u201d (Researcher 1 , 4/7/2013 ) ",
        "47 It is even more interesting to note that our interviewed policy maker sees policy mak ers as citizens\u2019 representatives and actually think of themselves as representatives of citizens\u2019 voice : \u201cPoliticians are very important representatives of consumers and citizens as they are elected by citizens to cater for their views in a broader sense. Interaction with politicians and policymakers is therefore a very important part of this project.\u201d(Policy maker 4 , 27/8/2013 ). If we now turn to the Communication we can read that: \u201cthe Commission has set up a SG Task Force which has issued a report out lining expected services, functionalities and benefits. These are largely agreed by industry, public authorities and consumer organisations and are described in the attached Staff Working Paper. \u201d (p. 2 ). Whilst we were not able to find the \u201cattached\u201d Staff Working Paper, we are left to wonder what \u201clargely agreed\u201d means in this context. Taking into consideration that organisations participating in the Task Force are three industrial partners, one public authority, and one consumer organisation, which are ex plicitly mentioned, it is not clear whether the agreement was made between them or other social partners who had agreed upon it as well. Hence, from a knowledge assessment point of view, we see that there are many quality issues that arise from what seems to be a prevalence of un - discussed socio - technical imaginaries in the debate about these systems, sustaining the overall innovation narrative. 4 Discussion SG are presented to citizens of the EU as supportive of a more sustainable energy system, a goal that is positioned high on the EU agenda through the innovation and growth narratives that sustain it. In this paper we have explored how knowledge assessment methodologies may help with looking ",
        "48 into quality elements of the discourses that sustain the \u201cSG\u201d project, namely assumptions, justifications, claims, narrative voices and what one can call the disconnect between the discourses and action of different members of the epistemic network that sustains the smart promises of future electric grids. In our an alysis of policy documents, in particular the Communication, as well as the in - depth interviews we have conducted, we see that the knowledge that is used in policy discourses is mostly knowledge that supports and celebrates the proposal, and not surprising ly it is aligned with industry discourses. In other words, the socio - technical imaginaries that shape this proposal are very similar to the ones described by Jasanoff and Kim (2013) in relation to past and current energy policies in the three different cou ntries they looked at. In the Communication that supports this initiative in the European Union, the discussion of \u201crisks and losses of technological development\u201d ( Op. cit. ) or the discussion of alternatives is very limited; instead SG are heralded as the smart, reliable, competitive and innovative breakthrough, as well as, the means to solve our growth, sustainability and energy security challenges. Thus, as for the European character of SGs, w e have not noticed many particular distinguishing attributes o f these socio - technical imaginaries \u2013 for instance, if compared the studies of Jasanoff and Kim (2009, 2013), the only distinctive signs are a broader supranational scope, the presence of grand narratives connected to the notion of Innovation Union and no risks discussed. The broader scope allowed for a more centralized view of smart grids and the possible application of SGs to resolve the aforementioned grand challenges. We could, therefore, say that SG are a project that serves outright the public good . Our pedigree analysis of the Communication (policy document) shows that the main sources that support the document are either European Commission or industry publications \u2013 see figure 1. By studying further the knowledge production around this theme, we re alise that there is a debate going ",
        "49 on that focus on the tangible object that connects citizenry to this enterprise: the smart meter. The smart meter is a constitutive element of the implementation of SG. As we have seen earlier, there are ethical issues ra ised with its adoption as the interface between citizens and the energy grids. Yet, this proposal (SG) is strongly reliant on public engagement and (active) citizenship. In fact, on one hand, engagement is the condition sine qua non for the proposal to thr ive as argued by many, but on the other hand, our analysis suggests that the concerns of citizenry are downplayed, that the rhetoric of empowerment with which smart meters are presented to citizens is to say the least discussible. Empowerment of citizens i s described as happening through the interactions between consumers and producers happening through SG. What seems to be missing is the clear vision of how this will happen. We agree with Nyborg and Ropke (2013) that it is unknown if and how the citizens\u2019 behaviour will change and if they will turn from passive into active (energy) citizens. Although we have seen that the ambivalences in visions among different stakeholders can be beneficial for and even reinforce the development of these technologies and t heir acceptance in society (Star & Griesemer, 1989; Casper & Clarke, 1998; Sovacool & Ramana, 2015 ), our results have shown that at some levels, there is not only a different vision but also a disconnect between different stakeholders, especially between policy makers and industry on one side, and citizens on the other. Citizens\u2019 views with regards to smart meters as expressed online show concerns for issues such as their rights, surveillance, health, safety, etc., which, as we have seen in some EU count ries, results on public resistance to the dominant visions. Policy makers see the convincement of citizens about the safety, predictability, security, privacy, data protection of SG\u2019 operations as one of the major challenges to enact these systems. However , the dialogue with the publics is rather poor or non - existing. In fact, our policy maker interviewees think of themselves as citizens\u2019 representatives; but can this claim be really sustained? For example, with knowledge assessment methodologies we see tha t the quality of knowledge produced by different actors of the epistemic network is ensured in ",
        "50 different ways, but we also see what knowledge is enacted and which is not. While the industry relies mostly on academic sources and their own research, policy m akers mostly use the industry sector, as source to document their claims. In the Communication, many claims are made without reference or they originate from other European Commissions\u2019 documents, therefore representing the homemade rhetoric. In referring to the publics, little is said about their concerns, expectations; public issues are described through issues of \u2018privacy\u2019 and \u2018security\u2019 as if public dimensions of such \u2018critical infrastructures\u2019 could be reduced to these aspects. Hence, in what sense ar e policy makers voicing European citizens\u2019 concerns and questions? How could instead civic epistemologies shape a better collective commitment to responsible energy markets and consumptions? Based on the study presented here, we argue that there is a stron g need for more participation and public debate in policy making processes. 5 Conclusions As our study suggests, the socio - technical imaginaries that are being privileged come from the industry and are then echoed by policy makers; they are coherent with and fuelled by the innovation narrative. Benessia (2013) refers to the standard imaginaries of innovation as: wonder (we want), control, power (we can) and urgency (we need). The discourse on SG can be well described by these standard imaginaries, not onl y we want and we need SG because they promise to solve many of the human current challenges, but also we can. But, how are the questions arising from those who are heralded as the key actors to implement these systems crafted in the overall proposal? Our i n - depth interviews seem to indicate that there are pragmatic, practical and political questions unanswered, especially by the policy documents, for example who is actually benefiting from the \u2018smart\u2019 on the grids? What regulatory means exist or will be dev eloped to protect citizens from potential corporate ",
        "51 wrongdoing when it comes to their rights? What is made of citizens\u2019 hopes and fears? W hat grids and energies are we supporting with SGs? Are there alternatives? - Figure 2 summarises what epistemic netw ork surrounds the construction of the discourses around SG, obtained through pedigree analysis in knowledge assessment methodologies. Figure 2 \u2013 the epistemic networks Finally, as for other collective challenges of our times, the debate on energy gov ernance needs not to be relegated to specific powerful elites and their agendas, but should be a matter of permanent debate and of shared responsible action, as frameworks like the EU approach to European Framework Programmes called Responsible Research an d Innovation seem to sustain. Acknowledgement The study we present here is a part of a larger research project called EPINET, whose main goal is to provide the assessment of the societal impact of new technologies within epistemic networks, with four diff erent case studies, SGs being one of the cases.

        "60 Annex 2 Wearable Sensors \u2013 Assessing Knowledge of Epistemic Networks Melina Breitegger, European Commission, Joint Research Centre Lucia Vesnic-Alujevic, European Commission, Joint Research Centre \u00c2ngela Guimar\u00e3es Pereira, European Commission, Joint Research Centre Abstract Wearable sensors are devices that allow communicating patient\u2019s state of health to their physicians without the need of their physical presence. They offer grand promises to both patients and doctors. Using knowledge assessment methodologies, we look at how new technologies and political discourses co-produce expectations and imaginaries about future healthcare. .In this paper we examine the pedigree of claims of EU policy documents, deepening it with in-depth interviews with members of the epistemic network, i.e. social actors that produce and share relevant knowledge about an issue. We found that even if the proposal of mobile health is attractive to many, better connectors among the epistemic networks about both bodies of knowledge and apparent disjointed visions could result on more socially robust policies. At present there still exist a great deal of different \u201cdisconnects\u201d between uses, users and policy makers with regards to wearable care. Keywords: Wearable Sensors, Knowledge Assessment, policy Introduction Wearable sensors (WS) \u2013 that is wearable devices that allow activity and physiological monitoring - are used in a wide spectrum of health related aspects by citizens. The types of sensors addressed in ",
        "61 this paper are mainly used for fitness, sports and self-monitoring, but the growing attention is primarily due to their potential applications in the area of healthcare monitoring. Whilst many individuals use these devices to monitor their personal fitness, there is an expectation of the usage of these devices in medical contexts, especially regarding eldercare or people with chronic medical conditions. The growing usage of WS in everyday life activities is paving the way for a need for further regulation, despite many WS fields of application already being highly regulated and normalised, e.g. health sector. Governments and the European Union (EU) institutions have become involved in several ways. Imaginaries of main stakeholders, especially those of policy makers and industry about the potential and further applications of WS are relevant driving forces that push the development of these technologies. But other active and relevant voices from, e.g. NGOs, academics and citizens are co-shaping the ways in which these tools are developed, deployed, normalised and eventually regulated. In this paper we look at how knowledge co-production influences policy. By applying knowledge assessment methodologies, we look at how science and other forms of knowledge are developed around new technologies that inform policy makers, in particular in Europe. We use the notion of epistemic networks (Rommeteveit 2013), i.e. a heterogeneous group of relevant actors, i.e. anybody responding to or contesting a societal challenge by engaging in activities together with others ( Op. cit .). Here we look at the different members that constitute the epistemic networks around WS. The concept of epistemic network will be further discussed in this paper. While looking at WS, we focus on the techno-scientific imaginaries (Jasanoff and Kim, 2009) in which they emerge and the discourses constructed around them also used in the policy development in the EU. Hence, by exploring these issues through knowledge assessment of policy documents and ",
        "62 industry papers, as well as through the interviews with different social actors we interrogate what the epistemic networks are for developments in this field. Wearable sensors in the EU Europe\u2019s growth strategy, Europe 2020, promotes the advances of future and emerging technologies \u2013 and WS are among them. WS are also a key feature of what is called the Internet of Things, the largest world project on connectivity. Policy developments in the field of telemedicine, mhealth and ICT for healthcare are present in the Digital Agenda for Europe, the European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing in Horizon 2020. In addition the European Commission (EC) launched several calls for proposals for projects related to biosensors, mostly in the area of telemedicine, e-health and active ageing during the 2000s. Research for \u201cpersonalised health care\u201d is funded with a budget of \u20ac 549 million in 2014, responding to the strategy to reduce the ever rising costs of healthcare in the ageing population of the EU. Through the analysis of these documents one can see that expectations are high: \u201cBy better understanding the causes of health and disease and making best use of big data, we can develop better diagnostics (e.g. in vivo medical imaging), therapies (e.g. clinical trials for non- communicable diseases), health promotion and disease prevention strategies (e.g. environment and health based interventions) at personal and population level, as well as technologies to support healthy ageing (e.g. mHealth applications).\u201d (EC 2014) The EC call for proposals of 2013 mentions ICT for Health, Ageing Well, Inclusion and Governance, as one of the big challenges of Europe. Here, ICT in health is described as a tool for empowering the elderly generation: \u201cThe \u2018ICT for Ageing and Independent Living\u2019 activities will focus on empowering people with age related dependencies or disabilities to live independently, delay/avoid institutionalisation and staying active as much and as long as possible.\u201d(EC C(2012)4536, 53) ",
        "63 But we would argue that these big promises come with high uncertainties and a number of ethical questions. So far, it is not clear who will own the data, or whether these will be open data; who would be responsible for medical decisions that are based on data produced by WS; or what are the social implications of distant care for elderly or people with chronically ill patients in need of continuous care. It is therefore important to analyse how epistemic networks contribute to the development and adoption of wearable technologies in healthcare and what normativities are developing through the design and use of these devices. Imaginaries of Europe, Science, Technology and Innovation The current discourse on WS can be linked to a more general perspective on science and technology in the European Union. In the \u201cInnovation Union\u201d, research and innovation are seen as a means to bring more products to the market, being at the core of the EU 2020 strategy. As Van den Hove et al. (2011) remarked, the discourse on innovation is based on a number of underlying assumptions. It is assumed, for example, that innovation is always good, it will create jobs and improve quality of life. Also, the narrative is presented in a salvific role, solving all the problems that we face today (Van den Hove et al. 2011, 75; Benessia, 2013). These assumptions are highly problematic because they can be proved wrong in many cases. An innovation is not \u201cgood\u201d at all times; economic profit does not automatically map into improvements of quality of life; the idea that all problems of society can be solved through technology (\u201ctechnofix\u201d) is obsolete and misguided. Often, by solving one problem with technology, we might generate another (Van den Hove et al. 2011, 76). Felt et al. (2007) argue that all key reference points in science and governance, such as the purposes of research, ethical issues and public concerns, are objects of collective imagination ( Op. cit , p11). Hence, it is important to investigate what imaginaries are entertaining the techno-scientific developments and who drives the process of collective imagination. In other words, whose values are being represented? What are the knowledge claims that are being used to ground these visions ",
        "64 and imaginations of the future? Jasanoff and Kim (2009) have described techno-scientific imaginaries when they studied energy policies in the USA through the exploration of the imaginaries that guided past energy policies in that country. This concept explains how visions about possible futures are produced being defined as \u201ccollectively imagined forms of social life and social order reflected in the design and fulfilment of nation-specific scientific and/or technological projects\u201d (Jasanoff & Kim, 2009, p.120). Imaginaries can be also expressed as \u201ccollections of visual and verbal metaphors that are created and communicated both in the specialised literature and in the mass media for public at large.\u201d (Benessia 2013) In this paper we focus on the verbal metaphors of such techno-scientific imaginaries in relation to health and wellness through WS. As a co-production within the societal and political context in which it develops (Jasanoff 1996), science and technology relevant actors are not only researchers, industry and other professionals but also policy makers and citizens (organised or nor according to specific interests). How these actors are involved in the process of knowledge production (and contestation) and how they influence decision making helps with understanding the dominant narratives in Europe in particular about innovation. In this context, we are referring to \u201cepistemic communities\u201d, which include all the parties involved in knowledge production - not only \u201cscientific knowledge\u201d, but also other types of knowledge based on experience and other sources. The concept of epistemic network is akin with that introduced by Haas (1992), epistemic community . The term \u201cepistemic communities\u201d is used differently throughout the literature, sometimes referring exclusively to scientific communities or scientists that share a scientific method. According to Haas, an epistemic community is \u201ca network of professionals with recognised expertise and competence in a particular domain and an authoritative claim to policy-relevant knowledge within that domain or issue-area.\u201d (Haas, 1992, p.3) The members of an epistemic community do not need to have the same background or to be from the same field but they need to share normative and causal beliefs, ",
        "65 notions of validity and a set of common practices. He understands it as a thought collective, i.e. a group of people that shares beliefs or faiths in the applicability of specific types of knowledge. This definition differs from our understanding of epistemic communities. Here, this concept is just used as \u201ca way of conceptualising complex development within emerging fields of sociotechnical innovation\u201d to study among other cases, WS. Hence, here we use Rommetveit\u2019s (2013) concept of epistemic network , since a network is more heterogeneous and porous than a community and allows for a hybridity of roles and identities across science-policy boundaries ( Op. cit ). In order to analyse how epistemic networks participate in knowledge production around WS, we applied knowledge assessment methodologies described in the next section. The concept of co-production and the knowledge assessment approach The concept of co-production introduced and developed by Jasanoff ( Op. cit. ), i.e. \u201cthe simultaneous production of knowledge and social order\u201d is relevant for our endeavour. In other words, scientific production cannot be seen as separable from the constitution of our societies being intertwined through co-existence and co-development. \u201c[Scientific knowledge] both embeds and is embedded in social practices, identities, norms, conventions, discourses, instruments and institutions - in short in all the building blocks of what we term the social \u201d (Jasanoff 2004, 3). The co-production concept helps with discovering the legitimation mechanisms through which epistemic networks make their knowledge matter into governance practices and vice versa, i.e. how governance styles and practices influence knowledge production and usage. Knowledge assessment as defined by Silvio Funtowicz deals with \u201cevaluating of knowledge inputs in decision-making processes\u201d (Funtowicz 2006, 139). In this context knowledge is not simply understood as \u201cscientific\u201d knowledge, but also includes other types of knowledge produced outside the academic sphere. ",
        "66 Knowledge assessment aims to analyse the quality of knowledge used in processes of public policy or of societal processes that shape the development and deployment of technology. Since it is dealing with different types of knowledge, quality assessment methods such as peer review in science cannot be applied. Quality cannot be defined in terms of good scientific practice but has to include additional values and interests, which are expressed by an epistemic community. Knowledge assessment responds to the quest for socially robust knowledge (Nowotny 2003) in policy making. Funtowicz and Ravetz (1992) proposed \u201cextended peer review\u201d by \u201cextended peer communities\u201d as the process that includes all those who are affected by a policy proposal or development. In the case of WS, we looked at papers produced by academia, the industry and the EC. An important goal of knowledge assessment is to identify relevant actors in a given debate on policy related science, in other words to identify the members of the extended peer community and hence discover the nodes of the epistemic network. The means by which knowledge assessment can do that is by using the concept of pedigree, \u201can evaluative description of the mode of production (and where relevant, of anticipated use) of the information.\u201d (Funtowicz and Ravetz 1990) that aims at demonstrating different types of uncertainty in the quality assessment of qualitative information (Funtowicz and Ravetz 2014). Methodology In order to apply knowledge assessment to the study of WS for health and wellness we have tried to identify policy documents issued in the European Union; yet, this technology and its application is really in its infancy with regards to the policy realm. For that reason we analysed the documents that have some relation to WS applications in health, such as the EC staff paper on Telemedicine, the green paper on mHealth and the EC Work program 2011 and 2013 on Information and Communication Technologies. As far as the industry sector is concerned, we analysed white papers from the company Zephyr and blog entries of FitBit. ",
        "67 After the analysis of the documents we conducted in-depth interviews with relevant social actors in the field of WS and telemedicine, which gave us more insight in the construction of specific visions and narratives. In order to select relevant social actors for the interviews, we looked at the authorship of relevant policy papers, scientific papers, articles in specialised media (for example, Wired Magazine) and persons that are involved in projects related to e-health. Hence, we conducted nine semi-structured in-depth interviews with three persons from academia, one policy maker, one journalist, one policy adviser, one medical doctor, one IT developer/researcher and one person involved in the quantified-self movement (http://quantifiedself.org). A knowledge assessment journey Wearable sensors related policy documents \u2013 journey 1 Looking at the documents, special attention was paid to the references that were given to support major claims on the benefit of wearable sensor technologies. We found that many of the claims are not backed up by any reference: \u201cTelemedicine can help to address major challenges faced by European healthcare systems. For example, telemonitoring can improve the quality of life of chronically ill patients through self- management solutions and remote monitoring from home, reducing hospitalization costs and saving on unnecessary emergency visits.\u201d (COM (2012) 736 final, SWD (2012) 413 final, 3 ) Although these are strong assumptions, they are not supported with references that would add on their robustness. Other claims are grounded on existing publications but the text was changed not reflecting the meaning of the original claims: \u201cTelemedicine can also significantly improve access to care, by delivering high-quality services to patients living in remote or sparsely populated areas affected by shortages of specialized healthcare professionals or by facilitating across border healthcare for the benefit of citizens in the EU.\u201d (COM (2012) 736 final, SWD (2012) 413 final ) ",
        "68 This section refers to the EU citizenship report of 2010, which deals only with cross-border healthcare, not discussing telemedicine as a means for better care for people living in remote areas. A common snag of the EU papers is self-referencing, i.e. the EC justifies certain types of claims that would require references to expert studies with arguments that were made in earlier EC publications of policy nature instead of referencing expert sources of information. By examining the document\u2019s \u2018pedigree\u2019, namely by looking at sources quoted in the 2012 EC paper on telemedicine, we found the following source types: policy documents: 25 EU Directives and Regulations, 14 from the EC, 7 from European Court of Justice; and one from academia. Whilst one can argue that the choice to have our healthcare mediated by ICT is a social and political one and not a technical one, it also can be expected that the reasoning offered is of social and political nature and not based on poorly referenced technical arguments. Figure 1: Pedigree of the 2012 EC paper on telemedicine. Looking at the published green paper on mHealth (EC COM (2014) 219), we can observe a greater variety of references, although the majority of references is still from the EC itself: 21 from EC, 17 Telemedicine pedigree 25 14 7 1 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% 1 EU Directives and Regulations European Commission European Court of Justice University ",
        "69 from industry and consultancies (12 industry, 5 consulting), 4 from the World Health Organization, 3 from university and 1 from the media. Figure 2. Pedigree of the mHealth Green paper. Wearable sensors publications from industry \u2013 Journey 2 Industry is often a powerful actor in epistemic networks. Therefore it is important to look at publications and studies from the private sector, which are used many times in policy documents at the European level. We looked at two companies that are at present very active in the business of health WS. We looked in detail at white papers issued by the company Zephyr. In one of the papers that we examined, the company presents a study that compares their product (the BioHarness) to a spirometer for measuring respiratory rate. They conclude that, \"Based on this initial study and the experience in the field to date, it appears that the lightweight, wireless and portable BioHarness can be used for physiological measurement both in the lab and in the field.\" (Zephyr Technology 2008, 2). In order to prove the scientific value of their study the paper presents statistical data and graphs, citing an academic journal to prove their (right) use of the statistical methods. Yet, the study was done with five participants, making the statistical analysis of the data meaningless.

        "70 The Fitbit company produces WS for fitness tracking. While the sensors are not medical devices, they are sold with the narrative of helping customers to improve their health. The normative concept behind the company\u2019s health action plan is quite simple. Everybody should walk 10.000 steps a day, sleep 8 hours and drink enough water. On their blog, the Fitbit company refers to doctors to support their health concept: \u201cThe American Heart Association uses the 10,000 step metric as a guideline to follow for improving health and decreasing risk of heart disease, the number one killer of men and women in America.\u201d (Fitbit Blog, 22/06/2010) The American Heart Association does recommend people to climb 10,000 steps a day on their website \u201chttp://goredforwomen.org\u201d, where recommendations are made for women to become fitter and healthier. In one article they refer to a certain Mr. David Frid, MD, a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio who is said to recommend the specific 10,000 steps a day. The Fitbit company also refers to other \u201cexperts\u201d in their blog whose expertise is not presented with any type of credentials. Another example would be the International Sports Medicine Institute, which is a Chiropractic Corporation that sells natural health products. (Fitbit Blog 5/06/2010) In many cases, the blog does not further specify who the \u201cexpert\u201d is, but mentions the opinion of experts without any reference. Fitbit also refers to experiences of the user community in order to prove the effectiveness of the device: \u201cBy seeing how much they move (in real time), our users say they walk 40% more each day to hit the recommended 10,000 steps a day.\u201d (Fitbit Blog 4/01/2013) Yet, it is not clear how the company evaluated users\u2019 experiences. Were customers asked to take part in a survey, and if so, how many users actually participated? ",
        "71 Deepening the process through stakeholder engagement \u2013 Journey 3 In order to get a deeper understanding of the processes of knowledge co-production and the epistemic networks around WS, we interviewed nine stakeholders from different fields of expertise. The identification of the interviewees was based on their expertise or their involvement in the policy process or opinion making. Hence we have interviewed four researchers from academia, one journalist, two policy actors, a doctor, a representative of the quantified self movement, which is an organisation that uses WS to deal with health issues. We have also contacted industry but none showed their availability to talk to us. All those interviewed were either authors of relevant publications in the field or known activists in the field. All interviews were conducted in the time period between 15 th of June 2013 and 16 th December 2013. The length of the interviews varied from 30 to 60 minutes. The semi-structured interviews were centred around questions regarding the interviewee\u2019s involvement in the field of WS, the personal motivation to engage with this topic, the knowledge that was used when producing material on WS, and general questions on benefits and challenges regarding WS in health care. Additionally we asked about how quality of knowledge could be assured when evidence was sought for the narratives these devices are being proposed and sold with; finally we also enquired about which topics were not successfully discussed in debates surrounding WS. In the interviews we focused especially on the issues regarding the use of WS in health care. Knowledge Assessment As previously noted, the EC is promoting e-health, m-health and WS as important means to improve the healthcare system. By looking at the policy papers and industry papers we noticed that many claims were not documented. Therefore, we asked our interviewees what their knowledge on WS builds on, especially taking into consideration the place and hopes they seem to take in a rather complex transformation of healthcare. ",
        "72 With regards to scientific and clinical studies on WS in healthcare, three of the interviewed persons from different epistemic networks (academia and healthcare) specifically stated that there was not enough research on WS in healthcare and a tele-health; the engineer and researcher interviewed considered positive the financing of projects in this area by the European Union. \u201cThere is surprisingly little academic research. I am doing a little bit of research, but I am mostly looking at safety issues. The companies themselves are very eager to present customer satisfaction type data, but that is quite different from the data that is required if you really want to look at the medical effects of the devices. We do not really have any comparisons for how the new applications perform compared to traditional.\u201d (Researcher 3, 29/11/2013) Concerning a EU funded project on sensors for monitoring and predicting falls of elderly people, Researcher 1 states: \u201cIt is just about gathering clinical evidence to support the usefulness of it, at least from a clinical or medical outcomes point of view. People are pushing this technology, but it is often largely unproven. They need to gather evidence to show that it is actually effective and it does improve health in some way. Even if it does not improve health, it could at least help healthcare costs so that we spend less money on it.\u201d (Researcher 1, 13/11/2013) With regards to WS in healthcare, a medical doctor and university professor replied that there is the need for more large-scale studies, instead of the small-scale studies that have been done this far: \u201cI would like to see more large-scale studies being done to really convince policy makers to change their funding behaviour. Whenever we want to study a topic, we have very small studies with a small number of participants. This is very costly, but we really need the evidence so that people will listen to us.\u201d (Medical doctor, 22/10/2013) These views contrast with the claims in the policy documents, as well as the opinion of the policy maker that we interviewed. According to the policy maker, there is enough knowledge including ",
        "73 clinical evidence available on WS used as medical devices that can be used to measure their cost- effectiveness. It just has to be gathered in the right way to get a complete picture: \u201cThe new thing we are launching with DG CONNECT tries to map out all the clinical evidence which is available on the market, to better measure the effectiveness and the cost-effectiveness of medical devices for e-health (\u2026) but we look at what industry produces and everything that is in the Cochrane database or the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) database. We have many things that we can consider (\u2026). Now (that) we have a complete picture, we will ask experts nominated by the Commission, a panel of experts on healthcare systems, to look at this. They will cast a particular eye on the quality of the literature which is being produced.\u201d (Policy officer, 24/10/2013) Another concern after the analysis of the policy papers was that not all stakeholder groups\u2019 opinions and their knowledge were represented. In the quote above, the policy officer mentioned specifically that the EC looks at \u201cwhat industry produces and everything that is in the Cochrane database or the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) database\u201d, in order to get \u201ca complete picture\u201d. Whilst, there seems to be a focus on industry, it is left to wonder who is invited to be part of the panel of experts. Another researcher (2) pointed out, that the research group used a range of methods, including discussions with different stakeholders for the Forward Look on Telemedicine (European Science Foundation, 2012). In her opinion only one group was underrepresented in the discussions, namely economists: \u201cIt involved literature, desk based research that some of us had already done, some of which we did in the course of the Forward Look. We had a qualitative researcher who we paid to do interviews with stakeholders outside of Europe, because we focused on people in Europe. We had lots of discussions, scoping events and so on, where we constantly fed back what we had developed to ",
        "74 people who were in the field. Having said that, there is one group that was under represented among the people we worked with, and this was health economists.\u201d(Researcher 2, 16/12/2013) In the case researchers were consulted for their expert opinion, it is important to investigate how their knowledge and input were used in the policy making process. The researchers we interviewed, who work in policy relevant areas, raised the concern that it is often not clear to what extent their work is being considered in the policy making process: \u201cYes, I guess it is hard to know what impact. People come and talk to me and ask me questions and there would be almost a national conversation where they come and take your input. I would like to think that my input has been taken. I have contributed to say the FARSEEING project in Europe, which is a European framework grant . You give your input as an expert at that level and the hope is that somewhere downstream will inform policy \u201d (Researcher 1, 13/11/2013 \u2013 emphasis added.) Imaginaries of health trough wearable sensors and telemedicine In this section we look at the visions around WS technologies and e-health and how they match existing imaginaries of techno-science. Our interest was in comparing different visions, to check commonalities about the possible positive and negative impacts of the use of the WS technology. Some of the questions we asked were: To which problem are WS the solution? What was your motivation to engage with this topic? What sources of information did you use? What kind of impact did your work have? Which topics concerning WS are not sufficiently discussed on a political level? ",
        "75 One of the main themes in answering the question \u201cTo which problem WS are the solution?\u201d, was that the use of WS in healthcare corresponds to the need to improve the quality of care and at the same time decrease the costs of healthcare. A journalist and blogger to whom we talked argues that \u201cA Fitbit is a technological invention that is coming from a society with severe public health problems, and it is not likely to solve those severe public health problems, because it is just a typical American gadget. \u201c(Journalist, 25 th June 2013) In Europe, the rising costs of healthcare are a burning topic. One of the researchers interviewed works on a research project that develops applications to predict falls in elderly, assess mobility and gait function; he sustains that the use of WS is related to the idea that proactive medicine can reduce accidents and therefore reduce medical costs. \u201cThe motivation in that specific field is to try to identify who will fall, whose health is failing in advance and to be proactive and to try and intervene in some way. The idea is to bring down the cost of healthcare because you have been preventative and proactive\u201d (Researcher 1, 13/11/2013) Another aspect that is often mentioned in policy papers is that WS could improve care of people with chronic medical conditions. This could lead to a decrease in costs, but also to an improvement of quality of living for the patients. The policy maker that we interviewed suggested that: \u201cThere is a need to treat patients with chronic disease, in particular more and more at home instead of treating them in hospital. To do that, you need to be able to monitor them from their own place.\u201d (Policy officer, 24/10/2013) The idea of reduction of costs however is not proven so far. A study conducted by one of our interviewees showed that, the use of WS for health monitoring actually increased the number of medical visits and therefore lead on an increase in cost, without additional benefits for the patients. \u201cActually, the results are sometimes quite surprising. We had a small study on diabetics in one of the cities in Finland, where glycaemic control was monitored using an application. What happened ",
        "76 was that the patients who were monitoring their blood/glucose level themselves were using more healthcare services, but the end result was the same. They did not get any health benefit, but they used more services because when they noticed something problematic during their monitoring, they visited doctors and clinics. They used much more services, but they did not get any better outcomes than the other patients.\u201d (Researcher 3, 29/11/2013) This view is actually shared by the policy officer who admits that despite the EU strategy on e-health, whose objective is to reduce the costs of healthcare, the evidence of the savings potential is still missing. \u201cYou need to look at the overall strategy of the EU on the e health action plan. The objective of e- health to treat patients differently, notably in view of reducing cost. Whether we like it or not, it is the EU strategy. The problem with that is that we do not have strong evidence on whether e health really reduces cost and whether it brings clinical value for patients.\u201d (Policy officer, 24/10/2013 \u2013 emphasis added) The researcher does not rule out that the use of e-health could reduce costs in some instances. But in his perspective in most cases it is not the case. \u201cOf course, we have productivity issues, so e-health should make healthcare smoother and more efficient. It sometimes does this, but very often this does not happen. \u201c (Researcher 3, 29/11/2013) Another vision is that WS will allow gathering a greater amount of information, as well as getting access to more \u201caccurate\u201d information about a person\u2019s health status. In fact, the medical doctor we interviewed, argues: \u201cIn my view, WS provide a means to get more information , in contrast to what we do at the moment, which is what I call snapshot care. Whenever you have a problem, you contact your physician. You already have a problem, so you are not trying to prevent the problem. In between physician visits, nobody knows what is happening.\u201d (Medical doctor, 22/10/2013) ",
        "77 Furthermore he states that the information collected by the sensor is more accurate than a patient\u2019s memory. \u201cIf you want to know about the condition or the physiology of a patient in between physician visits, such as in everyday life, you have to ask the patient. We all know that patients do not give accurate history. We get objective information about their state of health when we use WS. We can get out of lab conditions in an unsupervised way.\u201d (Medical doctor, 22/10/2013) It has to be noted at this point that relying on sensors could have an effect on the perception of one\u2019s health in general, since it reduces a person\u2019s health to a few factors that can be measured by sensors; the device acts as a mediator reducing necessarily the self-reflection on potential problems or creating alarms about issues that would have never gathered attention weren\u2019t there a sensor. As the policy adviser points out, \u201cIt is the same with all the sensors that we are going to put into people, perhaps for good medical reasons. We have tiny sensors to sense one component of a complex system and we are going to infer all sorts of things from that one simple component. There will be a huge error rate, but because this comes from an instrument with a nice number associated with it, people will believe it.\u201d (Policy adviser, 14/08/2013) The medical doctor we have interviewed agrees that WS and tele-care cannot be a substitute for traditional healthcare: \u201cI used to be very critical about WS, but I have changed my view over the last few years. WS just provide part of our toolbox . We will never replace the physical person-to-person contact. This is not really our intention and we do not want to replace the nurse or physician, but rather to provide better information for a broader base of making better and more reliable decisions about the patient.\u201d (Medical doctor, 22/10/2013 \u2013 emphasis added) ",
        "78 Concerning the reliability and quality of the data from current devices, there is still a number of technical problems to be solved. According to the interviewed developers and IT researchers, WS are not measuring the data with desired accuracy, or it is not proven that they provide reliable outputs: \u201c\u2026 most devices do not work very well . That is part of the problem. Does it work? That is what I am saying. Where is the evidence that it actually works? It looks beautiful. You sell a nice device that looks good and it makes you feel good to wear it because you believe that this is making a difference. It is almost psychosomatic because you think the number is correct, but often the number is not correct.\u201d (Researcher 1, 13/11/2013 \u2013 emphasis added) It should be obvious however, that a distinction needs to be done between devices used for medical purposes and WS that are used for fitness tracking. As we write this paper there is an ongoing discussion at EU level about what constitutes a medical device, as many of these WS and also some \u2018apps\u2019 are imagined as such by users. Another important strong element of the narratives WS arrive to us with is that they are an empowering technology. But the medical doctor we have interviewed argues: \u201cAs part of the services that we have defined using WS, we can provide feedback with the information we have, which can improve patient self-management. We use the term 'patient empowerment' - I do not really believe that a patient can manage herself or himself completely alone, but this can provide support in the same way as using wearable devices when we go running.\u201d (Medical doctor, 22/10/2013 \u2013 emphasis added) Related to the concept of patient self-management and patient empowerment, there are three main issues. One regards responsibility and the two others regard missing face-to-face interaction with the doctor and increasing inequalities arising from almost inevitable digital divides. Patient self- ",
        "79 management goes hand in hand with a shift of tasks and responsibilities from the health care professional to the patient. \u201cThen of course there is the responsibility issue. When you increase efficiency, one doctor or one consultant probably handles more patients than he used to. Then if the contact is very vague, how is the responsibility then realised? Who is really responsible for the decision made on e-health applications?\u201d (Researcher 3, 29/11/2013) Many of the devices are intended for eldercare. As stated by one of the researchers we have interviewed, certain groups in society might have difficulty to use the devices. \u201cBasically, I would say most of the services that you have on the Internet are for the young or the educated, so that if you are really sick and old, many of the services that are provided by the Internet may be difficult for you to use. In this way, e-healthcare can actually increase inequalities because it makes healthcare accessible for some, but does not help those who probably need the services more.\u201d (Researcher 3, 29/11/2013 \u2013 emphasis added) As stated by a policy maker, e-health is encouraging alternatives to face-to-face relationships among citizens and professional carers because in his view \u201cwe need to\u201d. This, in our view, can be an outright ethical issue. \u201cI do not know whether it is an ethical issue or not. However, it is true that if we promote mobile health, we are also promoting a non-systematic face-to-face relationship between the patient or the consumer and the doctor. I do not know whether it is an ethical issue but anyway we need to move towards this new way of delivering healthcare. That can be an ethical issue for some people. \u201c (Policy maker, 24/10/2013 \u2013 emphasis added) Also, related to the idea of empowering patients, the question arises of whether citizens will be able to choose the healthcare they wish to enrol with. If they are in some way obliged to use e-health services, this practice can hardly be seen as empowering. ",
        "80 \u201cWe all celebrate participation and empowered patients and so on. We want patients to be partners in decision making, but we need to make sure that this participation remains an opportunity . It must not become a burden or a duty to people.\u201d (Researcher 2, 16/12/2013 \u2013 emphasis added) In addition to the mentioned contrasting visions on WS for healthcare, there are a number of other ethical issues that were pointed out by our interviewees, which are not reflected in the policy papers and official communications and strategies of the EC. One issue that was mentioned by several interviewees is their concern for privacy. \u201cThere are several problems associated with these devices, one of which is the privacy issue. We will know much more about a person's mental and disease state and therefore we will be able to hire or fire or associate with people depending upon what we think we are seeing from the sensors. That is not permitted in most countries, at least in the Western world, but that will not stop people from doing it.\u201d (Policy adviser, 14/08/2013) Privacy in this case is intrinsically related to healthcare insurance schemes and in the view our interviewees could constitute a major normalisation of our health and therefore an ethical issue. \u201cThe only big concern I have is around health insurance (\u2026) If we know everything about you from the day that you are born, we will know what burden you will be on the health system (\u2026) It goes against the whole idea of insurance, which is the unknown that as a herd, we insure each other and some people will be unlucky and others will be lucky. Together we will cover the cost, but when you start to get more information about people and the premium changes - you can see it all happen. Some will be very heavily disadvantaged because they have a poor health condition and there is nothing they can do about it.\u201d (Researcher 1, 13/11/2013) Moreover, the issue of privacy leads to issues of property, autonomy and agency; for example, who owns the data from these devices? This issue is not new at all; for example, in the famous case of Henrietta Lacks in the 1950\u2019s (see Skoot 2010) and that of John Moore in the 1990s (see Moore v. ",
        "81 Regents of the University of California (51 Cal. 3d 120; 271 Cal. Rptr. 146; 793 P.2d 479)) with regards to property rights of their body materials and participation in research (see e.g. Tallacchini 2015 for a discussion of these two cases). The members of the quantified-self movement, for example, claim the right to own and also to analyse their own data. Medical data could be sold for money, but this option constitutes an ethical issue in the view of this interviewee: \u201cIn terms of owning and having access to other people\u2019s data , there are ethical dilemmas. However, that is going back to privacy, security and data ownership and is the same old story that I have been talking about. If somebody else helps you collect data and not only owns the data but also tries to make money out of it either anonymously or not, as in anonymising the data or not, for me that is an ethical issue because if you do not know where the data is going and what people will be doing with it, terms and conditions can be changed at will, as is often done. That is quite a big ethical issue for me.\u201d (Representative of grassroots organisation, 28/11/2013 \u2013 emphasis added) According to the policy maker we have interviewed, the use of medical data for marketing purposes is currently in debate. The EC proposal for data protection states that the data should only be used for medical purposes. \u201cThere is an emerging issue that everybody talks about. It concerns the re-usability of all the data which will be generated by these devices, for marketing and non-marketing purposes (\u2026) That can be a big societal or ethical issue, because you gather a huge amount of data (...).You can look at Article 81 of the Commission\u2019s proposal for data protection regulations. It clearly states that these data should not be re-used for purposes other than health research and health promotion. It should not be used for insurance or banking purposes. \u201d (Policy officer, 24/10/ 2013) But in times where the \u201copen everything\u201d paradigm is being herald as a key for restoration of trust, what kind of governance will protect existing rights and norms? This brings us to the issue of ",
        "82 regulation. Given the numerous ethical issues and uncertainties associated with present and future uses of WS, some of the people that we interviewed called for a need for more regulation. \u201cI definitely think there is a need for a legal framework for telemedicine . First of all, unless it is regulated, companies will market and install services that probably are not adequate or safe. Then we also have the privacy issue. People should control the use of their sensitive health data. There is definitely a need for a legal framework for that.\u201d (Researcher 3, 29/11/2013) A legal framework will have to address the question of whether WS for fitness purposes are regarded as medical devices or not. \u201cThis is the regulatory issue at stake. Are these WS, apps or devices considered as medical devices or are they to be considered as consumer products. At this stage, they are considered medical devices in the legislation. On the other hand, in other cases, they are followed up or monitored as consumer products. Regarding what you have explained to me now, the information in these sensors measures health issues, which are important. Therefore, they should then be considered as medical devices. They should then be regulated as medical devices with CE marking and so on. \u201c(Policy maker, 24/10/2013) A researcher argues that commercial WS for fitness purposes should be subject to the regulations if they claim to provide a health benefit. \u201c\u2026It is okay to sell them for people to use as entertainment, but if you are really claiming that it provides health benefits, then you should have to have the same type of proof that you have for medicines, medical devices or medical procedures. You have to have medical data and studies to show that something could happen if people start to use these things. Many of the health application type of data is missing.\u201d (Researcher 3, 29/11/2013) Discussion Knowledge Assessment and Epistemic Networks ",
        "83 In the earlier sections we see that the epistemic network is quite active on producing different types of knowledge about the development and use of WS for health related issues. There are clear nodes on policy, industry, academia and citizens organisations. A great deal of promises (resulting on expectations) is made through the policy documents (including the research calls sponsored by the EC) and industry papers looked at in this paper. For example, in policy papers we have found a great deal of lack of references for rather important claims, self-referencing within and across few nodes of the epistemic networks, reference to poorly conduced studies and other types of practice that make knowledge claims amenable to scepticism. Our analysis also suggests that the strong nodes of epistemic network are businesses and industry behind WS. A great deal of the knowledge used in policy papers come from industry and not so much from citizen led projects (e.g. \u201cquantified movement\u201d, etc.); in fact, industry is leading the experience of WS in health and wellness through their purposeful interactive platforms, collecting not only data but also the qualitative experience of users (e.g. fitbit maintains a blog among users that share their experience through a myriad of threads). By assessing knowledge production loci, one can also see that there are disconnects between what the imagination of the current and future uses of these sensors. There are several spontaneous experiments of self-care, self-veillance both by industry but also by citizen movements, where it is unlikely that professional monitoring of what the impacts of these objects are in received notions of care, health and wellness are being carried out \u2013 with what criteria anyway? As with other technological developments put out there with a narrative, WS are also the object of unanticipated appropriations both by institutions and citizens; \u201cdo it yourself\u201d, makers, hackers movements are doing their own thing whilst the healthcare establishment is also looking into the opportunities. The views that we have presented through the in-depth interviews with different social actors show a great number of disconnects, not only with regards to different imaginations of the role and ",
        "84 function of these devices with regards to health and healthcare, but also with regards to supporting evidence that these devices can deliver what they are expected to. While some researchers that we interviewed had provided their advice to EC policy makers, they were unsure about to what extent their input had made a difference to the policy making process. As in the policy papers we looked at, many claims have no references or include a reference to a EU institution it is difficult to see where the information came from in the first place. Moreover, besides the disconnect of different epistemic networks, there is a lack of research on the impact of wearable devices and e-health on society. The vision that it is being put forward on the policy level develops in specific spheres but the deeper meanings are not being adequately scrutinized or are scattered around, not really being given a lot of attention in specific loci. Predominant imaginaries and their contradictions WS and e-health (or m-health) are certainly part of the techno-scientific imaginary that precludes that through technology health and healthcare issues can be fixed. This salvific role of technology is visible through the discourses of patient empowerment, effective and efficient healthcare and improved certainty (i.e. better and more complete health related data which imply better diagnosis and cures). Moreover, it appears as an imperative as we have seen earlier, in both policy papers but also in the words of At the same time there are a number of unknowns and concerns, expressed in different ways by different members of the epistemic network, such as unresolved ethical issues, namely with privacy, inequalities, namely with digital divide, or new ideas of care where face-to-face interaction is substituted with digital interfaces. In addition a number of uncertainties about quality of data and data ownership, responsibility, inadequacy of current regulation, besides the actual economic effectiveness of deployment of these types of sensors for health purposes add on challenges. ",
        "85 These \u2018simple\u2019 devices are designed and delivered to us with a narrative of the meanings of \u2018healthy\u2019, the meanings of what needs to be shared and what needs to be measured, how we should be ageing and also how our wellness, happiness and health are better dealt with through digital smart artefacts. The WS that are the focus of our research are not (yet) medical devices, but in a number of the discourses that we have analysed they are suggested to become integral part of the medical practice, preventative medicine, personalised medicine, mobile health, cure and care. All current narratives for the EU place science and technology at the heart of its future but also its identity 13 ; for some time the EU has been associated with the term innovation. In fact, \u201cinnovation\u201d is presented in a salvific role, used to justify and encourage techno-science development. WS are part of that answer that is still looking for the questions.

Quality of health and healthcare through wearable sensors Lucia Vesnic-Alujevic, European Commission, Joint Research Centre Melina Breitegger, European Commission, Joint Research Centre \u00c2ngela Guimar\u00e3es Pereira , European Commission, Joint Research Centre Abstract Wearable sensors are an integral part of the new telemedicine concept that concurs with the idea that Information Technologies will improve the quality and efficiency of healthcare. The use of the sensors in diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of patients not only potentially changes medical practice but also one\u2019s relationship with one\u2019s body and mind, besides the role and responsibilities of patients and healthcare professionals. In this paper, we focus on knowledge assessment of the online communities of Fitbit (a commercial wearable device) and the Quantified Self movement . Through their online forums , we investigate how users\u2019 knowledge claims, shared experiences and imaginations about wearable sensors interrogate or confirm the narratives through which they are introduced to the publics. Citizen initiatives like the quantified self- movement claim the right to \u2018own\u2019 the sensor generated data. But how these data can be used through traditional healthcare systems is an open question. More importantly, wearable sensors trigger a social function that is transformative of the current idea of care and health care, focused on sharing, socialisation and collective reflection about individual problems. Whether this is aligned with current policy making about healthcare, which narrative is centred on efficiency and productivity, is to be seen. ",
        "90 \u2018When behaviours and body functions are digitalised as quantifiable data, indicators and concepts of health and fitness become narrow representations of these phenomena\u2019 (Lupton, 2014, p. 5) Wearable sensors at crossroads: the technology and healthcare policies Medical sensors have a long history of usage in medicine and healthcare (Wilson, 1999; Aberg et al., 2002; Ko et al., 2010). Wearable sensors are portable devices that collect specific data of the body, for example blood glucose levels, heart rate or movement. They are used for fitness and/or health purposes and are often advertised as the devices that will motivate people to exercise more, help losing weight and so on. In parallel, various studies (Pantelopoulos and Bourbakis, 2010) have been conducted for assessing the usefulness of these devices in healthcare, by providing real-time information about a person\u2019s health while the patient and medical doctor are not at the same place. They usually monitor heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, respiration rate, etc., being available as small wearable sensors, wearable material, smart textile or implantable sensors. The systems work through a user interface to algorithms through which personal data will be extracted and processed (Pantelopoulos and Bourbakis, Op. cit. ). During the past decade wearable sensors became very popular, because the healthcare costs increased and the ageing society has become a serious problem (Shah, 2009). The new technology appeared as deus ex machina for policy makers who saw in it the resolution for high prices of traditional healthcare. Wearable sensors are often seen through imaginaries of preventive care that will help people transform their unhealthy lives. At the same time, Ayo (2012) argues that the amount of health policies that focus on health promotion throughout the world has considerably increased in the last 30 years, as a consequence of ",
        "91 neoliberalism and the so-called \u2018healthism\u2019 14 , a new lifestyle where individuals become obsessed with their own health and consciously work on it. This contributes to the vision that a responsible citizen should fit in lifestyles, heralded as healthy (Ayo, 2012:100). Today, the Internet represents a great space where people search for different information. Among others, they search for help when they are faced with certain health issues, especially if traditional medicine does not offer a satisfying answer to their problems. In this paper we will look at the Fitbit and Quantified Self forums, where users of Fitbit and different wearable and self-tracking devices discuss diverse issues, including health-related technicalities, and others, developing into a community around those topics. Fitbit is a small wearable device produced by a US-based company with a global reach, founded in 2007, with the mission of empowering and inspiring people \u2018to live a healthier, more active life\u2019 as written in their mission statement. Through the use of Fitbit, the daily steps walked and floors climbed are monitored. Therefore, the Fitbit is a device for any person to increase physical activity in order to lose weight. Additional features are sleep monitoring (the tracking of movement during the sleep) and the possibility to compare calories consumed and calories burned. The Fitbit user is asked to wear the device 24/7, insert food consumption and activities other than walking, as well mood swings in a cloud-based online platform. As a result the user can see charts with information on daily activity, resting, eating and compare the data over a time span and see how \u2018fit\u2019 he or she is compared to other Fitbit users. The Fitbit company suggests every user to eat a specific amount of calories and to walk 10 000 steps a day in order to reach one\u2019s personal goal of weight loss. The fitness formula can be described as: eat less, walk more, sleep well and don\u2019t forget to drink 2 litres a 14 A term created by political economist Robert Crawford (1980) to describe the political ideology promoted in the USA in the 1970s where health is transferred to the level of individuals. Skrabanek (1994) uses it to describe the government\u2019s promotion of, and attempt to establish, a healthy lifestyle. Ayo (2012) describes healthism as a new lifestyle where individuals become obsessed with their own health and consciously work on its improvement through the combination of wellness and fitness programs (such as, e.g. Jane Fonda\u2019s workout videos in the 1980s).

        "92 day. This is an example of what Foucault refers to as the technologies and practices of the self, where the agency of the subject to influence their own bodies, thoughts etc. is accentuated \u2018as to transform themselves in order to attain a certain state of happiness, purity, wisdom, perfection, or immortality\u2019 (Foucault, 1988:18). Behavioural change is supposed to happen as a result of self-tracking. Self-tracking means systematically recording and analysing the information about one\u2019s own health, diet or different activities, by using technology in obtaining the data. It is mostly connected to the use of wearable sensors that serve for data gathering. Fitbit is an example of such devices. The Quantified Self is a US company that supports a world-wide community of users and makers of self-tracking tools which describe themselves as a movement. In an interview we made in 2013, Adriana Lukas, the organiser of QS meetings in London, says: \u2018There are no institutions or businesses involved but just individuals doing things because they are trying to solve a problem, and that is one of the most important points about quantified self that I can give you.\u2019 Although it is not completely clear how the \u2018movement\u2019 and the company link together, it is interesting to note however, that the coordinator of the UK movement does wish to pass the message that this is an initiative that is grounded on actual needs from people and that there are no institutions involved. In a lecture on self-tracking 15 , Anne Wright, the leader of the Body Track project 16 , argues that self- tracking is useful because medical solutions that fit the majority do not fit everyone. The context is relevant for the health of an individual as well as trying different strategies before choosing the right one. According to her, self-tracking is also helpful for finding the cause of a certain condition that a diagnosis does not reveal. Taking an action based on our own experience can be more powerful than doing it on your doctor\u2019s recommendation. 15 Wright, Anne. 2014. \u2018Self-tracking. Reflections from the Body Track project\u2019. Lecture at European Commission Joint Research Centre Ispra. 24 March 2014. 16 The Body Track project is a self-tracking open source project that will be available to everyone for free . ",
        "93 In other words, self-tracking helps us understand what is going on with our body and how in order to make better (first-class) choices. The main principles used by users are observe-hypothesise-act- reflect-adjust-iterate. The main argument for writing down (inserting in a program) all the data is that patterns are hard to recollect from memory, and in that sense self-trackers are constructing their personal narrative (Remen, 2006). Wearable sensors start as an extension of human senses but ultimately they seem to be designed to substitute them. Digital technologies are considered to be global and pervasive. Digital health has been critically studied from different perspectives, including social, cultural, political and ethical dimensions by various scholars (e.g. Ayo, 2012; Wright and Halse, 2014). Lupton (2014) argues that new technologies are \u2018intensely political\u2019 (p. 2) and change power relations as they easily influence social relations and institutions, which leaves place for new digital inequalities and new space for surveillance. Deleuze (1990) states that in contemporary \u2018societies of control\u2019, the power lays in technologies, which multiply the possibilities for controlling our freedom that goes beyond Foucauldian model of the \u2018panopticon\u2019 such as with the IoT proposal. New devices and apps provide new ways of self-monitoring and measuring and sharing our data with others who use these devices. The Internet also facilitates the access to health information to lay audience, with the Pew Research Centre stating that 8 in 10 Americans online look for their health information on the internet (Lupton, 2014). These and similar practices \u2018persuade individuals to monitor themselves and others by increasing their knowledge around food and health and by instructing them on how to change their lives by eating healthily and staying active\u2019 (Wright & Halse, 2014, p. 839). At the same time, the possibilities to monitor people through their data collected from the Internet today are greater than ever. Consequently the consumer marketing obtains a very individualistic approach, tailored to the individual characteristics and \u2018to monitor their bodies, behaviours and ",
        "94 geolocation at any time of the day or night using digital tracking systems\u2019 (Lupton, 2014, p. 5). In the neo-liberal tradition where self-tracking can be seen as self-governing, it becomes \u2018a strategy for producing responsible citizens who take care of their own health consistent with state objectives\u2019 (Till, 2013). Lupton (2014) argues that users participate in a corporatised context where the developers decide how data are generated, manipulated and used and can prevent users from accessing their own data (p. 7). Although we agree with the potential for control and surveillance through self-tracking apps and devices, we argue that these sites also offer new possibilities for resistance, especially when users are producing their own methods and means for self-tracking, as explained by Anne Wright in her project. Patient-driven healthcare can also be seen as an extension of traditional healthcare models and patient empowerment as some scholars have suggested (Swan, 2009). Knowledge assessment: quality of knowledge through wearable sensors We will introduce here two concepts that have been used in our research, \u2018knowledge assessment\u2019 as a means to scrutinise knowledge produced in loci other than the scientific realm and \u2018extended peer review\u2019 the process by which relevant knowledge applied to address a particular issue is scrutinised. Knowledge assessment (see Funtowicz, 2006) activities aim at scrutinising the quality of the processes of knowledge creation and its products deployed to underpin action. It must be noted that \u2018knowledge\u2019 here does not map onto \u2018scientific knowledge\u2019, but includes types of knowledge created in different spheres of life and experience. In this context, the existing quality control in research science cannot be applied. The evaluation of quality of knowledge in terms of fitness for purpose (quality being a relational attribute) is the core of knowledge assessment activities. But who determines what is fit for purpose? The concept of \u2018extended peer community\u2019 as articulated by ",
        "95 Funtowicz and Ravetz on their descriptions of post-normal science 17 is relevant here. The concept emerges from the recognition that for current types of policy-relevant science, the maintenance of scientific quality depends on open dialogue between all those affected. Today, encouraged by the online opportunities, \u2018those affected\u2019 combine their current knowledge with creative and experienced \u2018extended facts\u2019 in order to actively scrutinise and influence what is being proposed to them. This can be seen in all sorts of endeavours, where an increasing number of issues are raised outside the traditionally accepted as legitimate and credible spheres, be that about a health policy issue (see for example the Cochrane collaboration) or crowdfunding activities to develop or implement some \u2018do-it-yourself\u2019 proposal (see e.g. kickstarter or goteo). In this paper, we are extending knowledge assessment activities to processes of technology development in which meanings and issues related to technology deployment do not emerge through a formal policy cycle but rather arise in organised fora of discussion among users communities (the \u2018extended community\u2019) of technological artefacts, such as wearable sensors technology. The categories for assessing the quality of the debates within users communities will focus on knowledge produced through experiences, opinions, skill developments, etc., documented by users\u2019 interactions. Here, we will borrow the \u2018pedigree\u2019 of the quantitative information concept first developed by Ravetz and Funtowicz (1990) in their NUSAP system 18 and then later extended by Corral Quintana (2000) to qualitative information. Pedigree \u2018is an evaluative description of the mode of production (and where relevant, of anticipated use) of the information\u2019 (Funtowicz and Ravetz, ib idem). This means asking questions, such as: who is making statements? Where does the information come from? Who is listening? What legitimacy or credibility mechanisms are sought? Etc. 17 Post-normal science is a concept, attempting to characterise a methodology of inquiry that is appropriate for cases where \u2018facts are uncertain, values in dispute, stakes high and decisions urgent\u2019; it was first described in relation to environmental issues but its application has since been extended to other areas of policy. 18 NUSAP is a notational system proposed by Funtowicz and Ravetz (1990), which provides an analysis and diagnosis of uncertainty in science for policy. It captures both quantitative and qualitative dimensions of uncertainty and enables one to display these in a standardised and self-explanatory way. It promotes criticism by clients and users of all sorts, expert and lay and will thereby support extended peer-review processes. ",
        "96 In this paper we look at wearable sensors-users communities\u2019 discussions in order to assess the quality of knowledge created and shared about wearable sensors in connection to health and healthcare issues. Chasing the pedigree \u2026 In order to apply knowledge assessment methodologies in the context of user online communities, we have chosen and tried a well-known branded device, the Fitbit, which is an instance of wearable sensors announced with health benefits and lifestyles monitoring purposes: a smart \u2018trackers\u2019 family member. We looked at the online Fitbit users communities\u2019 discourses focusing on the quality of knowledge produced and shared about wearable sensors in that context. The forum of the online users\u2019 community has a huge number of entries around a myriad of topics, but they are grouped by topic. At the same time and separately from Fitbit, the Quantified Self movement has a similar online forum where self-trackers gather as an online community where they discuss various topics in a similar way to Fitbit users. Conducting our research in both forums allowed us to dissociate from a particular gadget and focus more on the self-tracking aspects, as the QS movement is not associated with any particular brand. As we were mainly looking at the users\u2019 posts in order to capture elements for knowledge quality assessment, a progressive focus was done around chosen themes that could best exemplify the knowledge assessment application. As introduced earlier, in our study we focused on the analysis of \u2018pedigree\u2019 of qualitative information. A number of quality categories were seen as appropriate for the type of material available from the user community forum. Having the quality categories in mind we looked for framings, factual or imagined argumentation, justifications, motivations, suggestions, appeals, assumptions and other narrative elements in the stories shared in those posts. ",
        "97 Two main quality categories were deemed appropriate for evaluating information pedigree in community forum: fitness for purpose and reliability. Table 1 summarises categories and subcategories. Table 1. Analysed categories and subcategories Category Subcategory Observations Fitness for purpose 1) Relevance: correspondence between information used and issues addressed 2) Accuracy of information 3) Comprehensiveness of information here we look at strategies by users to ensure information provided fits intended objectives of discussions started Reliability 1) Sources of information to support knowledge claims 2) Sources of legitimacy here we look at strategies used by participants to legitimise information \u2018offered\u2019 We used explorative quantitative and qualitative analysis of the content posted first on Fitbit forum and later on Quantified Self forum. This analysis is followed by more in-depth qualitative analysis where knowledge assessment was used. Mapping the topics In this section we present the most commented topics in the forums we have analysed, grouped into several categories for further analysis. a. Fitbit forum ",
        "98 Fitbit offers its users access to a user community forum where people can exchange their experiences and ask for advice from other users. The forum is structured in six groups: Announcements, Big Losers, Food suggestions, Feature suggestions, General, and Help and Support. The \u2018Big Losers\u2019 category is for discussions of users that are trying to lose or have lost 75 pounds/34 kilos or more. In the \u2018Food suggestions\u2019 and \u2018Feature suggestions\u2019 categories, users are asked to provide input for the food database of Fitbit and for the development of features of the Fitbit device. By mapping the topics discussed in all the different groups, taking into account all the topics that were commented in a time period of 10 weeks (30.4.2013-9.7.2013), we could identify 15 categories of topics. In total 374 topics were posted in the named time period (Table 2). Table 2. Fitbit forum Category Number of topics Topic examples Building communities/finding friends 137 \u2018Hello from Seattle WA!\u2019, \u2018Group Wanted/Woman, Late 40s/100 to lose\u2019, \u2018Guys talking about Guy Stuff and Getting Fit\u2019 Asking for advice from the community 78 \u2018Need a person to teach me what I\u2019m doing wrong to get this weight off\u2019, \u2018What to eat before work out\u2019, \u2018Frustrated and want some advice\u2019 ",

They are looking for other Fitbit users in a nearby geographical location (\u2018Hello from Seattle WA!\u2019), users with the same weight loss goal and other common issues (for example \u2018Group Wanted/Woman, Late 40s/100 to lose\u2019 or \u2018Guys talking about Guy Stuff and Getting Fit\u2019) or just search friends in general who can support them by losing weight \u2018together\u2019. Another large amount of topics are centred on advice on weight loss. The Fitbit users ask their fellow users\u2019 advice on dieting, exercise and how to stay motivated (\u2018Need a person to teach me what I\u2019m doing wrong to get this weight off\u2019, \u2018What to eat before work out\u2019, \u2018Frustrated and want some advice\u2019). Many people also use the community forum to communicate their personal experience, without directly asking for advice or support. Mostly these ",
        "100 posts are related to successful weight loss or increased fitness (for example: \u2018I have lost over 100 lbs!\u2019, \u2018Just hit my first goal\u2019). The suggestions for improvement of Fitbit are mostly focused on design, the development of the food database (where users can log their food in order to calculate the daily calorie intake), and technical features. The latter concerns for example the possibility to synchronise the Fitbit with smart phones and other tracking devices and to include additional features like bar code scanning to make food monitoring easier. b. Quantified Self forum The Quantified Self forum is structured in 16 topics, with the greatest number of posts in the following threads: Apps & Tools, QS Open Forum, Sleep, Learning and Cognition. We mapped the topics discussed in different threads by taking into account all the topics commented in the period of 10 weeks (27.1.2014-6.4.2014). We have identified 10 categories of topics. In total 124 topics were posted in the named time period (Table 3). Table 3. Quantified Self forum Category Number of topics Topic examples Building communities/finding friends 8 Hi everyone, Hello from Grand Bay Posts by QS 3 A new tool guide for the QS Community?

Help UW Researchers! Sharing information 4 Sun sensor Buy/sell 1 Seeking 10 Fitbit Flexes Experiments 2 Nootropics?; QS Experiment As we can see from the Table 3, the majority of posts are connected to asking the advice and sharing the experience with others. There are also a considerable number of calls to participate in research, launched by independent research institutions or companies, but this remains out of our scope. The QS forum is less used to find friends and more to exchange ideas on specific topics. Instead of losing weight together, the main issue is how to use or further develop self-tracking tools, the self- experiments, sharing experience with the others and asking for the advice on how to proceed with the experiment/self-tracking that they are conducting. Instead of adding friends in a social network like in the Fitbit community, the quantified self-movement organises \u2018official\u2019 meetings in locations where there are enough people involved in the movement. An interesting feature that the QS forum contains is the number of views, shown along with the number of comments. For instance, although the \u2018Zeo shutting down: export your data\u2019-thread contains 305 replies, it has at the same time 59 027 views. Similarly the thread \u2018Try my latest sleep hack\u2019 has only one comment but 13 336 views. ",
        "102 Quality in the Quantified \u2018self\u2019 We analysed comments posted on both forums in the selected time period from a qualitative perspective using knowledge assessment. First, we will present the results from Fitbit forum and then from Quantified Self. At the end of this section we provide a table with main types of quality issues that arise from the analysis of both forums. a. Fitbit In our analysis we have focused on forum entries and threads that included some form of suggestion for improvement of the wearable sensor technology both in functional and usage terms, as well as contributions to or quests for improvement of the knowledge base associated with the use of \u2018Fitbit\u2019 types of technology. We are exemplifying below the types of strategies used by participants to contribute to the threads we chose to analyse more in-depth: \u2018health at any size\u2019, \u2018non-wireless option\u2019, \u2018smoking log\u2019, \u20181 750 C/day deficit \u2026\u2019. 1) In some threads forum members make connections between \u2018Fitbit\u2019 technology to wider issues of health and initiate wider discussions about the place of wearable sensors in healthy lifestyle and health in general, interrogating different meanings of this technology. In the following posts the users bring on different arguments. \u2018Health at Every Size is a health program developed by a doctor (more about her here: http://www.lindabacon.org/about.html). Basically, instead of obsessing over what the scale says, it recommends focusing on actual health \u2014 fitness, eating a healthy diet, and relearning how to listen to what our bodies actually want to eat. A few years ago, the creator of HAES did a head-to-head study with a pro-dieting scientist, and the HAES group not only got a lot healthier than the dieting group, but kept the weight they lost off more successfully too.\u2019 \u2014 \u2018Health at any size\u2019 thread of Fitbit community \u2014 User 1HAES. And in a response from one of the users, the wider connection to health is further discussed: ",
        "103 \u2018I had never heard of HAES until this post, but based on your explanation in a previous post, I definitely support that philosophy in my life. (\u2026) I have more energy and feel better about my own body because I know I\u2019m treating it better than I was in the past. Our family is moving away from GMOs and processed foods in an effort to take this journey toward health as far as we feel is right for us. What I really like about my Fitbit is that since I have started logging my food (early July), I have a much healthier relationship with food.\u2019 \u2014 \u2018Health at any size\u2019 thread of Fitbit community \u2014 response to User 1HAES. In the HAES thread the users, for example, discuss the use of weight as indicator of health giving different perspectives from their own experience. For example in this quote: \u2018I have been under medical supervision for most of my life for a multitude of medical conditions. I have found that when it comes to weight, BMI, etc. that whether it is a useful tool or a simple cop out really depends on the doctor.

And in response to the latter post another user writes: \u2018Linda: it\u2019s important to remember that correlation does not guarantee causation. While it\u2019s accepted that weight correlates with heart disease, stroke, and diabetes it\u2019s not the weight that causes those things \u2014 it\u2019s typically the underlying lifestyle or genetic factors that contribute to both.\u2019 None of these claims are documented with references to scientific or other authoritative material.

        "104 2) In many entries to the richer debates, we can see competent observations and motivated suggestions, sometimes using specialised knowledge given the participants\u2019 professional walks of life intervening with mixed \u2018hats\u2019, sometimes attempting to legitimise their entries through the professional hat \u2014 replying as a pharmacist, for example. The quotes below illustrate this observation where users make suggestions reasoning in terms of health, legal, practical terms, in some the authoritative element being played out. \u2018I\u2019d like to see a wireless-free option.

(\u2026) I agree that BMI is not a scam, but it can be used in scammy ways. Many of the people who use it in scammy ways are laymen, though . I\u2019ve seen more people delude themselves about their BMI than I\u2019ve seen doctors scam patients, but I do work with cardiac patients so my patient population is a bit skewed. I was surprised when I started at the number of cardiac patients who think they are normal weight and are clearly not (\u2026). That\u2019s why I weigh daily. I know what weight I should be.\u2019 \u2014 \u2018Health at any size\u2019 thread of Fitbit community \u2014 response to User 1HAES; this one introduces herself as a pharmacist. ",

For example, on the \u2018smoking log thread\u2019 a suggestion for functionality that monitors quit smoking is made and many forum users have responded with personal experience to what most see as an improvement: \u2018I, like many others have joined the Fitbit community in an effort to improve my overall health. (\u2026) for those of us phasing this nasty habit [smoking] out of our lives (a lot more difficult than you might think), seeing and tracking this activity should help make us confront the unhealthy habit, and conversely inspire us to improve that particular data point . The feature \u2026. By seeing the relevant data points, I believe it would be quite helpful to many.\u2019 Smoking Log thread of Fitbit community.

When I started logging my food on this site I noticed that the protein/fat/carb ratio that I was eating was all wrong.

She also ran one of the really important clinical trials in the field, \u2026\u2019 \u2014 \u2018Health at any size\u2019 thread of Fitbit community \u2014 response to User 1HAES. \u2018Read Why We Get Fat and What We Can to About it by Gary Taubes \u2014 It will give you a whole new understanding of the calorie in and calorie out theory and why that may not always work.\u2019 1 750 C/day\u2026 thread of Fitbit community \u2014 response to User 11750C. 6) In other cases those who follow the thread ask for evidence in the form of further information or references, most likely because they wonder about the plausibility of the assertions. Hence, the strategies for quality assurance of what is discussed and offered are sometimes following the traditional schemes of quality control in science etc. For example, regarding the health at any size thread, a user requests specifically peer-reviewed publications, considering other sources irrelevant and illegitimate: ",
        "108 \u2018I\u2019m also sceptical of the above claims about the HAES vs. other diets study.

Quantified Self 1) The QS forum is somewhat different to the Fitbit one. The section with the most comments is \u2018Apps & Tools\u2019. It is used by QS members, but also by developers that want to get feedback on new apps. Some of the QS forum members participate in creating/designing apps or devices that can help self-tracking (as well as the platforms, as we have seen in the Body Track project): \u2018A few months ago a neuroscientist with a focus on sleep approached me to help him make an app that leverages a new scientific finding: playing specific frequencies of sounds during deep sleep can enhance deep sleep. The app is just now available on the App Store! I\u2019d be really happy to get some feedback from QSers. We are going to conduct a formal study with it \u2014 so let me know also if you\u2019d be interested in testing it out and verifying that it improves your sleep and alertness. Just shoot me an e-mail and I will provide you with instructions\u2019 Test out a new app for sleep improvement thread of QS community User dgartenberg. ",
        "109 2) Some entries ask for further information, reference or clarification to what was previously posted: \u2018Do you have more background information that you can post here? Portland\u2019s QS group is planning to do a meet up focused on sleep, might be worth checking out?\u2019 Test out a new app for sleep improvement thread of QS community \u2014 response to User EJain. 3) In some cases further references are given, either after self-testing, by referring to relevant literature or studies conducted in the same field or giving some examples: \u2018Hi Eric! Basically, the app measures sleep similar to how sleep cycle does it \u2014 by placing the phone on your bed and measuring your body movement. Based on your sleep stage we play auditory stimulation sounds that prime, in particular, deep sleep.

By talking about their health problems and self-experimentations, they try to solve the medical problem they have by different (un) verified methods and often ask for help of others based on their experience and consequently share their own problems and experiences. After listening to the experience of others, they make a conclusion about their own conditions: \u2018Every morning, I wake up with one nostril almost completely congested, and the other free. Is this normal? (\u2026) I went to four doctors about \u2026. Of course, this is highly dubious \u2014 why wasn\u2019t I ",

If I have a cold, this will occasionally happen. I always \u2026.\u2019 Poll: how often do you wake up with a nostril congested? Thread of QS community \u2014 response to User Izzy Merritt. \u2018Thanks everyone for their replies, and looking forward for more. It seems like I have a rare-ish condition. \u2026. I\u2019ll have to quantify how that works . I\u2019ve been almost completely off carbs for the past week already and no improvement yet, but there have been some carbs. And cheese. Here\u2019s something odd about my congestion: \u2026\u2019 Poll: how often do you wake up with a nostril congested?

This quote illustrates the emerging idea of Do-It-Yourself medicine. \u2018 Final result : it negatively affects my sleep, d = \u2013 1.1. For comparison, most improvements score less than 0.5.

        "111 Discussion and conclusion In this paper we have used knowledge assessment methodologies and in particular pedigree analysis, to perform a quality check of knowledge produced by user communities of wearable sensors. We have looked into two different forums that respond to the ideas of self-care and DIY health; one forum associated to a well-known branded sensor and another forum of a self-organised community that is not linked to a particular wearable sensor brand. This approach allowed us to assess the quality of information posted online where users discuss their own experiences, experimentations, make suggestions to others, etc. We have considered two main categories to look at the threads and individual posts: fitness for purpose and reliability of information exchanged, including the strategies through which individuals seek to communicate their learning, to make credible their knowledge claims, to justify their assumptions and to make plausible their own heuristics. Users are here seen as part of the \u2018extended peer community\u2019 that actively debate, examine and decide upon scientific or technological issues that have been proposed to them by corporations and public institutions, being it health or regulatory related. Table 4 illustrates the kinds of findings out of this analysis, summarising the results obtained through the analysis of both forums showing the main types of quality issues arising from the analysis of the forum discussions. Table 4. Summary of quality issues arising from the analysis of the two forums. Category F i t n e s s f o r p u r p o s e Relevance Fitbit and QS: all posts that we have analysed are relevant for the issue raised in the first place. Accuracy Fitbit and QS: different levels of accuracy are encountered, but in general posts are not well ",
        "112 documented and are basically auto-ethnographic; no verification is possible. Comprehensiveness Fitbit: many of the entries are not well documented; in some cases important claims are made but they are not developed neither supported by traditional science nor by \u2018extended facts\u2019. QS: many entries are documented with self- experimentation. R e l i a b i l i t y Sources of information Fitbit and QS: typical sources are: \u2014 auto-ethnographies \u2014 web pages of organisations or commercial \u2014 books \u2014 media pieces In many cases references are asked for; other times many claims go unverified but obviously it is not clear what the users do with the information. The majority of QS sources are auto- ethnographies. Sources of legitimacy Fitbit and QS : the majority of users do not use any form of authoritative strategy apart from ",
        "113 their own lived experienced to reply in the threads; Some users introduce themselves as \u2018experts\u2019 to bring legitimacy into their replies; Some users refer to external references, that being people or peer-reviewed materials The entries in the threads analysed are quite competent and reasoned upon, often based on personal experience; often however, the context in which the experience is told is not described or accounted for; hence, albeit these exchanges may fit the purpose of maintaining a dialogue where other users can intervene, adding, rectifying or other, they might not entirely respond to the issue launched in the thread. The posts are mainly auto-ethnographic and are mostly relevant for other participants of the forum. The types of legitimacy sought by users varies and includes other sources of information, allusion to well-known public figures and work and not necessarily peer-reviewed scientific sources. We would argue that the value of these threads is precisely on the experiential facts brought in the dialogues and also on the issues raised around the thread\u2019s theme, around the particular wearable sensor technology and ultimately about the overall use of wearable health technology. The quality control and specifically the pedigree analysis of the entries is not more difficult to analyse than many official \u2018expert\u2019 documents suffering from similar weaknesses. For example, a common snag of the EU papers is self-referencing, i.e. the European Commission justifies certain types of claims that would require references to expert studies, with arguments that were made in earlier EC publications of policy nature instead of referencing expert sources of information (Breitegger et al. 2015). ",
        "114 Knowledge assessment also allows us to examine the motivations of citizens to engage with self- tracking, self-care and health self-veillance through wearable sensors. For many citizens, monitoring their own health, through different devices or apps available in the market, such as Fitbit, is a response to actual needs, health related but also because these devices respond to other needs when it comes to health and wellness, that of conviviality. These devices belong to a generation of devices that are packed with lifestyle narratives implying strong normativities and imaginaries in the form of tempting proposals for how one should live one\u2019s life. But, in an interview with the authors, the London coordinator of the Quantified Self movement in London, stated: \u2018The people that I work with are constantly pushing the boundaries of what can be done and how they experiment and they do not care about data per se but about solving their problems. Let us say that you have diabetes or you are interested in running an ultra marathon or you have Parkinson\u2019s Disease and you need to measure certain markers, you want that. You want to make your life better and do not really care about fancy marketing, such as with Fitbit, which is banking on lifestyle marketing and wellbeing and so on. \u2018 These self-tracking gadgets attract different audiences, including those trying to lose weight, athletes, hypochondriacs and so on (Waltz, 2012). Hence, by sharing their experience citizens may be just focusing on resolving their own problem and not necessarily buying into a lifestyle and consumption narrative sold with the devices they use. Another important narrative with which these devices are proposed to citizens is empowerment; this is also visible through many of the discourses in the threads as we have seen and aligns well with policy discourses in healthcare in the European Union (see for example the mHealth green paper (European Commission, 2014)). In what seems to be a transition to an era of do-it-yourself healthcare, citizens seem to be implicitly and explicitly asked into relying more and more on their own observations and search for ",
        "115 information online instead of consulting a doctor, and given the price of healthcare which has been growing considerably, the patient-driven healthcare model is finding its place in policies on healthcare worldwide (Wolbring & Lashewicz, 2014). Wearable sensors, social media, ubiquitous computing, VoIP are seen as a leading technologies in home health monitoring and care (see e.g. Wolbring and Lashewicz, Op. cit.; Afshar, 2014). In fact, there seems to be a co-produced need and agreement for a \u2018do-it-yourself\u2019 strategy to tackle one\u2019s health; but what the analysis of these threads show is that the \u2018community\u2019 forming around the discussion of wearable sensors related issues is as important as the self-monitoring. Whilst self- tracking, i.e. reducing to a small number of parameters our health and fitness is seen as an improvement of quality in care, the ideas of socialising and sharing experience about health issues changes fundamentally the experience of \u2018do-it-yourself\u2019 care and knowledge production around health issues. Furthermore, it is worth noting that users seem to be engaged in an experiment with multiple purposes: whilst they actually and objectively contribute to the fine tuning of the technology, they also are engaging with the deeper experiment of non-medical devices being used to perform a health function giving the user a sense of agency with regard to their health. The added agency is provided by, on one hand the use of the personal(ised) device and on the other hand by the emphasis placed on sharing and on the idea that self-tracking is a \u2018collective endeavour\u2019 to address common health issues. Wearable sensors serve therefore purposes other than just self-monitoring and DIY health, including social purposes, such as sharing, mutual learning, going deeper in issues and companionship. This is transformative of the prevalent narrative of healthcare, which seeks for efficient, cost-saving, technology driven, virtual connectivity and patient-centred approaches away from the clinical settings. ",
        "116 In this way the wearable experience becomes actually the testing out in vivo of health and wellbeing narratives at a broader level. \u2018There is no self in the quantified self, and that is not because it cannot be measured. It is because you cannot get the data out of the varied sensors, applications and platforms and combine them into something that approximates [the] self more than just one data stream. (\u2026) An aspect of self measurement is a combination of all those data streams and at the moment you cannot measure that.\u2019 London Quantified Self coordinator in an interview in 2013. This interesting remark arising from a phase of knowledge assessment that we have reported elsewhere (Breitegger et al. 2015) tells us much about the expectations of users from technology and from measurement. Reducing the \u2018self\u2019 to a compounded set of data sets seems to be in the imaginary of all: users but also business and policy making. It is interesting to note that those reductionisms however entertain deep conversations about health and healthcare, as we have seen from the sample quotes from the forums we have analysed. But there are more alignments that emerge from the pedigree analysis that we have conducted; as explained in the introduction, policy makers and other stakeholders argue that there is a need for reducing healthcare costs. According to the efficiency narrative that supports healthcare in the EU, this is possibly achievable through greater engagement of citizens in self-care practices. There seems to be no evidence, however, about how knowledge produced in realms such as citizen online forums actually reach or are heard by policy and business actors. Yet, what needs to be understood is that healthcare is no longer in the hands of institutions that practice, regulate or provide healthcare but also in the hands of citizens who resolve their problems in pr active ways, acting sometimes as guarantees of quality of the healthcare system. In fact, citizen initiatives like the quantified self- movement claim the right to \u2018own\u2019 the sensor generated data. But how these data are fit for purpose ",
        "117 in traditional healthcare systems is an open question \u2014 see, for example, Ko et al. 2010; Redmond et al. 2014. Funtowicz (2006) argues that for the policy-relevant scientific problems, there is a need for an \u2018extended peer community\u2019 to be included in the process of decision and policy making through an open dialogue that would include diverse stakeholders including citizens. Would this be a commitment for enhancing quality of policy making, we would rather conclude that current disconnects on practice, expectations and actual appropriation of these technologies show that the main postulates of post-normal science, quality assurance through deliberation among different partners in the process, still need to be accepted by not only researchers and citizens but also policy makers and the industry.
