        "(7) The global context for action is the pursuit of a rules-based rules-and values-based global order, with multilateralism as its key principle and the United Nations at its core. The 2030 Agenda, together with the Paris Agreement on Climate Change ( 17 ) (\u2018the Paris Agreement\u2019) and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda ( 18 ) is the international community\u2019s response to global challenges and trends in relation to sustainable development. With the Sustainable Development Goals at its core, the 2030 Agenda is a transformative framework to eradicate poverty, and achieve sustainable development globally and promote peaceful, just and inclusive societies, while tackling climate change and working to preserve oceans and forests . It is universal in scope, providing a comprehensive shared framework for action that applies to the Union, to its Member States and to its partners.

The Union should enhance partnerships, promote policy dialogue and collective responses to challenges of global concern. Its action should support the Union\u2019s fundamental interests , principles and values in all its aspects, including promoting democracy and human rights, contributing to the eradication of poverty, preserving peace, preventing conflicts conflict prevention, mediation and post-conflict reconstruction including women at all stages, ensuring nuclear safety , strengthening international security, fighting addressing root causes of irregular migration and forced displacement and assisting populations, countries and regions confronting confronted with natural or man-made disasters, bringing about the conditions to create an international legal framework for the protection of persons displaced due to climate change, fostering inclusive quality education, supporting a fair, sustainable and rules- and value-based trade policy as a tool for development and to bring improvements to the rule of law and human rights , economic and cultural diplomacy and economic cooperation, promoting innovation, digital solutions and technologies, protecting cultural heritage especially in conflict areas, addressing global public health threats and fostering the international dimension of Union\u2019s policies.

[Am. 7] (9) The new application of this Regulation should also be based on the European Consensus on Development (\u2018the Consensus\u2019) ( 20 ), signed on 7 June 2017, which provides the framework for a common approach to development cooperation by the Union and its Member States to implement the 2030 Agenda and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda. Eradicating poverty, tackling discrimination and inequalities, leaving no one behind , protecting the environment and fighting climate change, and strengthening resilience are at the heart of development cooperation policy should underpin the application of this Regulation .

[Am. 9] (10) In order to implement the new international framework established by the 2030 Agenda, the Global Strategy and the Consensus, this Regulation should aim at increasing the coherence and ensuring the effectiveness of the Union's external action by concentrating its efforts through a streamlined instrument to improve the implementation of the different external action policies. (11) In accordance with the Global Strategy and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015-2030) as adopted on 18 March 2015 ( 21 ), recognition should be given to the need to move away from crisis response and containment to a more structural, preventive long-term approach that more effectively addresses situations of fragility, natural and man-made disasters, and protracted crises. Greater emphasis and collective approaches are required on risk reduction, prevention, mitigation and preparedness; and further efforts are required to enhance swift response and a durable recovery. This Regulation should therefore contribute to strengthening resilience and linking humanitarian aid and development action particularly through rapid response actions as well as relevant geographic and thematic programmes, while ensuring the appropriate predictability, transparency and accountability, as well as coherence, consistency and complementarity with humanitarian aid and full compliance with international humanitarian law and without hindering the delivery of humanitarian aid according to the principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence in emergency and post-emergency contexts . [Am. 10] (12) In line with the international commitments of the Union on development effectiveness as adopted in Busan in 2011 and renewed at the Nairobi High Level Forum in 2016 and recalled in the Consensus, the Union\u2019s Union, in the context of its official development cooperation assistance and across all aid modalities, should apply the development effectiveness principles, namely ownership of development priorities by developing countries, a focus on results, inclusive development partnerships as well as mutual transparency and accountability , in addition to the principles of alignment and harmonisation . [Am. 11] (13) Pursuant to the Sustainable Development Goals, this Regulation should contribute to reinforced monitoring and reporting with a focus on results, covering outputs, outcomes and impacts in partner countries benefiting from the Union's external financial assistance. In particular, as agreed in the Consensus, actions under this Regulation are expected to should contribute at least 20 % of the Official Development Assistance funded under this Regulation to social inclusion and human development, including with a focus on basic social services, such as health, education, nutrition, water, sanitation and hygiene, and social protection, particularly to the most marginalised, taking into account gender equality, and women's empowerment and children\u2019s rights as horizontal issues . [Am. 12] (14) Whenever possible and appropriate, In order to improve effective accountability and transparency of the Union budget , the Commission should set up clear monitoring and evaluation mechanisms to ensure effective assessment of progress towards the achievement of this Regulation\u2019s objectives. The results of the Union's external action should be monitored and assessed on the basis of pre-defined, transparent, country-specific and measurable indicators, adapted to the specificities and objectives of the Instrument and preferably based on the results framework of the partner country. The Commission should regularly monitor its actions and review progress, making the results publicly available, in particular in the form of an annual report to the European Parliament and the Council.

        "(15) This Regulation should contribute to the collective Union objective of providing 0,7 % of Gross National Income as Official Development Assistance within the timeframe of the 2030 Agenda. That commitment should be based on a clear roadmap for the Union and its Member States to set out deadlines and modalities for its achievement. In that regard, at least 92 % 95 % of the funding under this Regulation should contribute to actions designed in such a way that they fulfil the criteria for Official Development Assistance as established by the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. [Am. 14] (16) In order to ensure resources are provided to where the need is greatest, especially to the Least Developed Countries and the countries in situation of fragility and conflict, this Regulation should contribute to the collective target of reaching 0,20 % of the Union Gross National Income towards Least Developed Countries within the timeframe of the 2030 Agenda. This commitment should be based on a clear roadmap for the EU and its Member States to set out deadlines and modalities for its achievement. [Am. 15] (16a) In line with existing commitments in the EU Gender Action Plan II, at least 85 % of Official Development Assistance funded programmes, geographic and thematic, should have gender equality as a principal or a significant objective, as defined by the OECD DAC. A mandatory review of the spending should ensure that a significant part of these programmes have gender equality and women\u2019s and girls\u2019 rights and empowerment as a principal objective. [Am. 16] (16b) This regulation should give particular attention to children and youth as contributors to the realisation of Agenda 2030. The Union's external action under this Regulation should give particular attention to their needs and empowerment and will contribute to the realisation of their potential as key agents of change by investing in human development and social inclusion. [Am. 17] (16c) The inhabitants of the countries of Sub-Saharan Africa are mainly adolescents and young people. Each country should decide on its demographic policy. However, the demographic dynamic should be tackled in a global way in order to ensure that current and future generations will be able to achieve their full potential in a sustainable way. [Am. 18] (17) This Regulation should reflect the need to focus on strategic priorities, both geographically \u2014 the European Neighbourhood and Africa, as well as countries that are fragile and most in need, particularly Least Developed Countries, but also thematically \u2014 sustainable development, poverty eradication, democracy and human rights, the rule of law, good governance, security, safe, orderly and regular migration, the reduction of inequalities, gender equality, addressing environmental degradation and climate change and human rights global public health threats .

[Am. 20] (18) The special relationship developed with the Union\u2019s neighbouring countries, in accordance with Article 8 TEU, should be preserved and enhanced through the application of this Regulation . This Regulation should contribute to reinforcing States\u2019 and societies\u2019 resilience in the Union\u2019s neighbourhood, following the engagement taken in the Global Strategy. It should support the implementation of the European Neighbourhood Policy, as reviewed in 2015, and the implementation of regional cooperation frameworks, such as cross-border cooperation and the external aspects of relevant macro-regional and sea basin strategies and policies in the eastern and southern neighbourhood, including the Northern Dimension and the Black Sea regional cooperation . Those initiatives offer supplementary political frameworks for deepening relations with and among partner countries, based on the principles of mutual accountability, shared ownership and responsibility.

        "(19) The European Neighbourhood Policy, as reviewed in 2015 ( 22 ), aims at the deepening of democracy, promotion of human rights and upholding of the rule of law, the stabilisation of neighbouring countries and strengthening resilience, particularly by boosting promoting political, economic development and social reforms , as the Union's main political priorities. In order to attain its objective, the implementation of the reviewed European Neighbourhood Policy has been focusing on four through this Regulation should focus on the following priority areas: good governance, democracy, the rule of law and human rights, with a particular focus in engaging further with civil society; economic socio-economic development , including the fight against youth unemployment, as well as education and environmental sustainability ; security; migration and mobility, including tackling the root causes of irregular migration and forced displacement and supporting populations, countries and regions confronted with enhanced migratory pressure. This Regulation should support the implementation of the Union\u2019s association agreements and deep and comprehensive free trade agreements with countries in the neighbourhood . Differentiation and enhanced mutual ownership are the hallmark of the European Neighbourhood Policy, recognising different levels of engagement, and reflecting the interests of each country concerning the nature and focus of its partnership with the Union. The performance-based approach is one of the key tenets of the European Neighbourhood Policy. In the case of a serious or persistent degradation of democracy in one of the partner countries, support should be suspended. Neighbourhood funding is a key lever in addressing common challenges, such as irregular migration and climate change, as well as in spreading prosperity, security and stability through economic development and better governance. The visibility of Union assistance in the neighbourhood area should be enhanced. [Am. 22] (20) This Regulation should support the implementation of a modernised association agreement with countries of the Africa, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group of States and allow the EU and its ACP partners to develop further strong alliances on key and shared global challenges. In particular, this Regulation should support the continuation of the established cooperation between the Union and the African Union in line with the Joint Africa-EU Strategy , including the engagement from Africa and the Union to promote children\u2019s rights as well as the empowerment of Europe\u2019s and Africa\u2019s youth, and build on the future EU-ACP agreement after 2020, including through a continental approach towards Africa , and a mutually beneficial partnership of equals between the EU and Africa . [Am. 23] (20a) This Regulation should also contribute to the trade-related aspects of the Union's external relations, such as cooperation with third countries on supply chain due diligence for tin, tantalum and gold, the Kimberley Process, the Sustainability Compact, the implementation of commitments under Regulation (EU) No 978/2012 of the European Parliament and the Council ( 23 ) (GSP Regulation), cooperation under the Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) and Aid for Trade initiatives in order to ensure consistency and mutual support between Union trade policy and development goals and actions. [Am. 24] (21) The Union should seek the most efficient use of available resources in order to optimise the impact of its external action. That should be achieved through coherence , consistency and complementarity among the Union's external financing instruments, notably the Instrument for Pre-Accession III ( 24 ), the Humanitarian Aid Instrument ( 25 ), the Decision on Overseas Countries and Territories ( 26 ), the European Instrument for Nuclear Safety to complement the 26.3.2021 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 108/319 Wednesday 27 March 2019 ( 22 ) Joint communication to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, \u2018Review of the European Neighbourhood policy\u2019, 18 November 2015.

[Am. 26] (22a) The international dimension of the Erasmus Plus Programme should be boosted aiming at increasing opportunities for mobility and cooperation for individuals and organisations from less developed countries of the world \u2014 supporting capacity-building in third countries, skills\u2019 development, people-to-people exchanges, while offering a greater number of opportunities for cooperation and mobility with developed and emerging countries. [Am. 27] (22b) Considering the relevance of addressing education and culture in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the EU strategy for international cultural relations, this Regulation should contribute to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education, promote life-long learning opportunities for all, foster international cultural relations, and recognise the role of culture in promoting European values through dedicated and targeted actions designed to have a clear impact on the Union\u2019s role on the global scene. [Am. 28] (23) The main approach for actions financed under this Regulation should be through geographic programmes, in order to maximise the impact of the Union's assistance and bring Union's action closer to partner countries and populations, .This general approach while supporting thematic priorities such as human rights, civil society and sustainability. The objectives under the geographic and thematic programmes should be consistent and coherent with each other and should be complemented by thematic programmes and by rapid response actions, where relevant. Effective complementarity between the geographic, thematic and rapid response programmes and actions should be ensured. In order to take account of the specificities of each programme, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission to supplement the provisions of this Regulation by setting out the Union\u2019s strategy, the priority areas, detailed objectives, the expected results, specific performance indicators and the specific financial allocation for each programme. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making ( 31 ). In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States' experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.

        "(24) In line with the Consensus, the Union and its Member States should enhance joint programming to increase their collective impact by bringing together their resources and capacities. Joint programming should build on the partner countries\u2019 engagement, appropriation and ownership. The Union and its Member States should seek to support partner countries through joint implementation application , whenever appropriate. Joint application should be inclusive and open to all Union partners who agree and can contribute to a common vision, including Member States\u2019 agencies and their development financial institutions, local authorities, the private sector, civil society and academia. [Am. 30] (24a) In the case of a serious or persistent degradation of democracy, human rights and rule of law in one of the partner countries, support may, by means of a delegated act, be partially or fully suspended. The Commission should take due account of relevant European Parliament resolutions in its decision-making. [Am. 31] (24b) This Regulation should reconfirm nuclear safety as an important part of the Union external action and facilitate the objectives of cooperation specified in Regulation (EU) \u2026/\u2026 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 32 ) (\u2018Regulation EINS\u2019). Therefore, in the event where a partner country persistently fails to respect the basic nuclear safety standards, such as provisions of the relevant international Conventions within the Framework of the IAEA, the Espoo and Aarhus Conventions and their subsequent amendments, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the additional Protocols thereto, the commitments to implementation of stress tests and related measures, and the objectives of cooperation specified in Regulation EINS, assistance under this Regulation for the country concerned should be reconsidered and may be suspended or partly suspended. [Am. 32] (25) Whilst democracy and human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the protection of children, minorities, persons with disabilities and LGBTI persons, as well as gender equality, and women's women and girls\u2019 empowerment should be consistently reflected and mainstreamed throughout the implementation application of this Regulation, Union assistance under the thematic programmes for human rights and democracy and civil society organisations - local authorities should have a specific complementary and additional role by virtue of its global nature and its independence of action from the consent of the governments and public authorities of the third countries concerned. In doing so, the Union should pay particular attention to countries and urgency situations where human rights and fundamental freedoms are most at risk and where disrespect for those rights and freedoms is particularly pronounced and systematic, as well as to situations where space for civil society is at stake. The Union\u2019s assistance under this Regulation should be designed in such a way as to allow for support to, and cooperation and partnership with civil society on sensitive and human rights and democracy issues, providing the flexibility and requisite reactivity to respond to changing circumstances, needs of beneficiaries, or periods of crisis, and when necessary, contributing to capacity building of civil society. In such cases, the political priorities should be to promote respect for international law and to provide means of action to local civil society and other relevant human rights stakeholders in order to contribute to work that is carried out in very difficult circumstances. This Regulation should offer also the possibility for civil society organisations to receive small grants in a fast and efficient manner when necessary, in particular in the most difficult situations, such as those of fragility, crisis, and inter-community tensions. [Am. 33] (25a) In accordance with Articles 2, 3 and 21 TEU and Article 8 TFEU, the implementation of this Regulation should be guided by the principles of gender equality, women and girls\u2019 empowerment, and should seek to protect and promote women\u2019s rights in line with the Gender Action Plan II, the Council Conclusions on Women Peace and Security of 10 December 2018, the Council of Europe Istanbul Convention and Goal 5 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

        "(25b) This Regulation should address and mainstream the promotion of women\u2019s rights and gender equality globally, including by supporting organisations which are working on promoting sexual and reproductive health and rights (access to quality and accessible information, education and services) and combating gender-based violence and discrimination, as well as recognising and addressing the close links between the issues of peace, security, development and gender equality. This work should be coherent with, and promote the implementation of relevant international and European principles and conventions. [Am. 35] (26) Civil society organisations should embrace a wide range of actors with different multiple roles and mandates which includes all non-State, not-for-profit structures, non-partisan and non-violent structures , through which people organise to pursue shared objectives and ideals, whether political, cultural, social, or religious, environmental, economic or holding authorities to account . Operating from the local to the national, regional and international levels, they comprise urban and rural, formal and informal organisations. Other bodies or actors not specifically excluded by this Regulation should be able to be financed when it is necessary to achieve the objectives of this Regulation. [Am. 36] (26a) In line with the Consensus for Development, the Union and its Member States should foster the participation of civil society organisations (CSOs) and local authorities (LAs) in contributing to sustainable development and to the implementation of the SDGs, inter alia in the sectors of democracy, the rule of law, fundamental freedoms and human rights, social justice and as providers of basic social services to populations most in need. They should recognise the multiple roles played by CSOs and LAs, the latter as promoters of a territorial approach to development, including decentralisation processes, participation, oversight and accountability. The Union and its Member States should promote an operating space and enabling environment for CSOs, and further enhance their support for CSOs\u2019 and LAs\u2019 capacity building in order to strengthen their voice in the sustainable development process and advance political, social and economic dialogue, including through civil society facilities programmes. [Am. 37] (26b) The Union should support civil society organisations and promote their greater strategic involvement in all external instruments and programmes, including geographical programmes and the rapid response actions under this Regulation, in keeping with the Council conclusions of 15 October 2012 on \u2018The roots of democracy and sustainable development: Europe\u2019s engagement with civil society in external relations\u2019. [Am. 38] (27) This Regulation lays down a financial envelope for this Instrument, which is to constitute the prime reference amount, within the meaning of point 17 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 2 December 2013 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline, on cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial management ( 33 ), for the European Parliament and the Council during the annual budgetary procedure. (28) Reflecting the importance of tackling climate change , protecting the environment and fight biodiversity loss, in line with the Union commitments to implement the Paris Agreement , the Convention on Biological Diversity and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, this Regulation should contribute to mainstream climate and environmental action in the Union policies and to the achievement of an the overall target of 25 % of the Union budget expenditures supporting climate objectives and support actions with clean and identifiable co-benefits across sectors . Actions under this Regulation are expected to contribute 25 % 45 % of its overall financial envelope to climate objectives , environmental management and protection, biodiversity and combatting desertification, of which 30 % of the overall financial envelope should be dedicated to climate change mitigation and adaptation . C 108/322 EN Official Journal of the European Union 26.3.2021 Wednesday 27 March 2019 ( 33 ) OJ C 373, 20.12.2013, p. 1. ",
        "Relevant actions will be identified during the implementation application of this Regulation, and the overall contribution from this Regulation should be part of relevant evaluations and review processes. Union action in this area should favour the adherence to the Paris Agreement and to the Rio Conventions, and not contribute to environmental degradation or cause harm to the environment or climate. Actions and measures contributing to meeting the target on climate shall put special emphasis on support for adaptation to climate change in poor, highly vulnerable countries, and should take into consideration the relation between climate, peace and security, women\u2019s empowerment and the fight against poverty. This Regulation should contribute to the sustainable management of natural resources and promote sustainable and secure mining, forest management and agriculture. [Am. 39] (29) It is essential to further step up Cooperation on migration with partner countries, reaping the benefits of well-managed and regular can lead to mutually benefiting from orderly, safe and responsible migration and to effectively addressing irregular migration and forced displacement . Such cooperation should contribute to facilitating safe and legal pathways for migration and asylum, ensuring access to international protection, addressing the root causes of irregular migration and forced displacement, engaging with diasporas , enhancing border management and pursuing efforts in the fight against addressing irregular migration, trafficking in human beings and migrant smuggling, and working on safe, dignified and sustainable returns, readmission and reintegration where relevant, in a conflict-sensitive manner, on the basis of mutual accountability , and in full respect of humanitarian and human rights obligations. Therefore, third countries' effective cooperation with the under international and Union in this area should be an integral element in the general principles of this Regulation. An increased law. Coherence between migration and development cooperation policies is important to ensure that development assistance supports partner countries to manage fight poverty and inequality, promote rights and freedoms, as well as contribute to an orderly, safe and responsible migration more effectively management . This Regulation should contribute to a coordinated, holistic and structured approach to migration, maximising the synergies and applying the necessary leverage the positive impact of migration and mobility on development . [Am. 40] (30) This Regulation should enable the Union to respond to challenges, needs and opportunities related to migration, in complementarity with Union migration policy and development policies . To contribute to that end, in order to maximise the contribution of migration to development, and without prejudice to unforeseen circumstances new emerging challenges or new needs , a maximum of 10 % of its financial envelope is expected to be dedicated to addressing the root causes of irregular migration and forced displacement and to supporting strengthened engagement to facilitate safe, orderly, regular and responsible migration management and the implementation of planned and well-managed migration policies and governance, including the protection of refugees and migrants' rights based on international and Union law within the objectives of this Regulation. This Regulation should also contribute to addressing the brain-drain phenomenon and to help support the needs of displaced people and host communities, in particular through the provision of access to basic services and livelihoods opportunities. [Am. 41] (30a) Information and communication technologies (ICT) and services are proven enablers of sustainable development and inclusive growth. They can be key to improving citizens' lives even in the poorest countries, in particular by empowering women and girls, enhancing democratic governance and transparency, and boosting productivity and job creation. Nevertheless, connectivity and affordability remain a problem both across and within regions, since there are large variations between high and lower income countries and between cities and rural areas. This regulation should therefore help the Union to further mainstream digitalisation into the Union development policies. [Am. 42] (30b) The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by a Resolution of the United Nations General Assembly on 25 September 2015, underlined the importance of promoting peaceful and inclusive societies both as a Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 16 and in order to achieve other development policy outcomes. SDG 16.a specifically requests to \u2018Strengthen relevant national institutions, including through international cooperation, for building capacities at all levels, in particular in developing countries, to prevent violence and combat terrorism and crime\u2019. [Am. 43] (30c) In the High Level Meeting Communiqu\u00e9 of 19 February 2016, the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development updated the reporting directives on Official Development Assistance in the field of peace and security.

[Am. 44] (30d) The capacity building in support of development and security for development should be used in exceptional cases only, where the objectives of the Regulation cannot be met by other development cooperation activities. Giving support to security sector actors in third countries, including, under exceptional circumstances, the military, in a conflict prevention, crisis management or stabilisation context is essential to ensure appropriate conditions for poverty eradication and development. Good governance, effective democratic control and civilian oversight of the security system, including of the military, as well as compliance with human rights and the rule of law principles are essential attributes of a well-functioning State in any context, and should be promoted through a wider security sector reform support to third countries. [Am. 45] (30e) This Regulation should build on the conclusions of the evaluation by the Commission requested for June 2020, including a wide-ranging, multi-stakeholder public consultation, assessing the coherence of capacity building in support of development and security for development within the security-development nexus funded by the Union and its Member States with the Global Strategy and the UN Sustainable Development Goals. [Am. 46] (30f) The Union should also promote a conflict-sensitive and gender-sensitive approach in all actions and programmes under this Regulation, with the aim of avoiding negative impacts and maximising positive ones. [Am. 47] (31) Horizontal financial rules adopted by the European Parliament and the Council on the basis of Article 322 TFEU should apply to this Regulation. These rules are laid down in Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 34 ) (\u2018the Financial Regulation\u2019) and determine in particular the procedure for establishing and implementing the budget through grants, procurement, prizes, indirect implementation, financial assistance, budget support, trust funds, financial instruments and budgetary guarantees, and provide for checks on the responsibility of financial actors. Rules adopted on the basis of Article 322 TFEU also concern the protection of the Union's budget in case of generalised deficiencies as regards the rule of law in Member States and third countries, as the respect for the rule of law is essential for sound financial management and effective EU funding. (32) The types of financing and the methods of implementation application under this Regulation should be chosen on the basis of partner\u2019s needs, preferences and specific context, their relevance, sustainability and ability to comply with the development effectiveness principles, achieve the specific objectives of the actions and to deliver results, taking into account, in particular, the costs of controls, the administrative burden, and the expected risk of non-compliance. This should include consideration of the use of lump sums, flat rates and unit costs, as well as financing not linked to costs as referred to in Article 125(1) of the Financial Regulation. The role of the European Endowment for Democracy (EED) as a foundation mandated through the European institutions for the support of democracy, civil society and human rights worldwide should be strengthened and increased under this Regulation. The EED should be given the administrative flexibility and the financial opportunities to disburse targeted grants to civil society actors in the European Neighbourhood standing for the implementation of the European Neighbourhood Policy, in particular where it concerns the development of democracy, human rights, free elections and the rule of law. [Am. 48] (33) The new European Fund for Sustainable Development Plus (\u2018EFSD+\u2019), building on its successful predecessor, the EFSD ( 35 ), should constitute an integrated financial package supplying financing capacity in the form of grants, budgetary guarantees and financial instruments worldwide. The EFSD+ should support the External Investment Plan C 108/324 EN Official Journal of the European Union 26.3.2021 Wednesday 27 March 2019 ( 34 ) Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 July 2018 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union, amending Regulations (EU) No 1296/2013, (EU) No 1301/2013, (EU) No 1303/2013, (EU) No 1304/2013, (EU) No 1309/2013, (EU) No 1316/2013, (EU) No 223/2014, (EU) No 283/2014, and Decision No 541/2014/EU and repealing Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 (OJ L 193, 30.7.2018, p. 1).

Given its role under the Treaties and its experience over the last decades in supporting Union policies, the European Investment Bank should remain a natural partner for the Commission for the implementation application of operations under the External Action Guarantee. Other Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) or EU National Development Banks (NDBs) also have skills and capital which can add significant value to the impact of Union development policy and their participation under the EFSD+ should therefore also be strongly promoted through this Regulation. [Am. 49] (34) The EFSD+ should aim at supporting investments as a means of contributing to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals by fostering sustainable and inclusive economic , cultural and social development and promoting the socio-economic resilience in partner countries with a particular focus on the eradication of poverty, preventing conflict and the promotion of peaceful, just and inclusive societies, sustainable and inclusive growth economic progress, tackling climate change through mitigation and adaptation, environmental degradation , the creation of decent jobs in compliance with relevant ILO standards and economic opportunities, in particular for women, young and vulnerable people. Emphasis should be placed on providing inclusive and equitable quality education, and the development of skills and entrepreneurship by strengthening educational and cultural structures, including for children in humanitarian emergencies and situations of forced displacement. It should also aim at supporting a stable investment environment, industrialisation , socioeconomic sectors , cooperatives, social enterprises , micro, small and medium-sized enterprises as well as addressing strengthening democracy the rule of law and human rights, the lack of which often constitute the specific socioeconomic root causes of irregular migration and forced displacement , in accordance with the relevant indicative programming documents. Special attention should be given to countries identified as experiencing fragility or conflict, Least Developed Countries and heavily indebted poor countries. A special focus should be placed also to improve the delivery of essential public basic services, food security, and to improve the quality of life of rapidly growing urban populations, including through adequate, safe and affordable housing. The EFSD+ should encourage for-profit/non-profit partnerships as a means of guiding private sector investments towards sustainable development and poverty eradication. The strategic involvement of civil society organisations and of Union Delegations in partner countries should also be promoted at all stages of the project cycle, to help finding tailor-made solutions for promoting the socioeconomic development of communities, job creation, and new business opportunities. Investments should be based on conflict analysis, focus on the root causes of conflict, fragility and instability, maximising the potential for fostering peace and minimising the risks of exacerbating conflicts. [Am. 50] (35) The EFSD+ should maximise additionality of funding, address market failures and sub-optimal investment situations, deliver innovative products and \u2018crowd-in\u2019 private sector funds to optimise the contribution of private finance to local sustainable development . Involvement of the private sector in the Union\u2019s cooperation with partner countries through the EFSD+ should yield measurable and additional development impact in full respect of the environment and local communities\u2019 rights and livelihoods and without distorting the local market and unfairly competing with local economic actors. It should be cost-effective based on mutual accountability and risk and cost sharing. The EFSD+ , while based on adequate accountability and transparency criteria, should operate as a \u2018one-stop-shop\u2019, receiving financing proposals from financial institutions and public or private investors and delivering a wide range of financial support to eligible investments. [Am. 51] (35a) An EU guarantee for the sovereign investments operations in the public sector shall form part of the EFSD+. That EU guarantee shall not be extended to sovereign investment operations that involve on-lending to the private sector or lending to, or for the benefit of, sub-sovereign entities that can access sub-sovereign financing without sovereign guarantees. In order to assist capacity planning by the EIB, a minimum guaranteed volume of such sovereign investments operations shall be allocated to the EIB.

        "(36) An External Action Guarantee should be established building on the existing EFSD Guarantee and the Guarantee Fund for external actions. The External Action Guarantee should support the EFSD+ operations covered by budgetary guarantees, macro-financial assistance and loans to third countries on the basis of Council Decision 77/270/Euratom ( 36 ). These operations should be supported by appropriations under this Regulation, together with those under Regulation (EU) No \u2026/\u2026 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 37 ) (\u2018IPA III Regulation\u2019) and Regulation EINS, which should also cover the provisioning and liabilities arising from macro-financial assistance loans and loans to third countries referred to in Article 10(2) of Regulation EINS, respectively. When funding EFSD+ operations, priority should be given to those which have a high impact on decent job creation and livelihoods and whose cost-benefit ratio enhances the sustainability of investment and which provide the highest guarantees of sustainability and long-term development impact throughout local ownership . The operations supported with the External Action Guarantee should be accompanied by an in-depth ex ante assessment of environmental, financial and social aspects, as appropriate and including the impact on human rights and livelihoods of affected communities and the impact on inequalities and the identification of ways to address those inequalities in line with the better regulation requirements and taking due account of the principle of free and prior informed consent (FPIC) of affected communities in land-related investments . The External Action Guarantee should not be used to provide essential public services, which remains a government responsibility. Ex-post impact assessments should also happen to measure the development impact of the EFSD+ operations. [Am. 53] (37) In order to provide for flexibility, increase the attractiveness for the private sector , promote fair competition and maximise the impact of the investments a derogation from the rules related to the methods of implementation of the Union budget, as laid down in the Financial Regulation, should be provided as regards the eligible counterparts. Those eligible counterparts could also be bodies which are not entrusted with the implementation of a public-private partnership and could also be bodies governed by the private law of a partner country. [Am. 54] (38) In order to increase the impact of the External Action Guarantee, Member States and contracting parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area should have the possibility of providing contributions in the form of cash or a guarantee. Contribution in the form of a guarantee should not exceed 50 % of the amount of operations guaranteed by the Union. The financial liabilities arising from this guarantee should not be provisioned and the liquidity cushion should be provided by the common provisioning fund. (39) External actions are often implemented applied in a highly volatile environment requiring continuous and rapid adaptation to the evolving needs of Union partners and to global challenges to human rights and fundamental freedoms , democracy and good governance, security and stability, climate change and environment, oceans, and the migration, crisis and including its root causes such as poverty and inequality, and the impact of the increasing number of displaced persons, especially on developing countries . Reconciling the principle of predictability with the need to react rapidly to new needs consequently means adapting the financial implementation application of the programmes. To increase the ability of the EU to respond to unforeseen needs not covered by programmes and programming documents , building on the successful experience of the European Development Fund (EDF), an a pre-defined amount should be left unallocated as an emerging challenges and priorities cushion. It should be mobilised in duly justified cases in accordance with the procedures established in this Regulation. [Am. 55] (40) Therefore, while respecting the principle that the Union budget is set annually, this Regulation should preserve the possibility to apply the flexibilities already allowed by the Financial Regulation for other policies, namely carryovers and re-commitments of funds, to ensure efficient use of the Union funds both for Union citizens and the partner countries, thus maximising the Union funds available for the Union\u2019s external action interventions.

Moreover, cooperation between the partner countries and the overseas countries and territories as well as the Union outermost regions under Article 349 TFEU should be encouraged in areas of common interest. (42) In order to enhance partner countries' democratic ownership of their development processes and the sustainability of external aid, the Union should, where relevant, favour the use of partner countries' own institutions , resources, expertise and of partner countries\u2019 systems and procedures for all aspects of the project cycle for cooperation while ensuring local resources and expertise and the full involvement of local governments and civil society. The Union should also provide training programmes on how to apply for Union funding to local authorities\u2019 civil servants and civil society organisations with the aim of helping them to enhance the eligibility and efficiency of their projects. These programmes should be carried out in the countries concerned, be available in the language of the country and complement any distance learning programmes also established, in order to ensure a targeted training responding to the needs of that country. [Am. 56] (43) Annual or multi-annual action plans and measures referred to in Article 19 constitute work programmes under the Financial Regulation. Annual or multi-annual action plans consist of a set of measures grouped into one document.

In particular, in accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 and Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) may carry out administrative investigations, including on-the-spot checks and inspections, with a view to establishing whether there has been fraud, corruption or any other illegal activity affecting the financial interests of the Union. In accordance with Regulation (EU) 2017/1939, the European Public Prosecutor's Office may investigate and prosecute fraud and other criminal offences affecting the financial interests of the Union, as provided for in Directive (EU) 2017/1371 ( 42 ) of the European Parliament and of the Council. In accordance with the Financial Regulation, any person or entity receiving Union funds is to fully cooperate in the protection of the Union\u2019s financial interests and grant the necessary rights and access to the Commission, OLAF and the European Court of Auditors, and to ensure that any third parties involved in the implementation of Union funds grant equivalent rights; for this reason, agreements with third countries and territories and with international organisations, and any contract or agreement resulting from the implementation of this Regulation should contain provisions expressly empowering the Commission, the Court of Auditors and OLAF to conduct such audits, on-the-spot checks and inspections, according to their respective competences and ensuring that any third parties involved in the implementation of Union funding grant equivalent rights.
