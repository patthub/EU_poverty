        "In January 2002 the European Union Institute for Security Studies (EUISS) became an autonomous Paris-based agen- cy of the European Union. Following an EU Council Joint Action of 20 July 2001, modified by the Joint Action of 21 December 2006, it is now an integral part of the new structures that will support the further deve- lopment of the CFSP/ESDP. The Institute\u2019s core mis- sion is to provide analyses and recommendations that can be of use and relevance to the formulation of the European security and defence policy. In carrying out that mission, it also acts as an interface between European experts and decision-makers at all levels. Chaillot Papers are monographs on topical questions written either by a member of the EUISS research team or by outside authors chosen and commissioned by the Institute. Early drafts are normally discussed at a semi- nar or study group of experts convened by the Institute and publication indicates that the paper is considered by the EUISS as a useful and authoritative contribution to the debate on CFSP/ESDP. Responsibility for the views expressed in them lies exclusively with authors. Chaillot Papers are also accessible via the Institute\u2019s Website: www.iss.europa.eu ",

        "7 A mong the most notable events that feature on the calendar of the presidencies of the European Union are the EU summits, similar to those long held by the EU with the United States, involving the so-called strategic partners \u2013 Brazil, Canada, China, India, Japan, Russia and, from the 2008 French Presidency onwards, South Africa. The need to establish strategic partnerships with emerging global players and Russia, aside from those with the United States, Canada and Japan, was identified as an EU objective in pursuing effective multilateralism in the 2003 Euro- pean Security Strategy. Summit diplomacy of this kind offers a real possi- bility to deepen cooperation with each global player targeting bilateral issues, and to engage in a range of institutionalised dialogues addressing global issues. Summitry and strategic partnerships, both with established and aspiring global players, can thus be made to transcend the purely bilat- eral sphere to become privileged fora for jointly shaping the international agenda and, ideally, devising concerted strategies to tackle major challenges. The EU Institute for Security Studies has launched a multiannual proj- ect to explore how the EU should engage the \u2018new\u2019 global players and give substance to the strategic partnerships in the promotion of effective multi- lateralism. This Chaillot Paper is the first publication to result from this project. In 2007, the EUISS Annual Conference was largely devoted to this broad topic, which we will further explore in the context of the revamping of the EU\u2019s security strategy. A set of country analyses was prepared for Portugal\u2019s 2007 EU Presidency outlining how a number of global issues and challenges are perceived in Brazil, China, India and Russia. Four European experts were asked to analyse the scope for cooperation between the EU and these strategic partners in dealing with a set of issues identified in-house that addressed the political/security dimension, energy and the environment, trade and investment, regionalism and the future \u00c1lvaro de Vasconcelos Preface ",
        "8 world outlook. Four experts from those same countries were subsequently asked to produce a separate set of comments identifying opportunities for closer cooperation with Europe along the same lines. These contributions provided the basis for the comparative analysis outlined in the introductory and concluding chapters of this Chaillot Paper , which also draw on the findings of the 2007 Annual Conference. This study does not deal with two G8 members, Canada and Japan, or with increasingly important regional players like South Africa. Nor does it deal with the United States, although EU/US relations are more far-rang- ing, more complex and certainly more decisive for a future multilateral order than any other EU bilateral or bi-regional partnership. We have cho- sen to concentrate on the newer global players and Russia, the so-called BRIC countries, in order to understand how their aspiration or accession to great power status is altering the international system, and in what way EU bilateral strategic partnerships can be enhanced and gain more sub- stance and consistency, through the pursuit of common interests, to shape a multilateral world order. We are persuaded, however, that many of the conclusions that arise from this study will be of benefit to further exploring the potential of other existing strategic partnerships, and even informing future ones. A number of general points should inform the development of a coher- ent strategic vision of bilaterally-pursued multilateralism. First, the European Union is \u2013 and must continue to be \u2013 a global player because both the future of its own integration model and the well- being of its citizens are dependent on the evolution of a world governed by norms and rules. Second, multilateralism is stalling as multipolarity \u2013 even if this assumes an asymmetric form \u2013 progressively replaces the brief period of single-power dominance that followed the collapse of the bipolar world at the end of the Cold War. Third, bilateralism is a means to an end and not an end in itself. Regional dialogues should not be abandoned, nor the engagement with non-state actors. Fourth, when engaging newer world players, the question of trade and development cannot be pursued at the cost of abandoning the core issues of democratic governance and peace, whether relating to intra- or inter-state Preface ",
        "9 conflict. In this respect, as well as with regard to other pressing issues such as human rights, climate change or energy, strategic partnerships may differ considerably. The timeliness of this study has become evident. As its findings clearly demonstrate, in different ways and areas the engagement of the new world players is crucial in order to deal with today\u2019s global political and social challenges and to \u2018humanise globalisation\u2019, as Brazilian leaders have long been proposing. EU leaders have recently echoed this by stating the aim of \u2018shaping globalisation in the interests of all our citizens, based on our com- mon values and principles.\u2019 It is therefore a priority of this study to provide an in-depth analysis of how to build a common agenda on global gover- nance and understand the differences in current approaches, starting with the concept of multilateralism and what it takes to ensure its effectiveness. In short, the political priority for the European Union should be to trans- form its bilateral relations with global players in strategic partnerships in order to achieve an effective multilateralism.

        "\u2018Multilateralising\u2019 multipolarity \u00c1lvaro de Vasconcelos Raymond Aron once came to Lisbon for a cycle of conferences and interviews. This was in 1980, well before glasnost and perestroika had made their sudden appearance in the lexicon of international rela- tions, and when the world was still reeling from the first oil shock. Aron spoke a great deal about the new complexities of the interna- tional system. Back in those days, Aron was already arguing that the then seemingly eternal bipolar system would no longer provide a plausible basis for the interpretation of world conflicts and that the two superpowers would not be indefinitely able to contain, let alone resolve, \u2018peripheral\u2019 crises and wars, like the Iran-Iraq war that had just begun. He made it plain that energy dependency, notably in relation to oil \u2013 le sang des machines \u2013 was very much on his mind. In the years since 1989 a variety of theories have been proffered to provide interpretations of the post-Cold War era, seeking to explain all aspects of international reality under an all-encom- passing paradigm. Most of these simplistic explanations enjoyed ephemeral popularity, occasionally competing and overlapping at other times. The theories ranged from power-based interpreta- tions (e.g. the idea of a single superpower world hegemony) to the ideologically-based \u2018end of history\u2019 theory \u2013 incorporating an eco- nomicist variant according to which globalisation would squeeze any alternative to neo-liberalism out of existence \u2013 to the neocon- servatives\u2019 doctrine of unilateral military supremacy, proclaiming the inevitable victory of Mars. These were mirrored in the South by Messianic theories that were equally ideology-driven. Then cul- ture-driven theses made their appearance, inspired by the \u2018clash- of-civilisations\u2019 doctrine that attempts to explain conflict through cultural difference and proposes an antagonistic para- digm \u2013 democracy versus non-democracy, the first being a monop- oly of the West. As the twenty-first century unfolds, the world is far more com- plex than Raymond Aron could possibly have anticipated thirty 11 Partnerships for effective multilateralism EU relations with Brazil, China, India and Russia The author is indebted to Maria do Ros\u00e1rio de Moraes Vaz for her comments and sugges- tions . 1 ",
        "1 years ago. None of these various theories have been borne out by history, which stubbornly refuses to end. There is, however, a recognisably greater variety of actors (other than traditional actors, i.e. nations and states) that shape the world system and even the great powers among them are not as great or as powerful as they used to be. Worldwide interdependence \u2013 now termed \u2018globalisation\u2019 \u2013 has enabled the emergence of a variety of net- works, from human rights advocacy to organised crime, reinforc- ing the awareness that the global world is a plural world. To remain true to its nature and its stated objective of shaping a better world, the EU must have a clear and common understand- ing of the complex contemporary international political land- scape in which it is itself an important player. The European Union must achieve a truly global perspective that reflects its immense internal diversity, and fulfils the expectations that the Union elicits worldwide. This is a prerequisite for a multilateral order capable of coping with planetary challenges and averting disastrous polarising fractures. The emerging multipolarity After the fall of the Berlin Wall one of the recurring themes that attracted most scholarly debate was the search for a paradigm cov- ering both the way power is distributed among states and other international players and the crises that have erupted since then or persisted from the Cold War years, defying resolution to this day. This debate is intertwined, and occasionally indistinguishable, from the debate on the forms of world governance best suited to safeguard peace and security and address the vaster challenges that confront mankind. That a multipolar world was going to emerge from the ashes of the Cold War and the concomitant decline of America\u2019s increas- ingly questioned supremacy was already evident to Paul Kennedy, 1 who devised a four-pillar world built on the economic might of the United States, the European Union, Japan and China, with Russia accorded a special place of its own owing to a strategic arsenal that provided for \u2018nuclear superpower\u2019 status. In the euphoric 1990s, however, US power and supremacy were not yet declining, at least compared to potential competitors.

        "1 V\u00e9drine at the close of the Clinton era, was still able to rule the \u2018unipolar\u2019 world through what was then termed \u2018benign hege- mony\u2019. 2 This rare and exceptional moment that lasted through most of the eras of the George Bush Senior and Clinton adminis- trations coexisted with a renewed surge of regionalism that spread to every corner of the earth, and in which the United States was also actively engaged, albeit for self-centred reasons. Many schol- ars and politicians believed then that the age had dawned of a world system organised along the lines of more or less large regional groupings loosely modelled on the European Union. 3 In the most innovative analysis thus far on the changing nature of power in an era of human and economic interdependence, Joseph Nye convincingly argued that aside from economic and military power, in an information age, soft power \u2013 the power of attraction, the ability to shape the preferences of the others \u2013 would become more important in the mix of the components of state power. 4 Military power to ensure worldwide hegemony and dominance, the overriding concern of the bipolar world, is no longer the deter- mining factor. What is new and distinctive in the first decade of the twenty- first century is the growing recognition that we are indeed living in a multipolar world, albeit vastly asymmetrical as to how power, both soft and hard, is distributed and shared on the planetary scale. The post-Cold War world has entered a phase characterised by the emergence of new global players, active well beyond their own borders. In the present international system, the combina- tion of US hard power and European soft power is no longer suffi- cient to confront most global problems, even in the peace and security arena, although it remains a necessary requirement to build sustainable solutions. The term \u2018multipolarity\u2019 thus refers to the emergence of a plu- rality of global actors, who limit the power of the US superpower and that of other \u2018poles\u2019 such as the EU. More specifically, it refers to the rise of China and increasingly India, to the resurgence of Russia and to the growing importance of players like Brazil, par- ticularly in the sphere of international trade. In Brazil, which ranks among the \u2018mammoth countries\u2019, there is a consensus that its major power status is conditional on its ability to lead an inte- grated South America. The US share of the world\u2019s wealth is steadily decreasing. More significantly, this is happening in parallel to the declining 13 \u00c1lvaro de Vasconcelos 2.

        "1 attraction of the American model, a phenomenon that became acutely apparent from the 2003 invasion of Iraq onwards. This was accompanied by a palpable erosion of the US human rights record symbolised in the eyes of the world by the arbitrary detention and inhuman treatment of suspects in Guantanamo Bay prison camp. Reliable measurements of world opinion show a steady decline in approval ratings for the US among Europeans and indeed in many other parts of the world and show how this relates directly to a widespread rejection of US policies and its use of military power (the same polls indicate that this reflects only marginally on atti- tudes to the American people as such). The Pew Global Survey has found that after the Iraq war the image of the United States was tarnished virtually everywhere. It remains \u2018abysmal in most Mus- lim countries in the Middle East and Asia, and continues to deteri- orate among the publics of many of America\u2019s oldest allies. In terms of poll ratings, favourable views of the US are down to single digits in Turkey (9%) and have declined to 15% in Pakistan. Cur- rently, just 30% of Germans have a positive view of the US \u2013 down from 42% as recently as two years ago \u2013 and favourable ratings are sliding ever lower in Great Britain and Canada.\u2019 5 Because they are primarily policy-related, views of the United States could of course change dramatically in the post-Bush era. As measured simply by the share of the world\u2019s GDP at pur- chasing power parity (PPP), today\u2019s major powers are the Euro- pean Union (21.95%), the United States (21.06%), China (10.70%), Japan (6.57%), India (6.17%), Russia (2.69%), and Brazil (2.58%). The asymmetry in wealth and economic might, especially when compared to the sheer size of population, is glaringly obvious. 6 When considering military power and strategic power projection capabilities, the United States still come, however, a distant first \u2013 although the limits of US military power were already becoming clear before the intervention in Iraq. Of the emerging powers, China has over the last few years been credited with engaging in a significant military build-up. In 2006, Chinese military expendi- ture was 49.5 billion dollars and represented an increase of 11.7% in relation to the previous year, which had amounted to double the figures for the year 2000. 7 The US Department of Defense esti- mates that China\u2019s total military-related spending for 2007 could amount to anything between 97 billion dollars and 139 billion dollars. 8 This is still a modest sum, however, when compared with US (over 528 billion dollars in 2006, almost half of the world total) 14 'Multilateralising' multipolarity 5.

The analysis of present world rankings based on comparing military might \u2013 the basis of unipolar and bipolar supremacy doctrines \u2013 is in any case ill-adapted to a world dominated by eco- nomic globalisation and the information society and with a nas- cent public space at regional and global levels which gives added moral strength to international humanitarian law. Thus increas- ing \u2018global\u2019 constraints are put on the use of military power, already severely hampered by domestic public opinion adverse to troops being sent to fight in large-scale wars abroad. Integration into the world system together with great power status and international influence, including the crucial aspect of agenda-setting, are today predicated not just on military force and the ability to use it but in larger measure on the ability to promote sustained human development. This confronts states with the need to balance aspirations to world power status with the demands of interdependence and the weight of elements of soft power. Robert Kagan ridiculed European power, 10 mistaking the preference for multilateralism and soft power in EU foreign policy for weakness. As Pierre Hassner has noted, however, while Kagan is certainly right in ranking US operational military power and capa- bilities far above the EU\u2019s, he is wrong in identifying leadership and might with military power alone and the willingness to use it 16 'Multilateralising' multipolarity 10.

        "1 unsparingly, \u2018as the cruel reality from Afghanistan to the Lebanon and Iraq, sadly and abundantly demonstrates.\u2019 11 The growth in awareness of the need to protect human rights across borders that has accompanied economic and technological globalisation, together with the requirement for environmental protection and compliance with multilateral principles of inter- national behaviour, have been at the root of the popularity of the European model. The combined attractiveness of its social model, together with its sheer economic size, has given Europe a great deal of \u2018soft power\u2019. Yet Europe still punches below its weight in the international arena. Two of Joseph Nye\u2019s attributes of power 12 are missing \u2013 unity and military capability \u2013 which the United States possesses and which would be essential if the Union were to act decisively in dealing with crucial international problems. When considering the combined effect of these attributes of power, how- ever, in which the attractiveness of the model, values and public diplomacy, including at the multilateral level, are important vari- ables, it becomes apparent that the European Union is a world player on a par with others. The European Union: a \u2018diffuse\u2019 pillar of the global system The European Union is unquestionably a world player, but its precise role defies attempts at categorisation in traditional terms. The EU, in view of its uniqueness, is not directly comparable to any other world player. Like others, however, its real power is also a function of the way such power and the limits of its usability are perceived by other players. Doubtless, the EU still suffers from a deficit of recognition as a political actor enjoying the full array of traditional attributes of power. It is often dismissed as a mere \u2018toothless\u2019 civilian power and, conversely, accused of traditional superpower ambitions as it ven- tures into the wider security arena through CFSP/ESDP. This con- stitutes simultaneously an asset in that it is often seen as an unthreat- ening power and a liability in that it is viewed as a structurally weak force for good. The exact reverse happens when it is accused of engag- ing in power politics without enough clout to inspire sufficient awe or respect. This is certainly one of the paradoxes of EU efforts at ush- ering in effective multilateralism. The paradox is compounded by the recognition (not least by the EU itself) that the Union is both a large part and an indispensable maker of the world order. 17 \u00c1lvaro de Vasconcelos 11.

        "1 The internal debate around Europe puissance or Economic Europe ( Europe espace ) fails to capture the full potential of the EU in the world system. The EU will never become a military \u2018pole\u2019 replicating the United States \u2013 not so much because it lacks the power and the ability, but because it lacks the willingness to do so. Nor will it regress, as some would have it, to the pre-CFSP \u2018huge marketplace\u2019 stage, confined to the modest role of a leading eco- nomic player, deprived even of the full might of a civilian power. As continental expansion, through EU enlargement, is perfected and the opportunities of a global world are fully realised and exploited, this largely senseless debate will tend to subside, and the EU will shape and gradually affirm its international identity, no longer in contrast to or alongside the United States alone but in relation to a variety of major international actors. This will be achieved however in an adverse context, as the hopes and predictions formulated in the 1990s that the European model of deep integration would be emulated in other continents have not yet been realised. We are further away from a world of regions, closer to a world of powers: this is what multipolarity really means today. As new powers emerge, their wish to acquire a more global influence also increases, often to the detriment of efforts to achieve regional integration. This coexists however, in today\u2019s \u2018global\u2019 world, in the age of interdependence, with a shared awareness that a larger set of issues than ever before in the so- called global agenda can only be addressed through commonly- driven, worldwide efforts, calling for international standards and global governance. The Union has a genuine interest in playing a prominent global role. Its own model of integration is the most advanced form of multilateralism, and its experience equips it with a global reach. Due to the nature of the Union, its own survival is linked to the development of an international system based on norms and rules. In a revisited balance-of-power system, how long would it take for the EU to break apart under the competing pressure of clashing unilateralisms? Agonising divisions over Iraq, and to a lesser extent over Kosovo and Palestine, illustrate this point. In a global system shaped by norms and rules, the Union can play a major role in pursuing its own interests and by doing so avoid a power-based system where it could aspire to little more than a complementary role to that of the United States.

The new global actors perceive the EU in different ways. For some, like China and Brazil, the Union is a global political actor whose importance goes beyond the sphere of trade. Brazil and China, for different reasons, welcome a Europe that would play a more proactive political role internationally, as a way of ensuring a more balanced world and an alternative to an all-too-exclusive relation with the United States. However, both tend to see the Union first and foremost as an economic power and thus a poten- tial ally in driving forward economic development goals, although the disagreements between the Union and its partners from the South in the WTO negotiations are notorious. Chinese political elites view the European Union as a major world economic power 13 and a courted partner, particularly in terms of science and technology cooperation, and thus as a major strategic partner in achieving the much-vaunted goal of \u2018China\u2019s peaceful rise\u2019 14 through economic development. Brazil, whose foreign policy has traditionally been conceived primarily as a driver of economic development, also perceives the Union as a very important economic partner and a source of inspiration for regional integration. India, where foreign policy elites have tended to perceive the Union mainly as a trade actor, is quite sceptical about the EU\u2019s ability to play a relevant political and security role, particularly when it comes to Asia. Reflecting Russia\u2019s status as a European power, the Russian government\u2019s views of the European Union are more complex. The EU is certainly a prized economic partner, particularly when it comes to the energy sector where there is a growing interdependence between Russia and the rest of Europe. 15 Moscow however is not entirely comfortable with the idea of the EU taking on a more significant political role in the common neighbourhood. Because it is seen as a force that may counter its own ambitions, the Russian government has ceased to perceive the EU as a genuinely benign power and does not wel- come the development of the EU as a fully-fledged international security actor. 16 Another difficulty that arises in terms of the perception of the external identity of the EU is the fact that it is often confused, for better and for worse, with its Member States, the former colonial powers in particular. The strong international identity of a 19 \u00c1lvaro de Vasconcelos 13. See Feng, p. 80. 14. This term was coined by Zheng Bijian, former deputy to President Hu Jintao.

        "1 number of European powers both constrains and adds to the rele- vance of the EU as an international actor. Strong bilateral links are a facilitator of identification for third countries with the Euro- pean Union. This was the case with Latin American countries when Portugal and Spain joined the European Community. How- ever foreign policy initiatives conducted by individual Member States outside the EU mainstream can also reflect negatively on the EU as a whole. This is particularly the case in the peace and security arena, where Europe\u2019s divisions most adversely affect the EU\u2019s international identity and the way it is perceived by others. What is of crucial relevance for the Union is the fact that the \u2018internal\u2019 is to a great extent also \u2018external\u2019. EU soft power is owed in no small measure to the magnetic attraction of its own multilateral integration modelled on \u2018unity within diversity\u2019. Such a model could not survive a cultural/religious definition of EU identity. In this light, the EU now needs to prove that it is able to integrate its migrant communities, particularly those originating from coun- tries where the majority of the population is Muslim. The world is particularly attentive to its ability to integrate Turkey as well as its capacity to develop a positive approach to migration. 17 However one could concur with Celso Lafer\u2019s view that, seen through the eyes of citizens in many quarters of the world, \u2018the European experience of consolidating peace and prosperity under the rule of law is, from a Kantian perspective, a sign of the possi- bilities for progress in human affairs. Because of its political iden- tity, and its worldwide impact, the European Union is a force for peace, human rights, diplomacy and multilateralism. That is why the EU can be called an international public good.\u2019 18 Is the EU a regional or a global power? With eastward expansion and accession negotiations with Turkey under way, the Union has not only a common border and a com- mon neighbourhood with Russia but is also becoming closer to Central Asia, and therefore much closer to China and India. In this sense, engaging with the BRICs, and in particular the Asian powers, is vital for the stability of the wider neighbourhood of an enlarged EU. This is a reality of which the Russians are acutely aware and that the Chinese and Indians, who still see Europe predominantly as a regional security player, have yet to realise.

        "1 Europe\u2019s political influence in Asia (other than its omnipresence in trade and investment), in stark contrast to a strong US presence there, partly accounts for the predominance of its regional-power image in India and China. India is acutely aware of Europe\u2019s non-involvement in the string of conflicts peppering its own neighbourhood alongside its extensive borders. Brazil, and the whole of Latin America, is gener- ally more sensitive to Europe\u2019s distinctiveness as a fully-fledged international actor and not only in the framework of the World Trade Organisation. The days of Europe\u2019s involvement in bring- ing peace to Central America 19 are not quite forgotten, as well as the efforts to build bi-regional strategic relationships based on a web of \u2018third generation agreements\u2019 with Mercosul (a EU- inspired sub-regional integration process which values the \u2018Euro- pean model\u2019), the Andean Community or the project of a South America Community. Efforts at democracy-promotion on the part of the EU are also taken more seriously than elsewhere: Latin American countries provide a unique case at government level, for example, in welcoming EU conditionality clauses in agreements governing bilateral relations. The weight and the particular role of major players such as India and China, major Asian powers alongside Japan and Russia (as well as the United States) in shaping the international system, must however be fully taken into account irrespective of the way they currently perceive the EU\u2019s international identity. Awareness on the part of the EU of this obvious reality is clearly demon- strated by the recommendation on strategic partnerships con- tained in the 2003 Solana document. Between them, India and China, both nuclear powers, represent over a third of humanity, a proportion that will only increase by the middle and the turn of this century. Their perception of the EU as a relevant global player on a par with the United States will increasingly depend on the way in which the EU will fill the \u2018empty chair\u2019 in Asia. India is still clearly more Asia-centred than global-minded, not least perhaps because Asia itself is seen in India as a multipolar continent. In explaining why Europe was left out altogether of an analysis of powers that matter to Asia, Maharajakrishna Rasgotra candidly states that \u2018Europe is unlikely to be drawn in the power politics of a resurgent Asia. At best, Europe\u2019s role in Asia in the foreseeable future \u2026 will be a secondary one of support to the United States.\u2019 20 21 \u00c1lvaro de Vasconcelos 19. The very first success of a for- eign and security policy avant la let- tre (EPC, European Political Co- operation) in the early 1980s was the San Jos\u00e9 Dialogue, in existence to this day, which played an im- portant role in restoring peace in Central America. 20.

        "1 However, in view of the centrality of the EU\u2019s own periphery in the global security agenda, in particular the wider Mediterranean neighbourhood stretching towards Iraq and Iran, not only will Europe\u2019s ability as a security provider increasingly contribute to its increased world relevance, but the involvement of China (as was made painfully obvious in Darfur) and India must be actively sought. Both these Asian powers show a growing interest not only in Africa (e.g. Indian and Chinese summitry, including the EU- China partnership for Africa) but also in the wider Mediterranean and other parts of Europe\u2019s periphery. Many of the challenges the EU\u2019s neighbours are facing are indeed global problems calling for global answers. This is obvi- ously true of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the issue of Iran, questions dominating the UN Security Council agenda, or the importance of the Middle East and the Caucasus for energy secu- rity \u2013 a major concern of all the global players. In sum, if the Euro- pean Union is to be a world power, it has to be a regional power first, in view of the nature and centrality of its regional environ- ment. It is essential to bear in mind that the most important EU contribution to world peace has been the consolidation of a wide area of peace and democracy that goes from Portugal to Russia\u2019s borders. The eventual expansion of this area, through inclusion without full membership, to its southern and eastern neighbours would certainly have a major impact on the world order. Multilateralism and multipolarity are far from synonymous It is essential to distinguish between multipolarity and multilater- alism. The first is an expression of the way power is distributed at world level, the second an expression of how that reality should be acted upon, in other words of how that power should be used and to what ends. Multipolarity heralds a more complex international system, consistent with today\u2019s international distribution of power and the way it is both maximised and constrained by global interdependence. When the multipolar system predominated in nineteenth-cen- tury Europe, and by extension the world, it was formed by state enti- ties, whose main concern was to even out and perpetuate the bal- ance of power, which was largely symmetrical, between them. 21 The balance-of-power system which prevailed into the first half of the 22 'Multilateralising' multipolarity 21.

        "1 twentieth century did not, and indeed could not, prevent outbreaks of large-scale war whenever the balance was badly upset. Two world wars in Europe bear eloquent testimony to this obvious truth. The fact remains that leaders in many parts of the world, including Europe, assign a normative dimension to multipolarity, arguing that a multipolar balance of power and resulting alliance building in particular, serves as a counterweight to US power. This is certainly the case from the standpoint of China and Russia who have issued several joint statements calling for a multipolar world. 22 For them it is essential to challenge what they perceive as American hegemony, on the basis of what the Chinese call their policy of a \u2018harmonious world\u2019 and the Russians \u2018sovereign democracy\u2019. 23 In India, whose view of the international distribu- tion of power hangs almost exclusively on considerations of inter- national security, many still rather conservatively regard the world as unipolar \u2018with a fringe of multipolarity, in which the \u2026United States of America sets the global agenda.\u2019 24 India seeks to affirm its role in the global arena and considers that its new strategic alliance with the United States \u2018can make a difference in this quest.\u2019 25 And in Brazil, the world is seen as becoming multipolar indeed, although in an asymmetric and unfair way particularly as regards the distribution of wealth. An equally unfair representa- tion in the institutions of global governance contributes to weaken multilateralism. 26 According to Marco Aur\u00e9lio Garcia, \u2018as long as a new global governance and its attendant multipolar order are not ushered in, ad hoc groupings such as the G8 will con- tinue to prosper.\u2019 27 As Jean-Marie Gu\u00e9henno suggests, the inter- national system cannot be sustained under \u2018the indefinite supremacy of the United States, nor on the pursuit of independ- ence and sovereignty as the ultimate goal of a political entity.\u2019 28 The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, established in 2001, which brings together China and Russia, along with Central Asian states, is not only an important factor in creating a framework for a cooperative relationship between the two great powers to work together to deal with challenges on their borders. It also has a balance of power dimension in that it serves as a platform for chal- lenging what at least some of its members see as \u2018a threat of both strategic and philosophical unipolarity in international rela- tions.\u2019 29 This kind of agreement indicates the potential for the emergence of alliances typical of the balance of power system, in the context of the new multipolar world order. 23 \u00c1lvaro de Vasconcelos 22. \u2018Russia and China stand for a multipolar, just and democratic world order based on the com- monly recognised principles of in- ternational law,\u2019 Presidents Vladimir Putin and Hu Jintao said in a joint statement, CNSNews. com, 28 May 2003. 23.

        "1 Europeans have yet to agree on a common vision, as was made abundantly clear during the Iraq crisis. Some still favour American supremacy and prefer to think of the world as unipolar, conceiving the multipolar argument as a sort of subversive balance-of-power scheme meant to act as a counterweight to and ultimately to con- tain the United States. Within the EU, the debate around describ- ing the world as unipolar or multipolar is thus largely a debate about the nature of the relationship with the United States, whether this takes the form of automatic alignment or policies to balance the US\u2019s power through a coalition strategy. 30 The crisis over Iraq has demonstrated, however, that both the UK unipolar option for alignment with the US and Jacques Chirac\u2019s multipolar policy of coalition-building to curtail US power were equally impotent to influence the Bush administration and, furthermore, utterly divisive within the Union. Unquestionably, had the EU been able to speak with one voice at the UN Security Council it would have carried considerably more influence and \u2013 perhaps \u2013 succeeded in preventing the Iraq war and its catastrophic conse- quences. The new global players broadly agree that multilateralism can only emerge from multipolarity, i.e. a balanced distribution of the ability of individual powers to prevent unilateral options from prevailing. Whether this is true or not, the fact remains that, having delegitimised power politics on the European continent, the EU cannot defend power politics on a global scale. The influ- ence of the Union, as this study once again illustrates, will cru- cially depend on its ability to uphold its founding principles and values in the international arena, apply them consistently within the Union and shape a global agenda where they feature promi- nently. International relations models that are alien to the experi- ence of European construction \u2013 in other words, unilateralism(s) \u2013 cannot unite the Member States of the Union and lack the nec- essary support of the European public. The EU would have noth- ing to gain and everything to lose if it operated in a world gov- erned by unstable power games, in which it was one among various competing power players. If it is to have its say in world politics today the EU needs to work within a system governed by rules and norms. The EU needs a world governed by an encom- passing and effective multilateral system if it is to exert its influ- ence. 24 'Multilateralising' multipolarity 30. See \u00c1lvaro de Vasconcelos, \u2018Back to the future? Strengthening EU/Mercosul Relations and Re- viving Multilateralism\u2019, Chaire Mercosur, Sciences Po, Paris, 2004. ",
        "1 This means that the EU wishes to see strong international organisations, notably those entrusted with peace and security governance, operating in binding mutually-agreed regimes to be effective in confronting global issues. This naturally entails that breaches of universally accepted norms must not be allowed to go without punishment, and governance schemes have to be gradu- ally freed from the recurring veto-paralysis that made them largely ineffective throughout the Cold War era. This also means that burdens must be evenly spread out and world powers must be will- ing to face up to contributing their fair share. There is scope and, some will argue, pressing necessity, for the current and aspiring world powers to agree on a global agenda for sustainable human development, including the protection of civilians, and on a truly effective multilateral system. Obviously, military conflict has not vanished from the face of the earth, nor will it vanish overnight in spite of their concerted efforts. But it is increasingly obvious that the worst-case scenario \u2013 barring serious miscalculation and total failure of diplomacy \u2013 is conceivably no longer one of military confrontation among the \u2018great powers\u2019, whether real or imagined, but rather one of \u2018peaceful competi- tion\u2019. In this sense, the security paradigm that has dominated the Cold War bipolar era has lost relevance. There will be no world war for the foreseeable future. All conflicts, however violent, however painful and costly in human lives and resources, are peripheral conflicts, fought on the margins of the international system. Not because they do not and will not involve great powers (e.g. Iraq, Kashmir) but because they do not set them directly or indirectly on a collision course where excessive self-confidence could degen- erate into the self-defeating use of military force. Contemporary wars, furthermore, are not predominantly interstate conflicts even when they involve two or more states directly, but mainly wars against civilians. Asymmetry in warfare, incidentally, is mostly a consequence of this fact. In this context, what defines the relative weight of global play- ers is not only the ability to confront each other but also and increasingly so the capacity to provide security and welfare for their citizens and others, by addressing the global dimension of those same needs. The dividing line between the internal and external dimension of politics is increasingly blurred. This holds true for the whole world, not merely for the European Union. 25 \u00c1lvaro de Vasconcelos ",
        "1 Shaping a universal concept of effective multilateralism As a multipolar world is emerging just as the multilateral system shows unmistakable signs of growing weakness, the EU needs to recognise that the international distribution of power is fluid enough to warrant establishing \u2018special\u2019 relationships with aspiring world players while, at the same time, focusing on its primary goal of promoting global and regional governance and \u2018effective multilater- alism.\u2019 By this, as policy-drivers emanating from the Union, includ- ing the European Security Strategy, make clear, it is meant that mul- tilateralism must function as an enabler of the international community to deal with major global and regional issues. Effective multilateralism is therefore a system designed to enable the states that form the international community to act together in con- fronting challenges, tackling and resolving problems. It is not a tool for mutual containment and resulting paralysis. When it comes to world peace, as it is stressed in the ESS, the European Union wants \u2018international organisations, regimes and treaties to be effective in confronting threats to international peace and security, and must therefore be ready to act when their rules are broken.\u2019 31 This expression as well as the concept of \u2018effective multilateral- ism\u2019 ties directly into the notion of \u2018assertive multilateralism\u2019, as it was termed in the 1990s, following George Bush Senior\u2019s new world order successes, from the happy ending of the Cold War to the UN-legitimised Gulf War. Madeleine Albright, in the first year of the pro-multilateralist Clinton administration, argued that the US should pursue assertive multilateralism \u2018by increasing its reliance on international institutions, rules, and partnerships \u2026 the United States might better manage transnational problems, spread the burdens of world leadership, win legitimacy for its goals and actions, and consolidate the expanding community of free market democracies.\u2019 32 This concept was a victim of the strategic debate that followed the enormous difficulties of the UN-man- dated US intervention in Somalia, and later the Bosnia debacle. UN-bashing was very much on the rise in the run-up to the triumph of the neo-conservatives\u2019 military unilateralism. 33 As defined by the European Union, effective multilateralism is very much a response to the unilateralist posture of the Bush administration and the reaffirmation, albeit in a less favourable environment, that it is possible to find in the UN the legitimacy and the capacity to deal with international security and other global issues. 26 'Multilateralising' multipolarity 31.

        "1 Newer and aspiring world powers, however, have a different conception of multilateralism from that of the European Union, closer to the containment of the more powerful states and the assertion of their own sovereignty than to playing their part in building an effective multilateral system. Whether they are/become members of the UN Security Council or not, they need yet to take on the global responsibilities that their status and ambition should confer upon them, namely contributing to a fairer international order which is better able to regulate or \u2018humanise\u2019 globalisation so it can benefit all, and above all, to address the increasing global disorder. This means in no small way facing up to global problems from poverty alleviation to environ- mental safety and disease control within their own borders, as well as preventing or punishing ethnic cleansing and genocide. Among the BRIC 34 countries, Brazil (and most Latin American states with it) is the most committed to multilateralism. 35 Brazil, which is closer to the civilian power tradition, given the emphasis put on regionalism and international trade, can share the multi- lateral perspective of the European Union. The same can to a cer- tain extent be said of India, due to its democratic nature, tradi- tional leadership of the non-aligned movement and the enduring influence of Gandhi\u2019s non-violent tradition and the popularity of human security doctrines, which leads some commentators to classify it as a wielder of soft power. 36 However, India, China, and Russia are states with a \u2018strong sovereignty\u2019 posture, which leads to a natural tendency to favour bilateralism and take a much more conservative view of multilateralism. 37 Regionalism, one of the most promising aspects of international political developments in the 1990s, is being challenged by multipolarity and the con- comitant tendency towards bilateralism. The fact that during the first Portuguese Presidency of the EU (1992), the first ministerial meeting between the EU and Mercosul took place, whereas there was no meeting with Mercosul during the third Portuguese Presi- dency (2007) but, instead, the first summit with Brazil, is a clear example of this development. 38 The way the other major players perceive the international order and the role of the EU in shaping it is intimately linked to the way they perceive EU-US relations and EU relations with the other global players. India, who proudly claims to be the world\u2019s largest democracy, considers the EU preference for its relationship with China a paradox. In fact, China is seen by the EU as a constructive 27 \u00c1lvaro de Vasconcelos 34.

        "1 partner despite the difficulties existing in the bilateral human rights agenda. 39 In the future, the EU will have to find a balance in its relationships with these two major Asian powers. How the Union deals with multipolarity in the twenty-first century, and organises its web of \u2018strategic partnerships\u2019 will be underpinned by the view that without them key international problems cannot be resolved satisfactorily. The impotence of the international community in the face of poverty, humanitarian dis- asters, environmental degradation, and peripheral conflicts from Darfur to the Middle East, is not only the product of the abandon- ment of multilateral diplomacy by the US, but it is also a result of the lack of commitment of other big powers. But all of them recog- nise more and more that as they emerge as global players they need to share more responsibility. It is not for the European Union to reopen an international debate on the merits of \u2018engagement\u2019 and \u2018containment\u2019, with a view to its relations with China and Russia, that is already closed. 40 The Union needs to pursue an expanding, rule-based, positive agenda with all its global partners around trade and development issues, as well as more divisive issues such as human rights and freedom of expression. EU cooperation policy towards China and India is still essentially based on development aid. 41 There is a clear need for a shift to the coherent promotion of sustainable development along the same lines as the renewed Lisbon Strategy, prioritising innovation, education and the environment through cooperative programmes and recognising that India and China are today major economic players engaged in a process of fast sci- entific and technological development. 42 This shift is already pro- posed in the 2007-2013 EU Country Strategic Papers on China and India where the EU defines its relations with both countries, which are moving away from their status of ODA recipients towards that of strategic partners. 43 It is not enough, however, to work jointly for a global agenda focused on development, whatever its intrinsic benefits. Aspiring world powers and other major actors in the international sphere also need to make a collective effort to prevent major humanitar- ian tragedies, including those arising as a result of climate change and subsequent natural disasters, and those emerging from the crises and conflicts that still plague international life. One of the most difficult issues that need to be addressed in the strategic dia- logue with the global partners concerns the conditions for the 28 'Multilateralising' multipolarity 39.

        "1 legitimate use of military force. In spite of the widespread opposi- tion to military intervention, including on humanitarian grounds, generated after the US intervention in Iraq, circum- stances remain in which it is both legitimate and necessary to resort to the use of force to prevent crimes against humanity, for instance, without the consent of warring parties. The interna- tional community cannot remain powerless in the face of geno- cide, as in Rwanda or Darfur, without losing its legitimacy. One of the gravest risks confronting the current international system, which indeed represents the greatest challenge to multi- lateralism, arises from the grave distortion prompted by the so- called cultural/civilisational paradigm that divides the world into potentially hostile civilisational blocs, pitching the \u2018West\u2019 against the \u2018Rest\u2019. The latter, in Huntington\u2019s definition, is made up of the potential alliance of Islam and Confucianism. While this makes little sense, the possibility of the emergence of a future US-China bipolarity, replicating the rift of the Cold War era, cannot totally be discounted. It is one of the possible configurations of the regression of the international system outlined above. A grand coalition of the West is neither a desirable nor a viable way to build a multilateral world order. The world order no longer hinges largely on the long-sought partnership of equals between the EU and the US, but rather on a vaster, inclusive global partner- ship among old, new and aspiring world players around the imple- mentation of a commonly agreed international agenda. This is not compatible with the armed \u2018league of democracies\u2019 under American leadership proposal, 44 which would severely weaken the United Nations. The same can be said of the project to open NATO membership to \u2018any democracy in the world.\u2019 45 To avoid the trans- formation of NATO into a global alliance, an alliance of the democracies against the rest, is certainly a priority of the EU if it is to achieve its aim of building an effective multilateral system able to integrate all powers. Equally, attempts at establishing a division of labour between the US\u2019s hard power and the EU\u2019s soft power \u2013 incorporating a minor military component apt to deal with nation-building and similar tasks, while the use of hard power remains essentially the preserve of the US \u2013 are detrimental to a fair and just multilateral world order. It follows that effective mul- tilateralism is not achievable without a major change in America\u2019s foreign policy. The US is a crucial element of the future world order.

        "1 window of opportunity. There are many in America who think that it is high time to reach out to others and give all global players a stake in upholding the international order. This would bring back the United States as a powerful force behind the multilateral order of which it was the \u2018founding father\u2019 after World War Two. Shaping a universal concept of \u2018effective multilateralism\u2019 calls for engaging in a dialogue about what \u2018effective multilateralism\u2019 really means not only with the great powers but with the entire international community. This is not an easy task. European for- eign policy can only be fully successful if it contributes to the \u2018mul- tilateralisation of multipolarity,\u2019 and forges strategic partnerships with regions or countries that the EU identifies as the most suited to deal with current global problems. 46 The European Union has developed an extensive network of bilateral partnerships and sum- mit meetings with individual powers, with important regional groups, such as ASEAN, the African Union, Mercosul or Latin America, and with its southern neighbours in the context of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership. The development of a shared economic and even political bilat- eral agenda among the great powers, however, cannot distract the EU from the growing importance of other global players: regional or inter-regional associations, states, international organisations, and non-governmental organisations, which are sometimes the best standard bearers of the universal values advocated by the EU to govern global regulation, the most reliable defenders of human rights and the best allies to \u2018multilateralise multipolarity\u2019. The only way to give longer-term consistency to summit diplomacy is to involve not just the governments in pursuing the stated objec- tives but to create a more extensive network of relations between the civil societies of all our partners including in the countries where non-governmental actors face more difficulties. As Javier Solana asserted: \u2018Going beyond a government-centric world view, dominated by the West, is what 21 st century diplomacy will demand.\u2019 47 The EU definition of an effective multilateral order implies the need to use military power in certain circumstances, to confront real challenges to international peace and security. This should be done under the UN umbrella with the full cooperation of regional organisations and the newer global players, in particular demo- cratic India, Brazil and South Africa who form the South-South coalition, India, Brazil and South Africa Dialogue Forum 30 'Multilateralising' multipolarity 46. See Nicole Gnesotto and Gio- vanni Grevi, The Global Puzzle, What World Order for the EU in 2050? (Paris: EUISS, 2006).

Building consensus around the principle and practice of the responsibility to protect with China and Russia is also essential, not only to avoid obstruction at UNSC voting level but also in view of the contribu- tion they can and must make to international security. Conclusion It is arguable that the EU\u2019s role as a major world player is condi- tional upon its ability to shape a world order based on a new multi- lateralism. 49 The EU\u2019s contribution should encompass three dis- tinctive dimensions. First, promoting the right and obligation to protect , which arises from the sense that the international community and the United Nations in particular are responsible for the protection of the rights of individuals, above and beyond sovereign boundaries. This implies EU activism in supporting human rights and democ- racy, including through bilateral partnerships with all global play- ers. Such an approach coincides with the vision that Kofi Annan called for in his Millennium speech: \u2018the sovereignty of a state can- not be a protecting wall for the violation of the rights of man.\u2019 Second, the recognition of the benefits of regionalism , a phenomenon that should be actively encouraged by the European Union so it can develop into a structural feature of the international system as a whole. This implies that the Union needs to develop a nexus of group-to-group partnerships with regional groups and to include regional integration as a priority of its bilateral agenda with global players. And third, the emergence of a global public opinion , a \u2018second wave\u2019 of globalisation, which expresses the desire of civil society to influ- ence or participate in global decision-making. Like the globalisa- tion of trade, finance and services, this dimension of globalisation has spawned the need for enhanced multilateral governance. This implies a strong involvement on the part of the EU with NGOs at all levels of external action. In the current international system, the common good requires effective global governance, as recently restated by the European Council. 50 But global governance in turn calls for an 31 \u00c1lvaro de Vasconcelos 48. This trilateral initiative was formalised in June 2003 in the first meeting of the three countries that took place in Brasilia.

        "1 adaptation of international organisations to the new structure of world power. As long as the structures of global governance, from the UN Security Council to the IMF, do not fully integrate the new power centres of the international system, the tendency will be for the proliferation of competing and largely ineffectual ad hoc groupings. Bilateralism and the concomitant trend to set up unstable alliances will also continue to prosper. But such ad hoc forms of leadership, while they may have a role to play in building bridges, are unable to substitute for the multilateral order in which newer or aspiring great powers will be able to fully take on their international responsibilities. 32 'Multilateralising' multipolarity ",

Une politique internationale domin\u00e9e par un petit nombre de p\u00f4les de pouvoir politico-mili- taires et fond\u00e9e sur un jeu d\u2019\u00e9quilibre entre grandes puissances, ne leur est donc pas tr\u00e8s favorable car elle ne leur offrirait qu\u2019un espace restreint, celui du choix d\u2019un alignement subordonn\u00e9. Aussi, les deux parties veulent-elles promouvoir la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019une diversit\u00e9 de points de vue et l\u2019\u00e9mergence d\u2019un monde comptant plusieurs acteurs ou \u00ab p\u00f4les \u00bb importants, \u00e0 condition que le syst\u00e8me inter- national soit soumis \u00e0 des r\u00e8gles et au droit international garantis par des proc\u00e9dures et institutions multilat\u00e9rales. La construction europ\u00e9enne est elle-m\u00eame un exemple, au niveau r\u00e9gional, de la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019une telle perspective. Quant au Br\u00e9sil, sa tradition diplomatique s\u2019est toujours oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 la logique d\u2019\u00e9quilibre de puissances et a fermement d\u00e9fendu le droit international et les institutions multilat\u00e9rales globales (Con- f\u00e9rence de Paix de 1907, SDN, ONU) ou r\u00e9gionales (Union panam\u00e9ricaine, puis Organisation des Etats am\u00e9ricains [OEA] et aujourd\u2019hui, Mercosur et Unasur), fond\u00e9es sur l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 juridique d\u2019Etats acceptant, de plein gr\u00e9, des r\u00e8gles d\u00e9finies en commun 1 .

En contrepartie, l\u2019Union constitue le principal march\u00e9 pour les produits br\u00e9siliens (pr\u00e8s de 22% des ses exportations totales, dont 56% de produits manufac- tur\u00e9s ou semi-manufactur\u00e9s).

Il n\u2019est donc pas \u00e9tonnant que durant la derni\u00e8re d\u00e9cennie, les relations entre les deux r\u00e9gions aient \u00e9t\u00e9 domin\u00e9es par les questions commerciales et la coop\u00e9ration 2 . Les relations institutionnelles UE-Br\u00e9sil sont relativement r\u00e9centes.

Force est de constater cependant, que, depuis la mise en place de l\u2019Accord-cadre de coop\u00e9ration UE-Mercosur de 1995 et l\u2019ouverture formelle de n\u00e9gociations en vue d\u2019un accord de libre-\u00e9change avec les pays du C\u00f4ne Sud, l\u2019UE a privil\u00e9gi\u00e9 le volet commercial de sa relation avec le Br\u00e9sil, ainsi qu\u2019une politique de soutien au processus d\u2019int\u00e9gration du Mercosur 3 .

Pour le Br\u00e9sil, l\u2019Europe repr\u00e9sente \u00e9galement un contrepoids dans sa relation avec les Etats-Unis. Non pas une illusoire \u00ab alter- native \u00bb aux rapports tr\u00e8s \u00e9troits avec le grand voisin du Nord, mais un partenaire permettant de temp\u00e9rer ce qui est per\u00e7u comme une attitude \u00ab unilat\u00e9rale \u00bb de la part de l\u2019administration am\u00e9ricaine. Par ailleurs, Bras\u00edlia, consciente de ses nouvelles possibilit\u00e9s d\u2019in- fluencer certains domaines de l\u2019agenda global, a l\u2019ambition d\u2019\u00eatre reconnu comme un acteur dont les int\u00e9r\u00eats d\u00e9passent le simple cadre r\u00e9gional. Si le Br\u00e9sil est un ferme d\u00e9fenseur du multilat\u00e9ra- lisme et de la r\u00e9gulation du syst\u00e8me international, c\u2019est aussi pour y jouer un r\u00f4le de premier plan. Une aspiration qui s\u2019est concr\u00e9- tis\u00e9e dans la campagne men\u00e9e par les autorit\u00e9s br\u00e9siliennes pour un \u00e9largissement des membres permanents du Conseil de S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de l\u2019ONU.

La promotion du multilat\u00e9ralisme devrait ainsi se retrouver au coeur du partenariat strat\u00e9gique Br\u00e9sil-UE. Le principal d\u00e9fi actuel, reconnu par les deux parties, est de r\u00e9guler l\u2019interd\u00e9pen- dance croissante entre tous les Etats, r\u00e9gions et populations du monde. Il ne s\u2019agit pas cependant d\u2019un exercice formel. R\u00e8gles et institutions multilat\u00e9rales n\u2019ont un sens que si elles sont capables de r\u00e9soudre les probl\u00e8mes r\u00e9els de ce monde en voie de globalisa- tion.

L\u2019un des th\u00e8mes centraux d\u2019un partenariat UE-Br\u00e9sil devra donc \u00eatre le renforcement et l\u2019extension des comp\u00e9tences du Tribunal p\u00e9nal international. Une action coordonn\u00e9e et syst\u00e9ma- tique de ces deux parties, parmi les plus convaincues de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de faire respecter le droit international, pourrait avoir un effet d\u2019entra\u00ee- nement sur d\u2019autres pays \u00e9mergents ou en d\u00e9veloppement, mais aussi sur la possibilit\u00e9 de faire \u00e9voluer la position des Etats-Unis. En m\u00eame temps, il n\u2019y aura \u00e9videmment pas de justice interna- tionale efficace sans une d\u00e9fense intransigeante des droits de l\u2019homme Le principe selon lequel le respect de ces droits doit primer sur celui des souverainet\u00e9s nationales est essentiel pour le d\u00e9veloppement du multilat\u00e9ralisme. L\u2019Union comme le Br\u00e9sil (qui est signataire de la Charte interam\u00e9ricaine des droits humains et qui est soumis aux m\u00e9canismes de d\u00e9fense de la d\u00e9mocratie de l\u2019OEA ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 la \u00ab clause d\u00e9mocratique \u00bb du Mercosur) parta- gent cette id\u00e9e. Plusieurs divergences n\u2019en demeurent pas moins concernant l\u2019application du principe lui-m\u00eame.

L\u2019OMC, aux yeux des Br\u00e9siliens et des Europ\u00e9ens, demeure le grand garant des r\u00e8gles du commerce international, en d\u00e9pit des divergences majeures existant entre les deux parties concernant les n\u00e9gociations commerciales elles-m\u00eames. Mais son mode de fonc- tionnement interne et la complexit\u00e9 croissante des enjeux com- merciaux provoquent une paralysie progressive de l\u2019organisation.

La construction europ\u00e9enne reste un facteur de paix d\u00e9terminant en Europe, alors que le Mercosur, qui garantit l\u2019abandon de la rivalit\u00e9 militaire (y compris nucl\u00e9aire) entre le Br\u00e9sil et l\u2019Argentine, est devenu la principale \u00ab ancre \u00bb de stabilit\u00e9 39 Alfredo Vallad\u00e3o ",

La construction d\u2019un partenariat strat\u00e9gique UE- Br\u00e9sil devrait donc se concentrer sur les axes suivants : (cid:90) Coop\u00e9ration pour l\u2019int\u00e9gration : Echange d\u2019exp\u00e9riences, parti- culi\u00e8rement dans le domaine des politiques visant \u00e0 combattre les asym\u00e9tries internes.

Les deux parties devront s\u2019ac- corder sur la place que devront occuper les autres Etats mem- bres du Mercosur dans leur dialogue bilat\u00e9ral. L\u2019initiative europ\u00e9enne vis-\u00e0-vis du Br\u00e9sil a d\u00e9j\u00e0 provoqu\u00e9 des inqui\u00e9tudes de la part de l\u2019Argentine, m\u00eame si Bruxelles affirme qu\u2019il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019une mani\u00e8re de renforcer le Mercosur. De fait, un partenariat strat\u00e9gique Br\u00e9sil-UE vient renforcer la perception que le Br\u00e9sil est d\u00e9j\u00e0 un acteur international \u00ab diff\u00e9rent \u00bb compar\u00e9 \u00e0 ses voisins et cela commence \u00e0 avoir des effets n\u00e9gatifs sur le processus d\u2019int\u00e9gration r\u00e9gionale \u2013 et donc pour la strat\u00e9gie europ\u00e9enne de renforcer le Mercosur. L\u2019UE cependant, ne peut ignorer plus longtemps le r\u00f4le international sp\u00e9cifique du Br\u00e9sil. La meilleure mani\u00e8re de tenter de r\u00e9soudre cette quadra- ture du cercle serait, pour l\u2019UE, d\u2019avancer rapidement dans les n\u00e9gociations de l\u2019Accord d\u2019association UE-Mercosur. (cid:90) L\u2019accord d\u2019association bir\u00e9gional est la pierre angulaire de la relation entre l\u2019UE et le C\u00f4ne Sud et il repr\u00e9sente \u00e9galement l\u2019un des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de coh\u00e9sion importants pour le processus d\u2019int\u00e9- gration en Am\u00e9rique du Sud. Un accord entre les deux r\u00e9gions constituerait le premier exemple d\u2019une int\u00e9gration interr\u00e9- gionale et repr\u00e9senterait un instrument puissant de promotion de la vision strat\u00e9gique, commune aux deux parties, d\u2019un monde o\u00f9 le multilat\u00e9ralisme est renforc\u00e9 par des groupements r\u00e9gionaux. Cet accord, qui l\u00e8verait l\u2019un des grands obstacles au dialogue actuel entre le Br\u00e9sil et l\u2019UE, constitue, par ailleurs, l\u2019une des conditions essentielles pour que le partenariat strat\u00e9gique bilat\u00e9ral puisse effectivement aller de l\u2019avant. 40 L\u2019UE et le Br\u00e9sil : un partenariat naturel ",
        "2 Afrique sub-saharienne et coop\u00e9ration pour le d\u00e9veloppement L\u2019Afrique constitue un enjeu strat\u00e9gique pour l\u2019Europe. Le Br\u00e9sil, avec une histoire et une culture li\u00e9es au continent africain, l\u2019expan- sion de ses int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e9conomiques et politiques et sa participation \u00e0 la Communaut\u00e9 des pays de langue portugaise (CPLP), consid\u00e8re \u00e9galement l\u2019Afrique comme une priorit\u00e9 de sa politique ext\u00e9rieure 5 . Les deux parties ont ainsi int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 promouvoir, dans le cadre d\u2019un dialogue permanent avec leurs interlocuteurs africains, la prosp\u00e9- rit\u00e9 et la paix dans la r\u00e9gion. Les exp\u00e9riences compl\u00e9mentaires de l\u2019UE et du Mercosur pourraient \u00eatre ainsi mises \u00e0 profit pour coop\u00e9rer et aider \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9gration r\u00e9gionale de l\u2019Afrique sub-saha- rienne. Dans ce domaine, tout reste \u00e0 faire et les deux parties n\u2019en sont, pour le moment, qu\u2019au stade du lancement d\u2019un premier dia- logue institutionnel sur cette question. Le Br\u00e9sil, sous l\u2019actuelle pr\u00e9sidence de M. Lula da Silva, est l\u2019un des grands promoteurs de la lutte contre la faim et la pauvret\u00e9 dans le monde, qui a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 relay\u00e9e en Europe par plusieurs chefs d\u2019Etat europ\u00e9ens. Cette action pourrait constituer un des \u00e9l\u00e9ments du partenariat strat\u00e9gique bilat\u00e9ral, notamment pour le d\u00e9veloppement d\u2019actions conjointes en Afrique sub-saharienne. Energie et environnement La lutte contre le r\u00e9chauffement climatique est une priorit\u00e9 pour l\u2019UE et le Br\u00e9sil. Les deux parties doivent renforcer leur coop\u00e9ration dans le cadre du Protocole de Kyoto et chercher \u00e0 faire \u00e9merger des positions communes pour un accord post-Kyoto. A la diff\u00e9rence de l\u2019UE, le Br\u00e9sil ne veut pas s\u2019engager sur des objectifs quantifi\u00e9s. Il s\u2019agira donc d\u2019explorer ensemble des voies compl\u00e9mentaires : nou- velles technologies, bio\u00e9nergie, sophistication des \u00ab march\u00e9s car- bone \u00bb, etc. Energie Dans ce contexte, la diversification de la matrice \u00e9nerg\u00e9tique jouera un r\u00f4le important. Le Br\u00e9sil produit aujourd\u2019hui plus du tiers de l\u2019\u00e9thanol dans le monde, avec des conditions climatiques et une fronti\u00e8re agricole lui permettant d\u2019augmenter sa production de 41 Alfredo Vallad\u00e3o 5.

Il devrait jouer donc un r\u00f4le central et strat\u00e9gique dans la diversification de la matrice \u00e9nerg\u00e9- tique mondiale. Le dialogue bilat\u00e9ral devra donc se centrer sur les conditions sociales, \u00e9conomiques et environnementales, ainsi que sur les standards techniques et les r\u00e9gulations environnementales ou sociales de cette production avec l\u2019objectif d\u2019en faire une \u00ab commodity \u00bb internationale. La coop\u00e9ration bilat\u00e9rale pour la recherche de proc\u00e9d\u00e9s de production plus efficicaces et respec- tueux de l\u2019environnement, ainsi que pour la diffusion des techno- logies de biocarburants \u00e0 d\u2019autres pays en d\u00e9veloppement devrait \u00e9galement \u00eatre au c\u0153ur de ce dialogue. Par ailleurs, le Br\u00e9sil d\u00e9ve- loppe avec succ\u00e8s son industrie p\u00e9troli\u00e8re et gazi\u00e8re, tout en pous- sant \u00e0 une int\u00e9gration \u00e9nerg\u00e9tique de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique du Sud.

Pour ce qui concerne la technologie nucl\u00e9aire, le Br\u00e9sil ma\u00eetrise pratiquement tout le cycle du nucl\u00e9aire civil et poss\u00e8de de grandes r\u00e9serves d\u2019uranium. Il a par ailleurs d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de relancer son pro- gramme de construction de centrales nucl\u00e9aires pour la produc- tion d\u2019\u00e9nergie. Signataire du TNP, du Trait\u00e9 de Tlatelolco et du Trait\u00e9 quadripartite avec l\u2019AIEA, l\u2019Argentine et l\u2019agence bina- tionale de contr\u00f4le (ABACC), et b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiant d\u2019une Constitution qui lui interdit la possession d\u2019armes nucl\u00e9aires, le Br\u00e9sil a pu d\u00e9velopper sa technologie d\u2019enrichissement d\u2019uranium sans sus- citer de craintes majeures de la communaut\u00e9 internationale. La coop\u00e9ration avec l\u2019Europe est ancienne, particuli\u00e8rement avec l\u2019Allemagne, et un partenariat strat\u00e9gique ne peut ignorer les pos- sibilit\u00e9s de coop\u00e9ration scientifique et industrielle dans ce domaine (par exemple, sur des th\u00e8mes comme la participation br\u00e9silienne au programme ITER ou un accord avec l\u2019EURATOM et la participation europ\u00e9enne au programme nucl\u00e9aire civil br\u00e9silien). De plus, cette coop\u00e9ration serait un \u00e9l\u00e9ment important pour amener le Br\u00e9sil \u00e0 jouer un r\u00f4le plus actif dans la lutte contre la prolif\u00e9ration nucl\u00e9aire. Environnement L\u2019eau est en passe de devenir un bien rare et cher.

Un partenariat strat\u00e9gique bilat\u00e9ral devra pro- mouvoir une coop\u00e9ration dans ce domaine, dont l\u2019un des aspects pourrait \u00eatre des formes de compl\u00e9mentation de la production agricole europ\u00e9enne de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 pouvoir utiliser les ressources en eau des deux c\u00f4t\u00e9s de mani\u00e8re plus efficace. Le Br\u00e9sil est une des plus grandes puissances agricoles de la plan\u00e8te, de m\u00eame que l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne. Les deux parties jouent donc un r\u00f4le strat\u00e9gique, surtout en cette \u00e9poque de diversifica- tion vers les biocarburants, sur les prix et quantit\u00e9s disponibles sur le march\u00e9 mondial des aliments. Ils sont \u00e9galement essentiels pour la d\u00e9finition des r\u00e8gles pour l\u2019utilisation des OGM. Il est donc urgent qu\u2019il puisse y avoir une coop\u00e9ration bilat\u00e9rale dans ce domaine. Une coop\u00e9ration qui devrait s\u2019\u00e9tendre \u00e0 d\u2019autres parte- naires internationaux. La responsabilit\u00e9 br\u00e9silienne pour la pr\u00e9servation de la for\u00eat amazonienne et les responsabilit\u00e9s europ\u00e9ennes pour lutter con- tre le bio-piratage et le pillage des savoirs traditionnels peuvent servir de base au partenariat strat\u00e9gique dans ce domaine. Les deux parties devraient pouvoir harmoniser leurs positions pour le d\u00e9veloppement et l\u2019application de la Convention sur la Biodiver- sit\u00e9 de l\u2019ONU. Coop\u00e9ration scientifique et technologique La coop\u00e9ration scientifique et technique entre l\u2019UE et le Br\u00e9sil est d\u00e9j\u00e0 bien d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e, particuli\u00e8rement d\u2019Etat \u00e0 Etat.

Un partenariat strat\u00e9gique UE-Br\u00e9sil devrait d\u00e9finir les conditions et les r\u00e8gles concernant la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et les droits de pro- pri\u00e9t\u00e9 intellectuelle, permettant la participation des chercheurs, laboratoires et industriels br\u00e9siliens aux programmes europ\u00e9ens, particuli\u00e8rement \u00e0 l\u2019agenda de Lisbonne, tout en promouvant la participation des Europ\u00e9ens aux programmes br\u00e9siliens. Trois sec- teurs sont essentiels du point vue strat\u00e9gique : (cid:90) Recherche et technologie spatiale.

Avec l\u2019augmentation de ses int\u00e9r\u00eats et responsabilit\u00e9s internationaux, le Br\u00e9sil devra envisager s\u00e9rieusement de r\u00e9\u00e9quiper ses forces arm\u00e9es, dont le mat\u00e9riel est en grande par- tie v\u00e9tuste.

Une coop\u00e9ration UE-Br\u00e9sil en mati\u00e8re de technologies et d\u2019industrie de l\u2019armement contri- buerait \u00e0 un r\u00e9\u00e9quilibrage non comp\u00e9titif dans la r\u00e9gion et, \u00e9galement, au renforcement du Br\u00e9sil comme principal p\u00f4le de stabilit\u00e9 r\u00e9gionale. Par ailleurs, la coop\u00e9ration dans ce domaine renforcera les actions et les strat\u00e9gies communes en mati\u00e8re de maintien de la paix en d\u00e9finissant, en amont, une politique d\u2019\u00e9quipement compatible avec ces objectifs.

        "2 Culture et questions sociales Le Br\u00e9sil a \u00e9t\u00e9, par le pass\u00e9, assez r\u00e9ticent \u00e0 s\u2019engager dans un dia- logue sur les standards sociaux r\u00e9put\u00e9s servir de paravent aux poli- tiques commerciales protectionnistes. Cette attitude a beaucoup \u00e9volu\u00e9 r\u00e9cemment gr\u00e2ce au d\u00e9veloppement d\u00e9mocratique du pays lui-m\u00eame, mais aussi \u00e0 la prise de conscience qu\u2019une \u00e9conomie de plus en plus ouverte et d\u00e9pendante des march\u00e9s ext\u00e9rieurs ne pou- vait ignorer les pressions sur cette question. Pour l\u2019UE, la possibilit\u00e9 de convaincre un pays comme le Br\u00e9sil de d\u00e9finir et appliquer des standards sociaux constituerait un important levier pour sa propre strat\u00e9gie d\u2019une globalisation \u00abr\u00e9gul\u00e9e\u00bb. Des standards agr\u00e9\u00e9s par les deux parties auraient certainement un grand poids dans le d\u00e9bat international sur cette question et pourraient servir de benchmark pour d\u2019autres \u00e9conomies \u00e9mergentes ou en d\u00e9veloppement. En mati\u00e8re de sant\u00e9, le Br\u00e9sil est en pointe dans les programmes de lutte contre le sida et sur la question de l\u2019utilisation et produc- tion de m\u00e9dicaments g\u00e9n\u00e9riques en cas d\u2019urgence sanitaire. L\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne est le si\u00e8ge de certaines des plus puissantes industries pharmaceutiques de la plan\u00e8te. Le partenariat strat\u00e9gique bilat\u00e9ral devra tenter de produire des r\u00e8gles permet- tant de trouver un \u00e9quilibre entre le respect du droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 intellectuelle et les besoins des politiques de sant\u00e9 publique. Une avanc\u00e9e bilat\u00e9rale serait, \u00e0 coup s\u00fbr, une contribution majeure \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition des r\u00e8gles universelles dans ce domaine sensible. La gestion des flux migratoires est devenue une question strat\u00e9gique pour les gouvernements europ\u00e9ens. Le Br\u00e9sil est devenu, tr\u00e8s r\u00e9cemment un pays non seulement d\u2019\u00e9migrants (pr\u00e8s de deux millions de Br\u00e9siliens vivent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger \u2013 1% de la popula- tion \u2013 dont 250 000 environ en Europe), mais il redevient \u00e9gale- ment une terre d\u2019immigration (venue des pays voisins et, depuis peu, d\u2019Afrique sub-saharienne). La question migratoire est donc de plus en plus pr\u00e9sente dans les pr\u00e9occupations des autorit\u00e9s de Bras\u00edlia. Un partenariat strat\u00e9gique UE-Br\u00e9sil devra donc aborder toute une gamme de questions telles que les conditions l\u00e9gales d\u2019entr\u00e9e sur le territoire, l\u2019int\u00e9gration des migrants, le march\u00e9 du travail, les protections juridiques et sociales, les remises de fonds vers les pays d\u2019origine, la lutte contre le trafic d\u2019\u00eatres humains, les relations avec les pays d\u2019\u00e9migration, en particulier en Afrique. 45 Alfredo Vallad\u00e3o ",
        "2 Par ailleurs, un dialogue strat\u00e9gique sur les mani\u00e8res de g\u00e9rer des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s de plus en plus diverses est particuli\u00e8rement appro- pri\u00e9 pour la relation UE-Br\u00e9sil. L\u2019Europe proc\u00e8de essentiellement de deux fa\u00e7ons : un mod\u00e8le \u00ab citoyen \u00bb, qui refuse la diff\u00e9rence dans la sph\u00e8re publique pour la rel\u00e9guer dans le priv\u00e9, et un mod\u00e8le \u00ab multiculturel \u00bb qui accepte l\u2019expression des diff\u00e9rences dans le domaine public, et organis\u00e9 en communaut\u00e9s vivant c\u00f4te \u00e0 c\u00f4te. Le Br\u00e9sil proc\u00e8de par un \u00ab m\u00e9tissage \u00bb o\u00f9 les diff\u00e9rences, sans \u00eatre ni\u00e9es, parfois m\u00eame v\u00e9cues durement, sont constamment dis- soutes dans le m\u00e9lange de couleurs de peau ou de religions, dans une reconstruction culturelle permanente. Le d\u00e9bat sur les avan- tages et les inconv\u00e9nients de ces \u00ab mod\u00e8les \u00bb, ainsi que sur les exp\u00e9riences concr\u00e8tes d\u2019int\u00e9gration, pourrait \u00eatre au c\u0153ur m\u00eame du dialogue strat\u00e9gique Europe-Br\u00e9sil et avoir une r\u00e9percussion importante sur le reste du monde 6 . Dans le domaine universitaire, les programmes de coop\u00e9ration sont anciens et se d\u00e9veloppent. Un partenariat strat\u00e9gique devrait cr\u00e9er plus de conditions concr\u00e8tes (bourses, visas, logement, reconnaissance des cursus, stages, etc.) pour la participation d\u2019\u00e9tu- diants br\u00e9siliens aux programmes comme Erasmus Mundus et Alban, et pour que les \u00e9tudiants europ\u00e9ens puissent effectuer des s\u00e9jours dans les institutions d\u2019enseignement br\u00e9siliennes. Les stages en entreprise des deux c\u00f4t\u00e9s devraient \u00e9galement \u00eatre encourag\u00e9s et rendus possibles. Quant \u00e0 la coop\u00e9ration culturelle, il y a sans nul doute un domaine strat\u00e9gique dans la relation UE- Br\u00e9sil : l\u2019audiovisuel \u2013 comprenant non seulement, le cin\u00e9ma et les programmes de t\u00e9l\u00e9vision, mais \u00e9galement la musique. Le Br\u00e9sil et l\u2019Europe sont tous les deux des puissances dans ce domaine. Un partenariat strat\u00e9gique devrait permettre non seulement de d\u00e9velopper les march\u00e9s de chaque c\u00f4t\u00e9 et les productions com- munes, mais \u00e9galement servir de base au d\u00e9veloppement de r\u00e8gles bilat\u00e9rales et globales permettant de trouver un \u00e9quilibre entre les int\u00e9r\u00eats de l\u2019industrie audiovisuelle de chaque partie, la place et le r\u00f4le des subventions publiques et la promotion de la diversit\u00e9 culturelle. 46 L\u2019UE et le Br\u00e9sil : un partenariat naturel 6.

        "2 Conclusion Le d\u00e9veloppement du partenariat strat\u00e9gique UE-Br\u00e9sil est un exercice qui, forc\u00e9ment, prendra du temps. Si la d\u00e9fense du multi- lat\u00e9ralisme et d\u2019un monde qui promeut la r\u00e8gle de droit et le respect des droits de l\u2019homme est une vision partag\u00e9e par les deux interlo- cuteurs, des divergences persistent \u00e0 quant \u00e0 l\u2019application de ces principes. Les Europ\u00e9ens, pour leur part, p\u00e8chent par une sorte de rigidit\u00e9 autocentr\u00e9e. Ils agissent comme s\u2019ils \u00e9taient persuad\u00e9s que les r\u00e8gles, les standards et la conception m\u00eame des probl\u00e8mes et d\u00e9fis, tels qu\u2019ils sont \u00e9dict\u00e9s ou pens\u00e9s en Europe, devraient n\u00e9ces- sairement constituer un benchmark universel et la seule base l\u00e9gi- time pour un dialogue avec leurs partenaires non europ\u00e9ens. Les Br\u00e9siliens, quant \u00e0 eux, conservent une attitude ambigu\u00eb. Ils exi- gent de pouvoir participer pleinement \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition m\u00eame des d\u00e9fis, r\u00e8gles et standards, ainsi qu\u2019aux institutions charg\u00e9es de les traiter ou de les appliquer, mais continuent de se m\u00e9fier de tout r\u00e9gime supranational contraignant. Cette difficult\u00e9 inh\u00e9rente \u00e0 une situation o\u00f9 le \u00ab vieux \u00bb doit faire une place au \u00ab jeune \u00bb est renforc\u00e9e par l\u2019existence de r\u00e9elles divergences concernant les relations commerciales, les crit\u00e8res d\u2019une politique de d\u00e9fense de l\u2019environnement, les instruments n\u00e9cessaires pour le maintien de la paix et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 interna- tionales, le degr\u00e9 d\u2019acceptation d\u2019engagements impliquant des formes de supranationalit\u00e9, la conception m\u00eame des politiques sociales, etc. Par ailleurs, il faut y ajouter un autre niveau de com- plexit\u00e9 li\u00e9 aux dynamiques d\u2019int\u00e9gration r\u00e9gionale. D\u2019une part, l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat des divers Etats membres de l\u2019UE et les priorit\u00e9s de leurs relations bilat\u00e9rales avec le Br\u00e9sil, ne sont pas toujours conver- gents \u2013 ni entre eux ni avec ceux des instances de Bruxelles. D\u2019autre part, la priorit\u00e9 accord\u00e9e par Bras\u00edlia \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9gration sud-am\u00e9ri- caine et au Mercosur ne pourra que ralentir le dialogue avec l\u2019Europe et son institutionnalisation. Il sera donc indispensable de multiplier les canaux de contacts et les instances o\u00f9 le partenar- iat strat\u00e9gique puisse \u00eatre discut\u00e9. 47 Alfredo Vallad\u00e3o ",
        "2 Pour une grande partie des th\u00e9matiques \u00e9nonc\u00e9es, il con- viendrait donc non seulement qu\u2019elles fassent l\u2019objet d\u2019un dialogue intergouvernemental, mais aussi qu\u2019elles puissent \u00eatre nourries par des forums ou des r\u00e9seaux de dialogue et de recherche ad hoc associant des repr\u00e9sentants des gouvernements et de la Commission europ\u00e9enne, des entreprises, des institutions inter- nationales comp\u00e9tentes, du milieu acad\u00e9mique et experts, des cen- tres d\u2019\u00e9tude, des ONG travaillant sur les domaines en question. Ces forums ou r\u00e9seaux sont indispensables, d\u2019une part pour offrir un espace de dialogue non officiel o\u00f9 chacun peut avancer et \u00e9couter des arguments sans \u00eatre dans l\u2019obligation de d\u00e9fendre une position officielle pr\u00e9-\u00e9tablie.

Ces liens sont cruciaux pour l\u2019harmonisation des posi- tions, mais aussi pour fonder le partenariat strat\u00e9gique sur des bases plus permanentes, larges et durables qu\u2019un dialogue qui n\u2019engagerait que les gouvernements. 48 L\u2019UE et le Br\u00e9sil : un partenariat naturel ",
        "The strategic partnership between Brazil and the European Union Marco Aur\u00e9lio Garcia The institutionalisation of the partnership between Brazil and the European Union at the Lisbon Summit of July 2007 provided a new dimension of depth to this \u2018natural\u2019 relationship. Brazil\u2019s diplo- matic traditions throughout the twentieth century \u2013 and the place of honour always accorded to international law and multilateral- ism \u2013 have been politically significant in explaining the country\u2019s far-reaching links with the EU. These extend beyond the economic sphere: equally relevant are, among others, the ethnic and cultural ties underpinning this proximity, which precede the establishment of the EU itself. This partnership is a token of the European Union\u2019s recogni- tion of the place Brazil today occupies in the world. The alliance does face, however, significant obstacles on the way to realising its full potential. To this end, it is crucial to understand and respond appropriately to these challenges. One issue of paramount impor- tance has to do with the asymmetry between the two partners. Its economic and political weight notwithstanding, Brazil is an emerging, individual global player, while the European Union has become the largest grouping of countries ever formed. Brazil and South America Brazil finds itself at the centre of numerous projects focusing on South American integration, such as Mercosul and, more recently, the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR). Both these initia- tives have held up the European Union as a paradigm, even as they acknowledge the enormous differences between the integration processes on either side of the Atlantic. Mercosul is still an imperfect customs union, given the contrasting macro-economic policies adopted over the last few years particularly by its two principal mem- bers \u2013 Argentina and Brazil. The absence of countervailing measures to accommodate policy differences has only added to the difficulties. 49 Partnerships for effective multilateralism EU relations with Brazil, China, India and Russia 3 ",
        "3 These disparities have been somewhat narrowed by the conver- gent response of Southern Cone governments (all took office from 2002 onwards) to the economic crisis that shook the region from the mid 1990s. Yet tensions persist as a result of lingering asymmetries that are rooted in trade imbalances tending to favour the larger economies. It was the challenge of moving Mercosul beyond a simple commercial alliance that sparked the present debate on how to enlarge and enrich the bloc\u2019s policy agenda. As a result, issues such as integrating production chains and invigorat- ing the region\u2019s physical and energy infrastructure have come to the fore. Discussions are under way on setting up a host of joint financing mechanisms, ranging from a regional development bank to encouraging regional trade in local currencies, as well as improving existing trade and financing schemes, such as the regional trade clearinghouse mechanism. Finally, progress has also been made in establishing the Fund for the Structural Con- vergence of Mercosul, modelled on the EU\u2019s structural funds. This broadening of Mercosul\u2019s original scope has two major implications. Firstly, increased economic interdependence among member countries and, as a result, countries adopting policies geared to a common legal framework and regional goals. The slow pace at which this is being achieved \u2013 in Brazil as elsewhere \u2013 points to the critical importance of Mercosul\u2019s normative structure being quickly and comprehensively adopted by member countries. Sec- ondly, a need to accelerate the setting up of a political framework able to effectively respond to the new dimensions taken on by the integration process. The Mercosul Parliament, while still in its infancy, is a significant step in this direction. As we strive to strengthen the political-administrative structures at the Montev- ideo headquarters, Brussels again offers inspiration. This slow and hesitant rate of progress is explained by the fact that Mercosul must fuse outlooks and practices stemming from sovereign governments as well as supra-national institutions. Unlike Europe, South America has not undergone overwhelming catastrophes \u2013 such as the major wars that shook Europe during the first half of the twentieth century \u2013 that are a forceful incentive to overcoming obstacles to regional integration. That said, a dra- matic history and a common threat perception are not enough in the absence of unshakeable confidence among Member States as to the merits of integration. 50 The strategic partnership between Brazil and the European Union ",
        "3 Much has been made of the crisis of Mercosul. Admittedly, its track record often compares unfavourably to the European Union, which, despite its own domestic difficulties, has success- fully enlarged and deepened. However, Mercosul is gradually forg- ing its own unique identity. It successfully sidestepped the origi- nal proposal for a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), which would have dashed all hope for truly symmetrical and balanced regional integration. Having been forced to abandon plans for a hemispheric\u2013wide trade bloc, the United States reverted to sign- ing Free Trade Agreements (FTA) with individual countries or sub-regions. Even this more modest strategy faces opposition \u2013 which may grow should the Democratic Party win next November \u2013 in the United States Congress. Since 2003-2004 Mercosul has successfully attracted almost all South American economies into association agreements. This has been achieved despite the differing foreign trade models prevail- ing in the region \u2013 differences reinforced by FTA negotiations over the last two years between the United States and certain South American countries. The bloc that has coalesced around Mercosul paved the way for establishing the Community of South American Nations, later re-named UNASUR. UNASUR seeks to foster trade within the sub-continent. The ultimate goal of setting up a continent-wide customs union is clearly unattainable in the short and medium term. Here the con- trast between South American and European regionalisation is obvious. The original agreement among the founding European \u2018Six\u2019 successfully attracted neighbouring countries \u2013 which has not happened in South America. Clearly, the \u2018US factor\u2019 is per- ceived differently on either side of the Atlantic. Brazil, regional integration and the European Union This minor digression puts into perspective the growing impor- tance of South American integration schemes for Brazilian foreign policy in recent years. Brazil\u2019s heightened international profile, especially as concerns South America, is not born of a desire for self- promotion. It is rather a central pillar of Brazil\u2019s drive for national development. Here again, European experience is illuminating, for building the European Union is more than simply jumbling 51 Marco Aur\u00e9lio Garcia ",
        "3 countries together \u2013 rather it is predicated on a fundamental redef- inition of each Member State\u2019s national self-image and goals. Despite its size and scale, Brazil believes that forging a solid regional bloc is necessary for it to meaningfully engage in the mul- tipolar world that is taking shape. Mercosul is presently negotiat- ing \u2013 as is the Andean Community \u2013 a Free Trade Agreement with the European Union. The difficulties encountered are similar to those facing Brazil in its economic and trade relations with the European Union. Many will only be overcome when major global disputes, such as the current impasse over the Doha Trade Round, are overcome. European demands for greater concessions on industrial protection \u2013 which would harm efforts to rebuild the industrial foundations of many South American economies \u2013 are not matched by an equivalent willingness on the part of Europe and the United States to abandon protective agricultural subsi- dies. Brazil and Europe and the reform of multilateral organisations The reform of the Bretton Woods institutions is a common aspira- tion of Brazil and the European Union. Yet Europe\u2019s resistance to reform the WTO casts a pall over hopes for greater collaboration on these issues. In contrast, there is room for optimism as concerns the World Bank and, above all, the International Monetary Fund (IMF). With Dominique Strauss-Kahn at the helm, the IMF has shown greater openness to the grievances of emerging economies. Following the disastrous failures of its prescriptions for South America (and for Argentina, in particular), there is now greater flex- ibility not just in the Fund\u2019s general outlook, but also on the issue of how the organisation is run. Brazil, like other emerging coun- tries, seeks a greater role in the IMF\u2019s decision-making (i.e. increased quotas), in proportion to the country\u2019s present weight in the world economy. On other multilateral questions \u2013 most particularly issues of global governance \u2013 there is significant room for cooperation between Brazil and the European Union. First and foremost, the reform of the United Nations, so as to enhance that organisation\u2019s authority as well as the chances for meaningful evolution towards a truly multilateral world. Of special relevance in this context is the 52 The strategic partnership between Brazil and the European Union ",
        "3 question of collective security and, more particularly, of the enlargement of the Security Council. Brazil is a candidate for a per- manent seat on an enlarged Council that is better suited to the realities of the post-Cold War era, which are radically distinct to those of 1945. While reform has the support of the likes of the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Portugal, it will be diffi- cult to achieve unanimity within the European Union, given the reluctance of countries such as Italy and Spain to accept new per- manent members. While these difficulties will not be easily overcome, there remains scope for joint action on other collective security issues. Brazil\u2019s and South America\u2019s successful involvement in Haiti offers a new paradigm for multilateral political, diplomatic and military intervention in flash points where Brazil enjoys especial ties, such as Africa. The same goes for dealing with the Middle East stalemate. Brazil joined European countries in taking a front seat during the recent Lebanese crisis and, just a few months ago, at the Annapolis Summit. As long as a new global governance and its attendant multipo- lar order are not ushered in, ad hoc groupings, such as the G8, will continue to prosper. Since President Chirac\u2019s Evian initiative, in 2003, the G8 has regularly met with other emerging countries. The G8+5 formula (Brazil, China, India, South Africa and Mexico) that has been taking shape in recent years may still offer room for improvement, but it does open the way for new groupings. No matter how transitory and imperfect, they help bring fresh ideas to the debate on how the global community should deal with major economic, political and social threats. Brazil has partnered with Europe on major initiatives with meaningful results, such as the fight against hunger and poverty. Yet there remains room for an even more ambitious partnership equal to the scale of the chal- lenges ahead. Brazil, Europe and Africa Trilateral cooperation with African countries is one worthy option. There is no denying that Europe\u2019s longstanding ties with Africa are often tinged with ill-resolved colonial overtones. Brazil for its part has engaged in a major way with the African continent. Since 2003, President Lula has visited over twenty countries and expects to 53 Marco Aur\u00e9lio Garcia ",
        "3 travel to many more over the coming years. Brazil has 32 embassies in Africa, while African countries have doubled the number of diplomatic missions in Brasilia, which has hosted over 20 heads of state and government from that continent since President Lula took office. The growing number of agreements signed between Brazil and African nations helps explain the mushrooming of Brazilian investments and financing schemes in Africa, as well as the five- fold jump in trade over the last three years. President Lula is a firm believer that biofuels offer an exceptional platform for coopera- tion with Africa. Much of the continent boasts ample sunlight, and abundant demographic, land and water resources to sustain biofuel production, be it sugarcane-based ethanol or biodiesel from oilseeds native to Africa. The production of biofuels can become a major boon to oil- and gas-poor countries, but their use should also be encouraged in oil-rich regions. As long as adequate measures are taken to ensure local food security, biofuels can offer innovative solutions to the energy crisis affecting many countries. Alternative fuels can also help redress trade imbalances by both reducing the need for fossil fuel imports and generating foreign currency from the export of green fuels. By creating new job opportunities, biofuels help stem perverse mass migration \u2013 rural exodus and the ensuing bloating of African capitals \u2013 as well as the international migrant flows that so worry Europe. Beyond its positive impact on global warming, biofuels open new industrial opportunities for recycling used plastics, medicines, fertilisers and other materials. By uniting European financial resources and Brazilian technology, we can further encourage the renaissance already underway in Africa\u2019s economy. Defence cooperation Defence is yet another important field for Brazil-European Union cooperation. The end of the Cold War, together with Brazil\u2019s democratisation during the 1980s and its new South American neighbourhood policy, especially towards Argentina, has seen the demise of old and obsolete conceptions of security. Only of late has Brazil set about developing a new defence doctrine, one that is 54 The strategic partnership between Brazil and the European Union ",
        "3 relevant to the multipolar world in the making, to continental inte- gration and to the constitutionally-mandated tasks allotted to the Armed Forces. This conceptual evolution, together with the major fiscal crunch that hit the Brazilian Armed Forces \u2013 as has happened throughout the region \u2013 has led to deep cuts in the defence budget over the years. The doctrinal debate on defence policy is inseparable from the question of arms procurement. Brazil has no intention of going on a \u2018shopping binge\u2019 for weapons. It is more interested in cooper- ation programmes ensuring technology transfers that will help rebuild the Brazilian defence industry in partnership with that of other South American countries. President Lula favours the set- ting up of a South American Defence Council to underscore the continent\u2019s commitment to remaining a peace zone and to foster- ing local defence initiatives that are mutually compatible, includ- ing on procurement policy. A well-balanced and non-asymmetri- cal relationship between Brazil and the European Union in this field could go a long way in advancing Brazil\u2019s regional defence agenda. Science, technology and culture Promoting cooperation in science and technology should take a front seat in Brazil-European Union relations. The economic devel- opment surge Brazil underwent in the 1950s and 60s was largely fuelled by obsolete imported industrial equipment. In contrast, the present-day international division of labour is such that Brazil has strongly benefited from imported cutting-edge technology. Yet, as mentioned in relation to military cooperation, the challenge is not simply to import the most up-to-date hardware through turnkey packages. Rather the goal should be to enhance technological part- nerships that foster prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic. This requires improved exchange programmes between terti- ary-level scientific institutions, but equally closer cooperation in technical training, a field that has been undergoing an extraordi- nary revival in Brazil over the last five years. University coopera- tion at the undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate level was until recently mostly one-way (from Brazil to Europe) and centred on a few European countries. A wider range of European countries 55 Marco Aur\u00e9lio Garcia ",
        "3 should be open to Brazilians and the flow of students, teachers and researchers between Brazil and Europe should also be more balanced in both directions: Brazil-Europe and Europe-Brazil. Cultural relations offer a major challenge, especially in the light of the relative decline in the influence of European culture in Brazil and South America. What is required is that, on the one hand, European culture recovers the privileged place it enjoyed in the past. On the other hand, the partial \u2013 even distorted \u2013 percep- tion of Europeans toward Brazilian culture must be corrected. Recent developments disclose new potential, such is the case of the exceptional growth of the Instituto Cervantes in Brazil, as well as the British Council and the Goethe Institute\u2019s strong presence there, together with a somewhat reinvigorated Alliance Fran\u00e7aise. The Ann\u00e9e du Br\u00e9sil in France, in 2005, was judged the most suc- cessful \u2018saison\u2019 of this type. Over ten million European visitors were exposed to Brazilian culture. Its outstanding success led to the decision to organise, in 2009, the Year of France in Brazil. This is an initiative worthy of replication in other European countries, in particular those with strong historical ties to Brazil, even though these have often weakened over recent decades. Making cultural goods widely available and fostering an enhanced appreciation for local production should be at the cen- tre of any cultural cooperation effort. This is why the audio-visual field, including cinema, television and the new communications technologies, deserve closer attention. Given its strategic charac- ter, this is a highly disputed field, be it openly \u2013 in the case of com- mercial negotiations, especially on intellectual property rights \u2013 or mutedly, which highlights the issues of cultural hegemony at stake today. Multilateralism is not limited to purely economic or political considerations. Its cultural dimension is all the more important given its impact on concrete economic and political issues. A more effective and direct dialogue between Brazil, South America and Europe, one that does away with intermediaries, will help overcome common stereotypes that infest European analyses of South America and South American perceptions of Europe. 56 The strategic partnership between Brazil and the European Union ",
        "3 Perspectives Relations between Brazil and the European Union must not ignore the dialectic that has overtaken international relations in recent decades. Positive (and negative) experiences associated with inte- gration processes are closely linked to the ability of Government and civil society to cooperate constructively. This can be a trying relationship, but one that remains indispensable. It is trying because of the often conflicting perspectives that each brings to the table. Yet it also is indispensable, in so far as society \u2013 and the pub- lic spaces that mould it \u2013 play a critical role in setting limits on gov- ernment, above and beyond those controls already enshrined in formal state institutions. Yet as in any relationship, the strategic partnership between Brazil and the European Union requires agile and efficient mech- anisms. The inevitable formalities associated with any meaningful alliance must not be allowed to stifle it. Otherwise, bureaucracy\u2019s empty rhetoric is simply a mask for passivity and lack of true com- mitment. The specificity of the integration processes taking place on either side of the Atlantic mirror differing realities, both historical and material. To bring the European Union and Brazil closer means more than simply binding together a continent and a coun- try. A continent that has collectively undertaken an extraordinary economic and political adventure over the last fifty years; and an emerging country that seems to have rekindled its faith in the promise of the future. Brazil also offers a conduit for Europe to reinvigorate its ties with Mercosul and other countries wishing to make UNASUR a reality. From this partnership, more than mutual material gain can be expected; rather we can hope for an important contribution to building the multipolar, democratic and peace-loving world to which we all aspire. 57 Marco Aur\u00e9lio Garcia ",

        "The EU and China: a necessary partnership Fran\u00e7ois Godement Introduction China is the largest emerging economic power, and exerts a grow- ing influence on the European economy. It is now becoming the EU\u2019s first source of imports for goods, and also its first source of foreign trade deficit: worth 131 billion euro in 2006, this is pro- jected to grow to 170 billion euro in 2007, a level equivalent to the well-known US trade deficit with China. While a downturn in the US economy and a lower dollar have slowed down the growth of Chinese exports to the United States, in January they were still increasing towards Europe at a 30 % year-on-year rate. No other major economy in world history has reached an external trade sur- plus amounting to 11 % of GDP. China is also the first recipient of foreign direct investment (FDI) among emerging economies, at levels which have consis- tently exceeded 50 billion US dollars since 1997, reaching 83 bil- lion US dollars in 2007. The European Union\u2019s contribution to this flow is only around 5%, although much of it is allocated to comparatively high-technology industries. China\u2019s monetary reserves are the highest in the world, reaching 1,530 trillion US dollars in January 2008; any sign of a coming shift of these reserves out of the dollar could bring about a further rise in the value of the euro. China\u2019s foreign trade has been largely liberalised as a conse- quence of its entry into the WTO. The same is not true of services, where China still maintains significant barriers, while the Euro- pean Union, a significant exporter of services worldwide, main- tains a 7 billion euro surplus in this area with China. China also claims trade protection for some of its national industries, while it complains about the anti-dumping or temporary measures that affect roughly 10% of its exports to Europe. Europe is now a major tourist destination for the Chinese, and also a major centre of higher education for students from China. China\u2019s own foreign direct investment into Europe is now growing, with cases of 59 Partnerships for effective multilateralism EU relations with Brazil, China, India and Russia 4 ",
        "4 acquisitions of small to medium-sized enterprises multiplying. Given the level of China\u2019s currency reserves, the well-publicised creation of an investment fund has triggered a debate in Europe, alongside the trade issues, on the acceptability of Chinese invest- ment in strategic industries. Globally, the outward flow of Chi- nese direct investment \u2013 both industrial and financial \u2013 may have exceeded 50 billion US dollars in 2007, although precise figures are hard to assess. China is also important because of its progressive integration in the international system and its multilateral-based rules. All policy areas are affected, most notably intellectual property rights, the above-mentioned economic issues, emission control and global warming, international access to energy and raw materials, non-proliferation, official development assistance (ODA) and governance criteria, and human rights. In fact, this list can grow indefinitely, as China\u2019s present or potential influence is felt across almost all fields of international exchanges. 1 China has different demands for the European Union. Some of them, as set out in China\u2019s sole policy document regarding the European Union (October 2003), 2 are negative: China insists that the European Union refrain from intervention in its internal affairs in the name of human rights, and does not want it to receive visitors representing the Tibet cause and Taiwan. Other demands are positive: China wants the European Union to rescind its arms embargo, and to grant China market economy status. China is an incontrovertible partner. The international debate has progressed beyond the issue of \u2018engagement\u2019 or \u2018containment\u2019. Europe has issued no less than five policy communications since 1995 regarding China. The overall framework of the relationship, however, is still defined by the 1985 Trade and Economic Coopera- tion Agreement (TECA), which is being renegotiated into a Part- nership and Cooperation Agreement since January 2007, with a goal to conclude talks by April 2009. China and the EU have already signed more than 30 major agreements or high-level exchanges. These include an annual EU-China summit since 1998, several high-level government meetings and a yearly strategic dialogue at vice-foreign ministerial level since December 2005. A strategic dialogue, however, is not the \u2018strategic partnership\u2019 that was set as an official goal in 2004. Among major agreements and dialogues, the human rights dialogue, established since 1996, has proven the thorniest as the Europeans question the practical 60 The EU and China: a necessary partnership 1.

        "4 follow-through of these meetings. On the other hand, several suc- cessive science and technology agreements have led to substantial cooperation. China and the EU cooperate on illegal migration flows, and have at the same time signed a memorandum making Europe an \u2018approved destination\u2019 for Chinese tourists. Some of these dialogues are ad hoc creations following the advent of a major bilateral problem, such as the textile trades dialogue set up in 2004. They signal, however, that China is ready to commit impor- tant resources in order to enhance its relations with the European Union. In October 2003, China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued its own policy paper towards the EU, recognising European integration as an irreversible process and designating the Union as an influential global partner. In December 2007, China and the European Union decided to set up a High Level Economic and Trade Mechanism. Three caveats Three cautionary remarks, however, should moderate expectations about these developments. (cid:90) China is not alone in Asia. In spite of more than 15 years of slow growth, Japan remains the world\u2019s second economy (4.3 trillion US dollars in 2006 versus 2.7 trillion US dollars for China) and a more important partner of the European Union, if one factors in cross-investment and technology exchanges and the obvious compatibility of democratic values and market practices. India\u2019s population will overtake China\u2019s in the next twenty years, its economic growth is accelerating, and its foreign trade is tilted towards Europe. Other Asian countries or groupings (ASEAN) are also vibrant, and represent important markets. All these countries, in spite of persistent geopolitical reservations and local conflicts, have a policy to engage China. But they are also important partners for the European Union. What the Euro- pean Union says and does with China must be consistent with its relations with other Asian countries, so as to preserve a polit- ical balance among different EU partners. To paraphrase the slo- gan for the 2008 Beijing Olympics (\u2018one world, one dream\u2019), there must be \u2018one EU, one voice\u2019. The EU\u2019s recently published foreign policy and security guidelines towards East Asia recom- mend that Europe should enhance a strategic dialogue with China, but also with Japan and the United States regarding East 61 Fran\u00e7ois Godement ",
        "4 Asia in general. 3 The regional dimension of bilateral strategies must be pursued at all times, including by having Europe serve as a catalyst to establish new areas of regional cooperation. (cid:90) Excessive expectations placed on the relationship have dam- aged it in the recent past. Europe\u2019s immediate declaration of a strategic partnership floundered on the issue of the arms embargo in force since 1989. The lack of explicit criteria on Europe\u2019s part may have encouraged China to think an upgraded relationship with the EU could be obtained virtually without any concession on its part. Talk of the \u2018honeymoon\u2019 in 2004 was therefore replaced by disappointment in 2005. We should not repeat this cycle of optimism followed by disap- pointment. Coordination among Europeans must come first. (cid:90) Conversely, excessive and simultaneous demands in too many areas have no chance of being met by China, given its emphasis on sovereignty and the capacity to resist demands, its strength- ened government, but also the immense requirements it faces domestically. The October 2006 European Commission China policy paper is the most comprehensive and cogent list of pre- scriptions since these documents have started appearing. 4 The Council, however, saw clearly that such a wide array of policy goals could not be implemented realistically. It has only endorsed the conclusions of the Commission paper \u2018in gen- eral\u2019. China is likely to wait until it perceives what the true nego- tiating priorities of the European Union are. It will also be on the lookout for any signs of wavering and cracks among Mem- ber States. This is not because of a devious purpose, but because it is a realist power, not a neo-institutional construction, and also because its own persisting sense of weakness still requires the power-balancing policy of \u2018dividing Barbarians\u2019. An agenda for strategic partnership will therefore build on the legacy of past agreements, on the experience of recent setbacks and difficulties, on the ongoing negotiation of a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement that would go beyond the original terms of 1985, and of course on the political will by both parties to inten- sify relations. The US will remain a defining factor in shaping the EU-China partnership. China will look carefully at its own rela- tions with the United States, the balance of which will prove an important factor in determining policy shifts towards the Euro- pean Union. For example, the United States holds the key to 62 The EU and China: a necessary partnership 3. Full text at: http://www.consil- ium.europa.eu/ueDocs/cms_Da ta/docs/pressdata/en/misc/978 42.pdf. 4.

        "4 restrictions in international technology transfer in military- related sectors, and is also considered by China as the arbiter of the oil market and the gatekeeper of access to many energy resources. US Congress action, whether motivated by broader political con- cerns or by dissatisfaction over trade, has the potential to derail China\u2019s export-led growth. At the same time, China is carefully watching the overload of the US foreign policy agenda, and is also increasingly anxious about the possible consequences of interna- tional financial imbalances and turbulence, what the Chinese call the \u2018new complexity\u2019 of the international situation. A case could be made that the bipolar relationship emerging between China and the United States, while leading to strategic stability, has also increased economic imbalances, and that it is in China\u2019s interest to develop an economic partnership with other major economic poles. The European Union, for its part, will feel the need to avoid statements and decisions that contradict its principal ally or that antagonise other important Asian partner states. Finally, public opinion \u2013 and the ups and downs of the pub- lic opinion cycle regarding China \u2013 should also be taken into con- sideration. In this respect, an unexpected downward cycle started in 2007, with Chinese social and environmental issues, concerns about the \u2018plundering\u2019 of Africa, food and toy safety, and cyberat- tacks featuring among the main issues in daily press coverage. This cycle should not distract us from the main perspective, how- ever: China is undergoing a fast process of growth and internal reform; China\u2019s stability and the stability of Asia are essential con- cerns for Europeans as well as for Asians The political and security dimension In the balance between multilateralism and multipolarity, the notion of a Chinese-European convergence of views is under- pinned by much ambiguity. Europe is not a major strategic actor in East Asia because it does not share military responsibilities in the region\u2019s hot spots. This sometimes leads to the notion of a Euro- pean policy that would be complementary to US policy, and focused on \u2018soft power\u2019 and multilateral action. While Europe is a significant aid giver to China, in the belief of an engagement- induced transition over social and domestic political issues, this does not provide significant leverage. The two sides give 63 Fran\u00e7ois Godement ",
        "4 prominence to multilateralism and to the UN system. But most European member countries are also allies of the United States, while China officially rejects hegemony, unilateralism and power politics. Europe and China have the mutual advantage of not shar- ing borders or neighbourhood problems, but Europe has to take into consideration the concerns of other partners in the Asia- Pacific, while China\u2019s increasingly global reach implies that there are now concerns about China\u2019s foreign policy in regions much closer to the European Union. The China-Iran relationship and the strength of China\u2019s actions to counter proliferation, Africa, energy deals with Russia, and the effectiveness of United Nations resolu- tions (and of the potential sanctions that they include) have all become areas of potential cooperation or friction between China and the European Union. UN reform, peacekeeping and regional integration The issues of UN reform and effectiveness top the agenda. Both of the EU Member States which are permanent members of the UN Security Council have endorsed the enlargement of the permanent membership of this body to Brazil, Germany, India and Japan, while Germany has entered a mutual pledge with those three other candidates. China\u2019s negative attitude towards its key neighbour in Asia, Japan, and its lukewarm attitude towards the third Asian regional power, India, have effectively halted the reform. The recent thaw in relations between China and Japan should encourage Europe to raise the issue again. Cooperation should be sought with China with regard to its participation in peacekeeping operations, whether they are decided under UN auspices, or whether they are increasingly framed in a framework of regional international organisations. Training of peacekeepers is one area of cooperation, where China now has established an international centre of its own. Efforts to train Chinese peacekeepers and to communicate on the mandates and experiences of peacekeeping would be a step forward for both sides, and also a way to deflect potential controversy over the issue of the arms embargo. Perhaps the most important development, however, would be the setting-up of joint Asian peacekeeping operations. While China declares itself against alliances and international manoeu- vres, it has encouraged joint military exercises with Russia and 64 The EU and China: a necessary partnership ",
        "4 other Central Asian states participating in the Shanghai Coopera- tion Organization. By contrast, international peacekeeping is almost absent from the Asia-Pacific at the regional level. Because of concerns about the underlying balance of power, Asian regional institutions have not developed regional crisis management, peacekeeping and preventive diplomacy. However, many Asian states, including China, provide peacekeeping contingents glob- ally. The European experience of comprehensive peacekeeping and peacebuilding could be addressed in the dialogue with ASEAN, China and Japan, as a model for better relations within the region. Regional and interregional cooperation in East Asia are grow- ing. China is now engaged in practically all Asian regional institu- tions and in the second-track dialogues of the ASEAN Regional Forum. These also include sub-regional dialogues such as the Six Party Talks on the Korean Peninsula, where China plays a key diplomatic role. Chinese diplomats are present in all meetings and study groups of the Council for Security Cooperation in the Asia- Pacific, which covers topics such as North-East Asian peace and stability, weapons of mass destruction, maritime security, energy security and transnational crime. A major limitation to China\u2019s participation, however, lies in its insistence on keeping the Taiwan issue, and participants from Taiwan, off the agenda and the roster list of meetings that deal with international relations or military issues. China also remains cautious about entering into commit- ments in the area of confidence-building measures, preventive diplomacy and cooperative security. China by far prefers state-to- state bilateral agreements, or interstate cooperation within the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, where counterterrorism, joint military manoeuvres and anti-hegemonic pledges are the main points of the agenda. It is also using economic diplomacy, as well as cultural and educational exchanges, as tools of \u2018soft power\u2019: the concept appeared in President Hu Jintao\u2019s speech to the 17 th CCP Congress in November 2007. 5 Non-proliferation After a long stalemate, the international process to prevent the nuclearisation of North Korea has suddenly made headway, leading to a revival of the Six Party Talks sponsored by China in February and October 2007. There is no question that, at this stage, 65 Fran\u00e7ois Godement 5. Full English text of Hu Jintao\u2019s speech available at: http://eng- lish.sina.com/china/1/2007/102 5/129308.html. ",
        "4 the engine of progress on the Korean peninsula is the bilateral US- North Korea relationship, as Chinese diplomats have correctly assessed in the past. It is important, however, to keep these talks in a multilateral perspective, especially from the point of view of non- proliferation. China\u2019s role with regard to the Iranian nuclear issue is also a matter of important concern to Europe. The China-Iran relation- ship is driven by Iran as much as, or more than, by China. Chinese business interests in trade and investment relations, and the prospect of important natural gas resources, for which China is in competition with India and even (until October 2006) Japan, are important factors. China needs to strike a balance between its immediate interests and the need to be regarded as a \u2018responsible stakeholder\u2019, 6 particularly when the UN Security Council con- cerns itself with Iran. An important linkage has emerged between the Iranian and North Korean situation. While withdrawing from the Non-Prolifer- ation Treaty (NPT), North Korea has declared itself a nuclear military power and has conducted what is officially described as a nuclear test. Because of this historical record, it is undesirable that the ongo- ing negotiations on the disabling and dismantling of North Korea\u2019s uranium reprocessing facilities result in allowing what would be best described as a \u2018recessed\u2019 nuclear power status for that country. This example would be cited by any country wishing to withdraw from the NPT while developing a military nuclear capacity. It is in the interest of the European Union to ensure that China does not suspend its diplomatic efforts and cooperation before North Korea\u2019s existing nuclear weapons are accounted for and included in a denuclearisation agreement. The European Union, which threw its weight in at an awkward time (November 2002) with the diplomatic recognition of North Korea by most of its Member States and initial pledges for aid, should now stand ready to be part of a multilateral package designed to reintegrate North Korea into the international community, provided North Korea abides by its recent commitments. Military issues and the arms embargo The EU has been insisting on more transparency in China\u2019s mili- tary spending. The importance of this issue is highlighted by China\u2019s anti-satellite space test of January 2007. China is, in 66 The EU and China: a necessary partnership 6. This expression was coined by Robert Zoellick in December 2005. Full text of his speech avail- able at: http://www.state.gov/ r/pa/prs/ps/2005/57822.htm. ",
        "4 principle, committed to peaceful use of outer space, and is also engaged in a limited partnership with the European Union on the Galileo GPS project. It is important to put the testing of anti- satellite weapons to an end, both to avoid the risk of environmental damage and to limit danger to other users of outer space, and because China\u2019s use of anti-satellite weapons might trigger similar programmes elsewhere, especially in the Middle East. A further clarification is also needed in view of a recent statement by Presi- dent Hu Jintao, made at the APEC summit in September 2007, regarding the \u2018dangerous phase\u2019 into which Taiwan has entered. 7 President Hu has recently, in his address to the 17 th Communist Party Congress, corrected this perspective by holding forth the possibility of a \u2018peace agreement\u2019 with Taiwan, on the basis of the One China principle. The European Union has endorsed the One China principle and criticised the risk factor inherent in declarations alluding to independent statehood made by some of Taiwan\u2019s leaders. The EU is therefore entitled to query China about its own contribution to a peaceful resolution of the cross-straits issue. It would be wise for the EU to build on this stand in order to obtain from Chinese interlocutors a pledge not to use force, and to maintain positive proposals on the issue of reunification. Military relations and arms exports remain out of the bounds of the partnership, since the European Council decreed in June 1989 an \u2018interruption by the member states of the community of military cooperation and an embargo on trade in arms with China.\u2019 The Council affirmed in December 2004 \u2018the political will to continue to work towards lifting the arms embargo\u2019, without any increase in arms sales, however. There are reasons to believe that this decision of principle should be followed through by plans for an orderly normalisation of the situation. China\u2019s sol- diers participate in many peacekeeping operations, where they routinely cooperate with other contingents, including from the European Union: such is the case for example in Southern Lebanon. Military-to-military exchanges in training and educa- tion exist with several European countries. Naval visits and even joint exercises, if not military manoeuvres, have taken place with France, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. The United States has also started a strategic dialogue with China on important for- eign policy and security issues. In this context, the European arms embargo appears as a barrier of principle. 67 Fran\u00e7ois Godement 7. Hu Jintao\u2019s remarks can be found at: http://hr.china-em- bassy.org/eng/zxxx/t360601.htm. ",
        "4 The European Union needs to make a decision on the mecha- nisms for restricting arms exports to sensitive countries, and on the commitments it requires from China in exchange for a lifting of the arms embargo. Not to set these conditions, and not to be able to deliver in a dialogue, downgrades the negotiating potential of the European Union with China. This negotiating process is a test for Europe\u2019s future foreign policy and security institutions and for their ability to coordinate positions with Member States. Human rights Europe is torn between the necessity of positive, multi-level engage- ment with China, and frustration over the lack of progress in the realm of human rights, judicial and legal cooperation. There is no perfect answer to this dilemma, but Europe should prominently raise specific human right cases with China. Moreover, the issue of the ratification of the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is of primary importance, particularly in the con- text of a possible lifting of the sanctions which include the 1989 arms embargo. This requirement should not prevent Europe from engaging in a longer-term cooperation designed to favour a transi- tion. Training, overseas education in humanities, social sciences and the legal professions, as well as the media, should be presented as part of the overall package of scientific and educational cooper- ation with China. China and Africa Because of its growing presence and investment in the conti- nent, China carries a serious responsibility for stability, security and development in Africa, and especially over the Darfur issue. 8 Overall, two-way trade has increased from 5 to 55 billion US dol- lars between 2001 and 2006, with a slight surplus for Africa due to its energy and raw material resources. This should not obscure the fact that Africa\u2019s exports to China are still only a small fraction of its exports to the European Union. While very impressive figures are often cited today for China\u2019s aid to Africa, these data often group together actual aid with loans tied to exports or projects involving Chinese firms. China\u2019s Official Development Assistance (ODA) has in fact declined relative to its trade volume with Africa. China\u2019s aid is project-driven, often in synergy with commercial 68 The EU and China: a necessary partnership 8. Christopher Alden, Daniel Large & Ricardo de Oliveira (eds.), China returns to Africa: a Superpower and a Continent Embrace (London: C. Hurst, 2008). ",
        "4 credit and the involvement of private firms. Furthermore, China\u2019s high profile also triggers, by way of competition, a further influx of aid from other Asian countries, such as Japan and Korea. Trad- ing networks of immigrant Chinese entrepreneurs and labour force migration from China to Africa are also creating a mixed pic- ture: they stimulate competition, from consumer goods to infra- structure projects, but also create social tensions. International aid and cooperation programmes are necessarily affected by China\u2019s very swift rise as a commercial partner and an aid-giver. The European Union and other multilateral aid-givers will have to change their strategy in response to China\u2019s activities. Engaging China to participate in regional and multilateral proj- ects and programmes, raising awareness of aid and governance cri- teria but also showing a readiness to re-examine them in the light of Chinese participation, are important goals. In this context, a tri- lateral dialogue with African regional organisations, helping to strengthen the hand of African governments in dealing with out- side partners, is also desirable. Calls for observing governance criteria and for refraining from restarting a public debt spiral, however, are likely to go unheeded by China. China does not lend much for current government expenditure or towards social programmes. It mainly finances projects which have a clear profit horizon, or the infrastructures that are needed to transport major energy and natural resources. The European Union does not have much direct leverage over China\u2019s Africa policy, and should instead focus on the emerging commercial competition that is, in many ways, welcome to Africans. There are nevertheless two areas of leverage: one is the protection of foreign nationals and investment, where China is every bit as vulnerable as any other outside actor. Regional safety mechanisms and cooperation should be enhanced, and used to bring in Chinese cooperation. The other concerns the issue of the European Union\u2019s aid to China itself. External aid programmes Both the EU and Member States maintain large ODA programmes towards China. The situation is paradoxical, since China is Europe\u2019s principal source of trade deficit. Aid programmes since 1989 have been justified by the persistence of poverty-stricken areas and sec- tors of China\u2019s population. In practice, European aid programmes 69 Fran\u00e7ois Godement ",
        "4 often target infrastructure and light industry projects that have been vetted by local Chinese authorities, and could well be financed by China\u2019s public budget. The amounts spent on ODA could well be reallocated towards joint project financing, with particular atten- tion on areas which constitute joint priorities: energy efficiency, environmental protection, urbanisation and transport, public edu- cation and health services. At any rate, grants towards China should increasingly be matched by Chinese cooperation with European aid-givers in other regions of the world, such as Africa. Economic and trade issues Economic and trade issues dominate the relationship between China and the European Union. Patent and intellectual property issues, the bank distribution system and insurance market, dump- ing subsidies and price-fixing are all questions of growing impor- tance. Non-tariff barriers are estimated by the Commission to cost Europe more than 21 billion euro annually. Strategically, three overarching issues permeate these debates. First, the issue of protectionism and \u2018economic nationalism\u2019, which is embodied in two recent debates. In China, the drafting of the new monopoly law designating key strategic sectors where outside investment may be forbidden on an increased scale. In the European Union, a mounting pressure to protect key industries and firms from acquisition by China: the \u2018golden share\u2019 concept, or outright regulation. Europe faces a genuine dilemma in this respect: much of the capital outflow resulting from its trade deficit with China is not recycled to Europe, but towards the US monetary and debt market. Europe therefore blatantly needs an influx of Chinese FDI and financial capital to balance the trade relationship (unless one believes that a more balanced trade rela- tion is within reach \u2013 an unlikely scenario in the coming years). Some of these issues are also divisive within Europe. It is urgent that the EU, just as it achieved unity on its negotia- tion objectives for China\u2019s entry into the WTO in 1999-2001, works towards the same unified strategy in the financial area. Europe\u2019s trade deficit and the international context in fact provide some leverage, while it is clear that Chinese surplus capital can be put to some use in key sectors of the European economy. Why not seek a partnership for infrastructure financing in Europe itself? 70 The EU and China: a necessary partnership ",
        "4 This partnership has been highlighted by Chinese participation in the Galileo global positioning system. But there are many other areas for joint infrastructure investment, such as transport, energy, and communications. Why not balance the \u2018golden share\u2019 concept with a degree of Chinese participation in some key sectors and industries? It is desirable to recycle some of the Chinese trade surplus into the European economy, without increasing the level of public debt and without a further rise in the European currency. Infrastructure investment is an area that provides both a solution to some of the imbalance, and rates of return for Chinese invest- ment without risk. Why not seek a joint code of investment towards this goal? Second, the issue of monetary policy. The fact is that Europe itself is a surplus capital exporter, and its monetary policies have not been conducive to recycling of capital from China. China has in fact missed the opportunity afforded by the rise of the euro since its introduction in 2002, repeating the Japanese mistakes of the 1980s by buying into a depreciating dollar for political rea- sons. Europe would not benefit today from a sudden and high- profile shift of China\u2019s forex reserves towards the euro \u2013 as this would cause further appreciation of the euro. Yet China is today anxious to hold more diversified currency reserves. New debt instruments might be explored such as Eurobonds for public and private issuers. In the short term, however, the question of the re- evaluation of the yuan has become a key issue of contention between China and the European Union. Further liberalisation of China\u2019s capital controls is necessary. Europe should also seek more transparency on China\u2019s external capital flows, often origi- nating in offshore capital markets. Europeans should realise, however, that reevaluation of the yuan and better governance for China\u2019s capital markets will actually lead to a rise in Chinese investment abroad. Europe must have a positive outlook to receive and put to good use this flow of Chinese capital. Third, the issue of opening up China\u2019s service sector to more outside competition. This is an area where Europe has an interna- tional advantage, yet the service sector remains severely restricted in China. This is by no means limited to financial services. Con- struction, telecoms, and distribution services are also cases in point. The opening should also be extended to government pro- curement and to public goods, given the magnitude of China\u2019s domestic investments linked to rapid urbanisation. 71 Fran\u00e7ois Godement ",
        "4 Energy and the environment This is a very strong case for partnership between the European Union and China in these crucial policy areas. Even counting the sometimes uncoordinated strategies of Chinese energy firms abroad to secure long-term access to energy resources, China\u2019s overall energy picture and situation increasingly resemble that of a large consumer society with increasing external dependency and much societal autonomy \u2013 or anarchy \u2013 in energy consumption. China\u2019s government, a few months before the Olympics, is also stung by criticism, inside and outside China, regarding the rising level of pollution and emissions. In the energy domain, an important EU partnership with China is already in place. The energy dialogue has existed since 1994. An Energy Development Programme, started in 2004, has resulted in two Action Plans on, respectively, clean coal, energy efficiency and renewable resources. Europe has further commit- ted itself to a zero-emission generation project with China. The Joint Declaration on Climate Change 9 and the resulting EU- China Strategic Partnership are a key element of joint multilateral cooperation between China and the European Union. Member States add other resources and projects to this agenda. For its part, China has increasingly emphasised the pursuit of energy effi- ciency (with a plan to reduce energy consumption per unit of GDP by 18% in 5 years) and the need to protect its own environment over the mere pursuit of energy security in geopolitical terms. 10 There is still a huge gap, however, between these pilot projects and declarations on the one hand, and concrete achievements on the other. Future cooperation between China and the European Union should include the following issues and sectors: (cid:90) Access to market and reciprocal rights (including acquisition of firms and distribution rights). While Chinese consumers would benefit greatly from more competition in the energy distribu- tion sector, there should be no basic fear of Chinese ownership in European primary energy production and distribution firms, since both Europe and China are energy consumers and energy importers, rather than energy producers with a potential monopoly or cartel position. It would be in the interest of both China and the European Union to open up the capital of their infrastructure, production and distribution entities. It is also in 72 The EU and China: a necessary partnership 9. Full text available at: http://www.eu2006.gv.at/de/Ne ws/information/3003ChinaCli- matJD.html. 10. Michal Meidan (ed.), Shaping China\u2019s energy security: the inside per- spective (Paris: Asia Centre, 2007). ",
        "4 the interest of Europe not to let Russia alone have the deciding hand in an emerging triangle between European and East Asian consumers. The EU-China partnership on energy should break new ground. (cid:90) Cooperation over alternative energy sources (nuclear, wind, solar, coal gasification and liquefaction) as well as on emission control. Large-scale and low-cost production \u2013 China\u2019s trade- mark in all consumer goods sectors \u2013 is not very developed in the area of alternative energy sources. Industrial cooperation, however, could lead to vastly reduced costs in products ranging from solar panels, high-efficiency batteries, hydro-turbines and electric motors for wind electricity. In this domain, as well as in others, moreover, it is very important that the European Union move from an aid-giving and protocol partnership to commercial partnership. At present, there is insufficient visi- bility of the end-results of European aid and actions. It is important to strengthen intellectual property rights and in particular to ensure that cutting edge European technologies in the area of energy efficiency are not recycled free of charge by Chinese firms. In practice, this is yet another reason to promote joint financial investment in environmental industries. (cid:90) A Europe-China initiative should be launched, preferably in a Europe-Asia setting, on the post-Kyoto criteria for 2012 and, before that, for the new round of application to the Clean Development Mechanism after 2008. China benefits from the carbon trading system as an emerging economy, and some of its firms with very high emission levels take advantage of this to seek financing. Europe risks its credibility on the issue of emis- sion reduction, where it has taken a forward-looking stand but must now look for alliances. A more ambitious plan for the reduction of emissions in China should be sought with joint financing and technical cooperation. A three-way partnership with Japan would bring new leverage in this area. In this con- text, there have been conflicting reports on China\u2019s concrete plans for a pilot clean coal generation plant by 2015, in spite of an agreement for co-financing with Europe. China may be developing, with a longer time horizon, its own industrial processes. Ensuring co-development in a shorter timeframe is indeed a symbolic goal for EU-China cooperation. 73 Fran\u00e7ois Godement ",
        "4 Social issues Social issues are a weak link in China\u2019s fast development path. This is acknowledged by authorities who have attached growing impor- tance to building a \u2018harmonious society\u2019 as a way to address these issues. While China today is a middle-income country, its Gini coef- ficient of inequality has steadily worsened \u2013 above 0.45 for the last five years, it is the highest in Asia. The speed of the transition from collective planning to the market has left behind whole sectors of social protection such as retirement pensions, health care, educa- tion in rural areas, water and waste management. Some issues of public management are of a social more than of an economic nature: public procurement and competition, anti-monopoly law and its enforcement, urban planning. There are theoretical debates inside the think-tanks of the Communist Party on social models. Some advocate social-democratic or \u2018Northern European\u2019 style reforms, while others lean more heavily towards economic liberal- ism with safety nets. In regulation, financial incentives, and across many sectors, Europe has considerable experience to offer and should place its firms as providers of services and know-how in China. However, it is inconceivable that Europe should continue the financing of domestic social adjustments in China, while the com- petitive sectors of China\u2019s economy become the first source of external trade deficit for Europe. Cooperation should therefore be viewed as a mutually profitable, contractual process, and not as part of Europe\u2019s external aid. With this reservation, there are many areas where it is in Europe\u2019s best interest to help China overcome its remaining deficiencies. (cid:90) AIDS and other epidemics. European expertise would be helpful in designing information and prevention programmes. Exchange of information and cooperation among the pharma- ceutical industries should be encouraged. (cid:90) Urban planning, public transportation and regional planning. These are sectors where Europe plays a leading role in conceiv- ing, producing and distributing social goods. They are also three sectors where China is in need of progress, in spite of the heavily financed but piecemeal projects it has launched ahead of the Olympic Games. 74 The EU and China: a necessary partnership ",
        "4 (cid:90) Social protection and legislation. This is a very delicate area, because it involves not only international norms and the defi- nition of individual rights, but also the debate on fair commer- cial competition and what constitutes social dumping. High- handed European requests are likely to backfire and remain unpopular in China, even if it would be in the interest of the working population to be protected by higher \u2013 and better enforced \u2013 norms. European firms themselves should be encouraged to enforce standards set by common deliberation, although the sectors where European presence is the strongest are not the most problematic in terms of social practices. Conclusion What does it take to upgrade China-EU relations to the level of a strategic partnership? First, there needs to be reciprocity in mutual pledges and commitments. The European Union\u2019s outlays in China are often not represented for their true value. China must also learn not only to make concessions \u2013 it already makes adjust- ment efforts \u2013 but to accept that these concessions are publicised. While this goes against the traditional culture of face-saving, it is now essential in order to persuade European public opinion of the acceptability of EU-China cooperation. In other words, China needs to showcase some results of its cooperation with the European Union, and to produce some benchmarking regarding the effectiveness of signed programmes. Examples of benchmarking could be sought in the number and size of joint ventures in key areas of cooperation, in the publica- tions resulting from training and educational exchange pro- grammes, and in legislative or regulative changes introduced as a result of consultation with the European Union. Conversely, a track record of Chinese investment and partnership programmes in Europe should be kept. Second, and more fundamentally, it is necessary that the Euro- pean Union does not deviate from principle on some key issues, such as human rights, non-proliferation and reciprocal treat- ment. A coming test for China-Europe cooperation \u2013 and for mul- tilateralism, promoted by both parties \u2013 is in the area of third party 75 Fran\u00e7ois Godement ",
        "4 cooperation and governance. Europe must welcome China\u2019s ris- ing profile in regions, such as the Middle East, Africa and Latin America, where its economic dynamism creates new opportuni- ties. China should strive to maintain and reinforce the interna- tional institutions and norms that are upheld by Europe. Third, priorities need to be clearly selected and fleshed out. China\u2019s well-experienced negotiators have consideration for unity of purpose and action, and react in a realistic fashion to external requests when these requests are properly prioritised. 76 The EU and China: a necessary partnership ",
        "A Chinese perspective on China- European relations Feng Zhongping What China wants from Europe China\u2019s foreign policy includes three main dimensions, which are interlinked, namely relations with its neighbouring countries, rela- tions with the developing world, and relations with major powers. In China\u2019s official and academic discourse, great powers normally include the US, Russia, Japan and Europe. However, unlike the US, Russia and Japan, which are either China\u2019s most important neighbours or the dominant powers at the global or regional level, the EU matters to China mainly because of its economic influence. Ever since China\u2019s opening up and reform in the late 1970s, Europe has been one of China\u2019s most important trade and economic partners. As the biggest developing country in the world, China during the early years of economic construction needed European countries\u2019 investment, high tech- nology and experience of modernisation most. Today, thirty years later, the European Union with 27 Member States has become China\u2019s number one trade partner. In 2007, the EU replaced the US and became the biggest market for Chinese products. In other words, China now needs not just Europe\u2019s money and technology but also its markets. According to the Chinese Ministry of Com- merce, bilateral trade between China and the EU from January to November 2007 reached about 322 billion US dollars. Although Japan has invested the most in China, it is the European Union Member States that have been China\u2019s most important supplier of high technology over the past three decades. With trade volumes expanding, trade friction grows. China\u2019s exports (a substantial amount of which is from European compa- nies operating in China) to Europe have increased at a fast pace. The EU has also significantly increased its exports to China over the past few years. The main problem, however, has been the increasing trade deficit on the European side. So far, the EU has not demanded China to reduce its exports to Europe. Instead, it is 77 Partnerships for effective multilateralism EU relations with Brazil, China, India and Russia 5 ",
        "5 asking China to open further its service sectors to European com- panies. Thus the real problem, to a certain extent, is not the trade deficit but market access. China, however, concerned with its own weak competitive position, has been reluctant to accept the Euro- peans\u2019 demand and would only agree to a gradual opening up of its service sector. The Europeans have also been complaining about two other issues which they believe have affected European exports to China. One is China\u2019s ineffective protection of intellectual property rights, and the other is the depreciation of RMB, the Chinese yuan. The trade issue has become the major focus of the recent Sino- European talks during European leaders\u2019 visits to China and at the tenth China-EU summit held in Beijing on 28 November 2007. It has also become a main source of dissatisfaction and anger between the two sides. To redress the renminbi (RMB) issue, the \u2018big three\u2019 of the Euro group, namely the President of the Eurogroup, also prime minister of Luxembourg, the Head of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Eco- nomic and Monetary Affairs, made an unprecedented trip to China in November 2007, urging the People\u2019s Bank of China, China\u2019s central bank, to revaluate the RMB. The Europeans, especially the European Commission, have been voicing the European concerns over trade issues since 2005 and Peter Mandelson, the Trade Commissioner, has been a fre- quent visitor to China. In October 2006, the Commission unveiled its first ever working paper on trade relations with China, together with its general policy communication on China entitled \u2018Closer partners and growing responsibilities\u2019. On the whole, Europe has adopted a firm stance on trade matters. China, for its part, has been asking the EU to recognise its full market economy status (MES). With MES, Chinese companies cannot easily become the victim of anti-dumping investigations by European authorities. Since China will automatically become a full market economy in 2016, 15 years after entering the WTO, the Europeans seem to have two choices. Either granting China MES as early as possible, because its value decreases each day, or to delay such recognition as long as possible. It is possible that the two sides could come to an agreement on the MES issue during their negotiations on the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA), which started in early 2006. The purpose of negotiating the 78 A Chinese perspective on China-European relations ",
        "5 PCA is partly to update the trade and economic agreement between China and the EEC signed 22 years ago. China has only gradually realised the importance of trade issues in its overall relations with Europe. The recent series of high-level meetings held in Beijing, especially, have had some impact on the top leaders of China. During the tenth EU-China leaders\u2019 meeting China\u2019s premier, Wen Jiabao, proposed setting up a vice-premier level economic and trade talk mechanism between China and the EU. The first such set of talks was due to take place in April 2008. It was also agreed that the People\u2019s Bank of China and its counterparts in Europe would hold regular meetings on issues which concern both sides. So far, China has had similar talks with both the US and Japan. The agreement to hold high-level talks with the European Union on trade issues is a clear indication that China attaches great importance to its biggest trade partner. Of course, partnership is about much more than just trade and economic cooperation. China has been requesting the EU Mem- ber States to lift the arms embargo against China. France under President Jacques Chirac and Germany under Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder had pushed for this to be lifted. The chances of success- fully removing the embargo were actually good until the US made its opposition clear and China passed the Anti-Secession Law early in 2005. The situation became further complicated when Ger- many elected its new leader in November 2005. Chancellor Angela Merkel is involved in consultations with the Americans on the issue. On the other hand, the French position has not changed since the new President Nicolas Sarkozy came into office. China also wants the European countries to support its unifi- cation, and to oppose Taiwan\u2019s independence and other inde- pendence movements in China. From China\u2019s point of view, although the European countries do not have as much leverage as the US does on Taiwan, the Europeans\u2019 position would still have a certain impact. By comparison to the French position on Taiwan, publicised during President Sarkozy\u2019s trip to Beijing in November 2007, the Chinese have good reason to be disappointed with the EU position expressed in the joint statement following the tenth Sino-EU leaders\u2019 meeting in Beijing. In that document, the Euro- pean Union just expressed concern over the Taipei authorities\u2019 intentions regarding the future status of the island. 79 Feng Zhongping ",
        "5 How China views Europe As mentioned above, China has regarded Europe as one of the world\u2019s leading powers or, to be more accurate, as the world\u2019s lead- ing economic power. This view, however, has been changing over the past few years. First, more and more people in China think that the European Union is a power which has different views from the United States over the world order of the twenty-first century. Although both the US and Europe have the same values and share many interests, they hold different opinions on how to address the new challenges facing today\u2019s world. The gap between the Europeans and the Americans was real over the Iraq crisis. The majority of the popu- lation in Europe has opposed the Iraq war, even in the UK where the Blair government participated in the war with the US. The Europeans on the whole do not believe that military means can be effective in fighting international terrorism. The Europeans do not see eye to eye with the Americans on the issue of climate change either. While the EU has been playing the leading role in coping with global warming, the US, which refused to sign the Kyoto Treaty, is reluctant to make any commitment on the issue. Although the new leaders of France and Germany are regarded as more pro-American and transatlantic relations have greatly improved, key differences between the two sides have remained. The Iranian nuclear issue will be the litmus test for the newly recovered transatlantic ties. If the US attacked Iran, many Euro- pean countries would have great difficulties in providing their support. Second, the European Union should not be considered just a civilian power, as its military capability has quietly developed over the recent years following the Kosovo crisis. While many if not all Europeans still want the US troops to remain in Europe, the role of NATO has undergone considerable change since the end of the Cold War. The security situation in Europe today is completely different from that prevailing during the Cold War. According to the EU\u2019s first ever security paper, \u2018A Secure Europe in a Better World\u2019, agreed by all the Member States in 2003, the key threats facing the Europeans are international terrorism, the prolifera- tion of WMD, regional conflicts, state failure and organised crime. 80 A Chinese perspective on China-European relations ",
        "5 It has been suggested that this document should be updated, yet whatever changes may be introduced, the fact remains that Europe is facing new and also much more complex security chal- lenges. Europe itself has shown a willingness to play a more active role and become the US\u2019s partner in dealing with the \u2018new threats\u2019. Since the Kosovo crisis in the late 1990s, the EU has steadily made progress in the area of European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP). The EU is no longer just a trade bloc, playing the leading role in the WTO and other global economic institutions, but also an actor able to play a vital role in peacekeeping and crisis man- agement with its so-called Battlegroups and other crisis manage- ment tools. Third, most Chinese observers of Europe have an optimistic view of the future of European integration. Chinese observers have been more influenced by German and French approaches than by the British one. Most Chinese Centres for European Stud- ies (thanks to the EU-China higher education programme, the number of Centres for European Studies in Chinese Universities and think tanks has grown rapidly in recent years) host German experts, French experts and British experts. The phenomenon of enlargement fatigue and the constitutional crisis have made Chi- nese officials and researchers cautious about the prospects for European integration. Yet the overall feeling in China about Europe\u2019s future integration has been quite positive. One has to accept that the European integration process has never been a straightforward one. The signing of the Lisbon Treaty in Decem- ber 2007 (of course, it will not take effect until it is ratified by all 27 Member States), has sent a strong signal that the EU wants to move forward. Furthermore, although the common foreign policy will, at least for the foreseeable future, remain an inter-govern- mental exercise (i.e. the final say will remain in the hands of each Member State), it is believed that with the new common foreign policy mechanisms, including the permanent President of the European Council, and a double-hatted High Representative, the EU will become more visible and its voice louder on the world stage. Perhaps most important is that the public in Europe has been supporting the EU Member States to work further together in dealing with climate change, terrorism and other global chal- lenges. 81 Feng Zhongping ",
        "5 What can China and Europe do together in the world? China is of course very different from Europe. China\u2019s GDP is already bigger than that of most European countries, but it has a population of 1.3 billion and the level of per capita GDP is very low. Since China is still a poor country, development has always been the priority for the Chinese leadership. For a long time, China has been an inward-looking country and its approach to the outside world has been reactive. Since it entered into the global system, becoming a member of the WTO, for example, China has been a rule taker, not a rule maker. Moreover, China\u2019s political system is different from that of the European countries. It therefore has gen- erally been sensitive about western-style democracy and the so- called colour revolutions taking place in recent years. On foreign policy issues, the biggest difference between China and the Euro- pean countries is that China does not think that one country has the right to intervene in another\u2019s internal affairs. For example, China has been playing an active role in helping solve the North Korean nuclear issue, but it has refused to impose sanctions or to consider military options. On both Burma/Myanmar and the Sudan-Darfur issues, China has retained this position. However, with its economy growing at a fast pace and the inte- gration with the world deepening, China has recognised that com- mon interests with European countries far outweigh divergences. Indeed, China\u2019s perception of its national interests has changed greatly over the past three decades since it opened up to the out- side world. China has increasingly realised that its own stability and prosperity is closely linked to the rest of the world. Further- more, China has gradually come to understand that it has the responsibility to play a bigger role in maintaining global peace and stability. A few years ago, the Chinese leadership adopted the notion of \u2018peaceful rise\u2019 to illustrate China\u2019s intentions. Today, the key concept is the \u2018harmonious world\u2019. This should not be regarded as just a slogan. In fact, it shows that China is willing to make a greater contribution to the world\u2019s stability and prosperity and testifies to Beijing\u2019s growing sense of responsibility. China has more in common with Europe than with the US in reshaping the new world order, or building up a harmonious world. The Europeans, drawing from their own post-Second World War experience, have developed a strong belief that \u2018effec- tive multilateralism\u2019 should be the key principle for dealing with 82 A Chinese perspective on China-European relations ",
        "5 the new challenges and maintain peace and stability in an increas- ingly globalised world. China, for its part, has been pushing for a multipolar world ever since the end of the Cold War. It is true that a multipolar world is different from a multilateral world. Yet it is China\u2019s view that a multipolar world would be the basis of a mul- tilateral world. Without a balanced power structure in the world, any multilateralism will not be reliable. Now, like many in the world, the Chinese government thinks that a multipolar world has already emerged, with the rise of new economic powers, including not just China but also Russia and India. A survey of Chinese offi- cial papers on foreign policy shows that the government talks less of multipolarity and more of multilateralism. To have a similar view about how the world should be governed is important. This has become the basis, indeed, for China and Europe to further develop strategic dialogues and cooperation on key global issues. Climate change Global warming has become a great concern for the world and especially for the Europeans. China has also started to worry about its own environmental problems and has been reflecting on its eco- nomic growth model. As far as its international responsibility is concerned, China is committed to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol. At the same time, it insists that the European countries and other devel- oped countries must continue to take the lead in reducing green- house gas (GHG) emissions beyond 2012 and assist developing countries in enhancing their contributions to addressing climate change. For the time being, the central government is making con- siderable efforts to induce the provincial governments to accept the so-called \u2018scientific development approach\u2019, i.e. green and sus- tainable development. If China and the European Union can form a Partnership on Climate Change, they can become a model for the world \u2013 a model on how developed countries could help developing countries to ensure energy efficiency and environmental protection. Such a partnership should include the development of concrete coopera- tion on province-level climate change programmes in China, as well as cooperation on technology development and transfer. In the coming years, there will be a great potential for both sides to cooperate in this area. The Europeans should work closely with 83 Feng Zhongping ",
        "5 the Chinese on transferring European energy technology to China. For its part, China must make sure that European intellec- tual property is well protected. Africa\u2019s stability and development China and Europe can also work for Africa\u2019s stability and develop- ment. The Europeans, for various reasons, have maintained strong links with Africa. The EU has been the most important trade part- ner and the biggest investor for African countries. China has tradi- tionally had good relations with Africa. China supported the African independence movement and the Africans have in turn offered their support to Beijing in international organisations. During recent years, Africa has become more important to Beijing as China\u2019s demand for resources and especially energy has steadily increased. African countries have also become an important mar- ket for Chinese products. The Europeans should not consider China\u2019s growing influence in Africa as an unhealthy development. The EU and China should build on their respective advantages and work together to reduce poverty and promote peace and sta- bility in the continent. China\u2019s strength lies in its infrastructure building. In the future, there are two areas where China and the European countries could deepen their cooperation. One is strengthening the medium and small-sized enterprises and the other is agriculture. Both areas are crucial for Africa\u2019s develop- ment. The number of Chinese in Africa has been increasing in recent years. China could provide African enterprises with the know-how to produce low-price goods, while the Europeans could deliver funding. China held a very successful summit meeting with African leaders in 2006. Most countries in Africa have taken the view that China\u2019s involvement in Africa now represents an important opportunity for them. China, however, is not the only country to have hosted such an important summit with African leaders. The first EU-Africa summit took place in Cairo as early as in 2000 and the second summit was held just last December in Lisbon. China has indicated its willingness to have more coordination with the European Union on Africa. At the tenth China-EU Summit held in Beijing on 28 November 2007, leaders of both sides agreed, accord- ing to the joint statement, to continue their dialogue on African issues. The EU invited China to attend the EU-Africa Summit as 84 A Chinese perspective on China-European relations ",
        "5 an observer. China invited the EU Commissioner for Develop- ment to visit China, in order to explore ways and channels of coop- eration among China, the EU and Africa in appropriate areas. Clearly, if China and the European countries work together on Africa, the chances of making a real change will be much higher. Non-proliferation Cooperation on nuclear proliferation, illegal immigration and other non-traditional security issues should be further strength- ened between China and Europe. Iran, for example, remains a criti- cal challenge for the world. China\u2019s position has been consistently that the Iranian question could only be solved through political means within a multilateral framework. China therefore hopes to be able to work together with the Europeans on this issue. The Chi- nese government has been an active participant in talks and discus- sions on how to address the broader question of nuclear power for civilian purposes. China tends to believe that the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) proposed by the US is a sound initia- tive but also thinks that this policy initiative faces serious techno- logical challenges. China and the European countries could cer- tainly intensify their dialogue about this. China still believes that the NPT is a cornerstone of the international non-proliferation regime and sees some positive signs emanating from the US recently, i.e. President Bush\u2019s announcement of further nuclear disarmament in December 2007. Conclusion China needs Europe more than Europe needs China. When people in China think about Europe and its importance, trade, invest- ment, science & technology, and higher education would certainly come up to their minds. For many, Europe is also a model from which China could learn. They are not overly worried about the existing differences. They would think this is inevitable because the two actors have a different history, culture, political system and above all are at different stages of economic development. Anyway, differences should not become obstacles to cooperation. From China\u2019s standpoint, what is really needed to enhance China-EU relations is strengthening mutual trust. Any policies 85 Feng Zhongping ",
        "5 and actions which would increase mutual confidence should therefore be encouraged. The current strategic dialogue mecha- nism between China and some EU countries, such as France, the UK, and Germany, should be maintained. The second-track dia- logues between Chinese and European think-tanks have proven to be quite effective for both sides to acquire a better understanding of each other and should be increased. European experts should pay more visits to Chinese research institutions. As its relations with Europe have expanded rapidly and become more complex, China has to gain a better understanding of how the EU works. Although important foreign policy and defence issues have remained in the hands of individual EU Member States, China has come to realise that on most other issues it is necessary to work with both individual capitals and with Brussels. 86 A Chinese perspective on China-European relations ",
        "The EU and India: a deepening partnership Christian Wagner Introduction India and the European Union (EU) share a range of cultural and economic relations that have developed over many decades. India was one of the first countries that established diplomatic relations with the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1963. In 1973 a Commerical Cooperation Agreement was signed. Since the 1990s economic and political relations between India and the EU have intensified considerably. The Joint Political Statement of 1993 for- mally launched a political dialogue with annual ministerial meet- ings. The Cooperation Agreement of 1994 extended the bilateral relationship to broader economic and political affairs. With the first bilateral summit in Lisbon in 2000, the EU acknowledged India\u2019s economic achievements and its aspirations for a global role in the international system of the twenty-first century. The European Security Strategy (ESS) of 2003, based on the concept of comprehensive security, has emphasised the need for strategic partnerships. The landmark Strategic Partnership Agreement between the EU and India was launched at the fifth EU-India summit in the Hague in 2004. 1 At the sixth summit in New Delhi in 2005 the Joint Action Plan (JAP) was adopted to implement the Strategic Partnership. 2 The Strategic Partnership and the Joint Action Plan underline the special importance of this relationship because India is one of the few countries with which the EU has signed such an agreement. The main points of the JAP are: Strengthening Dialogue and Consultation Mechanisms; Political Dialogue and Cooperation; Bringing Together People and Cultures; Economic Policy Dialogue and Cooperation; and Developing Trade and Investment. The strategy set out in the EU Country Strategy Paper for India (2007-2013) consists of two pillars. 3 The first forms the basis for the EU\u2019s future development cooperation so that India is able to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) by 2015. The 87 Partnerships for effective multilateralism EU relations with Brazil, China, India and Russia 1.

        "6 second pillar concerns the implementation of the JAP. In the con- text of an intensified political dialogue since the first summit in 2000, annual summits, as well as regular ministerial and senior official meetings, take place on a regular basis. Sectoral dialogue groups have been established as well as working groups on con- sular affairs and terrorism. Besides the official level, the EU-India Round Table includes the civil societies of both sides in the insti- tutional network. These various agreements and multifaceted activities show that EU-India relations are already embedded in a dense institutional web compared to other newly emerging coun- tries. Bilateral relations are still dominated by economic and trade issues. The EU remains India\u2019s most important trading partner and accounted for 21.6% of India\u2019s total trade in 2004. India is an attractive market for EU exports. Annual growth of EU goods exports to India averaged 5.7% between 2000 and 2004 against an average annual increase of EU goods exports to the world of only 3%. Bilateral trade in services has nearly doubled since 1995 and reached 5.4 billion euro in 2003. India is at present the EU\u2019s twelfth most important trading partner, accounting for 1.8% of the EU\u2019s total exports and 1.7% of its total imports. India\u2019s new economic attractiveness is also visible in the increase in foreign direct investment (FDI) since 1991. Investment approvals rose from 78 million euro in 1991 to 2.3 billion euro ten years\u2019 later. Improving economic relations have been accompanied by growing consensus on security issues. Both India and the EU share a mutual commitment to democracy, human rights, a pluralistic society and peaceful conflict resolution. Both sides have under- lined their responsibility to promote a just international order which rests on multilateral institutions, thereby strengthening the principles of cooperation rather than confrontation. In order to cope with the new security challenges like terrorism, the prolif- eration of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), drug and human trafficking, and organised crime, India and the EU are natural partners. Despite the many areas of convergence, however, it should not be overlooked that Indian foreign policy elites have a traditional understanding of their country being a great power. Indian foreign policy is therefore characterised by ideas of self-reliance and independence and India has used a mixture of hard and soft 88 The EU and India: a deepening partnership ",
        "6 power strategies to pursue its interests. Since independence in 1947, India has been a strong promoter of regional cooperation and multilateral institutions in the Asian and global arena. India was active in settling regional disputes, such as in Indochina in the 1950s, and Nehru was one of the founding fathers of the Non- Aligned Movement (NAM) in 1961. During the 1960s India became a representative of the developing countries in the context of the United Nations (UN) and advocated a New International Economic Order (NIEO) in the 1970s. It was only after the military defeat in the border conflict against China and the first Chinese nuclear test in 1964 that India put a stronger emphasis on hard power strategies that were followed by conventional and nuclear armament. The collapse of the Soviet Union, which was India\u2019s most important trading partner at that time, was followed by the severe financial crisis which broke up India\u2019s \u2018mixed economy\u2019. Although this paved the way for economic liberalisation, India was initially regarded as a \u2018loser\u2019 in the new international environment. Today the picture has changed radically. The economic reforms intro- duced after 1991 made of India one of the world\u2019s most dynamic economies. The conclusion of strategic partnership agreements with the US, China, Russia, Japan, France, the UK and the EU indi- cates that India is one of the main beneficiaries of the interna- tional system that has developed since the early 1990s. India holds a special position in the international system because it has always been regarded as a representative of the devel- oping countries in international organisations such as the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Furthermore, India is active in estab- lishing new alliances like the IBSA-Initiative with Brazil and South Africa and has intensified the trilateral dialogue with China and Russia. India has therefore a special position and acts as a gateway towards the countries of the \u2018South\u2019 with regard to future negoti- ations in multilateral institutions. That said, Indian foreign policy is still guided by a strong sense of strategic autonomy that puts the degree of engagement with other great powers in perspective. The recent domestic debate about the Indo-US nuclear deal and the future dependence or independence of India\u2019s foreign policy has highlighted the contin- uing importance of these concerns. 89 Christian Wagner ",
        "6 Its economic and human resources make India one of the most attractive partners for the EU in the twenty-first century. India and the EU have already established a strong institutional frame- work to support their cooperation. But although the EU is one of India\u2019s most important partners in terms of global trade and financial institutions, India\u2019s new middle class and its foreign pol- icy elites remain much more focussed on the US and Asia rather than on Europe. There are at least two main challenges for the EU. First, to expand EU-India relations from the current economic focus to political and security issues of common concern. Second, to broaden political, civil society and also academic networks to make Europe a more attractive partner, especially when compared to the US. Political, security and governance issues The reform of multilateral institutions India and the EU share a number of political goals, security con- cerns and priorities for global governance. Both sides stress the need to reform the United Nations (UN) in order to make the world organisation a central institution for global governance issues. India and Europe should intensify their bilateral consultations before the meetings of the UN General Assembly and extend their collaboration on major international issues on security, trade, envi- ronment and development. India and the EU have also emphasised their commitment to effective multilateralism. Although both have a long tradition of involvement in multilateral institutions, they have a different understanding of effective multilateralism. The EU regards \u2018effec- tive multilateralism\u2019 as a synonym for strengthening interna- tional institutions in order to establish a rule-based international order in the long-term perspective. India has a more traditional understanding of the concept which derives from its great power approach and the strong emphasis on national sovereignty. India regards multilateral institutions as a means to pursue its national interests. The use of \u2018effective multilateralism\u2019 can therefore be understood as a strategy to achieve these goals via cooperation in global institutions. Looking at the foreign policy discourse in India it is difficult to imagine that Indian governments will agree 90 The EU and India: a deepening partnership ",
        "6 to international agreements that may constrain national sover- eignty. As a consequence of its foreign policy approach and its great power ambitions, India has a keen interest in the reform of global institutions that will enhance the country\u2019s international stand- ing. This opens new avenues for cooperation with the EU but also includes some constraints. These are evident, for instance, in the different approaches towards the International Criminal Court (ICC). The EU wants to strengthen this new institution while the ICC is not supported by India, which fears potential interference in its internal affairs. India has also been very vocal with regard to the reform of the Bretton Woods institutions like the Interna- tional Monetary Fund (IMF). India wants such reforms to increase its global influence. It has demanded that the GDP should be com- puted on Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) terms, which would boost India\u2019s share to 5.2 %. Peacekeeping, crisis management and regional conflicts The EU and India have a long tradition in UN peacekeeping opera- tions and post-conflict reconstruction. Since the 1960s India has participated in most UN peacekeeping missions and has sup- ported international crisis management in regional conflicts as long as its own national interests have not been affected. For many years India has belonged to the top three troop contributors to UN missions and no other country has lost as many soldiers in interna- tional missions as India. Regional conflicts and failed states pose security threats for both India and the EU as these states may provide safe havens for terrorist groups. The Indian Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, has clearly stated that India cannot afford to see states fail in its neighbourhood. India is also trying to cooperate with its neigh- bours in order to tackle the terrorist threats. Although not part of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan, India has increased its cooperation with the Afghan government and is actively involved in the reconstruction of infrastructure like roads and schools. It is also beginning to train the Afghan army. India has agreed on a consultative mechanism with Pakistan to stop the infiltration of terrorists into Kashmir, has operated joint military actions with Bhutan and Burma/Myanmar to fight 91 Christian Wagner ",
        "6 insurgent groups in India\u2019s northeast and is negotiating with Bangladesh for a joint approach. India\u2019s efforts, however, are ham- pered by the fact that it is perceived negatively in the neighbouring countries. Because of its experiences with the Kashmir issue India was reluctant to support multilateral initiatives for conflict reso- lution in South Asia for a long time. Moreover, Indian foreign pol- icy still puts a stronger emphasis on pursuing national interest than on the promotion of democracy and human rights. The EU has slowly expanded its engagement in regional con- flict resolution in Asia in recent years. In 2002, the EU participated in the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission (SLMM) to monitor the ceasefire agreement between the Sri Lankan government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and, in 2003, the EU became one of the Co-Chairs for the peace process in Sri Lanka. The Aceh Monitoring Mission (AMM) was the first ESDP opera- tion in which the EU cooperated with a regional organisation (ASEAN) and became actively engaged in conflict resolution in South East Asia. India and the EU have already initiated back-channel commu- nication on the political developments in Sri Lanka and Nepal, where India has successfully mediated to reach an agreement between the conflicting parties. In order to cope with the chal- lenge of failing states India and the EU need to strengthen their consultation mechanism further, for instance on countries like Burma/Myanmar. Both sides should intensify their collaboration and should promote joint training for security and police forces in interna- tional peacekeeping missions, and share experiences in post- conflict management. In the context of the JAP, conferences and seminars on common experiences and lessons learned have been established like the EU-India Dialogue on \u2018Asian, European and African Policies, Practices and Lessons Learned in Peace Opera- tions in Africa: DR Congo, Sudan and the Darfur Conflict\u2019 which took place in June 2007 in Delhi. India has been actively involved with the US in post-disaster management after the tsunami in December 2004, for instance in Sri Lanka and Indonesia. India is only beginning to build up its own capabilities for post-disaster management and civil protec- tion. This is an area for closer collaboration with the EU, which is not yet covered by the JAP. 92 The EU and India: a deepening partnership ",
        "6 Armaments and non-proliferation The fight against terrorism and the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) feature prominently among the secu- rity concerns shared by the EU and India. India has suffered for many years from the threat of terrorism, mostly from militant Islamist groups which use terrorist attacks for their struggle in Kashmir. Recent bombings in Delhi, Mumbai, and Varanasi were attributed to these groups and aimed to undermine the rapproche- ment between India and Pakistan that started in 2003. The bomb- ings in London in 2005 showed that militant Islamist groups have a global network whose support base can be traced back to South Asia. Both sides have already agreed in the JAP to establish contacts between the Indian and EU Counter Terrorism Coordinators and to cooperate in the UN context to ensure universal respect and implementation of relevant UN Security Council resolutions, UN conventions on terrorism and related protocols. Although India and the EU have a common commitment to the non-proliferation of WMD, the issue is more complex than that. With its nuclear tests of 1974 and 1998, India became a de facto nuclear power which refuses to sign up to the Non-Prolifera- tion Treaty (NPT). The US-India nuclear deal of March 2006 is an important watershed in the history of the NPT because the US for the first time agreed to share civilian nuclear technology with a country outside the NPT. The timing of the deal in 2006 caused concern because of the negotiations with Iran and North Korea on their nuclear programmes. The US-India deal focuses on civilian nuclear cooperation in order to deal with India\u2019s energy shortages which impede economic growth. Neo-conservative security ana- lysts in the US argue that the deal also includes a strategic compo- nent which is part of the US strategy of containing or hedging the rise of China. India perceives itself as a nuclear power on a par with China but has never pursued nuclear proliferation \u2013 in contrast to the nuclear powers of the NPT or countries like Pakistan. Despite all the criticism in the US Congress, the \u2018Hyde Act\u2019 was passed with a large majority in December 2006. Despite their different approach to the NPT, India and the EU could agree on a common position against non-proliferation of WMD as laid down in the JAP. India demonstrated its commit- ment to non-proliferation by supporting the international com- munity against the Iranian nuclear programme, notwithstanding 93 Christian Wagner ",
        "6 India\u2019s own interest in Iranian energy supplies. Following the agreement between India and the US on the final amendments to the deal in summer 2007, the Indian government has been con- fronted with domestic opposition, coming mainly from the Com- munist parties. They argue that the deal will make of India a \u2018jun- ior partner\u2019 of the US and that it will damage India\u2019s independent foreign policy. If the deal does come into force, however, it will pose a chal- lenge to the EU as well. On the one hand, EU members like the UK and France have already welcomed the deal which will bring India closer to the non-proliferation regime. If the agreement is imple- mented following the consent of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) and negotiations for safeguards with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), 60% of India\u2019s nuclear programme will be under the safeguard mechanism of the IAEA \u2013 a major increase compared to current arrangements. Moreover, India will further strengthen its export control mechanisms and may become a member of the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI). The deal may also open new investment opportunities for state and private companies in the Indian energy market. On the other hand, various EU members have voiced their concern that the deal may further weaken the nuclear non-proliferation regime. They fear that the privileges given to India may act as an incentive for other countries to follow India\u2019s path, for instance by leaving the NPT regime. Despite the criticism of the deal, it should not be overlooked that all nuclear powers under the NPT have accepted it. Russia, France and the UK have openly endorsed the deal. China, which is seen as India\u2019s main rival in Asia, has not yet voiced any major concern against it and even Mohammed al Baradei, the Director of the IAEA, has welcomed the deal. Human rights, democratisation and development assistance India and the EU share a similar understanding of human rights and have a long tradition of democratic governance. The imple- mentation of human rights in India is still in need of improvement and has led to various controversies with the EU especially over the human rights situation in Kashmir. At the global level, the creation of the Human Rights Council was a major achievement of recent UN reforms. India was elected to the Human Rights Council in 2006 but has not always followed European approaches. The JAP 94 The EU and India: a deepening partnership ",
        "6 includes provisions to engage India in a human rights dialogue with the EU, although India\u2019s sensitivities regarding external inter- ventions in domestic affairs need to be taken into account. Closer cooperation between India and the EU on human rights issues in third countries like Sudan and Burma/Myanmar would strengthen international mechanisms. However, although India is the biggest democracy in the world and has a longer democratic tradition than some EU Member States, it has not developed a pol- icy of democratisation or promotion of democracy in its foreign policy. Indian interventions in neighbouring countries have been mainly guided by requirements of national security rather than by the aim of democracy promotion. Since 1964 India has also developed its own programme of development assistance, i.e. the India Technical and Economic Cooperation (ITEC). ITEC is a mainly bilateral programme, largely focussing on training activities both for civilians and the military abroad. The extent of India\u2019s development assistance is difficult to evaluate because it often includes export promotion schemes for Indian industry. The majority of India\u2019s development activities are focussed on neighbouring countries in South Asia, especially Bhutan and Nepal. After 2001, Afghanistan became another focus of Indian development activities. It can be expected that India may extend and concentrate these programmes on energy-rich countries in Africa and Latin America. Involvement and cooperation in Africa Following the example of China, the Indian state and private energy companies have intensified their activities in Africa in recent years although, compared to China, India has far fewer resources at its disposal. If India increases its activities in Africa and Latin America, India and the EU will \u2018meet\u2019 more often in the future in third countries. This raises the question of how far both sides will seek to promote common norms like democracy and human rights or rather pursue national interests like energy security. African countries contribute 25% of India\u2019s energy imports. Of these countries, Nigeria is the most important supplier with a share of 15% of India\u2019s total oil imports. India\u2019s energy companies are also active in Sudan where they cooperate with Chinese firms in the exploration of the Greater Nile Oil Project. 95 Christian Wagner ",
        "6 India has launched various initiatives to become more actively involved in African institutions. It has intensified its relations with the East African Community (EAC), created a common forum with the Southern African Development Community (SADC) in 2005 and supported NEPAD with 200 million US dol- lars. In 2005 India and the African Union (AU) signed a memoran- dum of understanding (MoU) establishing that the Indian space organisation will link the 53 African states by satellite. South Africa is a strategic partner of India and both have established the Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional Cooperation (IOR- ARC). To enhance cooperation with Africa, India has developed the Special Commonwealth African Assistance Programme (SCAAP). Present figures from the ITEC and SCAAP show that there is no clear correlation between resource-rich countries and Indian development activities. Because of energy interests and its close relations with African countries through the Indian dias- pora, however, India\u2019s role in dealing with regional conflicts in Africa can be expected to grow. Regional integration and inter-regional cooperation Europe has always been regarded as a model for regional collabora- tion and integration in other parts of the world. Because of the bilateral problems between India and its neighbours, in the past regional cooperation could not gain momentum in South Asia. It was only in 1985 that the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) was established. After the beginning of its economic reforms in 1991, India became more involved in the pro- motion of regional organisations in South Asia. India was among the founding members of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi- Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) and of the IOR-ARC, which were established in 1997. India has also been actively seeking to become a member of other regional institutions across Asia. Its involvement in the institutional network of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has been growing since the early 1990s. In 1992 India became a sectoral dialogue partner of ASEAN, and in 1995 a full one. In 1993 it was invited to participate in the ASEAN Regional Forum that dealt with security issues and included extra- regional powers like China, the EU and the US. In 2003 India and 96 The EU and India: a deepening partnership ",
        "6 ASEAN signed an agreement to build a free trade area by 2011 and India acceded to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation. In 2004 the ASEAN-India Partnership for Peace, Progress and Shared Prosper- ity pact was signed. In addition to its participation in the two sum- mit meetings of the East Asian Summit, India has also been eager to join the inter-regional dialogue between Europe and Asia that started with the Asia-Europe Meetings (ASEM) in 1996. India was first left out of ASEM because of China\u2019s resistance and has par- ticipated in ASEM only since 2007. India\u2019s growing engagement in the network of regional institu- tions in Asia stem from the fact that the importance of Asian countries as India\u2019s economic partners is growing steadily. In this context, India has launched new initiatives to enhance SAARC. The implementation of the SAARC Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA) in 2006 has given intra-regional trade a new stimulus. With the inclusion of Afghanistan as a new member in 2007, SAARC was extended for the first time. At the SAARC summit in Delhi in April 2007 Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh promoted the concept of \u2018connectiv- ity\u2019 in order to increase both regional trade and people-to-people contacts. He also emphasised India\u2019s \u2018asymmetrical responsibili- ties\u2019 in South Asia, thereby accepting India\u2019s leading role in SAARC. With the introduction of unilateral trade concessions for the least developed SAARC members, India has tried again to stimulate the process of regional cooperation. SAARC\u2019s new momentum has also attracted a growing number of observers including the EU, China, Japan, the United States and South Korea. Although South Asian regionalism follows a differ- ent trajectory than Europe\u2019s, SAARC can benefit from EU cooper- ation in the field of civil society and people-to-people contacts. The decision was taken at the last SAARC summit in Delhi in 2007 to set up a South Asia university which should have its first cam- pus in India. Given Europe\u2019s experiences in student mobility this is an excellent opportunity to promote EU-SAARC cooperation be it through the development of a common syllabus, the creation of other campuses in neighbouring countries, or the creation of exchange networks between students and academics. Another area where the EU can bring its expertise to bear is the concept of town twinning or partnership programmes between bordering state capitals or provinces. 97 Christian Wagner ",
        "6 Despite these new initiatives, it should not be overlooked that the overall record of SAARC is still modest. While increasing in recent years, intraregional trade accounts for only around 5% of total trade. In 2005 the SAARC Development Fund (SDF) was cre- ated with three focal points, namely the Social Window Project, the Infrastructure Window Project, and the Economic Window Project. Since it still lacks an effective mechanism to allocate funds for common projects, SAARC could usefully draw from the EU\u2019s experience to devise how regional projects could be managed. India\u2019s new emphasis on increased economic interaction has also helped to improve relations with Pakistan. Relations between the two countries have for a long time been held hostage by the Kashmir conflict. With the rapprochement in 2003 and the begin- ning of the composite dialogue in 2004, both sides have developed a mechanism to address their major concerns like Kashmir (Pak- istan) and terrorism (India). These developments further under- line that regionalism can be regarded as an important tool in help- ing to overcome hostile relations between neighbours. The international community should continue to support this bilat- eral process in the future and there should be no new initiative for third party intervention or an internationalisation of the Kashmir issue. This may damage the positive results that India and Pak- istan have achieved so far. Economic and trade issues India\u2019s rapid economic growth and its expanding middle class offer a solid basis for future economic cooperation with the EU. Despite its economic liberalisation since 1991, India still counts for less than 1% of world trade in goods and just over 2% of world trade in services. The EU, on the other hand, is the world\u2019s largest exporter and importer of goods and services. In order to further intensify their economic relations, both sides have agreed on an EU-India Free Trade Agreement (FTA), for which negotiations started in June 2007. India has lowered its tariffs considerably since 1991 although they are still high compared to EU tariffs. Moreover, India\u2019s unilat- eral liberalisation policy contrasts with the country\u2019s reluctance towards multilateral liberalisation, for instance in the agricultural sector within the Doha Development Round. 98 The EU and India: a deepening partnership ",
        "6 Major Indian business firms have intensified their investments in Europe in recent years. Both sides share an interest in greater mar- ket access for services and FDI. This common interest may help to strengthen the mutual commitment to the protection of intellec- tual property rights. Another element of convergence lies in the fact that neither the EU nor India seem to be pressing for liberalisation in agricultural trade. The main hurdles for an FTA with India will be domestic. India may resent the inclusion of binding clauses on environmental, social and human rights, which are regarded as interference in internal affairs. The recent debate about the implications of the Indo-US nuclear deal has illustrated again that the Indian public has a very critical attitude to external influences. Nevertheless, it should be possible to overcome these obstacles because the Indian Parliament does not have treaty-making powers and the Indian government joined the WTO in 1995 despite massive internal dissent. Because of its rapid economic growth India \u2013 together with China \u2013 has become one of the growth engines of the world econ- omy. Besides already existing platforms of communication, India and the EU should intensify their dialogue on WTO issues to achieve an effective multilateral framework in the field of trade and investment. India is an important partner in the global trade system as it is regarded as a representative of the developing coun- tries in the context of trade negotiations. Apart from that, India has built new alliances like the IBSA (India-Brazil-South Africa) initiative in order to increase its diplomatic leverage in interna- tional trade regimes. It remains to be seen how far IBSA will evolve into a durable alliance and whether it will represent the interests of the South rather than those of the member countries. Neverthe- less, IBSA is an example of India acting as a broker for other play- ers in the South. Energy and the environment India\u2019s economic achievements since the 1990s have made energy security a major issue of its foreign policy. At present India\u2019s main domestic energy resources for power generation are coal (68.3%), hydro (11.9%), gas (11.5%), oil (4.6%) and nuclear power (2.8%). 4 The fact that biomass is still the most important energy source 99 Christian Wagner 4. See Stein Tonnesson and Ashild Kolas, \u2018Energy Security in Asia: China, India, Oil and Peace\u2019, Re- port to the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Oslo 2006, p. 39. ",
        "6 (214 Mtoe of a total of 573 Mtoe) illustrates that the vast majority of the population is still living in rural areas. 5 All forecasts predict that India\u2019s hunger for energy will increase as a result of a growing population and rapid industrialisation. At present India is the sixth-largest consumer of energy in the world and the third-largest consumer of oil and gas in Asia after Japan and China. In 2010 India will be the fourth-largest consumer of energy after the United States, China and Japan. India\u2019s energy dependency will increase with regard to all fossil fuels. India is already importing 70% of its oil supplies and this share will rise to 90% by 2030. The situation is only slightly better in the gas sector. India recently made some large discoveries of gas but all estimates indicate that India\u2019s import dependency on gas will be around 40% in 2030. Although India\u2019s coal reserves are among the biggest in the world, the gap between supply and demand will also make it neces- sary to import more coal in the years to come. India\u2019s import dependence is most obvious in the nuclear field. After its nuclear tests in 1974 and 1998, international sanctions have restricted India\u2019s nuclear programme so that the share of nuclear power today is only 2.8% of total energy production. India\u2019s energy scenario offers many opportunities to intensify cooperation with the EU and its Member States, at both the bilateral and the multilateral level. First, cooperation should address the tech- nological upgrading of India\u2019s energy sector, for example improving the quality of Indian coal. Second, since power generation is a com- petence of the Indian states, key states could be targeted to invest in the modernisation of their electricity sector. A third area of coopera- tion may include improving the efficiency of the energy sector. Many Indian states do not have, for instance, effective power tariff systems and power theft is widespread both among the affluent and poorer layers of society. A fourth priority is to enhance the use of renewable energies. Hydropower is still more important than nuclear energy and biomass is still the most important source of energy for the majority of the population. These areas offer huge opportunities for European companies and especially for small and medium-sized enterprises to intensify their cooperation with India. Besides the area of infrastructure, where India and the EU have already agreed on the India-EC Civil Aviation Project, the energy sector can thus become another area for Public Private Partnership (PPP) cooperation, in which European energy firms will find attractive investment oppor- tunities in the field of conventional and renewable energy. 100 The EU and India: a deepening partnership 5.

        "6 Internationally, India will also be one of the key countries to achieve the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. India\u2019s CO 2 emissions will rise sharply until 2030 although its level of CO 2 emissions in 2030 will still be less than 50% of European OECD countries. Indian governments have consistently emphasised that the per capita emissions of the developing world are only a small percentage of those of the developed countries. Increasing tech- nological cooperation with India will be an important task in order to reduce the emissions. In 2002 India signed the Kyoto Pro- tocol but it is exempted from the framework of the treaty. India is expected to gain from the transfer of technology envisaged under the Protocol. New international mechanisms against global warming and designed to foster CO 2 reduction, to be agreed in the negotiations on a post-Kyoto mechanism, can only be successful if emerging economies like India can be actively integrated. Against this background, the energy dialogue should also aim at India\u2019s membership of the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) in which the country only holds an observer status at the moment. Once again, cooperation with India will prove even more important given the country\u2019s role as representative of the developing world in many international institutions. Science and Technology, education, health, social standards India\u2019s membership in ITER (International Thermonuclear Exper- imental Reactor) and its participation in the GALILEO project do underline the importance of science and technology in EU-India relations. Every year about 250,000 engineers graduate from Indian universities. Even if not all graduates are qualified accord- ing to Western standards, India\u2019s human resources offer a huge source of intellectual capacity for European firms. The Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT) have achieved a global reputation and are indispensable for sustaining development and poverty reduction. India and the EU have already established a dialogue on information and communication technologies. The next step should be to broaden the dialogue to new key industries like nan- otechnology and biotechnology. In the context of technological cooperation, Europe must intensify its academic linkages with India. At present India\u2019s 101 Christian Wagner ",
        "6 educated youth is oriented towards the United States which for many years now has opened its labour market to attract Indian professionals. The Non-Resident Indian (NRI) community in the United States is now about 2.5 million people. Their average household income is about double the size of the average house- hold income in the US. Recent figures show that apart from the United Kingdom, European countries are not regarded as attrac- tive destinations for Indian students. Figures on student mobility show that 85% of Indian students prefer to go to the US or Aus- tralia for their studies. In Europe, the UK is the most attractive des- tination with 7% whereas Germany can only attract 2.5% and other European countries even less. It is therefore of the utmost impor- tance to strengthen academic exchanges that will help to establish new societal networks. Some steps have already been taken and national European sci- entific organisations have established offices in India. Bureau- cratic obstacles in Europe should be removed in order to make the EU a more attractive destination for Indian students. India, on the other hand, should ease its restrictive policy regarding research visas for EU scholars. Increasing respective visibility and enhancing mutual knowledge in both societies at large is yet another priority. The JAP and the EU Country Strategy Paper address the cultural and education dimension. It is envisaged to establish \u2018European Studies Centres\u2019 in India and \u2018Centres of Contemporary Indian Studies\u2019 in Europe. This should be seen as a first step, to be followed by more dialogue and exchange at the civil society level. The global fight against poverty will only be successful if coun- tries like India achieve sustainable results. The latest EU Country Strategy Paper allocates around 60% of available funds to meeting the MDGs, which signals the strong commitment of the EU to India overcoming the challenge of poverty. The latest report on the MDG showed that most South Asian countries including India are still lagging behind despite a number of achievements. India is either \u2018slow\u2019 or \u2018regressing\u2019 in 9 out of the 21 sub-goals of the MDG. 7 The top priorities will be education and health in order to overcome the deficits in both sectors, especially in the rural areas. Strengthening primary health and education are also indis- pensable preconditions to fight epidemics and HIV/AIDS. India lacks the capabilities to implement these policies, especially at the state level. India and the EU should target some states in order to concentrate their activities on them. 102 The EU and India: a deepening partnership 7.

        "6 India\u2019s organised sector encompasses not more than 9% of the country\u2019s working population whereas India\u2019s large informal sec- tor encompasses around 90% of its working population. The European welfare state has developed a variety of social security networks which are today recognised all over the world. India is only beginning to look for new approaches to achieve a form of inclusive social development in which the benefits of its rapid eco- nomic growth will be more equally distributed among the people. Given Europe\u2019s experience in these fields, a new dialogue mecha- nism should be established in which various approaches, social security systems and best practices can be discussed. Exchanges should not be limited to the state level but should be broadened to include the business community and the trade unions as well. Conclusion: deepening EU-India relations Relations between India and the EU have evolved in a positive direc- tion since the 1990s. India\u2019s liberalisation policy made an impor- tant contribution to open new avenues for cooperation with Europe and the rest of the world. In contrast to other emerging economies, moreover, India offers the biggest soft power capacities given its democratic traditions and its experience as a pluralist soci- ety. Both India and the EU share the commitment to common val- ues like democracy and human rights. The EU and India can thus be regarded as natural partners. At the global level, both India and the EU prefer multilateral institutions to unilateral actions in order to cope with global chal- lenges. The EU-India Joint Action Plan offers a roadmap for future bilateral relations. The main challenge will be to broaden the exist- ing economic collaboration to new areas. Establishing academic networks and increasing student exchanges will create new advo- cacy groups that will form the basis for deepening the bilateral relationship. The EU has a strong interest in engaging India as a viable global partner to cope with security challenges and shape a more just global order. For this reason, Europe and India should launch a dialogue on global governance in which foreign policy is not only guided by national interest but also by common values like democracy and human rights. 103 Christian Wagner ",

        "The EU and India: challenges to a strategic partnership Ummu Salma Bava The relationship between India and the EU dates back to the estab- lishment of diplomatic ties with the European Economic Commu- nity (EEC) in 1963. While the EU is one of the largest trade partners of India, however, it is only recently that a new, more political dimension was added to the relationship. In 2004, the Fifth India- EU Summit meeting at The Hague endorsed the proposal to upgrade the India-EU relationship to the level of a \u2018Strategic Part- nership\u2019 and a Joint Action Plan (JAP) was adopted at the Sixth India-EU Summit meeting held in New Delhi in 2005. An analysis of the JAP, however, fails to capture the shift of the geopolitical cen- tre of gravity to Asia and India\u2019s growing significance in world pol- itics. This chapter analyses EU-India relations in the context of the changing global strategic landscape and of India\u2019s strategic part- nership with the US, which has assumed critical importance. The changing global context and the EU\u2019s Asia strategy With the end of the Cold War, the familiar patterns and structures of the international order have given way to uncertainty, challenges and opportunities for all states. The EU\u2019s enhanced engagement with Asia was first highlighted through the Asia Strategy paper in 1994 called \u2018Towards a New Asia Strategy\u2019. This was an effort to take an integrated and balanced view of the relations between the EU and its Asian partners. The changing economic balance of power was the pre-eminent reason for the EU to focus its attention on Asia as a region and accord it a high priority, although it had bilateral relations with many Asian countries. 1 The strategy highlighted the EU\u2019s contribution to regional security dialogues and its role on issues such as arms control and non-proliferation, regional disputes and the security of sea-lanes, as well as matters relating to good governance and human rights. On the economic front, the EU expressed the desire to achieve 105 Partnerships for effective multilateralism EU relations with Brazil, China, India and Russia 1.

Politically, the strat- egy focussed on the Asia-Pacific region and in particular on China. It called for the protection of human rights and the spreading of democracy, good governance and the rule of law. India found men- tion in the context of poverty alleviation and transition to market economy. Arguably, in 1994, the EU did not consider India to be a strategically important regional player. The EU\u2019s engagement with China was and is primarily driven by the latter\u2019s thriving economic growth that has fuelled more European FDI and fostered trade flows. China\u2019s growing eco- nomic prowess and increased political assertiveness made it a crit- ical partner for the EU, despite it not being a democracy and its dis- mal track record on human rights. In other words, economic interests and not so much normative values were primordial in the development and upgrading of the EU\u2019s relations with China. India \u2013 an emerging power As Asia redefines its identity and security after the end of Cold War, India is redefining its position within Asia and at a global level, exploring the foreign policy options that have opened up in a changing world. The end of the Cold War and India\u2019s remarkable economic performance in the 1990s disclosed new perspectives for India\u2019s strategic ambitions. India\u2019s large population (surpassing the one billion mark), an expanding middle class (the size of the US population), a strong defence establishment under civilian control, its functional democ- racy and its leadership in the global ICT (Information and Commu- nication Technology) sector, along with strong economic growth, are shaping India as a rising political, economic and military power. India\u2019s economic growth has been achieved at a lower level of FDI as compared to China and, unlike the latter, it is not mainly export- driven but caters to a huge domestic market. Posting a 9% growth in the last few years and investing in defence modernisation, India is embracing a growing \u2018hard power\u2019 projection along with the normative values it has always endorsed since its independence in 1947. India is ringed by conflict at its periphery and thus the major imperative of Indian foreign and security policy has been to preserve its strategic autonomy. 2 106 The EU and India: challenges to a strategic partnership 2.

        "7 The India-EU strategic partnership Clearly, the EU now places new value on its relationship with India, but this has come only after India\u2019s economic growth captured global attention and especially after the nuclear tests of 1998, which signalled India\u2019s growing aspirations. Until 2002, the EU Country Strategy Paper on India was emphasising development and economic co-operation as the focal points of engagement with India. Thus, India\u2019s potential and growing political profile had still not registered with Brussels, which continued to view India within a development paradigm as an aid recipient country. However, with the advent of the 2003 EU Security Strategy, a major shift could be detected in the way in which the EU was defining its relations with the world in general and in particular with India. The Security Strategy identified six countries, including India, for a strategic partnership, given their importance in contemporary international politics and their future role as well. From 2004 onwards, the India-EU strategic partnership has evolved with the adoption of the landmark Joint Action Plan, which can be seen as the definitive blueprint detailing the areas of cooperation. In what follows, scope for cooperation is examined under three broad headings, namely: Political Dialogue and Cooperation; Economic Cooperation, Trade and the Environ- ment; and Social and Civil Society Cooperation. Political Dialogue and Cooperation The steady institutionalisation of India-EU relations, with peri- odic summit-level talks, offers a yearly platform to review progress and set new goals and targets. However, the interaction between a post-modern Europe of 27 members and a modern India \u2013 an indi- vidual country \u2013 brings into stark relief the difference in their polit- ical organisation. While the EU collectively represents the interests of 27 member countries and is a very effective economic actor, India represents its own national interests. While both India and the EU endorse a multilateral world order, building \u2018effective multilateral- ism\u2019 requires greater accommodation of interests and coordina- tion of policies, and endorsing the changing power configurations. Many EU Member States are supportive of India\u2019s position on the UNSC reform, but there is no common EU position. Making the UNSC more representative of the current geopolitical balance 107 Ummu Salma Bava ",
        "7 is critical to building effective global multilateralism and institu- tions of global governance. The EU endorsement of India for a UNSC seat would pave the way for the future evolution of multilat- eralism. While India has long participated in UN-led peace keeping activities, there is scope for greater synergy between India and the EU in joint action in conflict areas. The pooling of ideas, resources and strategy between India and the EU would provide a very effec- tive conflict management toolkit to the international community. On matters of non-proliferation and WMD, the EU needs to recognise that India has been a responsible nuclear actor. The EU does not have a common position on the Indian nuclear dossier, whereas EU Member States like Britain and France, which have nuclear weapons, have endorsed India\u2019s decision, and are support- ive of the exemption within the Nuclear Suppliers Group. The lack of a cohesive EU approach is compounded by the fact that it is individual states, and not the EU, which are signatories to the NPT regime and in the position to acknowledge the need for a differen- tiated approach. In a major political shift, on the contrary, the US has recog- nised the valid claims of India\u2019s national interest and has acted to enhance and strengthen India\u2019s military, economic, and techno- logical capabilities, while endorsing common values. R. Nicholas Burns, the US Under Secretary for Political Affairs, recently wrote about the India-US strategic partnership as follows: \u2018The rise of a democratic and increasingly powerful India is a positive develop- ment for US interests. Rarely has the United States shared so many interests and values with a growing power as we do today with India. By reaching out to India, we have made the bet that the future lies in pluralism, democracy, and market economics\u2019. 3 Clearly, when it comes to security matters, the US is the critical norm setter and, as such, it has taken the initiative to benefit India through a civilian nuclear energy cooperation framework. While the US is willing to rewrite the rules and accommodate India, the EU appears to take a more status\u2013quoist approach. In the wake of the India-US civil nuclear cooperation, the EU endorsed India\u2019s participation in the ITER project. Significantly, Member States like France are eager to have a nuclear arrangement with India along the lines of the India-US civilian nuclear energy coopera- tion, because of the huge commercial benefits involved. Although the EU has stated that it is also considering civilian nuclear ties with India, it has not taken a firm decision and is awaiting the out- 108 The EU and India: challenges to a strategic partnership 3.

        "7 come of Delhi\u2019s negotiations with the IAEA and the NSG. Consid- ering that all the EU 27 Member States are members of the NSG, the EU can take the lead in endorsing India\u2019s position. The EU will have to go beyond a \u2018soft power\u2019 approach to engage Indian security concerns given that the sub-continent is troubled by many conflicts. The Europeans are enjoying a security dividend due to the transatlantic partnership. India provides for its own security, as there is no security provider or guarantor in the region. Simultaneously, India will have to actively engage the EU Member States not only to highlight its track record as a non-pro- liferator but also to demonstrate that its intentions are verifiable, as the recent Indian votes against Iran in the IAEA prove. Although some of India\u2019s strategic interests converge with those of the EU, both have varied global aspirations. While India is the only non-western democracy in South Asia and normatively the closest to western democratic values, its actual democratic practice did not gain the recognition of the West for a long time. In the past, the EU also showed a tendency to lecture India on its human rights record. However, the EU\u2019s proactive engagement of China, although the latter is not a democracy, reinforces the sense that, despite the emphasis on normative values, the EU is also driven by realist considerations based on trade. India does not support democracy promotion in the manner currently endorsed by the government in Washington, a point that also divided the EU on American action in Iraq. Therefore, moving on from a prescriptive approach to action mode, India and the EU could collaborate on offering economic and political assis- tance through institutional support and training to countries in transition and reconstruction such as Afghanistan. In this context, the India-EU Security Dialogue since 2006 is a step forward in strengthening cooperation, provided that it goes beyond just being a platform for sharing views. For example, joint mechanisms could be developed and applied to conflicts in differ- ent regions such as Africa, where India and the EU are already par- ticipating in peacekeeping activities. Turning to India\u2019s long- standing concerns on terrorism, the EU was traditionally not seen as being supportive of India\u2019s security concerns. However, the cre- ation of an EU Counter-Terrorism Co-ordinator in the wake of the Madrid bombings signals the earnestness of the EU effort and opens up opportunities for both sharing information and enhancing cooperation. 109 Ummu Salma Bava ",
        "7 Economic cooperation, trade and the environment A major challenge lies in translating government exchanges and agreements into a substantial partnership, enhancing trade and investment flows. After China, India leads the restructuring of global economic relations. The EU, which is India\u2019s biggest trade partner, is seeking to expand the bilateral trade volumes. India has become a major hub for the IT and service sector, thereby trans- forming the image of India itself. The country offers a very attrac- tive investment market for different sectors, given its viable legal structures and trained workforce. India, however, suffers from excessive bureaucratic rigidity, and more needs to be done to exploit its full business potential. When it comes to trade, the case could be made for applying the principle of reciprocity between the EU and India. Despite its eco- nomic growth and potential, however, the fact cannot be over- looked that India faces numerous domestic development chal- lenges and reciprocity could have detrimental effects on its agricultural sector. Although India has brought down its tariffs, it has increasingly had to contend with non-tariff barriers such as sanitary and phytosanitary conditions and extensive procedures for securing export certification to the EU. The EU asserts that India\u2019s high tariff barriers are not transparent enough and thus not conducive to creating a trade-enabling structure. A major challenge on both sides is to expand the traditional trade items to include sectors such as services, bio and nano-technology and genomics, where collaboration would deliver greater benefits to both. Synergies could be enhanced between India\u2019s large scientific base and the EU supporting joint R&D projects. On the recommendations of a High-Level Trade Group to the Summit in Helsinki 2006, a trade and investment agreement was envisaged. The first steps towards an India-EU Free Trade Agree- ment have been initiated and independent studies on both sides have concluded that major benefits will accrue to both parties. However, the successful conclusion of the Doha Development Round wherein the EU and the US accommodate the concerns of developing countries will be critical to all trade agreements. While India emerges as a global service producer, it also offers a huge market for a varied range of good and services. India is notably undertaking defence modernisation and has diversified its weapons purchasing, which opens up opportunities for further 110 The EU and India: challenges to a strategic partnership ",
        "7 cooperation between India and the EU. In this context, the Euro- pean Aeronautical Defence and Space Company (EADS) is pursu- ing joint ventures with India and other defence manufacturers from the UK, France and Sweden are competing to secure major defence contracts. The fields of energy, climate change and the environment pro- vide another area of far-reaching cooperation. The EU and India are major energy importers and therefore securing safe, affordable and sustainable energy supplies is crucial to both. Developing a civil nuclear partnership with India along the lines of the India-US relationship will create greater mutuality of interest. However, this is likely to take the shape of bilateral agreements, as only a few EU countries possess the relevant technology. On the issue of climate change, while the EU and India have common interests and endorse global protocols, the challenges they confront are different. The President of the European Com- mission, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, said in November 2007: \u2018Climate change is the greatest challenge of our generation\u2019. India faces a difficult task in adopting the required standards, given that its main priority is providing development and growth for its expanding population. Assistance by EU Member States in filling the technology gap that India faces can lead to a joint effort to address environmental and development concerns. However, financing the required technological investment will be the biggest challenge, as this very much involves the private sector. Social issues and civil society cooperation The scope for cooperation on social issues is immense since India is at the crossroads of the developed and developing world. As India fosters its economic growth, it is also faced with meeting the Millennium Development Goals. In this context, the EU has com- mitted to increase development cooperation to supplement Indian programmes, namely the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) or universal education programme and the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM). The EU, however, has a low profile in India. It is perceived largely as a trading bloc and not as a significant political actor. There is a need to increase mutual visibility and to build up civil society networks through enhanced education and academic 111 Ummu Salma Bava ",
        "7 cooperation as well. Part of the problem lies in the strong empha- sis on bilateral relations between India and many of the EU Mem- ber States. There should be a collective approach in showcasing the EU in India. At the civil society level, the EU presence can be enhanced by greater participation and outreach among academia, think tanks and the media. The number of scholarships afforded to Indian students should be increased so as to lead to a greater synergy of talent between India and the EU. Despite its strong external image as a civilian and normative power, the EU has been unable to attract Indian scientific talent. The US takes a more flexible approach to allocating visas and this has enabled a large number of Indian students and hi-tech work- ers to go to the US. The Indian diaspora is one of the most affluent groups in the US and this has also facilitated a greater diffusion and absorption of American values back in India. The US has been successful in projecting itself through its soft power and in pre- senting the \u2018American dream\u2019 as an achievable target. Despite 9/11, the US has continued to absorb a large number of immi- grants and this has contributed to social mobility \u2013 a vital factor in enriching the American economy with the infusion of ideas and a highly skilled workforce. By comparison, troubled by internal dissensions, the EU strug- gles to integrate its immigrant communities and lacks a collective image to project abroad. Demographic decline is leading to an age- ing society that is also lagging behind in R&D. India\u2019s long-stand- ing experience of social integration, given its cultural diversity as a pluralistic democracy, may offer a good example of integration to Europe. Although the Indian constitution establishes a secular state, it guarantees not only religious freedom but also the cul- tural identity of all citizens. Conclusion: blending norms with realism Europe the \u2018norm entrepreneur\u2019 is a satiated power, whereas India is trying to become a norm setter, seeking to change the status quo in matters of global governance. Undoubtedly, the US remains the main superpower as far as economics, technology, politics and most importantly, military might is concerned. When the US upgrades its relations with India, it gives a global signal that is difficult to overlook. 112 The EU and India: challenges to a strategic partnership ",
        "7 The US and the EU engage a rising Asia in different ways, which underscores who shapes what aspect of global politics. The US has discovered the power potential of India, critical to the Asian strate- gic calculus, and has sought to overcome the Cold War legacy of mutual estrangement. If, however, the real intention of the US is to counterbalance the rise of China via a strategy of democratic encir- clement, it should be stressed that India does not see itself as a counterweight to China. India\u2019s foreign policy does not contem- plate becoming part of a military alliance. In this context, India- EU relations assume more importance. The EU seeks to create a multipolar world in which it identifies India and China as the emerging Asian power centres, and seeks to engage India because of its economic growth. However, there is a deficit in the India-EU relationship because the EU is not a strategic security actor and its ability to bring security deliverables to the partnership is extremely limited. What is critical to the discussion on strategic partnerships and norm diffusion is to ask what templates emerging powers use to model their behaviour. India is an emerging power with a strong national consciousness and an identity rooted in territoriality and sovereignty. It aims to enhance its soft power with hard power, thereby borrowing certain aspects of the US approach. In contrast, the EU, as a post-modern actor, seeks to construct a new collective identity based on soft power. The progress of EU integration has raised expectations regard- ing the Union\u2019s performance and visibility globally. However, Europe\u2019s lack of political cohesion and military prowess has diluted its political effectiveness. At global level, the EU is the most successful example of regional integration and durable peace between countries and yet \u2018the idea of Europe\u2019 resonates differ- ently in different regions of the world. The biggest challenge in assessing the EU as a global economic, political and security actor lies in the fact that it is constantly evolving. India and the EU should enter a strategic dialogue that goes beyond the articulation of normative principles and leads to con- crete action. Translating the potential for cooperation into reality will require strategic vision and political sagacity. In this context, the EU will need to respect India\u2019s strategic autonomy and its free- dom to set its security priorities: India cannot surrender its strate- gic interests. In effect, the challenge for the India-EU strategic partnership is to balance norms and realism. 113 Ummu Salma Bava ",

        "The EU and Russia: a contested partnership Sabine Fischer Introduction The label \u2018strategic partnership\u2019 has been used extensively in EU- Russia relations since the second half of the 1990s. However, the viability of a strategic partnership between the European Union and Russia is being questioned nowadays by policymakers and observers on both sides. Disagreements over domestic develop- ments in Russia, human rights and democracy, the so-called com- mon neighbourhood, and numerous global questions currently paralyse EU-Russia relations. These issues will play a role during the negotiations on the new agreement between the EU and Russia, scheduled to be launched at the next EU-Russia summit in Khanty-Mansiisk by the end of June 2008. For almost two years, political relations between the EU and Russia have been in a deadlock after the former Polish government issued a veto against the opening of negotiations in autumn 2006. EU-Russia summits during the Finnish, German and Portuguese Presidencies took place without tangible results, and the most pressing issues in bilateral relations remained untouched. Now both sides face the challenging task of agreeing on a treaty which corresponds to the complex reality of their relationship. The EU and Russia have developed strong economic and polit- ical ties since 1991. The EU very quickly became Russia\u2019s most important trading partner and the biggest source of external aid and technical support. While the EU\u2019s share of Russia\u2019s foreign trade exceeds 50%, EU trade with Russia has almost doubled between 2000 and 2006, making up for about 6% of EU exports and 10% of EU imports. 1 Over 60% of Russian exports to the EU consist of energy and raw materials. Although trade in manufac- tured goods and services has shown a constant increase in recent years, its significance in the overall trade balance remains mar- ginal, thus ultimately ascribing to Russia the role of an energy sup- plier \u2013 albeit the most important energy supplier to the EU. 115 Partnerships for effective multilateralism EU relations with Brazil, China, India and Russia 1.

        "8 Growing interdependence between Russia and the EU has been accompanied by extensive political dialogue. The legal foundation of the relationship is formed by a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (1997), which came into force in 1997 and expired by the end of November 2007. 2 However, the PCA will be extended every year for one year, unless one of the sides rescinds its partici- pation in the agreement six months in advance. In 2005, the PCA was flanked by the concept of Four Common Spaces (Common Economic Space, Common Space of Freedom, Security and Jus- tice; Common Space of External Security; Common Space of Research, Education and Culture). Roadmaps outlining measures for the accomplishment of these spaces were signed in May 2005. 3 Russia is the only third country with which the EU holds two sum- mits per year. In between the summits, communication continues in the framework of numerous dialogues (on energy, intellectual property rights, public procurement, industrial products, enter- prise and industrial policy, human rights etc.). Each dialogue encompasses a number of working groups dealing with detailed questions and involving officials, diplomats and experts from both sides. In recent years, the EU\u2019s assistance to political and economic reforms in Russia has decreased, since Russia experienced an unprecedented growth in its financial reserves thanks to capital inflows from energy trade and growing foreign direct investment. Therefore, Russia has become independent of external donors, ranging from the EU\u2019s TACIS programmes to national pro- grammes of technical assistance and to IMF and World Bank loans. Today\u2019s political elite in Russia rejects external assistance linked to democratic conditionality. As conditionality has been a core element of the EU\u2019s external assistance programmes for East- ern Europe for the last 15 years, the EU\u2019s approach is greeted with growing scepticism in Russia. EU-Russia relations are not limited to the bilateral level. EU Member States and Russia meet in multilateral fora, like the UN, the OSCE and the Council of Europe. As will be discussed below, the approaches of the EU and Russia to multilateralism in these fora tend to vary significantly, which has a negative impact on their capacity to act. This is especially the case with the OSCE, which is hampered regularly by disputes between Russia and \u2018the West\u2019 (meaning EU Member States, non-EU states, and the US) over the structure and scope of activities of the organisation.

This short overview demonstrates the complexity of Russia-EU relations today. Their development has also been shaped by domes- tic changes in the EU and Russia. The EU has undergone profound changes internally (through enlargement) and as an actor in the common neighbourhood with Russia. The accession of the Central European and the Baltic states to the EU has brought new actors to the negotiating tables in Brussels, who have very specific views on Russia. Three years after enlargement the EU is deeply divided and faces great difficulties in finding common positions on any issue regarding relations with Russia. Member States\u2019 preferences swing between pragmatic engagement and containing Russia\u2019s influence in the EU and its eastern neighbourhood. Russia has changed its approach to the outside world in gen- eral, and to the EU in particular. Its renewed self-perception as a global player translates into a much more assertive stance on many questions which used to be consensual or secondary throughout the 1990s, and which were subordinated to the pri- macy of good relations with the West. The early Putin administra- tion seemed to continue this pro-Western policy (or rather: returned to it after the discord over NATO\u2019s war in Kosovo in 1999), focusing especially on close relations with the EU as Rus- sia\u2019s most important trading and modernisation partner. At the same time (about 2000-2003/2004) the EU acquired a stronger profile as a political actor, thus increasing its influence in the \u2018common neighbourhood\u2019. This development culminated when Brussels and Moscow found themselves clearly on opposite sides of the political fence during the Orange Revolution in Ukraine. While Russia had openly supported Yanukovich\u2019s candidacy in the presidential elections and tried to influence domestic events in Kyiv in this direction, the EU lent full political support to the opposition movement and its demand that new elections be held. Since then, Moscow\u2019s initially positive attitude towards the EU as a partner for trade and modernisation has been overshadowed by growing suspicion regarding the EU\u2019s role in what Russia still per- ceives as its \u2018natural\u2019 zone of influence. The EU and Russia apply very different understandings of the term \u2018strategic partnership\u2019. From a Russian point of view, 117 Sabine Fischer ",
        "8 strategic partners cooperate on the international level where their interests converge. Such an understanding excludes involvement in domestic affairs and lacks strong reference to common values, which are crucial for the EU\u2019s approach. Russia has also changed its attitude towards the EU as a potential partner. Today, Russian elites do not only draw attention to different understandings of strategic partnership. They also question the purpose of a strate- gic partnership with a counterpart which is perceived as as weak as the EU. Moscow openly returned to bilateralism in its relations with EU Member States recently, putting much less focus on deep- ening relations with the EU as a whole. Relations between Russia and the EU have a long history and stretch across many policy fields. Over the last couple of years, they have come under increasing strain. The delineation of possibilities for partnership, therefore, needs to be based on a careful analysis of current problems and obstacles to the further deepening of cooperation. It remains questionable whether the EU and Russia are currently able to build up a \u2018strategic partnership\u2019. However, there is space for pragmatic cooperation on concrete issues, which should be used to pave the way for a broader common under- standing of major political challenges. The global dimension: security and multilateralism The United Nations The UN Security Council (UNSC) is by far the most important among the few institutions in which Russia, EU members and the US meet each other on an equal footing. Permanent membership in the UNSC is a cornerstone of Russia\u2019s foreign policy. For the EU, the UN provides an opportunity to get involved in multilateral dia- logue and decision-making with Russia. Security questions of global and regional importance, such as Iran\u2019s nuclear programme or Kosovo independence, as well as peacekeeping operations, are discussed in the UNSC, thus offering the opportunity to search for convergence and common positions. After a period of constructive cooperation between Russia and the West in the UNSC, severe disagreements over NATO\u2019s war in Yugoslavia in 1999 led to a shift in Russia\u2019s attitude towards mul- tilateralism in the UN. The UN was increasingly perceived as an 118 The EU and Russia: a contested partnership ",
        "8 instrument of US foreign policy. Moscow started to use its veto power and to block mainly US/Western initiatives, which it per- ceived as detrimental to its own interests. Russia has remained rather inactive in the debates about UN reform in recent years. It has shown cautious support for Ger- many\u2019s claim for permanent membership of the UNSC without, however, taking sides openly. It remains to be seen how the current Russian leadership will treat the same claim, now put forward by Chancellor Angela Merkel. Russia seems to be more inclined to use its position on the UNSC enlargement issue as an asset in negotia- tions on other topics than to come up with a clear position on UN and UNSC reforms. This demonstrates that Russia has not yet moved from negative to positive power in the UN framework. On the other hand, there have been signs of growing Russian interest in a stronger involvement in UN activities. In its \u2018Review of the Russian Federation\u2019s Foreign Policy\u2019, published in March 2007, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is critical of the fact that Russia ranks only 40 th among the contributors to UN peace- keeping missions, and demands that its share be raised in accor- dance with its international position. 4 Furthermore, the Review suggests that Russia should become more involved in the UN\u2019s humanitarian activities. Instead of its selective engagement it should not only develop a more systematic approach with respect to peacekeeping and humanitarian operations on the ground, but also enhance its involvement in the global donors\u2019 commu- nity. However, constellations in the UN Security Council seem to offer little scope for multilateral cooperation, since Russia\u2019s approach is focused mainly on strengthening its national inter- ests and position as a global player. It is also unlikely that Russia will take a clear position on the enlargement and reform of the UNSC in the near future. Both issues clearly demonstrate that Moscow\u2019s preparedness to become involved in (and indeed its commitment to) multilateral decision-making is rather limited. On their part, the EU and the European members of the UNSC should highlight common positions (which regularly occur on a variety of topics, like Iran, North Korea and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict) and in so doing keep Russia involved in multilateral debates in the framework of the UN. A concrete step in this direc- tion could be regular preliminary consultations between the EU\u2019s and the Russian delegations to the UN. 119 Sabine Fischer 4.

        "8 The EU/EU members should take up Russia\u2019s verbal commit- ments concerning its involvement in UN peacekeeping activities and humanitarian aid. Since Russia is slowly stepping up its engagement in development aid, this could become another field of intensified interaction and cooperation. However, the EU will have to face the fact that the Russian approach is diverging signif- icantly from its own in many aspects. Moscow is campaigning for the recognition of organisations like the CIS, the Organisation of the Collective Security Treaty or the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation as regional peacekeeping bodies by the UN \u2013 which would certainly create controversies among EU members. Russian technical support for developing countries is not tied to political conditionality, while the EU claims that good governance and democracy are cornerstones of its concept of development aid. Thus, attempts to coordinate activities in these fields have to be accompanied by an open dialogue about underlying principles as well as goals. Arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation Russia has managed to strengthen its position in the international arms market in recent years. With the conclusion of comprehensive packages with Algeria and Venezuela in 2006, Russian arms trade has also expanded geographically, going beyond China and India as the main importers of Russian military industrial products (while Russia delivers weapons to 82 countries, China and India account for 70% of Russia\u2019s overall arms exports). The Russian defence budget has also steadily increased over the last few years, without, however, exceeding 2.8% of GDP. Some Russian observers claim that Russia should follow a \u2018national strategy\u2019 on arma- ments, which is less oriented towards external cooperation. 5 They argue that economic growth in Russia has enabled the state to invest more in the defence sector, and increased the internal demand for Russian products. Western reservations about deep- ening cooperation with Russian enterprises (for example in the framework of EADS) have provoked Russian criticism and strengthened the argument for a \u2018national strategy\u2019. At the same time, multilateral arms control and non-prolifera- tion regimes are in deep crisis. Already existing tensions between the US and Russia have culminated in fierce debates about Ameri- can plans to deploy parts of a global Ballistic Missile Defence 120 The EU and Russia: a contested partnership 5. Konstantin Makienko, \u2018The Russian Aviation Industry: From European Option to National Strategy\u2019, Moscow Defense Brief , no. 2, August 2007. ",
        "8 System in Poland and the Czech Republic. Moscow did not show strong resistance against the US withdrawal from the Anti-Ballis- tic Missile (ABM) Treaty in 2002. Five years later, however, Russia- US relations have deteriorated and Russia, in accordance with its new self-perception as a global player, shows increasing readiness to confront Washington. High-ranking members of the Russian military even called for Russia\u2019s withdrawal from the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) and officials in Moscow announced that Russian nuclear weapons might be retargeted at Europe, should the US, Poland and the Czech Republic imple- ment their plans. Ultimately, the Russian reaction was twofold: in July 2007, Moscow announced its withdrawal from the Treaty on Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE), and suggested to Washing- ton the joint use of the Russian Gabala radar station in Azerbaijan as a substitute for deployments in Poland and the Czech Republic. The American reaction to this suggestion has been cautious, emphasising that joint use of the infrastructure in Gabala would not be excluded, but could only serve as an addition to the deploy- ments in Poland and the Czech Republic. As a party to the negotiations on the Iranian (and North Korean) nuclear programmes Russia has often pursued ambiva- lent polices. Moscow has sided with the West in its desire to pre- vent Teheran from acquiring nuclear weapons, while at the same time trying to avoid strict economic sanctions in order to protect arms trade with Iran and the Russian-Iranian contract on the con- struction of the nuclear power plant in Bushehr. However, Russ- ian-Iranian relations have become uneasy in recent years, since Teheran has constantly violated obligations imposed by the UN and the IAEA. As a result, Moscow took a tougher stance, eventu- ally supporting a UN resolution on sanctions against Iran in December 2006 and cutting off deliveries to Bushehr at the begin- ning of 2007. Furthermore, Russia put forward the suggestion to create an international consortium for the enrichment of ura- nium on Russian soil, which would provide Iran with the possibil- ity for civilian use of nuclear power, but prevent it from running a military nuclear programme. The EU\u2019s room for manoeuvre in addressing the crisis of multi- lateral arms control and non-proliferation regimes is very limited, since further developments largely depend on the attitudes of the US and Russia. The EU lacks a common position regarding Amer- ican ABM plans, as well as Russian reactions to it. The only sphere 121 Sabine Fischer ",
        "8 where Russia and the EU currently share interests is the preven- tion of an Iranian nuclear programme. Therefore the EU should consider the Russian suggestion on the international consortium for uranium enrichment and try to convince all parties concerned to enter into serious negotiations about it. The same holds true for Russia\u2019s offer regarding the radar station in Gabala. There is little hope that either Russia or the US will accept the other side\u2019s con- ditions as they have been formulated during the first half of 2007 \u2013 but negotiations would keep multilateral processes going and increase the chance that compromise solutions can be found. By all means the EU should emphasise the importance of multilateral arms control and non-proliferation vis-\u00e0-vis both Russia and the US. Regional security and peacekeeping Regional tensions between Russia and the EU have been on the rise in recent years. While the EU has increased in stature, Russia is try- ing to re-establish tighter economic and political control over the region of the former USSR. Thus, the \u2018common neighbourhood\u2019 has become the subject of a competition for influence between Russia and the EU. Again, underlying principles and strategies as well as goals differ. At the same time, Russia and the EU face a num- ber of common security threats, which emanate from political and economic instabilities in the \u2018common neighbourhood\u2019. In principle, both Russia and the EU share similar interests regarding the stabilisation of their neighbourhood. This manifests itself in cooperation that functions relatively well in areas like drugs trafficking and organised crime. This cooperation takes place in the framework of the Roadmaps for the Four Common Spaces, namely the Roadmap to the Common Space on Freedom, Security and Justice. However, in other crucial areas Russia and the EU follow very different agendas. While the EU claims that its pol- icy is oriented towards a long-term stabilisation of the region through socio-economic development and multilateral regional cooperation, Russia\u2019s policy is based on a zero-sum perception of regional relations, which undermines the prospect of cooperation. Moscow, for its part, accuses the EU of pursuing an economic zero- sum approach, forcing Ukraine and other states of the common neighbourhood to make a choice between Brussels and Moscow. 122 The EU and Russia: a contested partnership ",
        "8 Unresolved conflicts The resolution of the unresolved conflicts in Moldova, Georgia and Azerbaijan is possibly the single most urgent issue in regional relations in the former Soviet Union, and could provide a key to the solution of many other problems. Russia\u2019s policy has been oriented towards maintaining the status quo situation, because it provides Moscow with strong political, economic and military leverage over the states affected by the conflicts. At the same time, Moscow does not dispose of a forward-looking vision of how to treat the break- away regions, which increases its reluctance regarding any changes to the status quo . The EU has a vital interest in the resolution of the conflicts, because they are a major impediment to regional development and stability. However, Member States are split over the issue, which weakens the position of the EU in the region. Brussels has tried to gain a higher profile by appointing two EU Special Repre- sentatives for, respectively, the South Caucasus and Moldova, and has deployed the EUBAM mission on the Ukrainian-Moldovan border as well as a small rule-of-law mission, EUJUST Themis , and a border support team under the guidance of the EUSR in Geor- gia. However, these measures have remained isolated. Mostly, they were not the expression of the EU\u2019s forward-looking approach, but the result of pressure coming from regional actors. The EU should insist more firmly on a bigger role in conflict resolution, not only in Transnistria, but also in the other conflicts. The fact that Moscow, after initial reluctance, has ultimately accepted EUBAM, should encourage the EU to engage more deeply on different levels, including confidence building, border monitoring and mediation. The greatest potential for cooperation regarding the unre- solved conflicts probably lies in Russia-EU peacekeeping activi- ties. Since its creation, Russia has displayed interest in closer secu- rity cooperation with the EU in the framework of ESDP. Here, the EU could offer Moscow cooperation. Kosovo independence has an impact on the conflicts in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), especially in Abkhazia. The deterioration of the already strained relations between Georgia and Abkhazia could lead to the destabilisation of Northern Caucasus, which is not in the EU\u2019s interest and even less so in Russia\u2019s. The EU should, there- fore, take more decisive steps to prevent such a crisis. Cooperation in the unresolved conflicts, possibly even leading to joint peace- 123 Sabine Fischer ",
        "8 keeping sometime in the future, would be a big step forward in the development of the Common Space on External Security. From an EU perspective such missions must of course be linked with peace agreements. One of the main stumbling blocks in the way of all this remains the discrepancy between both sides\u2019 approaches to the build-up and command structures of joint peacekeeping forces. Russia demands cooperation \u2018on an equal footing\u2019, i.e. its equal participa- tion in the command of joint ESDP and Russian forces. The EU, on the other hand, insists on decision-making autonomy, which precludes equal participation of the Russian side. To kick off the process, both sides should be prepared to enter an open dialogue about these opposing positions. Regional cooperation During Vladimir Putin\u2019s first term in office, Russia stepped up its efforts to foster integration in the former Soviet Union through the creation of a number of new regional organisations in the realms of economic, political and security cooperation. All of them were characterised by strong Russian domination, which diminished the commitment of some of the partner states, like Ukraine, from the very beginning. Nevertheless, Russian cooperation initiatives were interpreted as an attempt to develop a soft-power approach in the region. The colour revolutions brought a radical change in Rus- sia\u2019s attitude. After the Orange Revolution in Ukraine in December 2004, Moscow reverted to a more assertive posture in its relations with the other former Soviet republics, using a mixture of eco- nomic and political pressure to prevent them from moving closer towards the EU, and also to NATO. At the same time, Moscow is binding more tightly into its regional cooperation initiatives those countries which are more interested in or dependent on closer rela- tions with Russia, namely Belarus, Armenia, and some of the Cen- tral Asian states. The EU, for its part, is divided over which priorities it should set in its policy towards the \u2018common neighbourhood\u2019. The divide runs between those Member States who claim that at least Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia should enjoy active support for their efforts to move closer to the EU (including a membership perspective for Ukraine), and those who favour a Russia-first approach and try to avoid taking political steps which could alienate Russia. 124 The EU and Russia: a contested partnership ",
        "8 The EU\u2019s main interest in the Eastern neighbourhood and rela- tions with Russia consists in increasing regional stability. Regard- ing regional cooperation, Brussels should stick to the principles of the European Neighbourhood Policy and strengthen its regional dimension. The Black Sea Synergy, although still in its early stages, could be a step in the right direction. 6 However, the regional and sub-regional organisations created by the region\u2019s states (including Russia) should not be ignored altogether. The Central Asian Strategy published during the German presidency in the first half of 2007 emphasises that \u2018the EU is prepared to enter into an open and constructive dialogue with regional organ- isations in Central Asia and establish regular ad hoc contacts, inter alia with EURASEC, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), CICA, CSTO, CAREC and CARICC.\u2019 7 The Black Sea Syn- ergy mentions only BSEC and the Black Sea Forum initiated by Romania as organisations with which the EU would be interested in entering into a dialogue. It could be an important symbolic step forward to make similar offers to organisations like the Single Economic Space, GUAM or the Collective Security Treaty Organi- sation and to reflect on possibilities of cooperation with them. An invitation to Moscow to engage in closer cooperation on this level could invalidate Russian accusations that the EU itself pursues a zero-sum approach in economic relations with its Eastern neigh- bours. Energy and the environment Energy relations between Russia and the EU have a bilateral as well as regional dimension. Energy trade has existed since the 1970s. Conditions, however, have changed significantly since then. After the breakdown of the Soviet Union, the former Soviet Republics including Russia remained entangled in a complex network of energy interdependence. Russia holds a monopoly of pipeline routes for Central Asian gas to Western Europe. The Western for- mer Soviet Republics are almost 100% dependent on Russian energy deliveries. On the other hand, they control the transport routes for Russian exports to the EU, while Russia is becoming increasingly dependent on Central Asian gas to supply its own domestic market. 125 Sabine Fischer 6.

        "8 The pipeline system and the production facilities as they stand today are inherited from the Soviet era. Therefore, heavy invest- ment and the diversification of the internal market (by increasing the number of independent companies) are necessary precondi- tions for an increase of production, but are precluded by sub- sidised energy prices and state control. Energy inefficiency is another pressing problem, which is closely intertwined with low prices and upward pressures in energy consumption both in domestic households and industry. In other words, short of urgent intervention, Russia will face serious problems in supply- ing its domestic market as well as guaranteeing export commit- ments in the medium term. As indicated below, the Russian Energy Strategy until 2020 envisages plans to meet these chal- lenges. Among other measures, the increased use of fossil energy sources other than gas is envisaged. It remains questionable, how- ever, whether such steps can ensure the sustainability of both domestic supply and exports. Considering the political implica- tions of a sharp increase in domestic prices, the urgent reforms that need to be undertaken in the gas sector are not very likely under the current domestic conditions. The EU\u2019s dependency especially on gas imports from Russia has been on the rise ever since the beginning of the 1990s. At the same time, both sides have found themselves increasingly at odds regarding the conditions of energy trade. The EU expects the liber- alisation of the Russian energy (essentially gas) market so that EU companies can enter it. Moscow\u2019s refusal to ratify the transport protocol to the European Energy Charter in order to protect its transport monopoly over energy deliveries has been a major point of contention for over 10 years now. The Russian side has pro- duced a number of arguments against the ratification of the Char- ter and the transport protocol, which have not met much consid- eration on the European side. Russia also responds to the EU\u2019s accusations by pointing out that the EU tries to limit the activities of Russian companies in its own markets, thus denying equal con- ditions for all sides. Throughout the last few years, and against the background of growing political tensions, Russia has used energy dependency time and again as an instrument to put political pressure on Russ- ian neighbours pursuing domestic and foreign policy goals dis- liked in Moscow. This is not to say that the Russian state exerts complete control over the energy sector and can use it deliberately 126 The EU and Russia: a contested partnership ",
        "8 as a tool when needed. However, where interests overlap, political will and economic tools merge into an unholy alliance, as can be observed in relations between Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Geor- gia. This alliance is enforced through the existence of informal networks of rent seekers on all sides, who benefit from the opaque and uncompetitive conditions of energy trade. The repeated rows between Gazprom and Ukraine since the Ukrainian Parliamentar- ian elections in September 2007 over gas prices and the role of intermediators in the Russian-Ukrainian gas trade illustrate the negative impact of these networks as well as their resilience. In energy matters, the EU and Russia are interdependent. The EU will not be able to quickly diversify its gas imports (which would also mean switching to potentially less stable trade part- ners). On the other hand, the fast diversification of exports to other world regions requires huge investments, which Russia will not be able to make in the foreseeable future. Thus, while the first steps to increase energy trade with China and other importers are being taken, Russia cannot abandon the EU as its main energy cus- tumer any time soon. Therefore, functioning and stable energy relations are at the core of both sides\u2019 interests. The crucial precondition for more cooperation in the field of energy is liberalisation on both sides, based on reciprocity. Russia has to modernise its energy market if it wants to remain capable of guaranteeing domestic as well as export supply. Considering its relative backwardness in technological development, Moscow should be interested in a controlled opening of the Russian energy market and closer cooperation with energy companies from the EU and other industrialised countries. This concerns not only production and transportation, but also \u2013 and in particular \u2013 energy efficiency, which will remain a crucial issue on the Russian agenda. If the EU wants Russia to soften its stance on energy market lib- eralisation, it has to demonstrate that Moscow\u2019s accusation of protectionism is invalid. The Commission\u2019s recent initiative in unbundling energy production and distribution might be a useful step towards the liberalisation of the European energy market. From the EU\u2019s point of view it makes total sense to protect its energy markets from the penetration of state-regulated external actors. The fact that a provision to limit the ability of non-EU com- panies to buy power-distribution networks within the EU has been branded as the \u2018Gazprom clause\u2019 in the public debate shows the 127 Sabine Fischer ",
        "8 strong politicisation of the energy issue in relations with Russia. However, the creation of a common energy market in the EU should be flanked by constructive moves along the lines of the European Energy Charter provisions. The Energy Charter includes rules for investment and non-discriminatory trade as well as a mediation mechanism. Therefore it provides important tools for the regulation not only of bilateral energy relations between the EU and Russia, but also of relations with the transit countries. In order to restart the Energy Charter process, the EU should seriously consider Russian concerns concerning the trans- port protocol, open up negotiations on them and be prepared to partially adapt the Charter in order to get Russia on board. This could be done with direct reference to the Energy Charter, or through the integration of crucial parts of it in the negotiations of the follow-up agreement to the PCA, due to start later this year. That said, the EU does not yet have a common energy market, and Member States\u2019 positions and interests concerning the Euro- peanisation of energy policy as well as energy relations with Russia diverge. Therefore, the EU remains a rather weak collective actor in regional energy relations. Transit consortia (whether trilateral or multilateral), binding together companies in EU Member States, the transit countries, and Russia and functioning according to transparent rules would be a possibility to regulate and stabilise energy transit from Russia to the advantage of all actors involved. The consortium projected by German, Ukrainian and Russian companies before the Orange Revolution was in principle a good idea. However, such constellations should not be dominated by special relations between single EU Member States and Russia. Other EU members should be involved (including in consultation upstream in decision-making) and given the opportunity to bene- fit through participation or interconnectors. The issue of energy saving and modernisation of the Russian energy sector is closely linked with the question of environmental protection and climate change. Recent studies have pointed out the severe consequences of global warming for Russia\u2019s climate, agriculture, economy and living standards (there are positive effects, too, like considerably decreasing heating costs, but the damage by far outweighs such advantages). 8 From a long-term perspective, Russia should therefore be keenly interested in suc- cessfully fighting climate change. Energy saving, for which the 128 The EU and Russia: a contested partnership 8. Alexey O. Kokoring and Inna G.

        "8 mechanisms under the Kyoto Protocol provide strong incentives, could also help solve challenges Russia is facing in its energy sec- tor. Moscow ratified the Kyoto Protocol after lengthy negotiations in 2004, thus allowing it to enter into force. This decision was reached in a swap deal with the EU, which in turn awarded Russia market economy status, thus paving the way for its WTO acces- sion. However, incentives for practical implementation of the pro- visions of the Kyoto Protocol remain limited. Since Russia will not face any problems in meeting its emission obligations in the fore- seeable future (in 2004 Russian emissions remained at 33% of its commitment), no additional domestic measures are needed. As mentioned above, energy saving does not figure high on the Russ- ian political agenda. Saving energy on the domestic market could free additional amounts of gas for export. However, with export contracts (especially for gas) fixed over several years, companies like Gazprom have no immediate need for additional gas. The Russian Energy Strategy until 2020 projects a change in the Russian domestic energy market in favour of an increased share of coal, so that gas export commitments can be met. Thus, the Russian government\u2019s strategy to avoid internal shortages and to guarantee the sustainability of its gas exports is not targeted at energy saving and the modernisation of its energy sector, but merely envisages switching to another fossil energy source. This would increase CO 2 emissions and run counter to the declared goals of the Kyoto Protocol (albeit still being in line with Russia\u2019s obligations). In other words, Russian political thinking does not link energy trade and climate change/environmental protection/energy sav- ing, and remains limited to short-term tactics to increase revenues from energy imports rather than medium- and long-term strate- gies for sustainable development. On the other hand, Russian companies are interested in the Joint Implementation (JI) mecha- nism under the Kyoto Protocol, which would allow co-financed joint ventures, and facilitate foreign investment and the transfer of technology and know-how in this area. The Russian govern- ment issued a decree on the national JI procedures in May 2007, which now allows for implementing the JI in Russia. The EU should take this as a starting point for enhanced cooper- ation with Russia in the fields of energy efficiency/environmental 129 Sabine Fischer ",
        "8 protection. Companies in EU Member States should be encour- aged to enter joint ventures with Russian companies. A special emphasis should be put not only on reducing CO 2 emissions, but especially on energy efficiency. The success of such a strategy cer- tainly depends on the extent to which energy efficiency technolo- gies become a driver of economic growth. Were this to be the case, intensified cooperation in this area could help the Russian gov- ernment realise its goal of diversifying the Russian economy and make it less dependent on energy exports. Other issues for bilateral cooperation Divergence on a number of important questions of regional or global relevance directly affects the bilateral relations between Rus- sia and the EU. Negotiations about the follow-up to the Partner- ship and Cooperation Agreement, which were due to start in autumn 2006, have been delayed three times because of insur- mountable disagreements. With parliamentary and presidential elections looming, the Russian leadership preferred to use harsh rhetoric in relations with the EU instead of demonstrating the will to compromise. This might change now that the elections are over, but there are no radical changes to be expected from the new Russ- ian President Dmitri Medvedev. At the same time, Russia and the EU remain in close contact in quite a number of fields. Where there are common interests, com- munication works well, as is the case in some of the areas covered by the Common Economic Space (regulatory dialogues on trade etc.), the Common Space of Freedom, Security and Justice, and the Common Space of Research, Education and Culture. In the cur- rent phase of political estrangement it is very important to pre- serve these spaces of communication and exchange. The EU should continue supporting Russia\u2019s WTO member- ship. Russia\u2019s accession to the WTO would render 80% of the cur- rent PCA obsolete and pave the way for the conclusion of a free trade agreement. However, both sides have to do homework before the accession can happen. Commitments pending for years now, like the Siberian overflight rights, have to be fulfilled quickly. Fur- thermore, Moscow has to sort out its trade relations with some EU Member States, and to do so in a constructive manner instead of exerting political pressure through trade embargos. For the EU, 130 The EU and Russia: a contested partnership ",
        "8 the main task consists \u2013 again \u2013 in finding a common position and urging those Member States who take a particularly intransigent attitude towards Russia to compromise. Russia faces numerous socio-economic and societal problems which will become more severe in the medium term. The Russian government has recognised these challenges and since 2006 addresses them in so-called National Projects on Education, Health, Affordable Housing, and Agricultural Development. Although these national projects are confined to the period of Putin\u2019s presidency, it is very likely that they will be continued in one way or the other after the presidential elections. In some of the areas concerned, for instance demography, the EU faces similar problems. In others, like the spread of AIDS and other epidemic diseases, it disposes of better-developed instruments. Deepened exchange of information and strategies and mutual assistance would be a promising field of cooperation, also allowing for closer contacts between societal actors from both sides. Cooperation in the fields of science and education has already made considerable strides over the last few years. Russia is one of the few third countries participating in the EU\u2019s research pro- grammes. Since 2003, Russia is also a member of the Bologna Process, and aims at making its higher education system interna- tionally compatible. Numerous cooperation programmes between Russian and EU/European universities have been cre- ated. With the support of the European Commission, the Moscow State Institute for International Relations has set up a so-called European College, which is supposed to become a main training facility for those parts of Russia\u2019s political elite dealing with the EU. These activities should be developed further and extended not only to Russia\u2019s bigger cities, but also to universities in more rural areas. The exchange of students and teachers should be intensified to increase the knowledge and understanding of cultural similari- ties and differences on both sides, and multiply networks among people at all levels. Conclusion Depending on the definition applied to strategic partnerships, it does seem onerous to call Russia a strategic partner of the EU. In early 2008, it has become difficult to speak of common values as a 131 Sabine Fischer ",
        "8 basis for Russia-EU relations. Pragmatic economic cooperation is overshadowed by numerous tensions and disagreements on the regional and international level. The current Russian leadership is preparing a transfer of power which will bypass democratic rules and will most likely not bring about change in Russian domestic politics and foreign policies. Hence, the prospects for the build-up of a strategic partnership based on democratic rules and norms and aiming at multilateral cooperation for the sake of interna- tional stability and peace are rather narrow in the short term. How- ever, as has been outlined in this contribution, due to the many interdependencies which have developed since the breakdown of the Soviet Union, the EU and Russia have considerable potential for fruitful cooperation on all levels of their relationship. If both sides make use of this potential, there is a realistic chance that a substantial strategic partnership might develop in the future. 132 The EU and Russia: a contested partnership ",
        "Russia and the European Union: redefining strategic partnership Dmitri Trenin Strategic partnership between Russia and the European Union 1 requires redefinition. The Union\u2019s original premise that Russia would not only progressively move towards liberal democracy and the market economy, but in so doing would increasingly accept European norms and regulations codified in the acquis communau- taire , has not been borne out by the actual trends. Russia\u2019s road to modernisation has turned out to be more twisted and tortuous, and this modernisation does not equal Europeanisation. After a series of unsuccessful attempts to integrate on special terms into the Western institutions, Russia has reasserted itself as a stand- alone great power. On the other hand, Russian expectations that Europe would become progressively more open toward Russian investments, Russian visitors and Russian views on the world have not been fully realised. The 2004 \u2018Big Bang\u2019 enlargement of the EU has resulted in a substantial rise in scepticism and suspicion towards Russia. Since Europe\u2019s current mode of engagement is not only about external policies, but also about internal conditions in part- ner countries as well, Europeans have been pressing Moscow on the issue of values, only to provoke Russian counter-accusations of self-serving hypocrisy. Thus, even as Europe on the whole has grown more apprehensive towards Russia, many Russians have become disillusioned about Europe. This mutual frustration is the paradoxical result of the grow- ing intimacy of Russo-European contacts. Expanding European business activities in Russia turn the general notions of business climate, the rule of law and property rights into very practical issues. The steep rise in Russia\u2019s financial power has turned the heretofore theoretical possibility of Russian companies acquiring stakes in European enterprises into a reality. Europe\u2019s growing dependence on Russian gas and oil supplies and the rise of resource nationalism in Russia are at the root of different approaches to energy security. The enlargement of the European 133 Partnerships for effective multilateralism EU relations with Brazil, China, India and Russia 1. Throughout this chapter, the author uses the shorthand of Rus- sia-Europe to describe the relation- ship between the Russian Federa- tion and the European Union and its Member States. Geographi- cally, of course, Russia west of the Urals is part of Europe, and cul- turally, Russia is European all the way, from the Baltic to the Pacific. Politically, however, Europe at the beginning of the twenty-first cen- tury denotes the EU and what may be called the Eurosphere , i.e. coun- tries of the European Economic Area, the Union\u2019s candidate mem- bers and close associates. Russia is clearly outside of that \u2018sphere\u2019. Finally, the word \u2018Europe\u2019 is used as a generic term to refer to the Union, its Members States, and pan-European organisations, such as the Council of Europe and the OSCE. 9 ",
        "9 Union has not only physically brought Europe closer to Russian borders, but has created an area of intense competition between the EU and Russia in what the Russians used to call their near abroad, and Europe now calls a common neighborhood. Long accustomed to dealing with individual nation states, Russians find it difficult to deal with the hybrid construction sui generis which is the European Union. The internal workings of the EU are light years away from the practices of a Byzantine court, but can be just as arcane. No wonder that Moscow\u2019s preferred partners are the EU capitals, an approach which many in the Union see as reflecting divisive tactics. For its part, the European Union finds it challenging to deal with a country such as Russia, which evokes vastly different feelings and very diverse interests among the Union\u2019s 27 Member States. Both Russians and Europeans are grappling with striking the right balance between bilateralism and multilateralism in their dealings with each other. Russia certainly does not have the reputation of being an easy international part- ner, but neither does the EU, albeit for entirely different reasons. Even within individual European states, various vested interests have sharply contrasting views on Russia and argue in favour of sometimes diametrically opposite approaches and policies. Finally, Russia-EU relations are closely linked with and affected by a range of other factors, including Russia\u2019s attitudes toward such pan-European organisations as the Council of Europe and the OSCE; Russia\u2019s relations with NATO, which unites most of EU Member States; the developments in those parts of Europe which lie outside of the EU territory, such as the Balkans, new Eastern Europe (Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova) and the South Caucasus; and Russia\u2019s relations with the United States, especially over democracy promotion, alliance enlargement and military deployments within geographical Europe. The above reference to growing mutual frustration does not mean that the idea of the Russia-EU strategic partnership is either wrong or impossible. There is no alienation, and only limited estrangement. Europe is, and is likely to remain for decades to come, Russia\u2019s leading trading partner by far. The EU countries are the principal source of foreign investment in Russia, which also means the transfer of advanced technologies and business practices. In civilisational terms, ever since embracing Christianity in the tenth century, Russians have always been European, 134 Russia and the European Union: redefining strategic partnership ",
        "9 representing Europe\u2019s ancient eastern (Orthodox) tradition. Cul- turally, Russians feel more at home in Europe than anywhere else in the world. They now go to Europe to visit or on vacation, but also to study and to stay, buying property and investing. The geo- graphical proximity and good communications make Europe an excellent travel destination from Russia\u2019s metropolitan centres west of the Urals. However, currently Russia is not desperate to make its relationship with the EU an absolute foreign policy pri- ority. Moscow has decided on an independent global strategy and is playing with a range of options. For Europe, long accustomed to Russia\u2019s physical presence in its midst, Russia is now more of a periphery than before. It is essen- tially a major energy supplier, indispensable and disturbing at the same time. Europe fears dependence on Russia in that sphere, mainly because it sees Russia as \u2018the other\u2019, an authoritarian entity antithetical to Europe\u2019s core values. For Europe, which has been able to manage its immediate neighbourhood by means of condi- tionalities attached to prospects of membership, Russia is a tough partner precisely because conditionality without membership does not work. So, Russia stays out of what Europe regards as the mainstream tendencies in the region and, alone among Europe\u2019s partners, seeks to present an alternative to that mainstream. Still, despite all this, Europe, which shares a continent with Russia and regards it as a cousin of sorts, feels the need to find a permanent accommodation with Russia. Having finally solved the German question in the very heart of the continent, it needs to solve the Russian one in the east. Long-term, wide-ranging and close (i.e., strategic) partnership is probably the only realistic way of achiev- ing that. How to achieve that, given the complexities, some of which have been mentioned in the preceding paragraphs? Before one is able to seriously address that question, one needs to review the recent experience and the current trends and prospects in a number of key areas of the Russia-EU interaction. It makes sense to start with the most dynamic element of Russo- European ties, i.e. their economic relationship, including energy. A logical follow-up is the more contentious and fragile political relationship, which also encompasses security issues. Finally, one has to come to grips with the main area of discord, as seen from the EU side: values. 135 Dmitri Trenin ",
        "9 Economics, energy and the environment In the energy sector, interdependence, rather than Europe\u2019s one- sided dependence on Russia, is the reality. In percentage terms, the Russian federal budget is much more dependent on the proceeds from oil and gas shipments to Europe than the EU countries are dependent on Russian deliveries. Europe certainly overreacted to the 2005-6 gas crisis between Russia and Ukraine, but its quest for alternative sources of energy supply is a sound long-term policy. Russia for its part needs to access the global energy market, which means becoming a supplier to Asia and America as well as Europe. What is unhelpful are Gazprom\u2019s threats to switch exports from Europe to China and calls in Europe and the US for an \u2018energy NATO\u2019 are equally unhelpful. Punishment will not work, either way. The real problem is not Russia\u2019s use of its energy supplies as a weapon to achieve political dominance, which is an oversimplified reading of the Kremlin\u2019s clumsily executed, but essentially rational policies, but rather the risk that Gazprom may not be physically able to satisfy Europe\u2019s needs and honour its contracts. As energy demand is rising in Russia itself, Gazprom needs to develop new gas fields in some very difficult areas, and to be able to lay pipelines to deliver gas to consumers in Europe. Development of deposits in the Arctic such as Shtokman, and building new pipelines such as the North and South streams, call for Russo- European cooperation. Pipeline competition is not a zero-sum game: energy security essentially means redundancy. Tripartite Russo-Western-Chinese competition in the Caspian and in Cen- tral Asia also enables the countries in the region to cut the best possible economic deals and to better balance their foreign and security policies. Similarly, liberalisation of the energy sector would leave both Russia and Europe better off. Russia\u2019s transit monopoly on gas supplies from Central Asia is not sustainable over the long term, and Moscow would have to ratify the Energy Charter including the Transit Protocol. In a trade-off, the EU needs to liberalise its own energy market, making it accessible to companies such as Gazprom. A much wider opening of the Russian energy market to outsiders would serve to modernise the energy industry and thus raise the Russian companies\u2019 international competitiveness. An opening of the EU market would serve the interests of European 136 Russia and the European Union: redefining strategic partnership ",
        "9 consumers. \u2018Energy\u2019 in this context is not limited to fossil fuels and includes the nuclear materials market, which Rosatom has been trying to accede. Russia acceded to the Kyoto protocol chiefly in order to close WTO negotiations with the EU. Through 2012, Russian CO 2 emissions are likely to stay below the Kyoto limits, but after that the growth of the Russian economy and the national energy strat- egy which calls for expanded use of coal as an energy source could put Russia above its obligations under the Kyoto agreement. Moscow needs to start developing its own environmental strategy, which is still lacking, based on the realities and trends of climate change, Russia\u2019s interests and its international obligations. Given Russia\u2019s geographical position, ongoing dialogue on environmen- tal issues linked to the problem of energy efficiency is a major area of practical cooperation between the EU and Russia. Economic relations between Russia and Europe are not limited to energy ties. By 2007, Russia has fully recovered from the col- lapse of the Soviet economic system in the 1990s. Russia\u2019s GDP, the world\u2019s eighth largest, is back to its 1990 level, but in qualita- tive terms, of course, it is wholly different. Russia\u2019s nine-year-old economic growth, spurred on as it is by the high energy prices, is likely to continue at least in the medium term. Some longer-term projections have Russia advancing still further, gradually overtak- ing all of the EU individual countries\u2019 economies. As it proceeds, Russia\u2019s modernisation requires a complete overhaul of the coun- try\u2019s infrastructure. Motor roads, railroads and airports are woe- fully substandard and inadequate. Modernisation also requires large-scale economic diversification away from oil and gas dependence. Russians will look to partners around the world, but Europe appears to be the most likely principal source of expertise, technology and investment. This is a major opportunity for Euro- pean companies. Political issues, including security affairs One of the salient results of the end of the Cold War and the rise of the European Union has been a marked transformation of the meaning of the term \u2018European security\u2019. Russia\u2019s own rise as a great power in the eighteenth century was closely linked to its entry of the European system of competing states, based on the balance 137 Dmitri Trenin ",
        "9 of power principle. Between 1945 and 1990, divided Europe was the centre stage of a global stand-off between two super-powers, one of which was the Soviet Union. Within a decade and a half after the end of the Cold War, however, Europe outside of the former USSR has become one, united under the aegis of the European Union. This had the effect of making Russia, whose self-image as a great power has been traditionally based on its competence in the affairs of Europe, into Europe\u2019s neighbour. To the extent that European security issues have survived into the twenty-first century, they are limited to managing relation- ships between Russia and NATO as well as Russia and the United States; and to the resolution of the \u2018frozen conflicts\u2019 in Kosovo, Transnistria, Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Nagorno-Karabakh. In 2007 Russia suspended its participation in the Conven- tional Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty as a means of making its Western partners ratify its adapted version (as Moscow already has) and heed Russian security concerns. While there is no imme- diate danger of a return to military build-up and confrontation, the passing of the treaty which was once hailed as the material foundation of the European peace order could increase uncer- tainty and mutual suspicion. While this is not strictly EU business, EU Member States which are parties to the CFE and those invited to join (like the three Baltic countries) owe it to themselves to make sure that the adapted CFE treaty enters into force and guar- antees common security in geographical Europe. Another issue that came to the fore in 2007 is the US plan to deploy elements of its global ballistic missile defence (BMD) sys- tem in Poland and the Czech Republic. The failure so far to reach an agreement between Washington and Moscow that would, at minimum, guarantee that the proposed deployments do not diminish Russia\u2019s strategic capabilities and, ideally, lead to US- European-Russian collaboration within a regional missile defence system, has produced tensions reminiscent of the Cold War era. Senior Russian officials have issued threats of new missile deploy- ments targeting European countries, which is clearly counter-pro- ductive. By reacting in this way, Russians are rekindling the fears that push Europe into America\u2019s protective arms. Yet, a compro- mise solution to the missile defence issue is possible in principle between the US and Russia, and Europeans would do right to help bring it about. 138 Russia and the European Union: redefining strategic partnership ",
        "9 In the reverse scenario of Moscow eventually reopening the intermediate-range missile (INF) issue, Europeans need to join America and Russia in promoting a global ban on those systems. In any event, they need to obtain assurances from Moscow that in the event of Russia\u2019s withdrawal from the INF, Europe is spared another missile build-up along the lines of the 1970s and 1980s. This may be possible in the situation in which the adapted CFE treaty is being fully implemented, and an acceptable solution is found for the BMD issue. The proposed US BMD deployments are linked to the Iranian nuclear issue. The EU, along with the US, Russia and China, is par- ticipating in international efforts aimed at preventing Iran\u2019s acquisition of nuclear weapons. Despite certain non-trivial differ- ences, Europeans and Russians not only share the ultimate objec- tive of non-proliferation, but also place emphasis on direct talks with Tehran. Even though there can be no resolution of the Iran- ian nuclear issue in the absence of a clear policy and an active role by the United States (e.g., along the lines of Washington\u2019s current approach towards the North Korean nuclear issue), the EU and Russia could play very useful roles, and closer coordination of their policies would be of benefit to all. In 1999 and again in 2004, Russia had to accept two waves of NATO enlargement. It loudly, though in vain, protested the first time, over the accession of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Repub- lic, and chose to register its disapproval silently, over the Baltic States, Romania, Bulgaria, Slovakia and Slovenia, five years later. Although there are no immediate plans for admitting more states from the former Soviet Union, this remains a highly sensitive issue. In Georgia\u2019s case, one needs to remember that Georgians believe they are at war with Russia, which occupies part of their ter- ritory (Abkhazia and South Ossetia). In the more important case of Ukraine, any attempt to raise the issue of NATO membership before there is a solid majority within Ukrainian society \u2013 and not just in the government and parliament \u2013 risks creating nationwide political turmoil and inviting cross-border interference support- ing either side in the argument. While Georgia, even in the worst case situation, is likely to remain important, but peripheral, Ukraine as a political battlefield between the West and Russia would seriously destabilise Russian-European relations. 139 Dmitri Trenin ",
        "9 Resolving the frozen conflicts would strengthen security on the borders of the EU and Russia. In an ideal world, the Union would have done well if it had managed to deliver a solution of the Kosovo issue based on an agreement between Belgrade and Pristina, something which Moscow had vowed to accept. Kosovo\u2019s 2008 proclamation of independence and its recognition by most EU members, as well as the United States, has not resolved the issue completely. The Union needs to deal with the fact that nei- ther the Kosovar Albanians nor the Serbs will accept to be ruled by the other group (which raises the unpalatable issue of Kosovo\u2019s partition); that Kosovo will take time to evolve into a fully-fledged nation state (which will require continued EU involvement on the ground); and that both Serbia and Kosovo will gravitate towards the EU (which will give the Union leverage if it wanted to use it). Kosovo is the defining moment for the Union, and the definition will depend on the outcome of the crisis. Moldova, where a Moscow-brokered peace deal was shot down in 2003 by the US and its European allies, still remains the best bet for conflict-resolution in the foreseeable future. A unified neutral Moldova, with proper guarantees for Transnistria within a com- mon state, with a small international police contingent to ensure security along the Dniester, and with Russia\u2019s ancient ammuni- tion depots (and their guards) safely gone, could become a first case of successful conflict resolution through the joint efforts of Russia and European states. Potentially, this is a case for ESDP- NATO-Russia collaboration. Abkhazia and South Ossetia are much harder issues to resolve, but the EU would play a constructive role if it reached out more to Abkhazians and Ossetians, in an effort to re-energise the search for a political solution. Russia\u2019s winning of the right to hold the 2014 Winter Olympics at Sochi, a mere 20 kilometres from Abk- hazia, makes it interested in strengthening peace and enhancing security in the region. On Nagorno-Karabakh, there is broad agreement among the three co-chairs of the Minsk group, France, Russia and the US, as to the modalities of peace settlement. Pre- venting war between Azerbaijan and Armenia is a common con- cern. Political developments in New Eastern Europe, the South Cau- casus and even Central Asia could impact on Russia-EU relations. Ukraine\u2019s 2004 Orange Revolution and the role that Poland, among others, played in working out a compromise between the 140 Russia and the European Union: redefining strategic partnership ",
        "9 Ukrainian factions, created an image of \u2018the lands between\u2019 the enlarged EU and the retrenched Russia as a new East-West tug of war. Since then, however, Ukraine has been largely on its own, with Moscow basically reconciled to its slow westward drift. President Putin has officially referred to Ukraine\u2019s eventual EU membership as being unproblematic for Russia \u2013 unlike, of course, its NATO accession, which remains anathema to Moscow. With Belarus having quietened down for the time being under the present regime, Moscow seeks from Minsk the opening up of the Belarusian market and a share of the privatisation prize. The perceived \u2018loss\u2019 of Ukraine stimulates Russian efforts to shore up its positions in Belarus, and to keep that country in the Russian orbit. As in the South Caucasus and Central Asia, however, Russo- European economic competition is a largely good thing, present- ing the countries in these regions with wider options and more policy alternatives. Values and visas One of Europe\u2019s major problems in dealing with Russia is the issue of values. How should Europe deal with a country which is mildly authoritarian, does not show enough respect for human rights, and restricts its citizens\u2019 freedoms? The Kremlin has responded to these concerns with the concept of \u2018sovereign democracy\u2019 which basically proclaims Russia\u2019s independence from Western, includ- ing European, tutelage (the sovereignty aspect) and insists on Rus- sia\u2019s equality in democratic (i.e. popularly supported) legitimacy with its Western partners. The clear emphasis on sovereignty and the refusal to be graded by international democratic standards has led to Moscow restrict- ing the monitoring mission of the OSCE\u2019s Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) in the run-up to the 2007 Duma elections, which in turn resulted in the ODIHR\u2019s refusal to dispatch the mission. Within the OSCE, Russia has been trying, mostly alone and so far unsuccessfully, to change the focus of the organisation away from human rights and democracy in the post-Communist states and towards more traditional security issues. Within the Council of Europe, Chechnya is less of an issue now than in the late 1990s and the early 2000s. For its part, Moscow has 141 Dmitri Trenin ",
        "9 been trying to highlight the situation of mostly ethnic Russian non-citizens in Latvia and Estonia, and to point to the public activities of surviving former Nazi collaborators in those coun- tries, and to the official support they are occasionally given as fighters against Soviet communism. Whatever the particular issues of the day, Russia\u2019s membership in the Council of Europe signifies Russia\u2019s commitment, in principle, to European values. To deepen that commitment, other members of the Council need to make sure that Russia is not only judged and criticised accord- ing to its performance, but is also heard and engaged. No one can or should be asked to remain quiet, or to censor themselves, but merely preaching and protesting is rarely produc- tive or even satisfying for that matter. Russia, of course, is not at the stage in societal and democratic development where the EU countries are, at present. But today\u2019s Europe is not only different, values-wise, from the Europe of 1914, but even from the Europe of, say, 1968. Russia, for its part, in its various aspects somewhat resembles the Germany of the 1920s, the France of the 1950s, and the Italy of the 1960s, all at the same time. From another perspec- tive, it appears like itself, circa 1913. These comparisons are highly notional and do not constitute any predictions about Russia\u2019s future course. They are mere intuitions, suggesting that Russia is an evolving entity, and that its trajectory may have more in com- mon with the evolutionary histories of Western European coun- tries than with the recent revolutionary experience (modernisa- tion through integration) of Central (formerly Eastern) Europe. Russia\u2019s societal values will change as capitalism and the mar- ket further develop in Russia; as property relations demand codi- fication in legal acts and norms; as proliferating interests require representation; and as growing affluence engenders demand for accountability. These processes are essentially economy- and soci- ety-driven, from the inside. However, multifaceted, multi-level interaction with Europe can play a hugely important positive role. Europe\u2019s very proximity and the affinity it evokes among ordinary Russians enhances the effect still further. Working toward a visa- free regime between the EU and Russia, provided, of course, that Russia satisfactorily secures its other borders, is the correct approach. Europeans will be right to insist that Russia fulfils its obliga- tions, whether in the Council of Europe or the OSCE, or the Euro- pean Court of Human Rights. They will be right, also, to take legit- 142 Russia and the European Union: redefining strategic partnership ",
        "9 imate Russian concerns and criticisms seriously. Russia is not the only country in Europe which has to deal with its heavy legacy of the past. Most European countries, and virtually all the major ones, fall into the same category. Germany\u2019s successful Vergangen- heitsbew\u00e4ltigung is an historical exception, not the rule. Russia- bashing, like Europe-bashing in Russia, is damaging to those doing the \u2018bashing\u2019. A 2030 vision? With the Russo-Polish meat dispute resolved, Russia and the Euro- pean Union are now free to move toward drafting a new partner- ship agreement to replace the 1997 one. This is an important immediate issue. However, in order for the partnership to become a truly strategic one, both the EU and Russia need to take a much longer view. Where will both of them be in, say, 2030? What will each need from the other, in order to achieve its domestic objectives and global ambitions? Russia may well become an independent pole in a multipolar world, but, with only a few percentage points of the global GDP, and a contracting population, would that not be a junior pole? Of Russia\u2019s potential partners-in-integration, would Europe not be the most attractive one? And, as for Europe, would a strong (confederal-type) relationship with Russia not provide it with much-needed strategic depth and enhance its standing in the world, increasingly dominated by Asian and other non-Western actors? Russia might be the ultimate Eastern Europe, the Old World\u2019s second pillar and the last frontier. Intriguing prospects to ponder. 143 Dmitri Trenin ",

        "The rise of strategic partnerships: between interdependence and power politics Giovanni Grevi Introduction The European Security Strategy (ESS) of 2003 outlined for the first time a common assessment of the main threats and challenges con- fronting the European Union. It also emphasised the EU\u2019s com- mitment to an international order based on effective multilateral- ism. However, while acknowledging that \u2018no single country is able to tackle today\u2019s complex problems on its own\u2019 and that, con- versely, \u2018there are few if any problems we can deal with on our own\u2019, the Strategy only referred in passing to the EU\u2019s relations with other big global players. In this context, the need to pursue the EU\u2019s objectives \u2018both through multilateral cooperation in international organisations and through partnerships with key actors\u2019 was stated. Different wording was used to describe different partnerships. The transatlantic relationship was defined as \u2018irreplaceable. Act- ing together, the European Union and the United States can be a formidable force for good in the world.\u2019 The aim was therefore \u2018an effective and balanced partnership with the USA.\u2019 In fact, in the aftermath of Iraq, the determination to fix EU-US relations per- vaded the whole text of the Strategy. Turning to other major inter- national partners, the Strategy singled out relations with Russia, arguing that \u2018we should continue to work for closer relations with Russia, a major factor in our security and prosperity.\u2019 The Strategy added that respect for common values would reinforce progress towards a \u2018strategic partnership\u2019 with the large neighbour. Fur- thermore, the Strategy called for developing strategic partner- ships with Japan, China, Canada and India, \u2018as well as with all those who share our goals and values, and are prepared to act in their support.\u2019 These references to \u2018working with partners\u2019 at the end of the ESS suggest five brief considerations. First, the transatlantic part- nership remained the defining strategic relation for the EU. 145 Partnerships for effective multilateralism EU relations with Brazil, China, India and Russia 10 ",
        "10 Second, Russia was considered an important enough actor to jus- tify a separate mention and, distinctively, was defined as a major factor for the security of the EU. Third, the pooling in the same basket of countries as diverse as Japan, China, Canada and India showed the lack of a truly strategic perspective in looking at other strategic partnerships. Fourth, common values and the readiness to act in their support were regarded as a component of strategic partnerships. Fifth, and related, the list of strategic partners was not a closed one, as much would depend on normative conver- gence and willingness to act together. Five years on, the international system has considerably changed, with Russia, China and India taking a more prominent role in shaping a new international order. Brazil is another impor- tant player affecting international relations across a number of issues. Economic and therefore political power has been shifting from the EU and the US to other economic powerhouses, notably in Asia. Russia, for its part, has reasserted itself as an independent, major political and economic power, notably exploiting its exten- sive energy resources as a political weapon. Most importantly, however, the 2003 Strategy has been proven right in so far as no single global player can achieve its strategic goals independently of the others. Whether one looks at curbing CO 2 emissions or ensur- ing the security of energy supply and demand; whether it is a ques- tion of redressing major trade imbalances or carrying out human- itarian interventions and supporting stabilisation and development, international cooperation is a vital condition for success. Between 2003 and 2008, the EU has done a lot to build solid, comprehensive strategic partnerships with the so-called new global players, namely China, India and Brazil, as well as with Rus- sia, which is a traditional great power but took a less prominent international role for a decade after the unravelling of the Soviet Union. Arguably, in 2008 these partnerships feature much higher on the political agenda of the EU than they did five years ago. In all likelihood, their ascension will continue in the short to medium term. The review of the four strategic partnerships carried out in this Chaillot Paper provides, thus, a contribution to assessing the implementation of the ESS itself, and prospects ahead. In what follows, some conclusions will be drawn from the comparative analysis of the partnerships in question. The first part of this chapter is dedicated to some of the serious challenges that affect 146 The rise of strategic partnerships: between interdependence and power politics ",
        "10 the viability of EU strategic partnerships. The second part outlines major opportunities for further cooperation across a range of political and security issues. Two caveats, however, must be noted. First, while not addressed in this context, the transatlantic partnership is the most important for the EU and will remain such for the foresee- able future, although it has suffered much controversy and is undergoing significant evolution. Deep economic interdepend- ence, shared political and societal values, extensive people-to- people contacts, common security threats and the NATO umbrella make for profound and lasting connections between the two sides of the Atlantic. For the EU, this is far from being an exclusive relationship but, in shaping strategic partnerships with other actors, it cannot be overlooked either. Second, from an EU standpoint, strategic partnerships are comprehensive by defini- tion, ranging far beyond the political and security fields to touch all sorts of economic and societal issues. This is a trademark of the \u2018EU way\u2019 of doing business with other players, and corre- sponds to the reality of ever-growing areas of cooperation and interdependence. The following analysis, however, focuses on the political dimension of these partnerships, based on the assump- tion that, short of a convergence of worldviews, self-perceptions and, where relevant, threat assessments, cooperation will suffer serious constraints. Strategic partnerships: a sign of the times Bilateral partnerships have always existed in parallel to multilateral frameworks. The 2003 ESS acknowledged that the EU needed to pursue its objectives through both international organisations and partnerships with key actors. While championing effective multi- lateralism at the global and regional level in different fields, the EU has invested a lot of political capital in building closer and struc- tured relations with other global players over the last five years. Strategic partnerships have been launched with India in 2004 (fol- lowed in 2006 by a Joint Action Plan to implement the partnership agreement) and with Brazil in 2007, upgrading the political profile of EU relations with these countries. In the case of China, negotia- tions on a comprehensive Partnership and Cooperation Agree- ment (PCA) were launched in June 2007, and a high-level economic 147 Giovanni Grevi ",
        "10 and trade talks mechanism was established in 2008. A PCA was concluded with Russia as early as in 1997 and negotiations are ongoing on renewing it. In the meantime, the EU and Russia pledged to reinforce their cooperation by setting up four \u2018common spaces\u2019 in 2003. They deal with, respectively, the economy; freedom, security and justice; external security; and research, education and culture. In 2005, four road maps were adopted to foster the imple- mentation of the four spaces. In policy documents and political statements over the years, the EU has been variously referring to these four countries as \u2018strategic partners\u2019. This political drive reflects and accompanies the growing rele- vance of large, individual state actors to international political and economic relations and to all major questions of global gover- nance. A quick review of some basic indicators confirms this point. The so-called BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India and China) accounted for 25% of the world GDP (at Purchasing Power Parity - PPP) in 2005, and are expected to account for around 32% in 2020. 1 In particular, China may account for as much as 26% of global economic growth between 2006 and 2020, and India 12%. Adding Brazil and Russia, 43% of global growth may be generated in these four countries over the next ten years or so. Based on these projections, China, India, Brazil and Russia may rank, respec- tively, as the first, third, eight and ninth largest economies in 2020 in terms of PPP, while China would be the second largest economy (around 35% of US GDP) at market exchange rates. Looking at trade patterns, it is evident that the relative impor- tance of the four countries in question has been growing steadily. Imports from China to the EU-27 have been growing from 52 bil- lion euro in 1999 to 194 billion in 2006 while, over the same period of time, imports from Russia have multiplied fourfold from 36 bil- lion euro to 140 billion. Exports from the EU-27 to China have more than tripled between 1999 and 2006, reaching 63 billion euro, while exports to Russia have grown fourfold to 72 billion euro and exports to India have increased by 150%, up to 24 billion euro. 2 After the US, China\u2019s is the EU\u2019s second largest trading part- ner, having displaced the US as the main source of imports in 2006, and Russia is the third one. Investments flows follow a similar pattern, although they are constrained by market and non-market barriers in countries like China and Russia, but also India. In 2005, 17% of the EU\u2019s outward foreign direct investment (FDI) flows targeted the US, while 36% 148 The rise of strategic partnerships: between interdependence and power politics 1. \u2018Foresight 2020: Economic, in- dustry and corporate trends\u2019, Economist Intelligence Unit, March 2006.

It should be stressed, however, that the EU exports to Switzerland (87 billion euro), while growing at a much slower pace, still outrank those to China, which underlines the considerable barriers encoun- tered by EU companies trading with the big Asian partner.

        "10 were directed towards the emerging markets. Of the four countries analysed here, Brazil is by far the biggest recipient of EU FDI, with a stock of around 80 billion euro in 2005, followed by Russia with over 30 billion, China with 27 billion and India with 12 billion. Between 2005 and 2007, however, EU investments in China have shrunk, reflecting economic but also political tensions. Energy, and the security of energy supply and demand, is a defining issue for the years to come. From this standpoint, the four EU strategic partners reviewed here belong to two different camps, namely major importers and major exporters. Like the EU, China and India are large economies whose growth is largely dependent on energy imports. Differently from the EU, however, the energy needs of China and India are exploding, to sustain breakneck economic growth. 3 To give an order of magnitude, China\u2019s energy demand, which already accounts for 12% of the world total, is expected to more than double between 2005 and 2030. The same goes for India, with the two countries accounting for almost half of the 50% increase of the world\u2019s energy needs by 2030. 4 This implies that, twenty years down the line, India will depend on imports for about 90% of its oil and 40% of its gas sup- plies, while China\u2019s import dependence will rise to around 80% for oil, and 27% for gas. The problem, of course, is that both developed and emerging countries (as well as the poorest ones) will rely on imports from a limited number of big producers. In so far as oil is concerned, Mid- dle East countries today account for 28% of global production, and their share should rise to 38% in 2030. OPEC countries\u2019 oil exports will grow from 42% to 52% of the world\u2019s total. Russia holds around 6% of the world oil reserves, and boasts by far the largest reserves of gas, followed by Iran, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Imports from Russia cover 24% of the EU\u2019s gas consumption and 44% of overall EU gas imports. Russia also accounts for 30% of EU oil imports and 27% of EU consumption. Brazil, for its part, has important oil reserves, earmarked mainly for internal consump- tion, and is set to become one of the world\u2019s leading producers and exporters of biofuels. The global production of biofuels might grow tenfold between 2004 and 2030, depending on the levels of investment, the price of oil, technological innovation, global regu- lations, and the impact on food production. The EU has set a min- imum target for sustainable biofuels of 10% of oil and diesel con- sumption in the transport sector by 2020. 5 149 Giovanni Grevi 3.

        "10 The success of the strategies to contain climate change will cru- cially depend on the involvement of developing countries and on the commitment of China and India in particular. With around 18% of the world total, China became the biggest CO 2 emitter in 2007, and India is set to become the third largest emitter by 2015. Short of far-reaching policy adjustments, global energy-related CO 2 emissions are expected to jump by over 50% between 2005 and 2030, with the US, China, Russia and India contributing two thirds of the increase. The review of these indicators suggests that, over the next ten years, the priorities and decisions of a few large state players will have a huge impact on the scope for and direction of international cooperation. It follows that bilateral relations between the EU and these actors have acquired renewed relevance, as an essential pre- condition for establishing viable mechanisms of global gover- nance. Multilateral structures have always reflected, to some extent, the values and interests of leading powers. The point, how- ever, is that the range of the key stakeholders of globalisation, and \u2018poles\u2019 of the geopolitical balance, is expanding, and new deals will have to be struck among them as a basis for common rules. Multilateralism will only be effective if it is compatible with the underlying interests of the big actors, although interests are not fixed and can evolve through international cooperation. At this stage, however, it is as yet unclear whether the priorities of the main global actors \u2013 both old and new ones \u2013 are growing more or less divergent, as evidence could be cited to support both argu- ments. EU strategic partnerships are therefore a sign of the times, and embody the attempt to reconcile the new, de facto centrality of bilateralism with the enduring, and growing, necessity of multi- lateralism. Strategic partnerships reflect an international system in transition where norms are contested and the balance of power is shifting, but the main challenges are largely common ones. As such, these partnerships require much flexibility in their formula- tion and interpretation. The worldviews of strategic partners The contributions featured in this Chaillot Paper show that strategic partnerships encompass relations with countries taking a very dif- ferent approach to international relations and cooperation, and 150 The rise of strategic partnerships: between interdependence and power politics ",
        "10 expressing different priorities. Three general points can be made in this connection. First of all, with the exception of Brazil, EU part- ners stress the centrality of national sovereignty to the interna- tional order and firmly uphold the principle of non-interference in their internal affairs and in those of other countries. It follows that they are reluctant to enter binding commitments in their relations with the EU and to accept that, for example, social or human rights clauses are attached to economic agreements. Authoritarian coun- tries such as China and Russia have entered dialogues on human rights with the EU, but the scope for tangible progress in improv- ing human rights standards seems small and, in some respects, appears to be shrinking. For a \u2018transformative\u2019 and \u2018normative\u2019 power like the EU, this is no mean challenge. This has clear implications at both the domestic and the inter- national level. On the one hand, in the words of Dmitri Trenin, the Russian concept of \u2018sovereign democracy\u2019 \u2018basically proclaims Russia\u2019s independence from Western, including European, tute- lage (the sovereignty bit) and insists on Russia\u2019s equality in demo- cratic (i.e. popularly supported) legitimacy with its Western part- ners.\u2019 6 On the other hand, following the coloured revolutions on its borders, Russia tends to regard relations with the EU in the common neighbourhood as a zero-sum game, and is extremely suspicious of the EU\u2019s support to good governance, civil society and democratic forces in the region. China, for its part, is notori- ously opposed to the slightest hint of international political, let alone military, interference or intervention in third countries. This approach undermines the emergence of customary norms of international law, such as the responsibility to protect, despite the fact that the latter has been collectively endorsed by UN members in the Outcome Document of the historical 2005 UN Summit. 7 India, while rightly proud of its democratic and pluralist political system, and very much engaged in UN peacekeeping activities, appears largely focussed on asserting its own strategic autonomy and not keen on exporting democratic norms and values. The second point is that the emphasis on sovereignty and non- interference puts the commitment of the EU\u2019s partners to effec- tive multilateralism in perspective. Brazil seems to come the clos- est to the EU\u2019s principled commitment to effective multilateralism and the UN system. With different nuances, how- ever, China, Russia and even India seem to take an instrumental approach to multilateralism. In a nutshell, looking at the often 151 Giovanni Grevi 6.

        "10 wide gap between their discourse and practice, multilateralism seems to be, depending on the circumstances, a tactic or a rhetori- cal device. All these countries, arguably, support multilateralism in a selective way, in so far as it fosters their interests. In other words, multilateralism is more about serving goals than about shaping the context for lasting and far-reaching cooperation. Sabine Fischer stresses how Russia uses its membership of the UN Security Council to assert a \u2018negative\u2019 veto power rather than to express a \u2018positive\u2019 agenda-setting power. 8 China and India have operated at cross purposes on the key issue of the reform of the UN Security Council, given the ambivalence of China on granting per- manent membership to India (let alone Japan), and the eagerness of the latter to acquire a seat at the UNSC table, thereby achieving its quest for global standing. Like Russia, India appears as an overtly revisionist \u2018modern\u2019 power, busy with carving its niche in a new concert of great powers. As Christian Wagner notes, although both India and the EU \u2018have a long tradition of involvement in multilateral institutions, they have a different understanding of effective multilateralism. The EU regards \u201ceffective multilateral- ism\u201d as a synonym for strengthening international institutions \u2026 India regards multilateral institutions as means to pursue its national interests. The use of \u201ceffective multilateralism\u201d can therefore be understood as a strategy to achieve these goals via cooperation in global institutions.\u2019 9 When it comes to China, according to Fran\u00e7ois Godement, \u2018in the balance between multi- lateralism and multipolarity, the notion of a Chinese-European convergence of views is underpinned by much ambiguity.\u2019 10 In fact, the Chinese discourse is very subtle, showing a clear under- standing of the difference between multilateralism and multipo- larity and of the distinctive European approach to the interna- tional order. Still, Feng\u2019s assertion that \u2018it is China\u2019s view that a multipolar world would be the basis of a multilateral world. With- out a balanced power structure in the world, any multilateralism will not be reliable\u2019 needs to be put to the test. 11 The familiar anti- hegemonic undertones of this statement will have to be balanced by concrete engagement in the multilateral agenda, from mone- tary issues to climate change, from regional tensions to humani- tarian interventions. The third point is that the diversity of worldviews harbours potential for new dividing lines between rule-makers and rule- 152 The rise of strategic partnerships: between interdependence and power politics 8.

        "10 takers or, rather, between different groups of rule-makers. At pres- ent, this is more a scenario than a statement of fact, but much political focus will be required to avert it. Salma Bava pointedly argues that \u2018Europe the \u201cnorm entrepreneur\u201d is a satiated power, whereas India is trying to become a norm-setter, seeking to change the status quo in matters of global governance.\u2019 12 Feng notes that \u2018since it entered into the global system \u2026 China has been a rule taker, not a rule maker.\u2019 13 This could, however, be interpreted as an instance of Chinese understatement considering the growing role of China in devising new models of economic growth and devel- opment, and distinctive visions of the global order. 14 Brazil, while closer to the EU\u2019s emphasis on global and regional governance, \u2018veut un monde r\u00e9gul\u00e9, mais dans lequel le pouvoir de r\u00e9guler ne soit pas un monopole am\u00e9ricano-europ\u00e9en et o\u00f9 sa participation dans la cr\u00e9ation, l\u2019\u00e9tablissement et l\u2019application des normes et r\u00e8gles soit clairement reconnue.\u2019 15 All of the above points to the need to revise the structures of global governance so as to make them better reflect the new dynamics of power and influence. Short of more determined steps in this direction, traditional multilateral institutions may see their role greatly downsized, or contested to the point of stale- mate. The clout of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the effectiveness of the World Bank have already been seriously affected by growing private financial and investment flows towards developing countries, the emergence of new major lenders such as China, the massive revenues accruing to energy- rich countries and the large currency reserves resulting from new trade patterns. 16 While regularly paying tribute to the importance of the WTO multilateral trade system, major trade powers have failed to come to an agreement on the struggling Doha Round. The international trade system is visibly fragmenting in different regional trade agreements and in bilateral negotiations, such as those that the EU is pursuing with India and MERCOSUR. Trade imbalances and tensions on market access and protection of intel- lectual property between the EU and China fuel much resentment in Europe, which may lead to a protectionist backlash. On these and other crucial matters, ranging from the reduction of green- house gas emissions to international criminal justice and human rights, the role of the EU as a norm-entrepreneur will therefore be put to the test. 153 Giovanni Grevi 12.

        "10 The EU: a strategic partner? Over the last few years, EU strategic partnerships have been upgraded to include a more explicit political and also security dimension, addressing issues of global governance and stability. This development raises questions not only about the commit- ment of the EU\u2019s partners, and their priorities and worldviews, but also about the Union itself. The point is whether the EU \u2013 a collec- tive international actor \u2013 is willing and able to perform as a strate- gic actor. Doing so implies commitment to a set of principles and values, the ability to define clear priorities, the availability of policy tools to pursue them consistently, the capacity to negotiate with other actors in the international system, and the recognition by others as a relevant strategic interlocutor. 17 Thus, entering strategic partnerships constitutes a key test for the Union as an international actor. First, acting strategically in relations with major global players requires an adjustment in the way in which the EU approaches its external relations. Second, the perceptions of the EU\u2019s partners matter a great deal in enhancing or undermining the role of the EU as a strategic actor. Third, look- ing at the strategic partnership \u2018market\u2019, the focus on the EU \u2018sup- ply\u2019 should be complemented by the analysis of the demand, or expectations, of partnership deliverables by other players. Fourth, the EU is not the only strategic partner in town. More specifically, the \u2018US factor\u2019 remains a key variable in shaping EU strategic part- nerships. In addressing the first point, a distinction should be drawn between the much-debated EU \u2018structural\u2019 power and more tradi- tional forms of \u2018relational\u2019 power. 18 Essentially, structural power is about shaping the environment of international relations, set- ting up international institutions, regimes and norms, and involv- ing countries in a comprehensive web of multilateral arrange- ments at the global and regional level for the management of interdependence. In deploying this dimension of power, the EU has been drawing on a wide range of external policies, including trade, economic and financial instruments, development and humanitarian assistance, and also the CFSP and, more recently, ESDP with its civilian and military dimension. The point that emerges from the contributions to this volume, however, is that strategic partnerships are as much about shaping the context for enhancing mutual relations as they are about trad- 154 The rise of strategic partnerships: between interdependence and power politics 17. This particular breakdown of the requirements to qualify as an international actor is borrowed from Charlotte Bretherton and John Vogler, The European Union as a Global Actor (London: Routledge, 1999). The authors include among the features of an interna- tional actor the domestic legiti- mation of decision-making and policy priorities as well. This is an important dimension, not least because of the growing public concerns regarding relations with some of the EU strategic partners, but it is not addressed as such here. 18.

        "10 ing respective interests. In fact, it would appear that, for \u2018realist\u2019 countries like China, India and Russia, strategic partnerships are essentially regarded as a tool to further their priorities. To provide a very clear example of the difference between a structural (or nor- mative) approach and a more strategic (interest-based) one, it is one thing for the EU to support the strengthening of the UN, but quite a different matter for it to take a stance on whether or not, say, India, should join the UN Security Council. When it comes to how the EU is perceived by its partners, the countries reviewed here do not seem to regard the EU as a fully- fledged international actor and stress the complexity of its insti- tutional structure as an impediment to more straightforward rela- tions. The mismatch between the EU as a post-modern, collective international actor, and the very purposeful, modern actors that it is dealing with, is noted by the various contributors to this Chaillot Paper . 19 In this connection, the results of a recent survey of public opinion conducted in various key states presents a sobering pic- ture. 20 Asked what the main world powers are today, 81% of the respondents mentioned the US, 50% China, 39% Russia, 35% Japan and 34% the EU, which shares the fifth place with the UK. More interestingly in this context, the EU was regarded as a world power by only 5% in India, 12% in Brazil, 13% in Russia, 32% in China (the best score outside the EU) and 26% in the US. It follows that the EU position in this ranking largely depended on positive answers from EU Member States. Taking a medium-term perspective and looking at world pow- ers in 2020, 61% of those surveyed mentioned the US, 57% China, 37% Russia, 33% the EU (at the same level as Japan) and 29% India. Again, low or very low percentages of public opinion from the four countries addressed here envisage that the EU will become a major world power. Conversely, however, when asked whether they would favour greater cooperation with the EU, a staggering 98% of Chinese and 91% of Russians answered positively, followed by 70% of Brazil- ians, 68% of Indians (with a drop of 15% compared to the previous survey in 2005) and 78% of Americans. While, therefore, the EU is not necessarily regarded by public opinion outside Europe as a global power itself, there is a lot of appetite for enhancing cooper- ation with it. One may sum up these figures by arguing that the EU remains a very attractive partner, but is not perceived as com- manding much authority when it comes to power relations. 21 155 Giovanni Grevi 19. Robert Cooper has stressed the distinction between the \u2018mod- ern\u2019 world of assertive states, based on balance, and the \u2018post- modern\u2019 world of multilateral co- operation, based on openness. See Robert Cooper, The Breaking of Nations (London: Atlantic Books), 2004. 20. Bertelsmann Foundation, \u2018Who Rules the World\u2019, October 2007. 21. These findings, pointing at the support for greater cooperation with the EU, are consistent with the positive perception of the Union emerging from the experts\u2019 contributions collected in Martin Ortega (ed.), \u2018Global views of the European Union\u2019, Chaillot Paper no. 72 (Paris: EUISS, November 2004). At the same time, Ortega noted that external observers were confused by the different voices of the EU and its Member States and that the European experience as such could hardly become a model for other regions of the world. A recent research pro- gramme on the external image of the EU offers a mixed picture as well. In particular, the self-pro- claimed \u2018distinctiveness\u2019 of the EU as an international actor appears less than self-evident in the eyes of third parties. For an overview of this programme and the main conclusions, see Sonia Lucarelli, \u2018The European Union in the Eyes of Others: Towards Filling a Gap in the Literature\u2019, European Foreign Affairs Review , vol. 12, no. 3, 2007.

        "10 The coherence between EU policies and the positions and ini- tiatives of individual Member States is of course crucial to the credibility of strategic partnerships, notably when it comes to for- eign and security policy issues. From this standpoint, while calling for better-defined EU positions, the strategic partners of the Union seem quite comfortable with fostering bilateral deals with large EU countries and pursuing a double-track approach, target- ing at the same time Brussels and national capitals. In some cases, such as the support for the development of the Indian nuclear industry, or the construction of energy transit routes from Russia to the EU, respective partners argue that they can only do business at the Member State level, whether it is a question of legal compe- tences, material resources or required expertise. The fragmented, uneven representation of the EU in multilateral fora complicates the picture further, both from an EU perspective and in the eyes of its partners. 22 In addition, looking at the partnership \u2018market\u2019, what the EU offers (when it is in the position to shape a common policy) is not necessarily what the partners want, and what the EU demands is not necessarily what the partners are willing or able to deliver. Comprehensive partnerships, not always endowed with an ade- quate sense of priority, may also contribute to raising excessive expectations of strategic convergence, and to generating subse- quent disillusion, as Godement notes with a reference to the China arms embargo issue. 23 Moreover, the author points out that China\u2019s demands are not always for positive engagement, but also for the EU to refrain from addressing important domestic issues such as human rights or Tibet. More tensions in the part- nership \u2018market\u2019 may emerge concerning the interaction between the EU and countries such as China, but also Russia and India, in third regions, primarily in Africa and the Middle East. 24 In the case of Russia, the focus on engagement through eco- nomic and regulatory channels clashes with strategic divergence on the \u2018common neighbourhood\u2019 and the hardening of the Russ- ian position on the \u2018transformative\u2019 nature and purpose of EU policies in countries such as Georgia and Ukraine, let alone Russia itself. As Trenin points out, the EU\u2019s assumption that Russia would \u2018not only progressively move toward liberal democracy and the market economy, but in so doing would increasingly accept European norms and regulations codified in the acquis communau- 156 The rise of strategic partnerships: between interdependence and power politics 22.

First, at least potentially, each of the four countries in question is a \u2018strategic partner\u2019 on its own, and can shape both bilateral relationships and regional structures (such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organisa- tion or the IBSA grouping) that do not include the EU. Second, and most importantly, the US appears as the pivotal player, whether the other main actors look at it as a partner or as a com- petitor (or even as a potential threat). The US is a defining global political actor because it remains the only one with respect to which all others define their strategic outlook. Of the countries reviewed here, India has established the most far-reaching part- nership with the US, based on the nuclear deal of March 2006 and also, so the parties highlight, on the strong bond of shared demo- cratic values. In addition, for the US, balancing China in South Asia is a priority. For India, the US is the main external security provider and its friendship offers a stepping stone to great power status. It is interesting to note, however, that, according to Salma Bava, India \u2018does not see itself as a counterweight to China\u2019 and that India\u2019s foreign policy \u2018does not contemplate becoming part of a military alliance.\u2019 25 China allegedly feels closer to the EU\u2019s than to the US\u2019s world- view and tends to downplay the distinctive position of the US in the current international system, arguing that a multipolar world has emerged. 26 Clearly, however, the US is the key player for China when it comes to vital issues such as the Taiwan question, North Korea, the security architecture of East Asia and the Pacific at large, and the security of energy supply routes, among others. Eco- nomic interdependence, and imbalances, make the US-Chinese relationship even more complex, controversial, and decisive. 27 As to Russia, it is not entirely clear that it regards the EU as a strategic partner at all, aside from trade matters. On the other hand, recent statements confirm the primordial importance attached by Rus- sia to the relationship with the US, although that is often framed in antagonistic terms. 28 157 Giovanni Grevi 25.

        "10 Strategic partnerships in the age of interpolarity EU strategic partnerships establish a comprehensive, contractual relationship between the EU and other key global actors. From this standpoint, strategic partnerships could be regarded as an updated version of the EU\u2019s efforts to \u2018domesticate\u2019 international relations, transforming crude power balances into rule-based relation- ships. 29 As such, strategic bilateral partnership and multilateral engagement need not be seen as an alternative. The question is not whether the EU should forego its goal of effective multilateralism to the advantage of bilateral partnerships or whether, conversely, the EU should refrain from deepening these partnerships so as not to weaken multilateral frameworks. Strategic partnerships should rather become important axes of the EU multilateral strategy. With a view to the de facto emergence of new centres of political and economic gravity alongside traditional ones, the challenge will be to mainstream multilateral solutions through bilateral channels, in addition to other frameworks. As noted above, workable multi- lateral solutions can only be formulated on the basis of the inter- ests and priorities of major global actors, and not bypassing or eluding them. The analysis conducted above has shown that the sheer diver- sity of the EU strategic partners, the sometimes unconvincing per- formance of the EU and the mismatch between the priorities of the EU and those of its partners are three major challenges con- fronting this agenda. As to the first point, the heterogeneity of the partners entails a degree of ambivalence in the very notion of strategic partnership. 30 The question is whether this is a problem per se . In building strategic partnerships, a degree of flexibility and also constructive ambiguity is to be expected and is probably indispensable. The political nature of the undertaking entails room for mutual adjustments, concessions and trade-offs, puts a premium on pragmatism and on an incremental approach, and does not lend itself to ideological dogmatism. Also, partnerships are made to last and deliver over the long-term. The bottom line is that these partnerships are strategic because they are necessary for the EU to effectively pursue its goals and spread its norms at the international level. By branding these relations as strategic part- nerships, the EU sends an important, positive and inclusive mes- sage to third parties. Of course, however, there should be no illu- sion that these partnerships prove effective by virtue of calling 158 The rise of strategic partnerships: between interdependence and power politics 29.

        "10 them strategic. There is therefore a need to strike a balance between political expediency and a credible, coherent EU posture towards its partners. For the EU, the second challenge is to become better at setting priorities and enhancing consistency \u2013 both tasks being impor- tant indicators of the EU\u2019s credibility as an international actor. With regard to enhancing consistency among them, one could point out four basic markers of strategic partnerships: a degree of common values and principles; shared interests on vital issues; reciprocity; and multi-level, structured cooperation on a more or less extensive range of technical matters. The EU should make it clear that, short of reciprocity, a partnership cannot be called strategic. Moreover, because of the political and symbolic value attributed to strategic partnerships, the EU should be prepared to adjust its discourse, and make progress conditional, with respect to those relationships that do not reflect strategic convergence at the level of both values and interests. Failing to do so would, in the long-term, undermine the credibility of the EU as a distinctive inter- national actor, not simply taking part in power politics but acting consistently with its normative foundations. Failing to set clear priorities would, on the other hand, under- mine the credibility of the EU as an international actor as such. The very fact of establishing strategic partnerships is evidence that the EU has engaged in selecting its priorities, but more needs to be done. In this context, the third challenge needs to be addressed, namely the mismatch of the priorities of the EU and of its part- ners. As noted above, the Indian nuclear question, market access in relations with China, and the future of the common neighbour- hood with Russia are some of the difficult subjects to be addressed. The EU and its Member States need to prove willing and able to shape common positions on this and other issues, and act with strategic partners accordingly. Priorities, however, look different depending on the time hori- zon and on the scope for cooperation that are envisaged. Over the short term, real or perceived differences may outweigh functional cooperation on distinctive policy areas. In the medium to long- term, however, what unites the EU and its partners is much stronger than what divides them. The respective positions and interests should be put in due per- spective. While it is true that the \u2018new\u2019 global players have rapidly acquired political status and economic clout, it is also clear that 159 Giovanni Grevi ",
        "10 the EU is and will remain a vital partner for them. From a trade standpoint, the EU is the biggest individual partner of the four countries reviewed here. For example, 20% of Indian trade is con- ducted with the EU, while that amounts to less than 2% of EU total trade. Trade with the EU accounts for roughly 55% of Russia\u2019s total, while trade with Russia accounts for 6% of EU exports and 10% of EU imports, over two thirds of which are energy. China\u2019s growth is very much export-led, and the EU is the biggest trading partner with around 20% of China\u2019s external trade. As Feng puts it, \u2018China needs Europe more than Europe needs China.\u2019 31 Brazil hopes to make biofuels into an international commodity, and the EU is set to become possibly the biggest market for that, with little capacity for domestic production. All of these countries crucially need trade and investment with the EU to sustain their economic growth and social development. According to Trenin, over the long-term, Europe may well prove to be Russia\u2019s most attractive partner in this regard. 32 Turning to political and security issues, stability is a core inter- est for all those global players that benefit from economic globali- sation. As they grow richer, countries like China and India are likely to moderate some of their \u2018revisionist\u2019 attitudes and become status quo -oriented powers, although the status quo will need to be adjusted to include them in the first place. Russia is no less inter- ested than the EU and the US in preventing a threatening Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. China is as keen as the EU and the US on ensuring that commercial maritime routes in the Gulf and the Indian Ocean are kept safe. The sustainable development of Africa is in the interest of China too, not least to secure its long- term investments, and awareness of that is growing. Brazil and India share a strong commitment to global peace and stability and a readiness to \u2018put their troops where their mouth is\u2019 to support UN peacekeeping operations. Trans-national terrorism and organised crime are clearly common challenges for the EU and its partners. Potentially the biggest challenge to the well-being and the secu- rity of the citizens of the EU and of its partners, as well as of the world at large, lies in the impact of climate change and human- generated pollution. 33 Overcrowded regions and developing countries deprived of natural resources are particularly exposed. The consequences of pollution and climate change are already 160 The rise of strategic partnerships: between interdependence and power politics 31. See Feng, p. 85. 32. See Trenin, p. 143. 33.

        "10 dramatic in China and India, but will affect all global actors in different ways. 34 Climate change is a good instance of what could be defined a double layer of inter-dependence: between countries and between policies. The impact of the economic development of countries like China and India, among others, on the growth of global CO 2 emissions over the next two decades has been under- lined above. On the other hand, energy, environmental and trans- port policies, trade and development policy, but also technologi- cal innovation, urban planning and civil protection interact in addressing climate-related challenges. Strategic partnerships need to encompass a growing range of policy areas in order to tackle strategic priorities. Interdependence is not new but, by all measures, it will grow in the future. Structural inter-dependence will inevitably impact on the international political system. Under these conditions, emerg- ing multipolarity could evolve in different ways, ranging from hostile confrontation to multilateral cooperation. It is clearly in the interest of the EU to defuse the tensions inherent in multi- polarity, and build the case for multilateral cooperation. In this perspective, a change of narrative would be in order. The concept of \u2018interpolarity\u2019 \u2013 that is, multipolarity in the age of inter- dependence \u2013 seems helpful both to describe important features of the current international system and to outline a vision of future developments. Interpolarity captures and acknowledges the progressive redistribution of power at the global level but highlights that power need not be used to compete but rather to cooperate. In a multipolar system, different poles balance each other and compete for scarce resources. In an interpolar system, poles co- operate to share the advantages of globalisation, set fair ground rules for competition, and confront common challenges. In a multipolar system, the focus is on the relative resources and capa- bilities of different actors. In an interpolar system, the accent shifts to the leadership and the ability of key players to engage in cooperation. The more influential an actor is, the more that actor takes a stake in establishing a multilateral system that delivers results. From an EU standpoint, \u2018poles\u2019 matter not in order to counter-balance each other, but to provide strong political invest- ment and resources for cooperation. An interpolar system and a multilateral order are compatible and mutually reinforcing. 161 Giovanni Grevi 34. On the impact of climate change on China, see Elizabeth C.

        "10 The building blocks of strategic partnerships Strategic partnerships should be regarded as one key instrument to move from multipolarity to interpolarity, enhancing the EU ambi- tion to strengthen effective multilateralism. The chapters featured in this Chaillot Paper provide a number of insights and stimulate reflection in the most relevant, and often promising, areas for con- crete cooperation between the EU and its strategic partners. While not aiming to provide comprehensive coverage, some issues are outlined below and grouped in five main clusters: global and regional governance; non-proliferation; crisis management; Africa\u2019s stability and development; and energy and climate change. Global and regional governance The EU and its partners share, at least in principle, a commitment to make the UN work and sustain its role as the key actor for main- taining international peace and security. However, two of the EU\u2019s partners are permanent members of the UNSC \u2013 Russia and China \u2013 and two are not, but are eager to become members \u2013 India and Brazil. The question of the reform of the UNSC is squarely on the table and will not go away, but will only become more pressing. In fact, as well as with the reform of other multilateral institutions, there is a need to strike a balance between inclusiveness and effi- ciency or, in other words, between legitimacy and credibility. The dialogue between the major stakeholders of globalisation should address this issue with renewed conviction. The EU will have to per- form much better than it did in the run-up to the summit of 2005, when it could not arrive at a coherent position on the number one issue \u2013 the size and composition of the Security Council. The coop- eration between the EU, its Member States, and its global partners will also be crucial in determining the success or failure of new bod- ies such as the Peacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights Council. At the same time, the EU, its Member States and its partners should work for a deepening and rationalisation of the various networks that have sprung up at the global level since the G7 (now G8) was set up back in 1975. 35 \u2018Generalist\u2019 networks such as the G8 have already informally involved emerging powers in their pro- ceedings. Ad hoc networks at the political and at the technical level 162 The rise of strategic partnerships: between interdependence and power politics 35.

        "10 can be helpful in focusing minds and targeting concrete problems such as specific resource issues, aspects of non-proliferation, tech- nology transfers, setting common standards, or better regulating financial transactions. The challenge will lie in deciding together where to invest political and financial resources, what networks are not essential, and how to get these networks to work in a more coherent manner. One idea could be to give responsibility for driv- ing each network to one of its major members or to the secretariat of relevant international organisations. Importantly, these net- works should be fostered in such a way as to strengthen and not undermine the existing institutions of global governance, notably those belonging to the UN family. Various authors have stressed that the regional dimension of bilateral partnerships is to be pursued at all times, which is consis- tent with the traditional EU commitment to support regional integration and inter-regional cooperation. However, factoring the regional dimension into strategic relationships is not the same as supporting regional integration and inter-regional cooperation per se. This is an important difference when exploring the roles that the EU and its partners can play in shaping governance at the regional level. The link between strategic partnership, regional integration and inter-regional dialogue is of particular relevance in the case of Brazil, with the envisaged Association Agreement between the EU and MERCOSUR. 36 When it comes to South and East Asia, where various regional frameworks are developing and overlapping, the EU is mainly perceived as the provider of experience and know- how in setting up institutions and important policy programmes. This provides considerable scope for \u2018triangular\u2019 cooperation between the EU, its strategic partners, and relevant regional bod- ies. In the Eurasian space, regionalism is less developed but various regional organisations and strategies co-exist, including for exam- ple the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, EURASEC, GUAM and the recent Black Sea Synergy. For the EU, Russia and also China, it will be important to ensure that regional initiatives in such a sensitive geopolitical space prove interlocking and not inter-blocking, including in managing crises and supporting fragile states. Strategic partnerships should help develop regional and inter-regional cooperation, and not bypass or neglect this level of governance. 163 Giovanni Grevi 36. See Garcia, pp. 49-52. ",
        "10 Non-proliferation Avoiding the proliferation of WMD is a priority for the EU and all its strategic partners. This is therefore an important test case of interpolarity, and effective multilateralism. Major powers should enhance their cooperation in consolidating common rules and credible frameworks for monitoring and implementation, with a focus on nuclear proliferation. One specific, and defining, instance of this cooperation is the commitment to prevent Iran from acquir- ing nuclear weapons. So far, although with different accents and considerable tensions, all major global actors have cooperated to achieve a peaceful resolution of the Iranian issue both in the UN and in the IAEA. This is all the more remarkable, considering the strong interest of, among others, China and India in energy and trade deals with Iran, as well as Russia\u2019s dealings with this country, including in the armaments\u2019 field. All EU partners show an interest in the various solutions put forward to shape a multilateral mechanism for ura- nium enrichment and supply to those countries needing it for civilian purposes. More needs to be done, however, and the engagement of countries like Russia and China on this front should be regarded as evidence of strategic convergence \u2013 or not, as the case may be \u2013 with the EU. The Indo-American deal on a strategic partnership, including the provision of nuclear technology and also nuclear fuel in exchange for stronger supervision by the IAEA, challenges both the EU and India to find common ground. There is a need to rec- oncile bilateral strategic partnerships and support to multilateral frameworks, such as the NPT, of which India is not a part. The ambiguity between the EU support for the NPT regime and the position of some of its Member States on the Indian nuclear dossier needs to be addressed, so as to strengthen both effective multilateralism and the credibility of the EU as an international actor. With a strong nuclear civil industry and large reserves of uranium, Brazil will be an important partner of the EU in sup- porting the reform of the NPT, devising new arrangements for making nuclear civil technology available, and strengthening the disarmament regimes. At the same time, the EU is confronted with the weakening of disarmament regimes in Europe itself, following the US with- drawal from the ABM Treaty in 2002, the US plans to deploy a new BMD system in Poland and the Czech Republic, the Russian with- 164 The rise of strategic partnerships: between interdependence and power politics ",
        "10 drawal from the CFE Treaty in 2007 and the debate in Russia on withdrawing from the INF Treaty, which could even unleash a new arms race. Although the EU is not the main interlocutor on these matters, notably in the eyes of Russia, they should not be beyond the reach of the EU as a political actor and a strategic partner. It is in the interest of the EU to support constructive negotiations on armaments reductions between the US and Russia, as well as joint programmes to defend all the partners from common threats. A sustained dialogue on armaments control and reduction could also engender a positive spill-over effect when it comes to dealing with the EU/Russia common neighbourhood. Crisis management State failure, civil wars and post-conflict stabilisation challenge in a more or less direct fashion all major global players. However, the threat assessment, and corresponding response, changes consider- ably from one to the other. That also depends on the perception of the respective spheres of influence and of vital interests, and on the interpretation of the prevailing norms on the use of force. The EU and its partners may not always share the same assessment of the threats and of the normative basis for intervention. In some cases, such as the protracted conflicts in Moldova and Georgia, as well as the Kosovo question, the EU and Russia even pursue countervail- ing strategies. However, when they engage in peacekeeping or crisis-management, all major powers are confronted with pretty much the same range of problems, and require a comprehensive approach to address them. This is all the more the case when they engage in a multilateral framework and in peacebuilding efforts. From this standpoint, the contribution of all the EU strategic part- ners is on the rise. Of the four countries reviewed here, India is the largest con- tributor of troops to UN peacekeeping operations in both absolute and relative terms. With 9,316 military and police per- sonnel serving under UN flags, India by far outranks China (1,819), Brazil (1,280) and Russia (290). Things look quite differ- ent, however, in terms of financial contributions to the UN peace- keeping budget. Russia and China provide around 61 million dol- lars each, whereas Brazil 17.8 and India only 4.6. 37 In the case of China and Brazil, one can observe growing interest in involvement in multilateral peacekeeping under the UN framework, with 165 Giovanni Grevi 37.

India and the EU have, on the other hand, developed consultation on dealing with political turmoil in Nepal and Sri Lanka, although very little cooperation took place in the case of the recent repres- sion of opposition movements in Burma/Myanmar. International crisis management is a domain where strategic partnerships and effective multilateralism could become mutu- ally reinforcing. Cooperation between the EU and its partners can take place at different levels. First of all, one should build on the so far limited experience of joint training and also joint exercises to enhance these exchanges and also share respective experiences and lessons learned. In this context, the interesting example of the EU- India Dialogue on \u2018Asian, European and African Policies, Practices and Lessons Learned in Peace Operations in Africa: DR Congo, Sudan and the Darfur Conflict\u2019, which took place in June 2007 in Delhi, paves the way for new initiatives. Also, the launching of a new programme of the European Security and Defence College, involving the military and police personnel of EU partners taking part in multilateral crisis management, might be considered. The EU experience is relevant not only when it comes to military crisis management but also with respect to the civilian dimension of policing, institution building and security sector reform, and in devising a comprehensive approach that involves all relevant agen- cies. Countries like Brazil and India seem particularly interested in these distinctive features of the EU crisis management culture, which also fits the concept of integrated mission in the UN con- text. Stronger mechanisms could also be set up under each partner- ship to consult at an early stage, when crises emerge, and seek to facilitate the definition of a common position, or at least a com- patible approach. These dialogues could well take place on a more regular basis at the level of UN Headquarters in New York, involv- ing both the EU and some of its Member States. At a more funda- mental level, however, the EU and its partners need to tackle the core question of the legitimacy and legality of international inter- vention, with a focus on humanitarian intervention and the con- cept of responsibility to protect and to prevent. These are very con- tentious issues in EU relations with Russia, China and also India but, if not addressed, strategic divergence on the use of force for 166 The rise of strategic partnerships: between interdependence and power politics ",
        "10 humanitarian purposes may grow. That would seriously under- mine not only the EU strategic partnerships, but also the role of the UNSC. Development and Stability in Africa The record of cooperation between the EU and other global actors in supporting Africa\u2019s development and stability should be taken as an important indicator, among others, of the credibility of strategic partnerships. So far, the balance is mixed, but that is to be expected in a time of systemic change, when emerging powers such as China and India are targeting Africa\u2019s natural resources and boosting their trade with the continent. Africa provides 30% of Chi- nese oil imports, and 25% of India\u2019s. In future, however, the conver- gence between the EU and its partners should be enhanced across a wide range of policy areas, from crisis management to development and economic assistance. That also includes the support to Africa\u2019s regional and sub-regional organisations, chiefly the African Union. In security terms, ongoing conflicts and post-conflict theatres provide much scope for cooperation between the EU and its part- ners, but also for potential friction. India is already a major provider of security to Africa through its involvement in UN mis- sions and, most notably, MONUC in DRC. In October 2006, three quarters of the military forces under the UN flag were deployed in Africa, and more than half of them came from India, Bangladesh and Pakistan. These countries also provide the bulk of the force in Liberia, Sudan and Ivory Coast. 38 In addition, as illustrated by Wagner, India has multiplied its links with African institutions and also with South Africa as a strategic partner. The two coun- tries have established the IOR-ARC and, together with Brazil, they launched the IBSA initiative. While relatively less engaged in the African continent, Brazil shows an interest in exploring ways to contribute to peace and stability in the region, in cooperation with the EU and other multilateral frameworks. China\u2019s growing presence in Africa has been the subject of increasing concern in Europe, principally because of the sheer size and speed of this phenomenon. Starting from a little over 10 bil- lion dollars in 2000, bilateral China-Africa trade has reached 55 billion dollars in 2006 and is expected to reach the 100 billion threshold by 2010. The EU is still Africa\u2019s largest single trade part- 167 Giovanni Grevi 38. \u2018Global Statistics on UN mis- sions\u2019, in Center on International Cooperation, Annual Review of Global Peace Operations 2007 , (Boulder, CO: Lynne Rienner Pub- lishers, 2007).

This is particularly the case when it comes to countries such as Sudan and Zimbabwe. The fact that the policies of one strategic partner undermine the approach to aid and political conditionality of the other is at the least problematic. More specifically, the management of the Darfur crisis and the willingness to exert joint pressure on the Sudanese government to ensure the smooth running of UN and EU humanitarian missions in, respectively, Darfur and Chad, will be a key test for the partnership between the EU and China, in sup- port of effective multilateralism and of an harmonious world. Far from being simply the platform for more or less fair com- petition, Africa is shaping up to take more responsibility for its own future, and ownership of political and economic reform. The EU and its strategic partners should join efforts to support this momentum and to strengthen fledgling regional structures in Africa. Dialogues at variable geometries can be envisaged to foster cooperation, for example trilateral fora involving the AU, the EU and countries such as China, India or Brazil. Accordingly, the EU invited China to attend the EU-Africa summit of December 2007, and China has showed openness to explore ways for cooperation with the European Commissioner for Development. Concrete areas for joint initiatives range from infrastructure development to support to Africa\u2019s small and medium-sized enterprises, while the protection of investments and of nationals abroad is of com- mon interest. Much more, however, needs to be done. These dialogues should not become occasional displays of goodwill and should not only pick and choose convenient issues, but also address the difficult ones. Cooperation will entail adjustments on the sides of all part- ners, including the EU, and not lecturing one another. Essentially, it is a question of changing the mindset of key stakeholders from a logic of possession and unbound competition to a logic of sus- tainable development and regulated competition \u2013 a win-win situ- ation. In this context, the deepening of strategic partnerships, the deepening of regional integration in Africa, and the strengthening of multilateralism could prove mutually reinforcing. 168 The rise of strategic partnerships: between interdependence and power politics 39.

        "10 Energy and climate change The related issues of energy security, energy efficiency, and climate change will be at the core of the international agenda for decades to come. All the contributors to this Chaillot Paper see them as the basis for much constructive cooperation between the EU and its strate- gic partners, while stressing the different interests and perceptions of the main global players. Ensuring the security of supply and the security of demand tops the agenda of, respectively, big energy importers and exporters. As a result, their priorities may prove more or less compatible depending on different regions and differ- ent energy sources. What is certain, however, is that their interests are intertwined. As noted above, Russia is a major exporter of oil and gas, is nowhere close to topping its emission ceilings under the Kyoto framework, which it is a part of, and does not share a sense of urgency in addressing the implications of climate change, although it is surely not exempt from them. China and India, on the other hand, are large energy-importing countries, have hugely inefficient energy sectors, contribute massively to the rise in greenhouse gas emissions, and very much suffer from the impact of both pollution and climate change. Brazil is self-sufficient energy-wise, aims to establish itself as a leading exporter of ethanol and biofuels (and, potentially, oil), and is reluctant to accept binding ceilings on CO 2 emissions under the post-Kyoto regime. Given the global nature of these challenges and of their impli- cations, strategic partnerships are only one tool among many to address them effectively. Nevertheless, the EU should use them to channel policy innovation, and to persuade its partners that mul- tilateral, albeit differentiated, solutions at the global level are a pri- ority for all. In this context, three issues stand out. First, technology transfers and industrial partnerships with China and India to improve energy efficiency and invest in renew- able sources. In particular, clean coal technologies are a priority in countries where coal will remain the main source of power pro- duction for decades. In China, these partnerships should target the regional level, where provinces are lagging behind in imple- menting the ambitious environmental strategy of the central gov- ernment. In so far as electricity production is concerned, compe- tence lies in India with individual states, which need much assistance in developing both infrastructure and regulatory 169 Giovanni Grevi ",
        "10 frameworks. With a view to cooperation with both China and India, a change of gear is suggested by the contributors to this vol- ume, whereby commercial joint ventures, industrial partnerships and public-private partnerships would replace the development assistance template. Second, and related to all this, access to the energy market and infrastructure should be achieved, on the basis of reciprocity, with countries such as Russia and China. In the case of Russia, the lib- eralisation of the energy market is regarded as very much in the interest of both partners, not least to allow European investment to upgrade ailing Russian infrastructure and to jointly explore new fields in remote areas. To improve the quality and trans- parency of the energy dialogue, negotiations on specific aspects of the Transit Protocol of the Energy Charter could be pursued in the wider context of the negotiations of the follow up to the PCA. The bottom line is that, for the foreseeable future, the EU and Russia will be tightly interdependent in energy matters. This should be considered as an opportunity to work together, and not a source of power-struggles. All the more so given the non-existence of a seri- ous Russian environmental strategy and Russia\u2019s emphasis on coal to sustain growing domestic demand up to 2020. Cooperat- ing with the EU in devising a sustainable energy strategy is very much in the interest of Russia. Third, work should continue between the EU, Brazil, and other major producers of biofuels such as the US, to achieve interna- tionally recognised standards. The latter should take into account two primary objectives, namely that the production of biofuels should consume less energy than is saved by using them, and that it is environmentally sustainable, at a time of rising food prices and shrinking arable land. Close cooperation on these matters in the context of the International Biofuels Forum, which also includes China, India and South Africa, is an example of the norm- setting potential of strategic partnerships. Conclusion The EU strategic partnerships with Brazil, China, India and Russia are very much work in progress. Looking back to 2003, when the ESS made a cursory reference to the need to work with partners, a lot has been achieved. The EU has put a particular effort into 170 The rise of strategic partnerships: between interdependence and power politics ",
        "10 enhancing the political visibility of strategic partnerships, and in establishing a dense web of networks at all levels, from dialogues on detailed technical issues to annual, or bi-annual, summit meetings. In policy terms, economic, trade, energy, environmental and also development issues have dominated the agenda, although with a different focus depending on the partner in question. Much progress is yet to be made in managing cooperation in these domains. This is all the more important considering the political salience that relations with key partners have taken on at the domestic level in EU Member States, whether one looks at the trade deficit with China or at energy dealings with Russia. The for- eign and security policy dimension of these partnerships is, in con- trast, still in its infancy. The changing global landscape, however, calls for a stronger engagement of the EU and its partners at that level too. The key point that emerges from this analysis is that the EU is at the crossroads of countervailing trends. On the one hand, inter- dependence, which requires a comprehensive approach to strate- gic partnerships and a strong investment in multilateral frame- works. On the other hand, the growing scope for power politics among major state actors with a clear sense of national interest and little intention to share sovereignty along the lines of the European model. From a foreign and security policy perspective, therefore, deploying the EU \u2018structural\u2019 power across a number of policy areas does not easily translate into political leverage. While some- times blurred in the eyes of the EU, the difference between so- called high politics (foreign policy, security and defence) and low politics (economy, trade, environment) is still quite \u2018clear-cut\u2019 in the eyes of its partners, although less so in the case of Brazil. The analyses collected in this Chaillot Paper , however, show that no vital issues divide the EU and its partners over the long term. When considering, for example, energy security, threats may stem from the mismanagement of the relations between consumers and suppliers, or from unconstrained competition for resources. Nevertheless, they are not inherent to the energy question, which can be managed through cooperation to all parties\u2019 mutual advan- tage. On the contrary, vital threats such as the proliferation of WMD, associated with trans-national terrorism, and the chal- lenge of climate change unite major global actors, both in the short and in the long term. The EU and its Member States should 171 Giovanni Grevi ",
        "10 make a determined, joint political investment to highlight the scope for cooperation and sustain the convergence of mutual per- ceptions, showing a united front. A clear definition of the Euro- pean interests and a clear statement of the values informing the European approach are a precondition for entering productive negotiations. The EU is not in the business of balancing or bandwagoning other powers and that should be clearly understood by its part- ners. Instead, the EU should take the lead in filling the gap between interdependence and power politics, engaging old and new global players in the management of common challenges through multilateral frameworks. To this end, strategic partner- ships can play an important role. The EU should not renounce the comprehensive template of its strategic partnerships. That is the interface between partner- ships and interdependence. The EU should rather enhance its abil- ity to define common positions on sensitive issues, including for- eign and security policy matters, as a basis for negotiation. That is the interface between partnerships and power politics. As strategic partnerships deepen, the divide between interdependence and power politics narrows. By investing in strategic partnerships and, crucially, in its ability to perform as a global actor, the EU trans- forms multipolarity into interpolarity, and paves the way towards effective multilateralism. 172 The rise of strategic partnerships: between interdependence and power politics ",

It is in the interest of the European Union to engage established and aspiring global powers in a sustained dialogue on how to confront pressing common challenges. This Chaillot Paper addresses the strategic partnerships that the EU seeks to set up with four important actors, whose ascent is changing traditional patterns of power and gov- ernance: Brazil, China, India and Russia. These partner- ships, among other instruments, can play a critical role in reconciling multilateral governance and emerging multi- polarity. As emerging powers take centre stage in international economic, political and security affairs, norms and insti- tutions are contested and different worldviews co-exist uneasily. Over the next ten years, the priorities and the decisions of major global and regional powers will define the scope for cooperation and highlight the sources of competition and conflict. The purpose of this Chaillot Paper is to identify areas of concrete cooperation between the EU and its respective partners, drawing from the viewpoints of both parties. This positive agenda should help pave the way towards effective multilateral frameworks and solutions, which include both old and new global powers, thereby further- ing the strategic objectives of the EU.
