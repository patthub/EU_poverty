        "0 2 News review of the IEE programme, N\u00b02 - September 2007 - page \u0018 E D I T O R I A L Dear reader, Welcome back after the summer break! September is usually a busy month, and this is particularly true if you are working hard to get an IEE project proposal ready for the 28 September deadline. If you missed this opportunity to apply for IEE funding there will be another chance in early 2008. We expect to publish the next call for project proposals in January 2008 and to organise an information day during the second EU Sustainable Energy Week in Brussels on 31 January - make a note in your diary! As far as our own agency is concerned things are also moving fast. In May we were given a new name \u2013 we are now called the Executive Agency for Competitiveness and Innovation, or simply EACI \u2013 and we have now a wider remit to manage not only the IEE programme but also additional EU programmes and initiatives. This is good news, because it allows us to build better links between Intelligent Energy \u2013 Europe and the new programmes. You can find more information on the following pages. Europe is facing climate change and rising oil prices, and intelligent energy remains high on the agenda. In this News Review we have chosen to put the spotlight on transport, an energy-devouring activity where change is badly needed. Perhaps the new approaches developed by the projects presented on pages 4 and 5, combined with the thrust of the EU Sustainable Mobility Week in September, can help change things in your city? Thank you for your interest and involvement in the IEE programme. Best regards, Patrick Lambert Director of the Executive Agency for Competitiveness and Innovation (EACI) IEEA_02.indd 1 5/09/07 9:33:17 ",
        "intelligent energy newsreview 02 News review of the IEE programme, N\u00b02 - September 2007 - page 2 Just when most of us had got used to the \u201cIEEA\u201d, the executive agency which has managed the IEE programme since mid-2005 has changed its name. It is now called EACI \u2013 the Executive Agency for Competitiveness and Innovation. Does this name change have anything to do with the EU\u2019s Competitiveness and Innovation (CIP) programme, the new framework for IEE? Indeed it does. The positive experience with the \u201cold\u201d IEEA encouraged the European Commission to delegate additional tasks to the agency and modify its name to reflect its new remit. In addition to the IEE programme, the EACI will from 2008 manage the European Commission\u2019s SME support network and eco-innovation initiatives, both part of the CIP framework, and the Marco Polo programme. While the new tasks and name of the agency are now defined, the EACI still needs to prepare for its extended responsibilities. Four new units will be added to the three existing ones, increasing the agency staff from 46 during \u201cIEE only\u201d times to some 150 by mid-2008. So what does this mean for the management of the IEE programme? There will be no dramatic changes, but rather new opportunities. The two units currently in charge of the IEE will continue their work and put their knowledge and skills at the service of the IEE programme as in the past. And the IEE programme will keep its identity and profile. At the same time, there will now be the opportunity to link up the different CIP elements and the Marco Polo programme to one another, and to use the extended outreach of the EACI to increase their impact. > ec.europa.eu/energy/intelligent/contact/national_en.htm IEE national contact points \u2013 support at your fingertips Do you know your National Contact Point for the Intelligent Energy - Europe programme?

Encouraged by the success of the first EU Sustainable Energy Week event at the beginning of this year, work has now begun on EUSEW 2008, the second EU Sustainable Energy Week. Organised by the European Commission\u2019s Directorate-General for Energy and Transport, other European institutions and major stakeholders, EUSEW 2008 will be the key meeting place for anyone interested in sustainable energy issues in Europe. It will take place from 28 January to 1 February 2008 and is expected to bring together more than 8,000 participants and 50 international sustainable energy conferences, workshops, seminars and media events both in Brussels and other cities across Europe. This time, the events organised in Brussels will be grouped by theme \u2013 such as energy policy, renewables, buildings, energy efficiency, and transport - so that participants can choose to stay just for the day and pick the theme most relevant to them. Make a note in your diaries now! You can obtain more details and register for the EU Sustainable Energy Week from 1 October 2007 on www.eusew.eu, and you can already create your own online account to receive regular information and updates. Press packs, media facilities, interview opportunities and special media assistance will be provided for journalists in Brussels, and on-the-spot camera teams will provide authentic footage as the week unfolds. > Online videos and DVD order instructions: http://ec.europa.eu/energy/intelligent/library/videos_en.htm New IEE video report: Europe\u2019s children learn to fight climate change More and more schools across Europe offer education on \u201csmart energy\u201d to help young Europeans play an active role in their own energy-intelligent future, and to tackle climate change. Our new video report shows how local experts and teachers involved in the IEE-supported FEEDU project run fun and informative classes on energy saving and renewables in Slovenia, the UK and Belgium. The video was released at the IEE European Info Day on 19 April 2007 and made available to TV journalists free of charge and copyright. Only 10 weeks after release at least 4 million people have seen the video during 20 TV broadcasts in 10 countries. DVD copies are also available and can be ordered from the EACI. The video exists in English, French, German, Italian, Polish and Spanish. Other IEE video reports are currently being developed on local biofuel production, sustainable cooling in buildings, and cycling projects in cities. > http://ec.europa.eu/energy/intelligent/ events/meetings_en.htm Meeting for IEE-supported biofuels projects in Brussels A meeting involving the co-ordinators of the 17 IEE-supported projects on biofuels was held in Brussels on 10-11 July 2007, with the participation of staff from EACI and the European Commission\u2019s Energy and Transport Directorate-General. This was an occasion for participants to provide feedback from their projects to the European Commission and to exchange experiences and ideas with people working on similar projects and facing the same issues. It emerged that participants considered the development of European standards and sustainability criteria for biofuels a priority for the sector, and it was felt that improved transparency and coherent national support schemes would also help develop the market. Greater co-operation was also the watchword as far as the management of the projects themselves was concerned. The participating co-ordinators planned to improve connections between their projects and to develop the potential for common initiatives. All participants expressed their appreciation of the opportunity to meet and indicated that they found it a useful chance to build stronger links. Don\u2019t miss this EUSEW event: the EACI plans to organise the IEE European Info Day 2008 on Thursday 31 January. The Info Day will inform you about how to apply for IEE funding under the 2008 call for proposals, but will also show off the programme\u2019s achievements to date. A scene from the new IEE video on energy education in schools: as part of their \u201csmart energy\u201d classes, children in Slovenia have set up \u2018Eko Stops\u2019 on the road outside of their school, where they and their teachers inform commuters of the need to car share.

Around 1 300 cities took part last year, and every year the number is growing. The need to improve our urban mobility systems and cultures is evident. Transport plays a central role in the economy and our daily lives. Yet it also uses almost 20% of all primary energy consumed in Europe, and is extremely dependent on oil. Heavy car and truck use in city centres is a source of noise, pollution and serious accidents. It also reduces everybody\u2019s public space. Cities with fewer cars mean better quality of life \u2013 we will see this again when cyclists and pedestrians take to the streets on 22 September, the European Car Free Day. The Intelligent Energy \u2013 Europe programme funds a number of projects which help transport in Europe\u2019s cities to become more energy intelligent and cleaner. Here are two examples. Better cycling policies in cities and regions: BYPAD European Mobility Week claims the streets for the people on 16 - 22 September > European Mobility Week takes to the streets on 16-22 September. In the spotlight: smart urban transport Bicycle-friendly cities and regions are the result of careful analysis, systematic planning and a coherent long-term policy. Does your region or city have a sound cycling policy in place? And if not, what can be learned from others\u2019 experiences? The \u201cBicycle Policy Audit\u201d, or simply BYPAD, is a powerful tool in this respect. It considers cycling policy to be a dynamic process and uses total quality management methods to manage it. An audit includes nine different elements which together ensure that a city or region has a high quality policy providing optimum conditions for cycling. With the help of IEE funding, the BYPAD team has trained and certified 34 auditors from 20 different European countries to assist local and regional authorities in applying the BYPAD toolbox and undertaking their own bicycle policy audit. More than 100 cities and regions have taken part so far. How does BYPAD work in practice? It is essential for the success of the scheme that local politicians, planners and cyclists take an active role in the evaluation and improvement of cycling policy, for instance by completing a questionnaire and by discussing the strengths and weaknesses of their local cycling policy. This analysis is moderated by a BYPAD certified auditor. He or she helps identify I N T E L L I G E N T E N E R G Y \u2212 E U R O P E I I and then carry out the most efficient ways of improving the local cycling system. The BYPAD project functions at the same time as a network for regular exchange between European cycling policy officials and experts. The BYPAD team is currently organising 12 regional BYPAD workshops in various European countries. It also organised an international BYPAD seminar during the Velo-City conference in Munich, Germany, in June 2007- a big success which brought about even greater interest and more participants in the scheme. All cities and regions participating in BYPAD can be found on the project webpage, which also provides a database with good examples of cycling policy. Finally, a list of national contacts helps your city or region to join this initiative and find a BYPAD auditor.

But its \u201cDriving Slower Goes Faster\u201d scheme has spearheaded a new urban mobility model which other cities may well copy in the future. Hilversum\u2019s transport planners have designed streets and junctions which aim to slow down traffic but at the same time make it more fluid. The effect may come as a surprise to many. Lots of cyclists and pedestrians are able to share the road space with cars, yet the cars still get from A to B quicker. Other good examples of smart urban design for energy intelligent transport and \u201cstreets for people\u201d are to be found in the Swedish capital and Slovakia\u2019s Trnava, where smart urban planning helped boost public transport use (Stockholm) and to reduce demand for transport altogether by locating facilities closer to each other (Trnava). SNOWBALL is a European initiative to implement clever urban planning and design strategies. Co-ordinated by Dutch transport consultancy Goudappel Coffeng, a team of eight partners is working together to spread the lessons learned in Hilversum, Stockholm and Trnava to Martin and Zvolen (Slovakia), San Fernando de Henares and San Sebastian (Spain), Verona (Italy) and Ludwigsburg (Germany). As a direct outcome, less energy will be consumed on transport in these cities, which at the same time will become healthier and more liveable places. The long-term ambition is to attract more cities and help them copy these successful models \u2013 hence a snowball effect. The key to success lies in creating better links between those responsible for transport planning and urban planning. Usually, these two tasks are being dealt with by different departments which have little contact with each other. Diverging perceptions and planning cultures ultimately result in urban designs which make smart mobility difficult. The SNOWBALL team is addressing these shortcomings and changing working procedures and planning methods in the six target cities. Best practice examples and a planning toolkit are available on the project website. Team members are now setting up national support networks for clever design strategies - please contact them if you want to take part!

The guidelines cover the essential steps of the certification process and are available in 11 European languages. All EU Member States are currently developing certification systems to comply with rules set in the European Buildings Directive. The IMPACT guidelines are the result of thorough testing of the certification methods developed in Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Spain, and Netherlands. This testing phase influenced the implementation process of the Buildings Directive in the six countries covered. Mr Frank Zegers Ecofys Netherlands B.V. Netherlands +31 (0) 30 2808 313 F.Zegers@ecofys.nl www.e-impact.org > Optimising the energy performance of buildings Depending on national legislation an energy performance certificate may be valid for up to 10 years. Once completed, buildings are usually not evaluated continuously to make sure that their actual operation is as energy-efficient as possible. The BUILDING EQ project tries to fill this gap by combining energy certification with a continuous building optimisation process. Initial steps towards this objective were taken at a recent project meeting in Finland where the team agreed a common method, the type of energy data to be continuously checked, and ways of using their methodology in different countries. During the next six months, the project team will certify and prepare 12 demonstration buildings - including offices, educational buildings and hospitals - to test their approach.

Purchasing decisions are often based on initial costs. However, costs throughout the lifetime of a piece of equipment are very different due to energy efficiency in particular. For instance, all- electric injection moulding machines are typically more expensive to buy than hydraulic machines, but over the entire lifetime are substantially less expensive to own and run due to better energy performance. The RECIPE \u2018Cost of Ownership Model\u2019 enables processors to calculate the cost of operating a piece of equipment over its projected lifetime, based on energy efficiency and projected usage. Reports show comparisons of the lifetime costs of different machines as well as the differences in cost when producing a specific part.

Cooling with the help of the sun? It works better than you would think. For more than a decade now solar air-conditioning technologies have proven their efficiency and reliability. And it is eminently smart, because the need for air-conditioning coincides with the summer\u2019s abundant sunshine. So there is a compelling case for the launch of the SOLAIR project, which will specifically promote the wider use of solar air-conditioning in residential and commercial buildings. The project website is now online. It will present good practice in the area of absorption chillers, which are most commonly used, as well as the more novel and innovative adsorption chillers and desiccant cooling systems.

Intelligent Energy \u2013 Europe (IEE) is the European Union\u2019s programme for promoting energy efficiency and renewables. It supports international projects and local/regional energy agencies which promote the smarter use of energy and the increasing exploitation of renewable energy sources. The IEE programme is implemented by the EACI in close co-operation with the Commission\u2019s Directorate-General for Energy and Transport (DG TREN). With more than 40 staff, the EACI is at the service of all IEE partners by managing the different projects and events funded under the IEE programme, and by imparting the technical expertise and best practices which they develop. More details on the IEE programme can be found at ec.europa.eu/energy/intelligent/index_en.html. \u00a9 European Communities & Executive Agency for Competitiveness and Innovation, 2007 Editorial information I N T E L L I G E N T E N E R G Y \u2212 E U R O P E I I IEEA_02.indd 21 5/09/07 9:35:04 ",
