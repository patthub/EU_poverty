        "Eurydice Policy Brief, Early Childhood Education and Care 3 Importance of ECEC? A t a time of unprecedented economic and social challenges, the importance of giving all our children a solid start in life by providing high quality early childhood education and care (ECEC) is crucial. Th e extensive benefi ts that high quality early childhood education and care brings have been widely acknowledged, ranging from economic advantages for society as a whole to better outcomes for individuals in schools. Th e results of international skill surveys (PISA (OECD) and PIRLS (IEA)) report that children and teenagers perform better in reading and mathematics if they have attended ECEC. Research also indicates that providing high quality ECEC may help reduce future public spending on welfare, health and even justice. By laying strong foundations for successful lifelong learning, high quality ECEC brings personal benefi ts to children, particularly to those from disadvantaged backgrounds. ECEC is therefore a cornerstone for building better and more equitable education systems. In support of evidence-based policy-making, Eurydice has published Key Data on Early Childhood Education and Care in Europe \u2013 2014 in cooperation with Eurostat. Th e report covers 32 European countries \u2013 including all EU Member States except the Netherlands, plus Switzerland, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Turkey. Th e reference year for all national policy data is 2012/13. Th is policy briefi ng gives an overview of the key fi ndings on ECEC that emerge from the report. It focuses on the most important challenges on which policy makers can have a direct infl uence (see Figure 1). Short case studies provide a glimpse into some of the ways policy-makers across Europe are meeting these challenges. De(cid:2) nition of early childhood education and care (ECEC) Provision for children from birth through to primary education that is subject to a national regulatory framework, i.e., it must comply with a set of rules, minimum standards and/or undergo accreditation procedures. It includes: \u2022 public, private and voluntary sectors; \u2022 centre-based as well as home-based provision (in the provider\u2019s home). ECEC participation has a stronger positive eff ect on the reading scores of disadvantaged children than on the results of their better off peers.

Access and quality are the two main ECEC issues facing policy- makers in European countries at present. Ideally, they need to be addressed simultaneously. Providing access for all without ensuring quality might not bring the desired benefi ts for children. Likewise, ensuring high quality ECEC without securing enough places might not be an acceptable solution when the broader goal is to provide equitable and effi cient education systems. Th is briefi ng discusses the ways in which policy-makers can make a diff erence and responds to two main questions with regard to access : \u2018how can places be guaranteed?\u2019 and \u2018what is aff ordable ECEC?\u2019 Th is has been and still is one of the main policy priorities in many European countries. Th e two main approaches for ensuring access are discussed and the varying degrees of public commitment to availability and aff ordability are shown. Policy-makers can make a diff erence providing garantee to an aff ordable place. CPD: Continuing Professional Development ",
        "Eurydice Policy Brief, Early Childhood Education and Care 5 Improving quality in ECEC requires changes in several diff erent areas, which policy-makers may directly infl uence ( 1 ). Th is paper therefore examines how countries seek to: \u2022 build a skilled workforce, which is essential if children are to have the best opportunities for learning and development; \u2022 improve teaching and learning through the provision of educational guidelines; \u2022 monitor and evaluate provision to ensure that quality standards are put into practice. In times of fi nancial constraints, countries need to consider their priorities carefully and they may fi nd it expedient to decide whether measures to improve accessibility are more urgently needed than improvements in quality. However, these decisions should be made while keeping in mind that access to high quality ECEC brings the greatest benefi ts for all children. Governance is also discussed in terms of which ministries/top-level authorities are responsible for the development and coordination of policies relating to the care and education of young children. Th e diff erent approaches to access and quality taken by European countries are refl ected in the overall design of ECEC systems. Countries that have separate settings for younger and older children tend to have diff erent measures according to the type of setting or the age of children. In contrast, countries with unitary settings that encompass the entire age range in \u2018early childhood education and care\u2019 services tend to have a more uniform approach both to access and quality issues. However, even in the countries with separate settings, or so-called \u2018split systems\u2019, diff erentiation between \u2018childcare\u2019 and \u2018early education\u2019 spheres is gradually diminishing, with more and more European countries integrating both dimensions into their ECEC policy. ( 1 ) Th e same areas are underlined in the \u2018Proposal for a Quality Framework for Early Childhood Education and Care\u2019 (European Commission, 2014). Access to high quality ECEC brings the greatest benefi ts for all children. In most European countries ECEC is split into two separate phases according to age. ",
        "6 ACCESS I n light of the research revealing the numerous benefi ts of participating in ECEC, there is an overwhelming consensus that ECEC should be available and affordable for all children. Th is has been largely achieved for children in the year (or even two) before primary education. In the EU-28, on average, 93 % of children between the age of 4 and the starting age of compulsory primary education are enrolled in pre-primary education. Th e situation is very diff erent for younger children \u2013 only 30 % of under-3s are in ECEC. How can the availability of ECEC places be guaranteed? Guaranteeing the availability of ECEC places means, in essence, ensuring that supply meets demand. For the most part, and in most countries, ECEC is not compulsory; therefore availability does not necessarily mean that every child needs to have an allocated place. However, it does imply that the children whose parents request a place should be able to fi nd one without undue delay and within a reasonable distance of their home. Demand varies considerably across European countries, especially for the youngest children. Demand is not only infl uenced by the quality of the ECEC system, and by the cost of services. Cultural beliefs associated with child rearing and parenting as well as social and labour policies are also important. For example, some countries have extensive childcare leave (up to two years) designed to enable parents to look aft er their own children in the early stage, while others provide only a few months. Th e offi cial age when children become eligible for ECEC provision and the child\u2019s age when parents start looking for an ECEC place are largely infl uenced by the length and remuneration of available childcare leave. Th e supply of ECEC places can be arranged by public or private bodies. Where and when profi t-oriented ECEC prevails or fi lls considerable gaps in supply not met by publicly subsidised establishments, prices tend to be high and therefore low income families fi nd it diffi cult to aff ord services. However, it is precisely these children who are in greatest need and benefi t most from ECEC. 32 million children are in the age range to use ECEC services in Europe, but almost 20 million were not in ECEC in 2011. Demand is not only infl uenced by the quality and cost of the ECEC system. Cultural beliefs are also important. ",
        "Eurydice Policy Brief, Early Childhood Education and Care 7 Figure 2: Main approaches to ensuring access to ECEC Only a few European countries have not introduced specifi c measures to increase the supply of ECEC places. Th e majority, however, use two approaches: some countries provide a legal entitlement to an ECEC place, while others make ECEC attendance compulsory . In both ways public authorities commit themselves to guaranteeing a place in ECEC. However, there are some fundamental diff erences. A legal entitlement means a child has a right to ECEC, while compulsory ECEC means that a child has a legal obligation to attend. By making it a legal entitlement, public authorities have to guarantee a place for each child whose parent\u2019s demand it (in the age-range covered by legal entitlement), regardless of their employment, socio-economic or family status. In contrast, in countries where ECEC is compulsory, public authorities have to ensure a suffi cient number of pre-primary places for all children in the age range covered by the legal obligation. Moreover, a legal entitlement does not necessarily imply that provision is free, only that provision is publicly subsidised and aff ordable. Compulsory ECEC implies that provision must be off ered free in public settings (see Figure 2). Th e legal entitlement to ECEC is a \u2018soft er\u2019 policy measure than compulsory attendance both for families and public authorities. In essence, it allows families the freedom to choose whether to provide their children with learning and development opportunities in a family or institutional environment. On the other hand, the legal entitlement is less of a fi nancial burden on public authorities than compulsory education both in terms of the places needed and the proportion of actual costs covered. A legal entitlement means that a child has a right to ECEC. Compulsory ECEC means a child is legally obliged to attend. Guaranteeing places in ECEC Legal entitlement to ECEC Universal right Requirement to satisfy demand Subsidised and affordable (might be free) Compulsory ECEC Obligation to attend Requirement to provide a place for every child Free ",
        "8 Most European countries have committed themselves to providing an ECEC place for all children, (see Figure 3) either by establishing a legal entitlement to ECEC or by making attendance compulsory. In 2013, only seven countries, namely Croatia, Italy, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, Iceland and Turkey, have not taken either step. From September 2014, in Croatia one year of pre-primary ECEC is compulsory and in Romania, a legal entitlement for 5-year-olds is available. In Europe, there are signifi cant diff erences in the age at which children have a guaranteed place in ECEC. Moreover, even with the guarantee, some countries face diffi culties in providing enough ECEC places in catchment areas. Only six European countries, namely Denmark, Estonia, Slovenia, Finland, Sweden and Norway, guarantee a legal right to ECEC to each child soon aft er its birth, oft en immediately aft er the end of childcare leave. Two countries joined this group recently. In August 2013, Germany has extended the legal entitlement to all children from age one; and Malta in April 2014 established a guarantee to free ECEC to children from the age of three months whose parents are in employment or education. In around a third of European education systems (Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Spain, France, Luxembourg, Hungary, Malta, Portugal and the United Kingdom), the legal entitlement to publicly subsidised ECEC starts when children are 3 years old, or a few months before they reach this age. In most of these countries, demand and supply is more or less balanced at the start of the legal entitlement. A few countries (Ireland, Hungary and Portugal) face diffi culties in providing enough places in certain areas. Enough ECEC places are usually available for children from the age of 4 to 5 in those countries that provide a legal entitlement. Moreover, in 2012/13 in nine countries, the last year or two of pre-primary education was compulsory and therefore a suffi cient number of places must be provided. Almost all European countries guarantee a place in ECEC. However, the starting age of the guarantee varies signifi cantly. Even with the guarantee, some countries face diffi culties in providing enough ECEC places in the areas that children live. ",
        "Eurydice Policy Brief, Early Childhood Education and Care 9 Country speci(cid:2) c notes: See the full report (European Commission/EACEA/Eurydice/ Eurostat, 2014, p. 41). In Luxembourg and most cantons in Switzerland, education is compulsory from the age of 4, while primary education only starts when children reach the age of 6. In Bulgaria, Greece, Cyprus, Latvia, Hungary, Austria and Poland, compulsory education starts when children are around 5, whereas primary education only starts when they reach the age of 6 or 7. Since September 2014, in Croatia, the last year of pre-primary education is compulsory. Not all these countries, however, manage to balance supply and demand (see Figure 4). Only Denmark, Finland, Sweden and Norway do not report any signifi cant imbalances between demand and supply for any age group. In Estonia and Slovenia, despite the eff orts to widen access to ECEC, the number of places for younger children still does not meet parental demand. For example, recent data show that in Estonia the demand for ECEC for younger children is 5 % higher than supply. In Germany, the availability of ECEC services varies signifi cantly between L\u00e4nder , moreover, there is a shortage of full-time provision. Source: Eurydice.

        "10 Case study: Legal entitlement to ECEC in Sweden All children from the age of 1 are legally entitled to ECEC. When parents require a place for their child in ECEC, the municipality should be able to offer one within four months. ECEC must be offered as close as possible to the child\u2019s home, taking into account the ef(cid:2) cient use of local and other resources as well as parents\u2019 preferences. When demand is higher than available places, a municipality may offer a place in an ECEC institution run by another organisation or in another municipality. Usually, parents have the option to move the child to the preferred institution when a place becomes available. Since 1995, the Swedish Schools Inspectorate can take action against a municipality that does not offer a place within the time limit, for example by imposing a (cid:2) ne. A recent government report (SOU, 2013:41) shows that supply meets demand in most municipalities. Only around 2 % of children starting ECEC have to wait for a place on average two to three months longer than the statutory four months. The Government is currently looking into whether new measures or incentives are needed to ensure that all children receive a place within the statutory time limit. Demand is higher than supply Supply meets demand No monitoring data available at central level No data available Older children Younger children Figure 4: Demand and supply of places in publicly subsidised centre-based ECEC settings, 2012/13 Country speci(cid:2) c notes: See the full report (European Commission/EACEA/Eurydice/Eurostat, 2014, p. 59).

        "Eurydice Policy Brief, Early Childhood Education and Care 11 Free ECEC available to all children \u2013 still an aspiration. Aff ordable ECEC needs to be guaranteed by legal entitlement \u2013 otherwise it is not available. What is affordable ECEC? Th e funding of ECEC varies signifi cantly across European education systems. Many countries consider it an essential public service and provide substantial amounts of public funding. Some countries leave ECEC provision for younger children (under 3 years old) to the private sector and expect parents to bear all the costs of these services; while in others, children may attend ECEC free of charge from the earliest age. In a few countries, parents pay fees throughout the early years until the beginning of primary education. ECEC may, however, be subsidised via payments to families (through tax relief, allowances or vouchers), via payments to ECEC providers, or through a combination of both. Aff ordability, of course, is a relative concept. High-income families can aff ord expensive private education and sometimes choose it even when free or publicly subsidised options are available. On the other hand, low-income families may need additional assistance even when access is free or subsidised as they may not be able to aff ord the necessary educational equipment or to pay for their child\u2019s food in the ECEC setting. Th erefore, depending on countries\u2019 distribution of wealth and the number of children living at risk of poverty and social exclusion, there may be a need for diff erent solutions to the problem of making ECEC more aff ordable. For example, in Denmark, which has the lowest rate of children at risk of poverty or social exclusion, well-off parents pay fees that amount to a maximum 25 % of a setting\u2019s operating costs. Furthermore, fee reductions and exemptions are off ered based on family income, family composition and the number of children in ECEC. In contrast, in Bulgaria and Romania, where approximately every second child under 6 years old is at risk of poverty and social exclusion, ECEC is off ered free or almost free to every child. Availability, moreover, is as important as aff ordability. Having free or heavily subsidised services without a guaranteed place may result in long waiting lists and parents competing to get a place. Th erefore, eff ective measures for making ECEC aff ordable are normally complemented by a place guarantee (either by compulsory attendance or legal entitlement), as discussed earlier. Figure 5 shows the various approaches to public commitment to the aff ordability and availability of ECEC. ",
        "12 Explanatory note: Below the scale, % of countries by age range are shown. The countries analysed were attributed to a single category, based on the predominant situation. Countries with several education systems were counted as one entry. The Figure does not account for the country size or the proportion of children. In fact, diff erent levels of commitment to ECEC aff ordability, ranging from no public commitment to complete public commitment can be found in European countries. In most countries, the commitment increases as children approach primary school age. Actually, most European countries have the highest level of commitment to providing aff ordable ECEC in the year preceeding primary education. However, in a few countries public authorities place a priority on ECEC availability and aff ordability from the earliest possible age of participation. Most European countries have the highest level of commitment to providing aff ordable ECEC in the year before the start of primary education.

Figure 6 shows the proportion of children under 3 years of age attending centre-based ECEC ( 2 ). It shows how the diff erent ways of making ECEC aff ordable and available aff ect the participation rates in ECEC for the youngest children, where the highest diff erences between countries are evident. Countries providing a legal entitlement or free ECEC are indicated. Th e dotted line at 33 % marks the \u2018Barcelona target for childcare facilities\u2019 agreed in 2002, which was supposed to be reached by 2010 ( 3 ). However, in 2011, only ten European Union countries (as well as Iceland and Norway) had achieved the goal of ECEC provision for a minimum of 33 % of children under 3 years old. Most countries providing a legal entitlement have reached the 33 % target of participation rates for under-3s. Th e few exceptions include Finland, where many young children are in home-based provision (12 % of 1 year-olds and 17 % of 2 year-olds (THL, 2011)) and thus supply and demand is balanced. In Malta, in 2011, the legal entitlement applied only to children from 2 years and 9 months. Th e only four countries (Denmark, Finland, Sweden and Norway) that have balanced supply and demand (see Figure 4) off er subsidised ECEC coupled with a legal entitlement (guarantee to a place) from an early age.

        "14 both aff ordable and available in these countries, as fees are rather low. In Sweden, for example, fees for ECEC are capped at PPS ( 4 ) EUR 110 (SEK 1257) per month. In Denmark, Finland and Norway, ECEC is slightly more expensive, with monthly fees at PPS EUR 270, PPS EUR 216 and PPS EUR 200, respectively. In order to make ECEC aff ordable for all families, fee reductions or exemptions for those in need are off ered. Moreover, in Norway, parents receive ECEC-specifi c tax relief, while Finland off ers support through the family allowance if a child attends private ECEC. In contrast, the private self-fi nancing sector is prominent in a few countries where a more liberal welfare state philosophy operates. In Ireland, Cyprus, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom, young children are considered the responsibility of parents, and state \u2018interference\u2019 is minimised. Th e fees in private ECEC can be rather high. For example, the average monthly fees for a 40-hour week for a two-year-old reach PPS EUR 866 (\u00a3 754) in England. However, some targeted subsidies are available: some two-year-olds from disadvantaged families can benefi t from some hours of free provision (10-15 weekly). Th ree countries (Latvia, Lithuania and Romania) off er free ECEC from the earliest possible age of participation (under 1). Parents contribute only for meals. Th e fees also mostly cover food in Bulgaria (amounting to PPS EUR 50). However, in these countries, there is no guaranteed place (except in Romania from age fi ve) and many children still cannot access ECEC. In addition, childcare leave is rather long (up to the age of two) and therefore mothers usually take care of their children themselves. Th is situation is clearly refl ected in the rather low participation rates of children under 3 years old (from 2 to 15 %). ( 4 ) Purchasing power standard (PPS): Th e artifi cial common reference currency unit used in the European Union to express the volume of economic aggregates for the purpose of cross national comparisons in such a way that price level diff erences between countries are elimi- nated. PPS thus buys the same given volume of goods and services in all countries. For ex- ample, in Eurozone countries 1 PPS varies from EUR 0.7 in Slovakia to EUR 1.2 in Finland. Private self-fi nancing sector is prominent in a few countries where a more liberal welfare state philosophy operates. Fees can be rather high. ",
        "Eurydice Policy Brief, Early Childhood Education and Care 15 QUALITY E CEC quality is a complex and much debated concept. While this paper does not attempt to provide a comprehensive defi nition of ECEC quality, the following criteria are generally accepted to be the basic characteristics of good quality settings: \u2022 a safe yet stimulating environment; \u2022 supportive and encouraging staff ; \u2022 opportunities for intensive verbal and social interactions; \u2022 appropriate experiences to promote children\u2019s cognitive, physical, social and emotional development. Th is briefi ng highlights some of the key areas that policy-makers may directly infl uence, and which help to create the right conditions for high-quality ECEC provision. How to ensure that staff have the right skills? ECEC staff have a major role in determining children\u2019s experiences and their learning outcomes (Bennett and Moss, 2011). Th e 2011 Commission Communication states that staff competences are key to high quality ECEC ( 5 ). However, there is still a tendency to allocate \u2018educational\u2019 work for older children to qualifi ed staff , and \u2018care\u2019 for the younger ones to less qualifi ed staff . In most countries, several types of staff have direct regular contact with children. In the Eurydice report, these have been grouped into three broad categories: \u2022 educational staff , usually qualifi ed at tertiary level (Bachelor level); \u2022 care staff with a minimum qualifi cation at upper-secondary or post-secondary non-tertiary level; and \u2022 auxiliary staff /assistants who usually are either not qualifi ed or have a minimum qualifi cation at upper secondary level. However, not all European countries have educational staff in ECEC, especially in provision for children under three. Having at least one staff member with a minimum of three years\u2019 tertiary education (Bachelor level) in education is still not required in the Czech Republic, Germany, Ireland, Latvia, Malta, Austria, Slovakia, the United Kingdom (Scotland) and Liechtenstein for the entire period of ECEC. Educational provision given by higher qualifi ed staff generally only begins when children are around 3 years old. Skilled staff are key to providing high quality ECEC. ( 5 ) Communication from the European Commission (2011) \u2014 Early Childhood Education and Care: Providing all our children with the best start for the world of tomorrow [COM (2011) 66 final]. ",
        "16 Th e requirements for staff in home-based settings usually tend to be lower. Th e most common approach to qualifi cations for home-based workers in ECEC is to require them to undertake a special training course. Th e length of these courses is oft en quite short, but does vary greatly \u2013 between 18 and 300 hours. Only Denmark and Norway require staff to have a minimum three years\u2019 Bachelor\u2019s degree for education in both home- and centre-based settings. Country speci(cid:2) c note: See the full report (European Commission/EACEA/Eurydice/ Eurostat, 2014, p. 102). Establishing the initial qualifi cation requirements for staff working with children is only the starting point to ensure a well-qualifi ed workforce. Continuing professional development (CPD) is an important means by which employees can upgrade their knowledge and skills throughout their career. In certain cases, participating in training also allows staff to upgrade their qualifi cations. However, continuing professional development is a professional duty for education and care staff in settings for children under 3 years of age in only half of European countries. For older children, it is a professional duty and/or necessary for promotion everywhere except in Denmark, Ireland, Cyprus, Sweden and Norway. For the entire period of ECEC Only for settings with older children (3 years or older) No educational staff with min 3 years of ISCED 5 in education No data available Home-based childminders are usually required to undertake a special training course. CPD is an important means by which employees can upgrade their knowledge and skills throughout their career.

        "Eurydice Policy Brief, Early Childhood Education and Care 17 Other ECEC staff members rarely have the same opportunities for in-service training or continuous professional development as school teachers. Why workload is important? Supportive working conditions form another set of important factors contributing to ECEC quality. Workload, in terms of the number of children per staff member, is particularly important. Staff /child ratio and group size appropriate to children\u2019s age are oft en seen as essential both to reducing staff turnover and enabling meaningful interactions with children. Th erefore, the majority of European countries have introduced central regulations covering the maximum number of children allowed per staff member and/or per group in centre-based settings. Although, in practice, the actual numbers of children may be lower than the stated maximums, the levels set by these regulations provide a useful indication of the standards operating across Europe.

        "18 Case study: Ensuring high quality staff in Norway In all centre- and home-based provision, all teams must have at least one member of educational staff with a three-year Bachelor level degree as a minimum. In total, 35.4 % of all ECEC staff hold a Bachelor level quali(cid:2) cation. These members of staff work with assistants, for whom there are no minimum quali(cid:2) cation requirements. Nonetheless, 12 % of assistants have an upper secondary level vocational certi(cid:2) cate in child care and youth work. Regulations on staff/child ratios stipulate that in centre-based settings, one kindergarten teacher with a Bachelor level degree should be in charge of 7-9 children under 3 years old, or 14-18 older children. Including assistants, the average ratio of ECEC staff to children is 4.9 (BASIL 2012/13). For home-based provision, one kindergarten teacher with a Bachelor level degree usually divides his/her time between several settings, where the total staff/child ratio is set at 1:5. Continuing professional development is optional. However, a recent strategy for competence and recruitment in ECEC (Kunnskapsdepartementet, 2013) emphasises the need for continuing professional development for all staff and highlights the need to improve the status of the profession. Norway is one of the countries at the forefront of addressing the gender balance in ECEC: men constitute almost 10 % of assistants and 7 % of Bachelor level staff. Current regulations stipulate that a man, who is equally quali(cid:2) ed, or almost as well-quali(cid:2) ed as a woman, must be selected for a job in an ECEC setting. With the Equality Action Plan 2014, Norway aims to ensure at least 20 % of male staff in ECEC (BLD, 2011). Th e limits set for the number of children per adult or per group are usually formulated taking into account children\u2019s ages. As children get older and more independent, the maximum number of children allowed per staff member increases. In order to provide an overview, Figure 8 shows the ratios and group sizes for ages 2 and 4. Th e variation across European countries is signifi cant. In Greece, Finland and most parts of the United Kingdom, one staff member cannot look aft er more than 4 children aged 2 years, while in Cyprus and Lithuania the limit is set at 16 and 15 respectively. Th e group sizes may vary from 10 in Germany and Slovakia to 26 in the United Kingdom (Northern Ireland). Usually, a team of several ECEC practitioners work together with a group of younger children. Th e maximum number of 4-year-olds per staff member varies from 7 in Finland to 25 in Cyprus. Th e maximum size of groups are usually set at around 20 children and reach up to 30 children in several countries. Usually, two staff members work with a group of 4-year- olds, but only one staff member is required in Cyprus, Lithuania, Malta and Slovakia. Th e maximum number of children allowed per adult oft en doubles when children reach 3 years of age. ",
        "Eurydice Policy Brief, Early Childhood Education and Care 19 How to in(cid:3) uence the quality of teaching and learning? Th e eff ectiveness of the teaching and learning process largely determines the quality of ECEC provision. Appropriate teaching methods, learning activities based on well-defi ned objectives, good communication between children and staff , follow up of progress towards the desired learning outcomes, as well as the involvement of stakeholders such as parents and the local community, all contribute to the delivery of high quality education and care (see EACEA/ Eurydice, 2009 and European Commission, 2014). At national level, policy-makers seek to infl uence the quality of teaching and learning by issuing \u2018steering documents\u2019 for ECEC, which include educational guidelines on a range of issues. What form do educational guidelines take? In some countries, educational guidelines are incorporated into legislation as part of an education programme, whereas in others they are published as a reference framework of skills, care and education plans, educational standards, criteria for developing local curricula or practical guidelines for ECEC practitioners. Recommendations are usually quite broad, and oft en institutions are free to develop their own curricula and choose their own methods. In several European countries, central \u2018steering documents\u2019 contain general principles and objectives for ECEC and these may serve as a basis for guidelines issued at regional or local level. Th us, in federal systems with signifi cant regional autonomy, as is the case in Germany and Spain, the education authorities of the L\u00e4nder and the Autonomous Communities are responsible for providing more detailed programmes of study for ECEC containing objectives, content and assessment methods, etc. In other countries (e.g. Estonia, Denmark, Lithuania (prior to pre-primary groups), Sweden and Finland), the guidelines and principles established in the national framework provide a reference point for producing local curricula at the municipal level or within ECEC settings. De(cid:2) nition of educational guidelines Of(cid:2) cial guidelines are issued on a range of matters to help ECEC providers offer a high-quality service. Educational guidelines may cover learning content, objectives and attainment targets, as well as teaching approaches, learning activities and assessment methods. Th e eff ectiveness of the teaching and learning process largely determines the quality of ECEC provision. Oft en ECEC settings are free to develop their own curricula and choose their own methods. ",
        "20 Which countries issue educational guidelines? It is becoming increasingly accepted that early years\u2019 provision is the foundation of learning throughout life; consequently, all European countries now issue offi cial educational guidelines to help settings improve their provision. However, in around half of all European countries these guidelines are restricted to settings for children over 3 years old (see Figure 9). Guidelines for younger children oft en emphasise care aspects and health/safety. In a few education systems where steering documents do not apply to younger children, ECEC providers must draw up their own education and care plan in order to become accredited. Settings are required to outline, for example, their proposed socio-pedagogic activities, the education and support provided for children, and information on cooperation with parents. In the countries where home-based provision is a signifi cant part of the ECEC sector and where educational guidelines exist, they usually apply to both home-based and centre-based provision. Country speci(cid:2) c note: See the full report (European Commission/EACEA/Eurydice/ Eurostat, 2014, p. 119). For the entire period of ECEC Only educational guidelines applying only to older children (=>3 years) No data available In half of all European countries, there are no educational guidelines for settings catering for younger children. Figure 9: Provision of educational guidelines in central steering documents for centre-based ECEC settings, 2012/13 ",
        "Eurydice Policy Brief, Early Childhood Education and Care 21 Recommended teaching approaches usually refer to fi nding the right balance between adult-led and child-initiated activities. What do educational guidelines cover? All countries that have educational guidelines \u2013 be it only for older children or for the entire ECEC phase \u2013 list learning objectives referring to personal, emotional and social development, language and communication skills as well as expressive arts and development of creativity. Physical development and health education as well as understanding of the world are also included almost everywhere for both groups (see Figure 10). Reading literacy and numerical and logical reasoning, as well as adaptation to school life are more oft en directed at older children. Early second/foreign language learning is recommended in educational guidelines for older children in about half European countries. Most countries recommend the type of approaches to education that institutions should adopt. Usually, these approaches refer to fi nding the right balance between adult-led and child-initiated activities as well as between group and individual activities. Th e principle of free play is underlined in around half of countries. Steering documents may also include guidelines on assessment methods, the most common being continuous observation. In the case of older children, observations oft en form the basis of a written record of assessment. Testing and self-assessment are rarely used. However, self-assessment is becoming increasingly important in Nordic countries. Older children All ages Fewer countries All countries foreign language adaptation to school life reading literacy numerical and logical reasoning understanding of the world physical development and health education expressive arts and development of creativity language and communication skills personal, emotional and social develpment Reading literacy and numerical and logical reasoning, as well as adaptation to school life are more oft en cited in relation to older children.

        "22 How is additional learning support provided? Participation in ECEC from a very young age improves the likelihood that children from disadvantaged backgrounds will be successful in their education, and reduces their chances of becoming socially excluded. However, in order to reach their full potential, these children might still need some additional support. Th erefore, all European countries without exception, have adopted measures to provide support for children who have additional educational and/or developmental needs. Th ere are two main approaches to identifying these children: \u2022 specifi c groups that meet defi ned criteria may be targeted; or \u2022 an individual approach may be taken, where specifi c needs are assessed and determined on a case-by-case basis. Case study: S\u00edolta (cid:4) National Quality Framework for Early Childhood Education in Ireland Educational guidelines are expressed as a standard on Curriculum in the National Quality Framework for Early Childhood Education \u2013 S\u00edolta. It states that \u2018encouraging each child\u2019s holistic development and learning requires the implementation of a veri(cid:2) able, broad-based, documented and (cid:3) exible curriculum or programme\u2019. Six components of Curriculum are further explained by a set of Signposts for Re(cid:3) ection and \u2018Think-abouts\u2019 which are intended to support practitioners in early education settings to become aware of and be critical of their practice. The framework was published in 2006, following a three-year developmental process, which involved consultation with more than 50 diverse organisations, representing childcare workers, teachers, parents, policy-makers, researchers and other interested parties. The objectives of S\u00edolta are to de(cid:2) ne, assess and support the improvement of quality across all aspects of practice in ECEC settings for children aged between birth and six. The Framework is addressed to all ECEC providers: full and part-time daycare, home-based childminders, sessional services as well as infant classes in primary schools. The website (www.siolta.ie) has been designed to support ECEC staff\u2019s engagement with the Framework as individual practitioners, in working with colleagues in a setting and also as a support for networking with other professionals who work with young children. Children in need of additional support are identifi ed according to group criteria or individually. ",
        "Eurydice Policy Brief, Early Childhood Education and Care 23 In order to reach those children who might have learning diffi culties as a result of their background, most education systems use cultural and/or linguistic criteria to target the groups most at risk. Socio- economic and geographic criteria are also considered important in many European countries. A third of countries combine this target group approach with the assessment of children\u2019s individual needs. Th e individual approach alone is rarely used. Th ere are three main ways in which additional support is provided for disadvantaged children: \u2022 specifi c measures to support children\u2019s development, learning and attainment especially language development; \u2022 provision of additional or specialist staff ; \u2022 establishment of special organisational and/or funding arrangements. Language support is the most common form of centralised support for disadvantaged children and is usually targeted at migrant children or those from ethnic minorities. Most countries with many children who are either foreign citizens or foreign-born, have issued central recommendations on language support programmes. However, the involvement of staff from a minority or immigrant background in supporting children with language diffi culties is quite rare.

        "24 How are ECEC settings monitored and evaluated? A fundamental aspect of quality management is the extent to which standards and regulations are enforced by the responsible authorities. Th e vast majority of countries employ two separate processes to ensure that all ECEC settings meet the required standards. New settings must undergo a process of accreditation, while existing settings are subject to regular evaluation, which is nearly always carried out by authorities outside the setting (external evaluation). Case study: Slovenia Slovenia has a long-standing tradition of bilingual ECEC settings in the context of minorities\u2019 legal right to be educated in their own language, to know their culture and to develop their national identity. Thus, in the area where the Italian minority lives, ECEC is conducted in one of two ways: the language of instruction is Slovenian and children learn Italian as a second language, or vice a versa. Bilingual settings also exist in the areas inhabited by the Hungarian minority, and the education is held in both Slovenian and Hungarian. In total, in 2012/ 13, around 1 % of all children in ECEC were attending settings where the language of instruction was Italian or bilingual Slovenian-Hungarian settings. Educational authorities have issued a Supplement to the Curriculum for working in the bilingual areas. This document highlights principles, speci(cid:2) c goals and examples of activities to support staff involved in bilingual education. These practitioners are not speci(cid:2) cally trained for teaching in a bilingual environment; however, they are required to speak Italian (in settings with Italian as language of instruction) or to be bilingual (Slovenian-Hungarian). Bilingual settings are entitled to receive extra funds for CPD for staff, related to ECEC practice in ethnically mixed areas. Moreover, these settings may bene(cid:2) t from such advantages as smaller group size, extra staff or a higher level of education of the staff. Additional funds for starting a new intake are provided to institutions even though the minimum required number of children is not reached. Monitoring and evaluation processes Accreditation is the process of assessing whether settings intending to provide ECEC comply with the regulations in force, i.e. a certain set of rules and minimum standards. External evaluation is a quality control process carried out by individuals or teams from outside an educational/ care setting which seeks to evaluate and monitor the performance of ECEC settings, report on the quality of provision and suggest ways to improve practice. Virtually all European countries have put in place a system for the accreditation and external evaluation of ECEC settings. ",
        "Eurydice Policy Brief, Early Childhood Education and Care 25 Virtually all European countries have put in place a system for the accreditation and external evaluation of ECEC settings. Moreover, most countries\u2019 central/top-level regulations/recommendations stipulate which aspects of provision should be taken into account when evaluating ECEC settings. Where the central level defi nes the aspects of provision to be evaluated, they commonly include compliance with regulations, particularly in respect of health and safety (e.g. premises, facilities and equipment both indoors and outdoors), child-staff ratios, as well as staff qualifi cations. However, there are wide variations both between countries and between types of setting with respect to the other aspects that might be covered. In particular, in many countries the evaluation of settings for older children is usually more comprehensive than for settings for the younger age group. In many countries, the evaluation of settings for older children is usually more comprehensive than it is for settings for the younger age group. ",
        "26 GOVERNANCE T he way that the system of ECEC is designed and organised is largely infl uenced by the responsible central/top-level authorities. Historically, childcare came under the remit of social and family aff airs, with the ministry responsible for health, welfare or family aff airs in charge. With pre-primary provision increasingly becoming more education oriented, the ministries of education are gradually becoming more involved in ECEC policies or even assuming formal responsibility for the entire period of early childhood education and care. Some case studies show that bringing the policy coordination for the entire ECEC phase into one ministry results in overall fi nancial gain (Unesco, 2003). Who is responsible for policy development and coordination? Currently, the fi nal two-three years of ECEC (before children become eligible for primary school) falls under the responsibility of education ministries in all European countries except Germany, where the Federal Ministry of Family Aff airs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth is responsible for the entire ECEC phase. However, even in Ministry of Education responsible for the entire ECEC phase Ministry of Education responsible for ECEC for older children Other ministry responsible for the entire ECEC phase Not data available Source: Eurydice. Figure 12: Responsibility for ECEC policy falling under Ministry of Education, 2012/13 Histori cally, childcare came under the remit of social and family aff airs. In ap proximately half of European countries, the ministry of education is responsible for the entire phase of ECEC. ",
        "Eurydice Policy Brief, Early Childhood Education and Care 27 Germany, at Land level, the ministry of education is oft en in charge. In approximately half of European countries, the ministry of education is responsible for the entire phase of ECEC. In the other half, the ministry of education only becomes involved at the later stage, namely pre-primary education for older children (usually from age three). When there are diff erent types of provision, responsibilities might be shared. For example, in Estonia, the Ministry of Education and Research is responsible for most ECEC provision catering for children from age one and a half to seven, but additional childcare services for the youngest children fall under the responsibility of the Ministry of Social Aff airs (see Figure 12). What is the current trend in the structure of ECEC provision? Many of the decisions made by policy-makers on ECEC access, aff ordability and quality issues discussed in this briefi ng are refl ected in the overall design of ECEC systems. Two main forms of ECEC structure in Europe can be distinguished. In some countries, ECEC forms a unitary system or single phase, while in others ECEC provision is split into two separate phases. In the standard unitary system, children have no breaks or transfers between institutions until they start primary school. In the spit system, younger children attend diff erent settings to older children. Usually, the transition from one setting to the next takes place when children are around 3 years old, but it can be at 2\u00bd years or as late as 4 years in some countries. As shown in Figure 13, the majority of European countries have split settings. Yet, children attend one unitary setting before starting compulsory school in most Nordic countries, the Baltic countries, Croatia and Slovenia. Th ere are some exceptions, with the last year or two of pre-primary education delivered both in primary schools and ECEC settings. For example, in Sweden, the last year of ECEC \u2013 the pre-primary class for 6-year-olds ( f\u00f6rskoleklass ) \u2013 takes place only in primary schools. Moreover, several European countries have both unitary and separate settings. In Bulgaria, Denmark, Germany, Spain and Austria ( 7 ), ECEC services can be delivered either in separate settings for younger and older children, or in unitary settings catering for both age groups. However, some distinctions may be maintained between the two age groups even in unitary settings. ( 7 ) Also, in the Czech Republic and Portugal, some private settings might include groups for both younger and older children. In the standard unitary system, children have no breaks or transfers between institutions until they start primary school. ",
        "28 Physical transition is only one of the aspects that distinguish split and unitary systems. Typically, there are diff erences in the ministry responsible, in educational guidelines, in the minimum requirements for staff qualifi cations, in the limits on adult/child ratios as well as whether a place is guaranteed. (see Figure 15). In the typical split system, younger children attend settings with a focus on \u2018childcare\u2019, while older children move on to \u2018early education\u2019. Th e responsibility for ECEC governance, regulation and funding are divided between diff erent authorities. Th e ministry responsible for health, welfare or family aff airs is usually in charge of provision for younger children, while the ministry of education is responsible for the provision aimed at older children. Consequently, educational guidelines normally apply only to the provision for older children. In the split system, the requirements for staff qualifi cations also usually diff er depending on the type of provision, with tertiary degrees in ECEC required mostly in settings for older children. Staff /child ratios are usually much lower for younger children and double or even triple when moving to \u2018early education services\u2019. Moreover, conditions of access may vary greatly; with a legal entitlement usually applying to older children and not to younger children. In the typical split system, the ministry responsible for health, welfare or family aff airs is usually in charge of provision for younger children. Unitary settings Split settings No data available Source: Eurydice. Figure 13: Organisation of centre-based ECEC, 2012/13 Country speci(cid:2) c notes: See the full report (European Commission/EACEA/Eurydice/ Eurostat, 2014, p. 35). ",
        "Eurydice Policy Brief, Early Childhood Education and Care 29 In contrast, in unitary systems, ECEC provision for all children of pre-school age is organised in a single phase and delivered in settings catering for the whole age range. Th e ministry of education is responsible for ECEC governance, regulation and funding. Th e provision is considered as \u2018early childhood education and care\u2019 services and educational guidelines cover the entire ECEC phase. Unitary settings have a single management team running provision for children of all ages and the same level of staff qualifi cation (usually tertiary level) is required for working with the entire age range. Staff : child ratios tend to be lower for the entire phase of ECEC than in the \u2018early education\u2019 provision in split systems. Furthermore, in unitary systems, a legal entitlement to ECEC or free ECEC is oft en granted from a very early age. Split systems showing all the attributes mentioned above are in operation in Belgium (German-speaking and Flemish Communities), the Czech Republic, Italy, Cyprus, Luxembourg, Poland and Slovakia. Other countries with split settings as shown in Figure 14 may have some of the attributes that also characterise unitary ECEC systems. Unitary set tings have a single management team running provision for children of all ages and the same level of staff qualifi cation. \u2018Childcare\u2019 (under 3 years) Ministry responsible for health, welfare or family affairs No educational guidelines Care staff with upper secondary qualifications Low staff: child ratios No legal entitlement \u2018Early childhood education and care\u2019 (0/1-6/7 years) Ministry responsible for education Educational guidelines provided Educational staff with tertiary degrees Low/medium staff: child ratios Legal entitlement \u2018Early childhood education\u2019 (3 years and older) Ministry responsible for education Educational guidelines provided Educational staff with tertiary degrees High staff: child ratios Legal entitlement S p li t s y s t e m U n i t a r y s y s t e m Figure 14: Characteristics of split and unitary systems ",
        "30 Towards greater integration In reality, the divisions between the two types of system are becoming blurred, since many of the countries with split settings are beginning to apply some of the policies which were originally introduced in settings for older children, to settings for younger ones as well. Th e fi rst step taken is usually the introduction of educational guidelines for younger children. Th ese can be set down either in the same steering document(s) that apply to the entire age range (e.g. as in Ireland), and/or in separate documents for younger and older children (e.g. in Belgium (French Community), Greece, Spain, Malta, Hungary, Romania and Turkey). Oft en educational guidelines are set in collaboration with education ministries. In some split systems, however, education ministries have the main responsibility for provision for both younger and older children. For example, in all parts of the United Kingdom the departments responsible for education set the standards for learning, development and care for children from birth to the age of compulsory primary education in all types of ECEC provision. Some split systems require at least one member of the team working with both younger and older children to have high level qualifi cations. In Greece, France, Portugal and Turkey, educational staff working in settings for younger children are required to have at least a tertiary level degree. Some countries have integrated settings, or eliminate the physical transition of children from one setting to another. For example, in Austria, alongside Kinderkrippen for children up to age 3, and Kindergartens from age 3, an increasing number of children attend mixed age group settings ( Altersgemischte Betreuungseinrichtungen ) for those from 1 to 6 years. Th ese groups are mostly provided in Kindergartens . Th ese examples show that by integrating some aspects of \u2018early education\u2019 into \u2018childcare\u2019 oriented settings for younger children, European ECEC systems are increasingly moving towards an \u2018early childhood education and care\u2019 approach. Furthermore, with many countries gradually expanding place guarantees to lower age groups, ECEC is increasingly becoming an integral part of the education system across Europe. By integrating some aspects of \u2018early ed ucation\u2019 into \u2018childcare\u2019 oriented settings for younger children, Eu ropean ECEC systems are increasingly moving towards an \u2018early childhood education and care\u2019 approach. Th e divisions between the two types of system are becom ing blurred, since many of the countries with split settings are begin ning to apply some of the policies applied in settings for older children, to settings for younger ones. ",
        "Eurydice Policy Brief, Early Childhood Education and Care 31 Where to look for further information European countries have very diff erent and varied solutions for the education and care for children under compulsory school age. Th is briefi ng has summarised the main challenges in improving access to and the quality of ECEC, and has demonstrated how these challenges are currently being addressed by policy makers across Europe. For more details on these and other important issues, as well as detailed country information, please consult the full report: \u2018Key Data on Early Childhood Education and Care \u2013 2014 Edition\u2019 (http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/education/eurydice/documents/key_ data_series/166EN.pdf). Case study: Malta (cid:4) Towards greater integration In Malta, there are separate settings for younger and older children. Educational guidelines (called \u2018Good Practice Guidelines for Programme of Activities\u2019) for \u2018childcare and family support centres\u2019 catering for the youngest children (aged between 3 months and 3 years) have been in place since 2006. For \u2018kindergarten centres\u2019 catering for older children (2 years and 9 months to 4 years and 9 months), educational guidelines are included in the National Curriculum Framework. In 2009, the responsibility for \u2018childcare and family support centres\u2019 was moved to the Ministry for Education and Employment. All four-year-olds have been legally entitled to free ECEC in state or church establishments since 1975 whereas provision for three-year- olds has been available since 1988. The attendance is nearly universal, with 98 % of three-year-olds and 100 % of 4-year-olds in kindergarten centres in 2012/13 (MEDE, 2012/13). In contrast, until recently, child care services in Malta have been underutilised with only 11 % of one-year-olds and 26 % of two-year-olds in childcare and family support centres in 2011 (DSWS, 2011). Affordability, cultural beliefs regarding child rearing and lack of quali(cid:2) ed services have been identi(cid:2) ed as the main challenges. In order to tackle affordability issues and facilitate female employment, from April 2014, the Maltese Government extended the legal entitlement to free ECEC to public and private childcare and family support centres. PPS 5.1 million (EUR 3.8 million) have been allocated for that purpose. However, currently the Free Child Care Scheme is available only for children whose parents are in employment and/or in education. An extension to universal entitlement is being debated. ",
