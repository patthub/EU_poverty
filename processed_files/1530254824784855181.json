        "In addition to the abovementioned permanent priorities, the 2010 annual priorities are: \u2014 European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion. This priority is intended to encourage projects aimed at raising young people's awareness of everyone\u2019s responsibility in tackling poverty and marginalisation as well as at promoting the inclusion of groups with fewer opportunities. This concerns in particular, projects aimed at stimulating young people's reflection on the prevention, ways out and consequences of poverty; projects tackling the issue of marginalisation and various forms of discrimination, such as those based on gender, disability or ethnic, religious, linguistic or migrant grounds. In this context, particular attention will be paid in particular to projects promoting the active involvement of: (a) disabled young people, encouraging exchange between young people with and without disabilities, as well as projects focusing on the issue of disability in our society; (b) young people from migrant backgrounds or ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities. In this context, projects involving Roma young people shall be encouraged wherever relevant. \u2014 Youth unemployment and promotion of young unemployed people's active participation in society. This priority is intended to encourage projects tackling the issue of youth unemployment and aimed at stimulating young unemployed people's active participation in society. \u2014 Awareness-raising and mobilization of young people around global challenges (such as sustainable development, climate change, migrations, the Millennium Development Goals). This priority is intended to encourage projects aimed at raising young people's consciousness of their role as active citizens in a globalized world as well as at fostering their sense of global solidarity and commitment vis-\u00e0-vis current issues.

Name: \u2018Saucisse de Morteau\u2019 or \u2018J\u00e9sus de Morteau\u2019 2. Member State or third country: France 3. Description of the agricultural product or foodstuff: 3.1. Type of product: Class 1.2. Meat products (cooked, salted, smoked, etc.) 3.2. Description of the product to which the name in (1) applies: \u2018Saucisse de Morteau\u2019 is a straight sausage with a regular, cylindrical form and a diameter of at least 40 mm (diameter of the casing at the time of filling) made from pork. \u2018Saucisse de Morteau\u2019 is filled into a natural, colourless pork casing (large intestine). The casing is closed at one end by a small wooden stick and by a string made of natural fibre at the other. \u2018J\u00e9sus de Morteau\u2019 is a particular form of \u2018Saucisse de Morteau\u2019 with a less regular cylindrical appearance and a diameter of at least 65 mm (diameter of the casing at the time of filling). \u2018J\u00e9sus de Morteau\u2019 is also filled into a natural, colourless pork casing (large intestine or caecum). If a caecum casing is used, the small wooden stick is not always present as the caecum is naturally closed at one end. \u2018Saucisse de Morteau\u2019 and \u2018J\u00e9sus de Morteau\u2019 can therefore have physical variations given the diversity of the casings used. When cooked, each slice of \u2018Saucisse de Morteau\u2019 and \u2018J\u00e9sus de Morteau\u2019 has a coarsely minced yet uniform texture and is consistent and firm in appearance. Smoking gives the sausages a typical amber colour, somewhere between brown and golden. Never\u00ad theless, the colour is not uniform throughout the product. \u2018Saucisse de Morteau\u2019 and \u2018J\u00e9sus de Morteau\u2019 are prepared from a mixture of lean pork and pork cutting fat (hard fat), coarsely minced and mixed. The transparency of the casings allows the lean pork to appear as dark patches and the fat as light patches. \u2018Saucisse de Morteau\u2019 and \u2018J\u00e9sus de Morteau\u2019 has a firm consistency. EN C 315/12 Official Journal of the European Union 23.12.2009 ",
        "The smoke flavour is one of the major characteristics of \u2018Saucisse de Morteau\u2019 and \u2018J\u00e9sus de Morteau\u2019 and is due both to the sawdust and resinous wood used and to the duration of the smoking process. In the raw product, this flavour is distinct. However, when cooked and in the mouth, the smoked flavour is balanced and lasting without being sharp or bitter. \u2018Saucisse de Morteau\u2019 and \u2018J\u00e9sus de Morteau\u2019 are also characterised by their meaty taste without being too dry or too fatty. The texture of cooked \u2018Saucisse de Morteau\u2019 and \u2018J\u00e9sus de Morteau\u2019 is tender and smooth, with coarse, firm mince. In the mouth, the product must not be tough or rubbery, but firm and juicy. The physico-chemical properties of \u2018Saucisse de Morteau\u2019 and \u2018J\u00e9sus de Morteau\u2019 are as follows: moisture content with fat removed: \u2264 75 % (raw product) fat: \u2264 30 % for a moisture content of 75 % (raw product) collagen/protein: 16 % maximum (raw product) sugar content: \u2264 1 % for a moisture content of 75 % (raw product) 3.3. Raw materials: Quality criteria for selecting meat Rearing of animals The animals selected for fattening are females and castrated males. Uncastrated males, including young males that have not yet reached sexual maturity, males castrated of a single testicle, males with cryptorchidism, hermaphrodites and cull sows are not accepted. The proportion of fattening pigs sensitive to halothane must be less than 3 % and all must be non-carriers of the RN- allele. In order to establish healthy rearing conditions and limit the need for additives and treatment, a procedure for cleaning, disinfecting and drying has been put in place between each batch at all stages of fattening pig production. The use of tranquillising medicaments is prohibited in the 48 hours prior to the animal\u2019s departure from the farm and during transport. At the time of loading, the animal has been fasted for at least 12 hours. Slaughter and cutting There is a waiting time of at least two hours prior to slaughter. The pigs are rinsed down when they arrive at the slaughterhouse and 30 minutes prior to anaesthesia. The minimum warm weight for pig carcases is 80 kg. Blemishes are limited to 5 % for all carcases in a client batch. The following are considered as blemishes: \u2014 hair removal blemishes, \u2014 rind blemishes, \u2014 burst blood vessels, \u2014 bruising, \u2014 fractures, \u2014 presence of foreign matter (grease stain, traces of faeces, offal fragments and any other undesirable foreign substance). The pH is an indicator of the technological quality of the carcases and, therefore, has to be controlled. Control methods involving sampling have to be specified and documented at slaughterhouse level. The ultimate pH (taken at least 18 hours after slaughter) falls within the range 5,50 \u2264 pH < 6,20. The measurement is taken 5 cm above the sirloin end at a depth of 2-3 cm. EN 23.12.2009 Official Journal of the European Union C 315/13 ",
        "The cuts that may be used in the mixture are as follows (no other cuts are permitted): \u2014 leg, \u2014 shoulder, \u2014 belly, \u2014 backfat, \u2014 loin, \u2014 trimmings (if used, the jowl must be prepared and not have any glands or red blotches). The proportions of meat used should be within the following ranges: \u2014 pork cutting fat (hard fat): 15-35 % of the meat to be used in the mixture, \u2014 lean pork meat: 65-85 % of the meat to be used in the mixture. The use of frozen raw materials (pork fat or lean meat) is permitted and limited to 15 % of the mixture. Frozen raw materials must be minced within 24 hours of thawing. \u2018Saucisse de Morteau\u2019 and \u2018J\u00e9sus de Morteau\u2019 from a mixture containing raw materials that had been frozen must be smoked within 24 hours of the thawed meat being minced. Cuts that can be used for making \u2018Saucisse de Morteau\u2019 and \u2018J\u00e9sus de Morteau\u2019 may not be frozen for longer than 12 months (lean meat) or 9 months (fat). Cuts with one or more of the following defects are non-compliant: \u2014 hair removal blemishes, \u2014 rind blemishes, \u2014 burst blood vessels, \u2014 bruising, \u2014 fractures, \u2014 presence of foreign matter (grease stain, traces of faeces, offal fragments and any other undesirable foreign substance), \u2014 abscesses. Loin meat with colour score 1 or 2 (based on the Japanese colour scale or equivalent) and blade shoulder meat with colour score 6 is eliminated. Meat with soft and oily fat is eliminated. 3.4. Feed (for products of animal origin only): The diet of the fattening pigs to be used to make \u2018Saucisse de Morteau\u2019 and \u2018J\u00e9sus de Morteau\u2019 contains whey (fresh or dried, mainly skimmed). The proportion of whey in the fattening diet is between 15 % and 35 % of the dry matter. The complementary feedingstuff for whey contains at least 50 % grains and miller\u2019s offals. The fattening diet must contain less than 1,7 % linoleic acid. 3.5. Specific steps in production that must take place in the identified geographical area: The production of \u2018Saucisse de Morteau\u2019 and \u2018J\u00e9sus de Morteau\u2019, from preparation of the mixture through to smoking, must take place within the geographical area. 3.6.

Specific rules concerning labelling: Labelling of the product must contain the following information: \u2014 name under which product is sold: \u2018Saucisse de Morteau\u2019 or \u2018J\u00e9sus de Morteau\u2019. Each product is sold under either the name \u2018Saucisse de Morteau\u2019 or the name \u2018J\u00e9sus de Morteau\u2019. By default, the name \u2018Saucisse de Morteau\u2019 is used, but products that satisfy the criteria for \u2018j\u00e9sus\u2019-type sausages may use the name \u2018J\u00e9sus de Morteau\u2019 instead. If the sausage has not been smoked in a \u2018thu\u00e9\u2019 smokehouse, then visual or written communications relating to the product may not make reference to this type of smokehouse. 4. Concise definition of the geographical area: The geographical area of production for \u2018Saucisse de Morteau\u2019 and \u2018J\u00e9sus de Morteau\u2019 is made up of all four departments of the Franche-Comt\u00e9 region (i.e. Doubs, Jura, Haute-Sa\u00f4ne and Territoire de Belfort). This geographical area corresponds to the area with traditional expertise for making and smoking \u2018Saucisse de Morteau\u2019. It also corresponds to the area where \u2018tuy\u00e9s\u2019 and traditional smokehouses are to be found throughout the entire Franche-Comt\u00e9 region. 5. Link with the geographical area: 5.1. Specificity of the geographical area: As the activity to have played a major role in shaping the landscape, agriculture in the Franche-Comt\u00e9 region is geared mainly towards cattle farming, with a particular focus on dairy production. The region has a very well-developed cheesemaking industry with Protected Designation of Origin status. There is a large number of \u2018fruiti\u00e8res\u2019 (as the cheese dairies are known locally) scattered throughout the area. These dairies produce whey, a choice raw material for animal feed because it is low in fat and unsaturated fatty acids but yet relatively rich in lysine and threonine (essential amino acids for pigs in particular). It is therefore the development of the cheese dairies (which, due to their small size make use of whey on site without being transported or chilled) that has enabled whey-based pig rearing to develop in the Franche-Comt\u00e9 region. The link between cheese production and pig production is therefore a direct and traditional one and, in contrast to nearly all other regions, this tradition has survived here. Pig production in this area encouraged the development of artisanal and industrial pig processors by providing these operators with a raw material that had not been diverted to national or international markets. That explains the continued existence of a relatively dense network of small and medium-size slaughterhouses and cutters in the area of production supplying a network of more than 30 local processors. The fact that there are still so many is a reflection of the dynamism of the area. Another characteristic feature of Franche-Comt\u00e9 is its large, mainly coniferous, forest, particularly in the mountainous zone. It is the availability of resinous wood that has enabled the practice of smoking to develop. Generally speaking, smoked products are traditionally products from eastern France and Europe. Historically, smoking was used to dry and thus preserve products, and was particularly prevalent in colder, mountainous areas where the process of smoking could be tied in with the need to heat dwellings. This gave rise to the concept of the \u2018thu\u00e9\u2019 in Franche-Comt\u00e9. A \u2018thu\u00e9\u2019 was the farm\u2019s heating centre and smokehouse, used to temporarily store pork in order to dry, smoke and thus preserve it. The practice, which was initially developed in Haut-Doubs, is the origin of the expertise in smoking that then spread throughout the entire Franche-Comt\u00e9 region with the appearance of smoking structures based on the principles of the \u2018thu\u00e9\u2019. EN 23.12.2009 Official Journal of the European Union C 315/15 ",
        "5.2. Specificity of the product: Characteristics associated in particular with the selection of raw materials and with a special method of processing Specific characteristics linked to the production process are as follows: \u2014 systematic use of wooden sticks for \u2018Saucisse de Morteau\u2019, although in the case of \u2018J\u00e9sus de Morteau\u2019 the caecum is used as a casing, \u2014 use of large intestine as a casing for \u2018Saucisse de Morteau\u2019 stuffing and caecum or large intestine as a casing for \u2018J\u00e9sus de Morteau\u2019, \u2014 the casing used for \u2018Saucisse de Morteau\u2019 is at least 40 mm in diameter at the time of filling, whereas the casing for \u2018J\u00e9sus de Morteau\u2019 has a diameter of at least 65 mm, \u2014 the filling is coarsely minced with the calibre of the grain being at least 8 mm for fat and meat, \u2014 slow smoking with resinous wood, \u2014 specific amber colour after smoking. The product owes its taste and smell, specific texture (separate grains of fat and lean meat, tenderness) and visual appearance (white-coloured fat and uniformly coloured lean meat) to the specific char\u00ad acteristics of the raw material. The raw material comes from pigs which have been genetically selected and on a specific diet. The pigs are fed on a whey diet with a restricted linoleic acid content (1,7 % of their diet), and so it is possible to select fat that is only slightly unsaturated. This characteristic gives fat grains which are distinctly separate in the mixture and have a pleasing white colour. It also makes \u2018Saucisse de Morteau\u2019 and \u2018J\u00e9sus de Morteau\u2019 more resistant to heat during smoking or cooking, and prevents the fat from melting. The low levels of unsaturated fatty acids (the result of being fed on whey) also prevent the sausages from developing a rancid odour. Unsaturated fat is also more adhesive and limiting levels of it allowing the product to capture the smoke better. In the presence of destructured fats, the smoke aromas are captured on the periphery of the casing and form an impermeable film that prevents the smoke from penetrating deep into the sausage. Whey feed, combined with selective genetic criteria, mean that the resulting meat is uniformly pink in colour. In conjunction with the firm, white fats, this helps keep the special grain of \u2018Saucisse de Morteau\u2019 and \u2018J\u00e9sus de Morteau\u2019 very visible. A reputation dating back to the 18th century For a long time, \u2018Saucisse de Morteau\u2019 and \u2018J\u00e9sus de Morteau\u2019 enjoyed a local and regional reputation, spread only by merchants and people passing through the area from the 18th century onwards. The product was part of the traditional rural diet, and was associated in particular with Sunday meals or, in the case of the \u2018J\u00e9sus de Morteau\u2019, Christmas meals. Its reputation then spread outside the original area as people could identify it clearly both due to its high degree of recognisability (coarse grain, colour, wooden peg) and to its organoleptic qualities (coarse mince, smoky taste). \u2018Saucisse de Morteau\u2019 and \u2018J\u00e9sus de Morteau\u2019 are products which are well known by the general public, restaurant owners and consumers alike. A public awareness survey conducted in 2008 showed that 71 % of consumers knew about the product. People immediately regard it as a symbol of Franche- Comt\u00e9 cuisine, alongside the various cheeses and wines of the region. This strong link between Franche-Comt\u00e9 and \u2018Saucisse de Morteau\u2019 is still alive today and puts the product at the heart of Franche-Comt\u00e9\u2019s culinary heritage. Although this reputation is due mainly to the name \u2018Saucisse de Morteau\u2019, the name \u2018J\u00e9sus de Morteau\u2019 is also well-known in its own right, particularly in the region, where it can often be found alongside \u2018Saucisse de Morteau\u2019 on shop shelves.

        "5.3. Causal link between the geographical area and the quality or characteristics of the product (for PDO) or a specific quality, the reputation or other characteristic of the product (for PGI): Characteristics linked to the geographical area of production \u2018Saucisse de Morteau\u2019 and \u2018J\u00e9sus de Morteau\u2019 characteristically undergo a slow smoking process. Slow smoking means that smoke has to be produced on a constant basis as this is an important factor for smoking. This expertise in slow-smoking is manifested in an ability to achieve slow combustion without a flame and to produce sawdust and wood according to various criteria, and is passed on in regional businesses. The practice itself and human skills associated with it developed as a response to local restrictions. Conifers grow in great numbers in the Franche-Comt\u00e9 forest, particularly in the mountainous zone. Local meat curers, very logically, used the types of wood at their disposal. The practice of using resinous wood and the practice of slow-smoking, which was originally developed in the mountainous areas, also spread throughout the entire Franche-Comt\u00e9 region. The presence of conifers means that the smoking process which \u2018Saucisse de Morteau\u2019 and \u2018J\u00e9sus de Morteau\u2019 undergo was developed solely on the basis of resinous woods \u2014 in contrast to other types of smoked sausage sold at national and European level, which are smoked using wood from deciduous trees. Slow-smoking by means of resinous wood is an extremely specific characteristic of \u2018Saucisse de Morteau\u2019 and \u2018J\u00e9sus de Morteau\u2019 giving it its amber colour and a smoked taste closely linked to the area in which it is produced. Furthermore, in conjunction with the smoking practice, the practices of coarse mincing, using wooden pegs and filling the sausages into the pig\u2019s large intestine are all traditional local practices specific to the Franche-Comt\u00e9 region. The Franche-Comt\u00e9 region is an area that corresponds to a zone of expertise. Reputation closely linked to place of origin The product\u2019s reputation is one of the fundamental elements linking it to the geographic area. This is manifested, among other things, by the annual \u2018Saucisse de Morteau\u2019 festival and competition which take place on the 15 August weekend and in October, respectively.

Feed (for products of animal origin only): For the sheep, grazing constitutes the principal source of feed. The wide variety of flora in the area and the presence of numerous endemisms are of particular interest, as they give the cheese its very particular organoleptic characteristics. Along with the practice of transhumance, this constitutes one of the main characteristics of this PDO. The pastures grazed by the sheep are very varied and rich in native flora. The grassland designated as grazing pasture is of particular note and is associated with the intensive and productive historical use of the pastureland. The grazing pastures are populated by grasses of the Poetea bulbosae class, dominated by the grass known as bulbous meadow grass, along with various varieties of subterranean clover, which, together with Poa pitardiana , covers large swathes of the region. Shrub thickets also form part of the sheep\u2019s diet, but to a lesser extent. These thickets are made up of legume species with high forage value, specifically tagasaste or tree lucerne and broom, both of which are varieties of flora native to the Canary Islands. Grazing may be supplemented with concentrated feed if weather conditions have been poor. Sheep are given supplementary feed only during lactation and during the final stage of the dry period, when they come in for milking once a day, but this is limited to concentrated feed, as they obtain the fibre in their diet from grazing. The supplementary feed usually consists only of maize, although sometimes bran, oats and beet are also added. As regards the practice of transhumance, once the sheep have stopped producing milk (dry period), which is usually between August and December, they are moved, by transhumance, to a larger area to graze. The practice of transhumance takes them outside the area covered by the PDO at times when no protected cheese is being produced. Consequently, for the cheeses to be protected, they must be produced between the months of January and July, when the sheep are grazing inside the protected area. The cattle are fed intensively, but always with vegetation harvested by the farmer, as follows: (a) from May to October, with the crops sown by the farmer (maize, sorghum, cereals and fodder crops), as well as with whatever is growing in the fields at this time of year and is harvested by the farmer (e.g. reeds, chestnut-tree branches, tree lucerne, forage shrubs, etc.); (b) from October to April, the rains bring new vegetation, such as miscleras , cardoons, hedge mustard, tree lucernes and broom, which the cattle eat along with the various kinds of grasses growing in the fields at this time of year. The above-mentioned feed is supplemented with concentrated feed, which is given to the cattle all year round, but in increased quantities and quality during the season when production is at its highest and pastures are less plentiful. The supplementary feed basically consists of flax, soya, maize, middlings and beet. EN C 315/22 Official Journal of the European Union 23.12.2009 ",
        "The goats are fed on the basis of intensive or semi-extensive farming. The goats obtain the fibre in their diet inside the protected area from: \u2014 fodder grown by the farmers on their agricultural land and given to the goats in the stable, the crops being, in decreasing order of importance, vetch, oats, maize, fodder kale, Lathyrus , rye, sorghum, etc., \u2014 the shrubs and grasses cut by the farmers in the fields, which vary depending on the season and are the same as those described above for the sheep, \u2014 natural pasturage in the enclosed areas in which the herds are sometimes kept, which is the same as that described above for the sheep. Concentrates are used as supplementary feed only at times of the year when lactation and milking take place. These concentrates basically contain maize, bran, oats and beet. They are administered once a day during the period in question. 3.5. Specific steps in production that must take place in the identified geographical area: All of the stages in the production of \u2018Queso de Flor de Gu\u00eda\u2019/\u2018Queso de Media Flor de Gu\u00eda\u2019/\u2018Queso de Gu\u00eda\u2019 take place in the geographical area identified in the PDO, thus following traditional practice in the area. 3.6. Specific rules concerning slicing, grating, packaging, etc.: \u2014 3.7. Specific rules concerning labelling: For protected cheeses that have been made with raw milk obtained from the producer\u2019s own animals, this may be indicated on the label by means of the word \u2018artesano\u2019. 4. Concise definition of the geographical area: The production area for milk suitable for the products covered by this Protected Designation of Origin coincides with the area in which processing and maturing take place and is restricted to three municipalities in the north-western district of Gran Canaria. These are as follows: G\u00e1ldar: this area, which covers 67,6 km 2 , has a perimeter which resembles a very irregular triangle with its apex facing the island\u2019s interior, at an altitude of more than 1 500 m above sea level. Moya: located in the central part of northern Gran Canaria, this municipality covers an area of 36,3 km 2 . Santa Mar\u00eda de Gu\u00eda: covering an area of 37,72 km 2 , this municipality is 1 500 m above sea level and slopes progressively down towards the coast at a steep gradient of more than 11,5 %. 5. Link with the geographical area: 5.1. Specificity of the geographical area: \u2018Queso de Flor de Gu\u00eda\u2019/\u2018Queso de Media Flor de Gu\u00eda\u2019\u2018/Queso de Gu\u00eda\u2019 is produced only in three municipalities in the protected district. There have been flocks and herds of Canary Island breeds in these three municipalities since before 1526. Historians recounting the tradition of cheese-making in these municipalities bear witness to the tradition and to settlers living alongside these animals as a means of subsistence and trade. The tradition of livestock farming and cheese-making still continues in the three municipalities in question, with approximately 100 livestock farms making farmhouse-made artisanal cheese using the traditional production methods. EN 23.12.2009 Official Journal of the European Union C 315/23 ",
        "The method used to produce \u2018queso de flor\u2019 is attributed to the old Castilian population which settled in the area that is now known as \u2018Altos de Gu\u00eda\u2019 (the Gu\u00eda highlands), which encompasses the important area of G\u00e1ldar\u2019s medium-altitude estates. The secret of why the livestock-farming and cheese-making tradition has continued is the isolation in which the inhabitants lived for centuries as a result of the precarious nature of the means of transport, being restricted to the use of bridle paths until almost the beginning of this century, which turned the community in on itself, as is logical in the almost total absence of communication. An additional factor is the tacit secret kept by producers of \u2018queso de flor, de media flor y de cuajo\u2019, which they guarded like a precious possession to be left only to their children. The steep terrain and the absence of roads connecting the artisanal centres to any villages other than Gu\u00eda favoured the creation of a small agricultural market there at the end of the 19th century, which was attended by farmers and cheese-makers from the surrounding area, essentially from the Altos de Gu\u00eda, Moya and G\u00e1ldar. 5.2. Specificity of the product: The first characteristic that gives the product its specificity is the proportion of milk from the various indigenous livestock breeds: \u2014 at least 60 % sheep\u2019s milk from the Canary Island breed of sheep, \u2014 a maximum of 40 % cows\u2019 milk, preferably from the Canary Island breed of cattle, although crossbreeds are also acceptable, \u2014 a maximum of 10 % goats\u2019 milk from an indigenous breed. The second characteristic that gives the product its specificity is the practice of grazing the sheep, whose milk makes up the largest percentage of that used to produce the cheese. Grazing necessarily gives the sheep a diet that includes plants native to the Canary Islands, which gives the milk that will be used to make the cheese particular distinctive and unique organoleptic characteristics. Furthermore, although the goats and cattle are not usually grazed, the farmer gathers grass and fodder from inside the production area to serve as their basic feed, which is why the milk they produce has specific organoleptic characteristics resulting from that diet. The third characteristic that gives the product its specificity is the fact that \u2018queso de flor\u2019 and \u2018queso de media flor\u2019 are made using vegetable rennets obtained from Cynara cardunculus var. ferocissima and Cynara scolymus , which grow wild in the production area. It is these factors that give the cheeses their particular and unique organoleptic characteristics, namely their texture, flavour and aroma. 5.3. Causal link between the geographical area and the quality or characteristics of the product (for PDO) or a specific quality, the reputation or other characteristic of the product (for PGI): The cardoon flower and the rennet give the cheese of the region its specific characteristics, as they are used only in this part of the island, producing what is known as \u2018Queso de Flor de Gu\u00eda\u2019. The type of rennet used is obtained from what is commonly known as cardoon flower, which is the dried flower head of one of the cardoon species that grows in the district in question, thus establishing a causal link between the geographical area and the quality or characteristics of the product. Despite being relatively small, the mountainous nature of the geographical production area means that it has a wide range of microclimates. The area has a perimeter which resembles a very irregular triangle, with its apex facing the island\u2019s interior, and reaches an altitude of more than 1 500 m, which is another important factor in its climate. EN C 315/24 Official Journal of the European Union 23.12.2009 ",
        "The climatic conditions in the municipality of Santa Mar\u00eda de Gu\u00eda derive from its northern location, which covers three different altitudes, whereas Moya is influenced by its windward position and is more humid and rainy at medium altitudes and at the summit, while G\u00e1ldar, which is below 400 m in altitude, is drier. These microclimates give the cheeses their particular characteristics. There are approximately 1 000 plant species growing wild in these municipalities, about 100 of which are endemic, which is the result of the microclimates and the different altitudes. Many of the species that grow wild here are native forage crops, such as broom, miscleras , cardoon, hedge mustard and tree lucerne, which form the principal source of feed for the livestock from January to July when they are in the geographical area, before they are moved elsewhere from August to December as part of the transhumance, giving the protected cheese the organoleptic and olfactory-gustatory characteristics that set it apart and link it to the environment in which it is produced. To sum up, we can say that the characteristics that differentiate these protected cheeses are very closely linked to the geographical production area, which has a number of unique factors: (a) its indigenous breeds, namely the Canary Island breed of cattle, the Canary Island breed of sheep and any of the Canary Islands\u2019 breeds of goats (Majorera, Palmera or Tinerfe\u00f1a), which are pure native Canary Island breeds, as recognised by law, and produce the milk used to make the cheeses; (b) rich and varied vegetation, with endemic species and high-quality grazing; (c) a long tradition of grazing livestock, which goes back to the 15th century and was continued by later settlers, for whom it became one of their principal means of support, thus making cheese- making into a traditional practice that has come down to us today; (d) a specific geographical location in the aforementioned district and a topography that favours a wide range of microclimates and allows the livestock to graze all year round; (e) a unique countryside characterised by extensive pastures and rural settlements with links to this economic activity; (f) a farming system that demonstrates that the production of this product is closely linked to the territory, the climate and the integration of its producers into the environment. Even when kept stabled, the animals are fed on grass and fodder grown and harvested by the farmer within the protected area.

Reasons for cancellation: Schussenrieder Bierbrauerei Ott has bought Brauerei Adler, which used to be in the geographical area of Krauchenwies-G\u00f6ggingen, and has moved production to Bad Schussenried. There are no plans to resume production in Krauchenwies-G\u00f6ggingen. Schussenrieder Bierbrauerei Ott\u2019s products therefore no longer meet the requirements of the PGI specification for \u2018G\u00f6gginger Bier\u2019. By letter of 26 September 2007, the Karlsruhe regional government office (Regierungspr\u00e4sidium Karlsruhe), as the competent control authority, confirmed that Brauerei Adler was the only local brewery in the geographical area of Krauchenwies-G\u00f6ggingen and that it can therefore be assumed that there are no other potential producers likely to be interested in using the protected geographical indication.

        "In addition, since the current product specification indicates the chemical, physical and organoleptic characteristics of the fruit without specifying the stage at which they must be checked, a time frame has been identified during which these characteristics must be assessed. The quality parameters measured during this time frame are to be considered valid for the entire commercial life of the product, since, as a result of modern preservation techniques, no significant degradation will occur in the fruit\u2019s firmness, sugar level or acidity. The reference to the limit on planting density of 4 800 plants/ha has been removed from Article 5 of the specification on the method of production, since setting a density limit only makes sense if it is tied in with biological, agronomical and soil/climate parameters, while it serves no useful purpose if it is included without any other reference. It has also been deemed appropriate to remove from Article 5 of the current specification the reference to the average yield per holding of 68 t/ha, since it penalises small holdings compared with large ones.

No indication of origin not expressly provided for or additional wording likely to mislead consumers may be added to the designation. 4. Concise definition of the geographical area: The \u2018Mela Val di Non\u2019 PDO production area is the catchment area of the River Noce as it flows through the Val di Sole and the Val di Non, also known as the Valli del Noce or Anaunia, in the Autonomous Province of Trento. This area, covering the two valleys, comprises the whole of the territory of the following municipalities: Andalo, Amblar, Bresimo, Brez, Cagn\u00f2, Caldes, Campodenno, Castelfondo, Cavareno, Cavedago, Cavizzana, Cis, Cles, Cloz, Commezzadura, Coredo, Croviana, Cunevo, Dambel, Denno, Dimaro, Don, Flavon, Fondo, Livo, Mal\u00e8, Malosco, Mezzana, Monclassico, Nanno, Ossana, Peio, Pellizzano, Rabbi, Rev\u00f2, Romallo, Romeno, Ronzone, Ruffr\u00e8, Rumo, Sanzeno, Sarnonico, Sfruz, Smarano, Spormaggiore, Sporminore, Taio, Tassullo, Terres, Terzolas, Ton, Tres, Tuenno, Vermiglio, Verv\u00f2. 5. Link with the geographical area: 5.1. Specificity of the geographical area: N a t u r a l e n v i r o n m e n t Soil: \u2018Mela Val di Non\u2019 apples are grown in an area that is highly suited to the production of apples of excellent organoleptic quality. The area\u2019s soils are formed from \u2018dolomitic\u2019 rock and in themselves provide an element of uniqueness. One of the characteristics of this type of soil is its exceptionally high level of exchangeable magnesium, often as much as twice the level considered normal in other fruit- growing areas. The organic matter content of the soil, at between 4 % and 6 %, is excellent, as is the nitrogen content. The soil also has good levels of other macroelements and of minor elements. Climate: The fruit-growing area has an extremely favourable south-south-east exposure and a climate ranging from temperate-oceanic to continental-alpine, strongly mitigated by the area\u2019s particular tectonic formation (wide glacial valley). The area\u2019s low rainfall (an average of five to seven rainy days per month) means that there are up to 300 days of sunshine every year. The complete absence of fog and mist throughout the year, linked to the low humidity, results in a very clear atmosphere which allows the strong sunlight to play its full role in biosynthesising the sugars and in developing the full \u2018bouquet\u2019 of aromas. These factors characterise the apples produced in this specific area. During the hottest part of the day, the clearness of the air is also aided by a southerly breeze (known as the Ora del Garda ) that regularly gets up in the late morning, caused by the movement of air masses originating over the wide lake basin of Lake Garda, the largest lake in Italy. Air quality throughout the production area is constantly monitored by APPA ( Agenzia provinciale per la protezione dell\u2019ambiente (Provincial Environmental Protection Agency)), which can certify the absence of urban atmospheric pollution in the whole \u2018Mela Val di Non\u2019 production area. The natural surroundings, in an Alpine area with a typical range of flora and its own particular wild fauna, as described by botanists and naturalists, attest to the environmental and land-based synthesis between cultivation and nature. H u m a n e n v i r o n m e n t Alongside the natural environment, centuries-long human activity has had a decisive effect on the strong link between \u2018Mela Val di Non\u2019 apples and the defined production area, as described in the historical information concerning the proof of origin and proven by an extensive range of historical/ cultural and scientific sources. EN C 315/30 Official Journal of the European Union 23.12.2009 ",
        "The deep roots of the rural population in the production area, its age-old experience, its agricultural skills handed down from generation to generation, and the ongoing pursuit and use of specific, traditional cultivation methods have created the conditions to permit apple-growing to consolidate over time to become what it is today, an historical, traditional and cultural asset of the whole area and the basis of its economy. Today, indeed, no fewer than 15 000 people out of a total population of 35 000 in the area work in apple production. Therefore, the life of the area\u2019s population moves in time with the cycles of apple production (in particular blossoming, ripening and harvesting) and many popular festivals, cultural events and conferences are linked to apples and to the very real significance of apple-growing in integrated mountain agriculture, in terms both of conserving the landscape and natural environment and of agricultural traditions. 5.2. Specificity of the product: The cool spring temperatures, during the initial phases in the development of the young fruit, encourage the presence of natural gibberellins in the plant. These lead to efficient cell multiplication, producing particularly crunchy, naturally elongated fruit with, in the Delicious varieties, a typical truncated cone shape. Rational irrigation prevents growth stress and allows the balanced growth of flesh and skin, ensuring that the fruit grow harmoniously throughout the summer, producing, in the case of the Delicious varieties, a particularly smooth skin without defects caused by russeting. In addition, the Alpine climate (hot days and cold nights) permits an excellent balance between the high level of photosynthetic products produced during the day and the low level of sugar normally lost during the night. The balance is very positive, inasmuch as sugar losses caused by nocturnal respiration, which are directly proportional to night-time temperatures, are severely restricted by a climate that is particularly cool, even during summer nights. The almost constant clear nights also play another vital role, covering the growing and ripening fruit in morning dew that, as it evaporates with the first rays of the sun, cools the fruit, producing an agreeable reaction in the skin, giving it a pink tone in the case of Golden Delicious and Renetta Canada and a bright, glossy red colour in that of Red Delicious. 5.3. Causal link between the geographical area and the quality or characteristics of the product (for PDO) or a specific quality, the reputation or other characteristic of the product (for PGI): The links between the exceptional factors described above are such that the natural and human environments and the climate of the valleys concerned form an indissoluble whole. This has helped give rise to a highly distinctive apple product with unique organoleptic and quality characteristics that is highly renowned and appreciated, with \u2018Mela Val di Non\u2019 apples everywhere enjoying a high reputation, among both consumers and the trade. According to official surveys, \u2018Mela Val di Non\u2019 apples have for several decades constituted a category by themselves. It should also be stressed that \u2018Mela Val di Non\u2019 apples usually command prices on average 20 % to 25 %, and occasionally as much as 40 % to 45 %, higher than apples of the same size and colour, i.e. of the same commercial class, grown elsewhere. Moreover, this consistently higher price, linked to the specific provenance of the apples, is enjoyed by all three varieties for which protection as \u2018Mela Val di Non\u2019 PDO is requested, i.e. Golden Delicious, Renetta Canada and Red Delicious. The natural variability of the product, which can be observed in the objectively wide range of analytical results describing the quality of \u2018Mela Val di Non\u2019 apples, is nevertheless characterised by a higher average quality. This is recognised by consumers, who are prepared to pay considerably more for apples grown in this production area. EN 23.12.2009 Official Journal of the European Union C 315/31 ",
        "As well as being appreciated by consumers for their particular qualities linked to the environment, the renown of \u2018Mela Val di Non\u2019 apples everywhere is shown by the prizes and certificates of merit they have won at numerous national and international fairs and exhibitions.
