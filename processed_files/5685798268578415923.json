        "4 European Semester 2020-2021 country fiche on disability - Greece 1 Executive summary and recommendations 1.1 Key points and main challenges for the European Semester in 2021 The employment rate of disabled people in Greece remains one of the lowest in EU, while it decreased in 2018, in contrast with slightly improved labour market situation overall. Disability inequality is compounded by high levels of long-term unemployment, while it cuts across female and youth unemployment, which remain challenging as such. Disabled people continue to encounter inaccessible physical and digital environments, and direct or indirect discrimination at the workplace. There has been significant delay in issuing secondary policy measures to strengthen the existing legal framework around reasonable accommodation and universal design of goods and services. At the same time, active labour policy design and investment have not sufficiently addressed disability specific challenges, particularly in new placements and provision of individualised jobseekers\u2019 assistance, while investment and impact have been moderate overall. One quarter of disabled people 16-64 remain at risk of poverty after social transfers. The national disability equality gap is wide across relevant indicators apart from individuals aged over 65, arguably due to social security safety nets. Low work intensity and/or low income households with disabled members are particularly at risk, as access to adequate and quality health and social services is directly linked with social insurance status, while out of pocket expenditure for health services is among the highest in EU. Coupled with inadequate child protection and family/ mental health support system, as well as limited alternatives to residential care, the risk of social exclusion and/or institutionalisation remains high for people with disabilities. There has been significant delay in implementing approved de-institutionalisation programs, as well as expanding equality law in the field of social protection which would further support independent living and inclusion in the community. There are furthermore opportunities for improving equal access and quality of medical services (New Health Bill), provided that disability is mainstreamed and efforts are matched with long-term investment in state health/ rehabilitation services, which has been low. Early-school leaving rates are significantly higher for disabled youth compared to non- disabled youth in Greece. This is clearly evidenced in decreasing/ low absolute number of graduates from primary and secondary special education. It is noted that the majority of pupils with disabilities attend mainstream education, however evidence suggests limited progress in implementing inclusive education programs, including ensuring accessible environment, individualised/ parallel support, specialised service provision, use of ICT and accessible learning material. Public investment is necessary to ensure coverage in terms of services and geographical regions. This would also enhance continuity to tertiary education which is indeed low for disabled youth. Support services and scholarships within higher education, as well as vocational programs/ apprenticeship schemes are expanding, and access to such programs by disabled youth needs to be monitored. ",
        "5 European Semester 2020-2021 country fiche on disability - Greece 1.2 Recommendations for Greece These recommendations are based on the evidence and analysis presented in the following chapters of our report. \u2022 Recommendation : Enact legislation related to reasonable accommodation and universal design of public and private goods and services, with particular focus on accessible transport, buildings, information and communication systems in line with the European Accessibility Act and Digital Europe priorities. Ensure that disability is adequately mainstreamed and specific challenges addressed in active labour policy design, monitoring and evaluation. Rationale: Access to the labour market is hindered by inaccessible physical and digital environments, goods and services, while existing legal frameworks do not provide sufficient guidance and safeguards as to implementing universal design and/or reasonable accommodation (secondary legislation foreseen has not been issued). Investment related active labour policies offer an opportunity to create placements in a context of low demand of workforce, which disproportionally affects disabled people, and integrate/ channel funding to address main disability gaps and challenges (see chapter 3). \u2022 Recommendation : Reform and invest in community-based health and social services to support independent living and social inclusion. Expand disability equality directive in the sector of social protection to enhance disability mainstreaming, including eligibility and potential impact of social transfers. Rationale: Legal framework and network of services to meet long-term health and social care in the community is inadequate in terms of coverage and quality, which exacerbates risk of social exclusion (and institutionalisation) of disabled people. Investment is necessary to ensure a range of accommodation and support services are available (regardless of social insurance status) in the community and deliver on CSRs and the European Social Pillar: supported living shelters for disabled youth transitioning to adulthood, social housing that is accessible and affordable for households with high support needs, programs supporting transition from long- stay institutions, children and family mental health support services in the community, access to cash benefits such as rent subsidy (see chapter 4). \u2022 Recommendation : Develop and invest in programs and measures for inclusive education. Expand disability equality directive in the sector of education to enhance disability mainstreaming. Rationale: The majority of pupils with disabilities attend mainstream education, while it is important to make this a meaningful option for children with disabilities who attend special education with low educational outcomes overall. Shortcomings are identified in terms of implementation, rather than legal framework, and investment is directly linked to that. Public education has suffered from low investment overall. Investing in inclusive school environments will benefit all pupils in terms of enhanced infrastructure, equipment, material and teaching methods, which could be served well under EU priorities for digital transition (see chapter 5).

        "6 European Semester 2020-2021 country fiche on disability - Greece 2 Opportunities to mainstream disability equality in the Semester documents 2.1 Country Report for Greece (Staff Working Document) In 2020, the Country Report for Greece included the following direct references to disability issues: \u2022 \u2018p. 18 Modernising its disability assessment system. \u2022 p. 45 Day-care centres for the disabled and elderly exist and numerous home care schemes are operated by both public and non-governmental providers. \u2022 P. 45 The transition from institutional to community-based care for people with disabilities, in particular children, is also a challenge. \u2022 p. 36 There is scope to further improve social dialogue and develop civil society.\u2019 Community based support and de-institutionalization, raised in the Country Report, are indeed key disability priorities both in terms of policy development and investment. From a disability perspective, securing the right to independent living, has direct implications in terms of ability to access employment and education, and being included in the community, and demands attention. At the same time, disability mainstreaming is necessary across sectors. The Commission Staff Working Document provides a comprehensive overview of issues in areas of employment/employability, education, health and social inclusion, where limited progress is noted overall in terms of focused investment-related policy (p. 17). The report provides evidence that disabled children and adults are disproportionally affected by challenges across the board, such as high unemployment rates (p. 33), deficiencies in education (p. 38), unequal access to medical care (p. 44) and lack of social housing schemes (p. 42). Simultaneously, disabled people continue to encounter specific obstacles in those areas, which compromise the extent to which they may benefit from positive developments, such as access to early education (p. 36), or social transfer schemes (p. 40) for instance. 2.2 Country Specific Recommendation for Greece (CSR) In 2020, the Country Specific Recommendation for Greece included the following direct references to disability issues: \u2022 \u201820. Comprehensive access to social services is necessary for the most deprived and vulnerable groups, including people with disabilities, refugees and asylum seekers.\u2019 It is positive that disability specific issues are noted especially where it concerns access to social protection, services in the community and healthcare. As discussed in chapter 4, there are systemic gaps in those sectors which obstruct access and increase the risk of social exclusion for disabled people disproportionally. It is accurately noted that those gaps have existed before COVID-19 pandemic, however recommendations for mitigating the impact seem to be responsive at short-term (CSR 1), while observations such as \u2018long-term care services (are) not sufficiently ",

The Committee recommends that the State party take effective measures to ensure the inclusion of persons with disabilities, particularly women with disabilities, in the open labour market, with a view to achieving target 8.5 of the Sustainable Development Goals. It also recommends that the State party ensure the provision of specific measures and individualized support in the workplace; promote among employers the right of persons with disabilities to employment on an equal basis with others; and mainstream the disability dimension in all employment policies, measures and programmes , including in the policy design of the Greek Manpower Employment OrganiSation.\u2019 Specific actions for employment and vocational training are prioritised under Specific Objective 2.3 Equal Opportunities for All (SDGs 3,4,8,9,11,16) of the proposed National Program for the implementation of the Convention for the Rights of persons with disabilities 2019 2 (p. 22) including suggested measures such as: a. Mainstreaming disability in all policies, measures and programmes for employment and vocational training and improved accessibility of electronic and physical services provided by the Greek Manpower Employment Organisation. b. Reform and modernization of positive measures for facilitating access to employment for disabled people. c. Development of peer support programs, such as training of scientific advisors with disabilities to support disabled people\u2019s access to employment and active inclusion policy development. d. Revisit possible disincentives to employment, e.g. disconnect cash benefit provision from employment status, and provide incentives for promoting access to private sector, (social) entrepreneurship, and self-employment. e. Enhance the role of the Labour Inspection Body to ensure full compliance to equal treatment directive on the grounds of disability and/or chronic illness and reasonable adjustment. 3.1 Summary of the labour market situation of persons with disabilities Data from EU-SILC indicate an employment rate for persons with disabilities in Greece of 31.1 % in 2018, compared to 60.7 % for other persons and approximately -19.6 points below the EU27 average - resulting in an estimated disability employment gap of approximately 30 percentage points (EU27 average gap 24.2, see Tables 2-4). 2 NCDP (v.1 July 2019) please note the official National Disability Action Plan is expected to be adopted by the end 2020. The document currently referenced has been drafted by the National Co federation of Disabled People as the official state partner in disability issues. https://www.esamea.gr/publications/others/4257-ethniko-programma-gia-tin-efarmogi-tis- symbasis-gia-ta-dikaiomata-ton-atomon-me-anapiria.

        "9 European Semester 2020-2021 country fiche on disability - Greece The same data indicate unemployment rates of 32.8 % and 21.8 %, respectively in 2018 (see Tables 5-7) and the economic activity rate for persons with disabilities in Greece was 46.3 %, compared to 77.6 % for other persons (see Tables 8-10). These indications are broken down by gender and age in the respective tables in annex. The trend data is somewhat erratic from year to year but indicatively, the labour market tracks the evolution of general situation but with poorer outcomes on all measures. The disability employment rate has been among the lowest in the EU, 3 while it decreased from 36.7 % (2017) to 31.1 % in 2018 (Table 3). What is particularly observed is that the employment rate of disabled people does not follow the increasing trend of the employment rate of the general population that year, in contrast with previous years. Still, disability unemployment is compounded by high unemployment rates in general, particularly since the economic crisis (Table 7). It should be noted here that the impact of the Coronavirus pandemic is expected to disproportionally affect disabled people, as total employment rates are expected to decline by 3.6 % in 2020. 4 Evidence therefore suggests an equality gap in the extent to which \u2018improvements in the labour market\u2019 benefit disabled people, at least on an equal footing to long-term, youth and female unemployment which are acknowledged to remain \u2018main challenges to address\u2019 . 5 That is to say that, assessing the weight of disability related factors would benefit overall assessment of the employment situation and national progress towards EU2020 targets. On the one hand, employment rate by gender and age is in both cases compounded by disability. Indicatively, disabled women in Greece are significantly less likely to be employed (26.7 %) than non-disabled women in country (50 %) and compared to disabled men in country (36.1 %); at the same time, they are considerably disadvantaged in comparison with their peers in EU on average (48 %) (Please see Annex Table 2). The disability gap is also visible in the age group 16-24, where unemployment rates remain challenging overall. 6 On the other hand, there are additional variables to consider from a disability perspective. General trends analysis shows that \u2018those affected most by unemployment are from lower educational backgrounds, with highest percentage (42 % ELSTAT 2017) noted among those who have completed only primary education\u2019. 7 Historical statistical evidence has shown higher early school leaving rates 3 Argument quoted from ANED (2018) EU2020 Country Report p. 6 available at https://www.disability-europe.net/country/greece. 4 National Reform Program Greece 2020 p. 8. Please note that discretionary measures to protect employees in response to COVID-19 are limited at this stage to compensation and ensuring special purpose leave for workers with children & vulnerable groups, as referenced in the NRP 2020; COVID-19 related measures are not discussed in detail in this report, as systemic challenges are deemed a priority to address (and arguably compounded by crisis such as a pandemic). 5 National Reform Program Greece 2020, p. 6. 6 Staff Working Document Country Report Greece 2020, p. 34. 7 Ministry of Labour (2018) Strategic Framework for Redesigning Active Labour Policies , p. 13 http://www.ypakp.gr/uploads/docs/11364.pdf.

Apart from low educational outcomes for disabled youth, there are additional obstacles disproportionally affecting disabled adults in accessing employment which remain largely unaddressed. 9 It is noted that the disability equality gap in unemployment peaks for disabled people aged 35-44 (54.7 %) in comparison to non-disabled population in that age group (19.5 %) (Please see Table 6). There is evidence of direct discrimination on the grounds of disability in rectruitment 10 as well as during employment that may result in dismissal. 11 Furthermore, little progress has been made with regard to implementing reasonable adjustments in the workplace: \u2018In most of the cases investigated in 2019, the measures or reasonable adjustments which had to be considered by businesses to ensure appropriate working conditions for all staff were simple and almost self-evident. Nevertheless, several businesses were reluctant to adopt even such easy measures (\u2026).\u2019 12 A positive development is observed in that more cases of unequal treatment in employment on the grounds of disability, and particularly in the private sector, are now being reported, noting that relevant equality law and related monitoring reports have been around since 2005. 13 Most commonly, however, resolutions seem to involve administrative penalties to businesses, therefore the impact of non-discrimination legislation in improving the employment situation of disabled people remains limited at this stage. It is noted that perceived prevalence of discrimination on the grounds of disability in country has remained stable between 2006 and 2018, while based on latest Eurobarometer findings half of Greek citizens believe that disability in Greece is a 8 Centre for Development of Educational Policy of the General Co-federation of Employees in Greece (GSEE) (May 2018) in cooperation with the NCDP Disability Observatory.

Based on numerous complaints to the Greek Ombudsman in regard to Public Work schemes (Call 2017), it is noted that vulnerable groups who are not in the position to closely monitor legislative changes, may miss important information that may render them ineligible, especially when this is provided through ICT. 15 The following section provides additional considerations related to the effectiveness of active labour policies that touch upon strategic planning, policy design, monitoring and evaluation. 3.2 Analysis of labour market policies relevant to the Semester For reference, see also the 2020 National Reform Programme for Greece. Challenges in the employment situation of disabled people remain despite CRPD based legislative reforms 16 and/or investment in active labour policies (ESIF 2014-2020; please see also chapter 6). The main factors identified relate to inadequate operationalization particularly of accessibility measures, coupled with inadequate mainstreaming of disability in active labour policies. There has been significant delay in issuing policies foreseen by the renewed disability rights framework (L. 4448/2017) to enact aspects such as: universal design of administrative products, environment and services, and reasonable adjustment (Law 4488/2017; Article 63 paragraph 2); and access to digital environment, especially digital communications, information and services, including media and network services. (Law 4488/2017; Article 64, paragraph 2). Furthermore, L.4495/2017 foresaw the operation of Central and Regional Committees for Accessibility not established to date. In addition, the Greek Ombudsman 17 comments on limited progress in accessibility of the built environment despite obligation for buildings hosting public services to have been fully adapted by 2020. It is noted that official standards for accessibility design (as foreseen by New Building Regulations L.4067/2012) have not yet been issued. Similarly, despite existing legislation, access to public transport (buses used in all cities except Athens) continues to be limited due to (inaccessible) old vehicles being used and/or lack of maintenance in new vehicles, as well as lack of accessible bus stops. While the labour market remains largely inaccessible in terms of obstacles in the built environment, transport to work, workplaces and ICT, Active Labour policies and job 14 NCDP Observatory for Disability Statistical Press Release 28.01.2020 https://www.paratiritirioanapirias.gr/el/results/publications/46/eyrwbarometro-gia-tis-diakriseis-sthn- ee-faneres-kai-kryfes-antilhpseis-gia-thn-anaphria-sthn-ellhnikh-koinh-gnwmh. 15 Greek Ombudsman (2019b) 15 Annual Report (reference year 2018), p. 71 https://www.synigoros.gr/resources/ee2019-p00-plires-keimeno.pdf. 16 Law 4448/2017. 17 Greek Ombudsman (2019a) Report on Implementation of UN CRPD (ar.72 L. 4488/2017) first report, p. 7, https://www.synigoros.gr/resources/ohe_el--2.pdf.

The National Institute of Labour and Labour Force notes that: \u2018Labour market policies in Greece remain to a great extent horizontal, despite some effort to specialise them according to specific social criteria. In addition, implemented labour policies do not acknowledge the complexity of problems, suggesting solutions to isolated aspects thereof.\u2019 18 The Greek Ombudsman observes that, while the economic crisis has compounded the employment situation of disabled people, ESF funded interventions have mainly aimed to address the sharp increase in unemployment of the general population. 19 Furthermore, any positive measures prioritizing disabled people\u2019s participation, among other social groups such as long-term unemployed, have had reduced effectiveness, since tangible prerequisites ensuring equal access to employment have been lacking. 20 Monitoring and evaluation of active labour policies have similarly lacked disability sensitive quantitative and qualitative indicators. These would enable comprehensive assessment of the extent to which disabled people benefit from such schemes and inform evidence-based reforms and increased investment in active labour market policies, as suggested by the Commission. 21 At the same time, the adequacy and effectiveness of ALPs has been limited in general. It should be noted that the allocated budget for Active Labour Policies (ESF 2014-2020) is \u2018among lowest in Europe\u2019. 22 A study by the World Bank, referenced in official analysis, shows investment at 0.306 % of GDP in Greece (value of unemployment rate at 21.1 % as of 2017), while the European average was 0.45 % at the time, including MS with unemployment rate less than 10 %; it is argued that based on the size of unemployment in Greece (2018), investment should be at 1 % GDP. 23 Respectively, the immediate results of active labour market schemes have been moderate in terms of gaining employment. Approximately, in the ESIF 2014-2020 period, 23 % of beneficiaries of ESF employment focused actions had a placement within 6 months after the end of the program, while 22 % beneficiaries in the Youth Employment Initiative were working within 6 months after their participation (results as of end 2018). 24 18 National Institute of Labour and Labour force (2017) Annual Report, p. 59 http://www.eiead.gr/publications/docs/2015/EIEAD_2017.pdf. 19 Greek Ombudsman (2019a) Report on Implementation of UN CRPD (ar.72 L. 4488/2017) first report, p. 29 https://www.synigoros.gr/resources/ohe_el--2.pdf. 20 Greek Ombudsman (2019a) Report on Implementation of UN CRPD (ar.72 L. 4488/2017) first report, p. 29 https://www.synigoros.gr/resources/ohe_el--2.pdf. 21 Staff Working Document Country Report 2020, p. 35. 22 Ministry of Labour (2018) Strategic Framework for the redesign of ALPs http://www.ypakp.gr/uploads/docs/11364.pdf, p. 23. 23 Ministry of Labour (2018) Strategic Framework for the redesign of ALPs http://www.ypakp.gr/uploads/docs/11364.pdf, p. 23. 24 EISF 2nd Progress Report August 2019, p. 12, https://www.espa.gr/elibrary/2h_Ekthesi_Proodou_ESPA_2014-2020_Aug2019.pdf.

        "15 European Semester 2020-2021 country fiche on disability - Greece Independent Citizens with Disabilities (SDGs 1,2,8,10,11) includes the following priorities and indicative actions: \u2022 2.2.1 Independent Living (Specific legislative framework, de-institutionalisation programs, funding home adaptations, enhanced access to technical aids, equipment and technologies); \u2022 2.2.2 Social Protection and Welfare (Adequate network of community-based services, evaluation of national disability assessment system, targeted measures for mental health); \u2022 2.2.3 Income Support (tax relief measures, cash benefits increase and expansion); \u2022 2.2.4 Protection of disabled people as consumers (access to goods and services). It should also be noted that equal access to healthcare forms a specific strand of actions under Specific Objective 2.3 (Equal Opportunities for All), while suggested measures include: \u2022 mainstream disability in all health- related policies and ensure universal access to effective health services on equal basis; \u2022 ensuring public character of the National Health Service; \u2022 institutional interventions, such as establishing directorates on Ministerial level about Chronic Illness, Rehabilitation (and expansion of service networks). 4.1 Summary of the social situation of persons with disabilities Data from EU-SILC indicate the poverty risk rate for working age persons with disabilities in Greece was 25.4 % in 2018, compared to 19.2 % for other persons of similar age - an estimated disability poverty gap of approximately 6 percentage points (see Table 14). For people aged over 65, the disability poverty gap was 2.3 points (12.3 % for older persons with disabilities and 10.0 % for other persons of similar age). The tables in annex also indicate the respective rates of AROPE and break these down by gender as well age. The lower risk of poverty for those aged above 65 is arguably due to social security i.e. disability/ old-age pensions. Limited social protection (in cash benefits and/or services) remains a main challenge particularly for low work intensity and/or low income households with disabled members. It should be noted that disabled people are much more likely to live in a hosuehold with low work intensity (35.2 %) than non-disabled low work intensity households (14.3 %) in Greece (Table 11), while this gap remains, albeit smaller, when considering material deprivation and low income indicators. A comprehensive long-term care policy is not yet in place, 28 restricting access to adequate and quality support with daily life activites in the community and thus increasing risk of social exclusion for persons with disabilities.

Indicatively, 34 in 2017, 267 individuals with intellectual disability were hosted in 42 Supported Living Shelters across Greece, 35 the single available community-based alternative, of which 18 were run by civil society actors. 36 Based on current capacity, it is estimated that three places are available for every 200 individuals with intellectual disability in Greece. 37 Additionally, historical data shows an overall decreasing trend in expenditure in home based long-term care from 2013 to 2016. 38 Indeed, one of the 2020 Country Specific Recommendations to Greece is to ensure comprehensive access to social services for vulnerable social groups, explicitly 29 Greek Ombudsman (2019a) Report on Implementation of UN CRPD (ar.72 L. 4488/2017) first report, p. 6, https://www.synigoros.gr/resources/ohe_el--2.pdf. 30 Final Observations Committee for the Rights of the Child (CRC/C/GRC/CO/2-3) for Greece. 31 Please see also ANED 2019 Living independently and being included in the community (Country Report Greece) for more data and further discussion, https://www.disability- europe.net/country/greece. 32 Greek Ombudsman (2019b) Annual Report 2019, p. 60, https://www.synigoros.gr/resources/ee2019-p00-plires-keimeno.pdf. 33 Commission Staff Working Document Country Report Greece 2020, p. 45. 34 Quoted directly from ANED 2019 Living independently and being included in the community (Country Report Greece), p. 3 available at https://www.disability-europe.net/country/greece. 35 Six out of the 13 administrative regions in the country lack such options entirely EYSEKT (2017). 36 EYSEKT (2017) Study for the Support Living Shelters in ESIF 2014-2020, p. 18 http://www.esfhellas.gr/el/Pages/eLibraryFS.aspx?item=2087. 37 EYSEKT (2017) Study for the Support Living Shelters in ESIF 2014-2020 , p. 19, based on data from the Ministry of Health, Disability Department in 2011 where the number of persons with intellectual disabilities was just over 18,000 (Table 9). 38 National Statistical Service (2016), Systems of Health Accounts, http://www.statistics.gr/el/statistics/-/publication/SHE35/-.

It is equally important to actively involve and strengthen synergies with civil society, 39 particularly for achieving this goal, as disability representative and/or parents\u2019 associations, as well as child protection national and international actors, have been actively involved in running de- institutionalisation programs and their experience should be capitalized on. 40 Access to health and community-based rehabilitation services Moreover, access to medical care remains a challenge, 41 while evidence suggests that shortcomings disproportionally affect persons with disabilities. In total, 20.8 % of persons with some or severe activity limitation reported unmet needs for medical examination in 2019 (19.7 % in 2018), in sharp contrast with 4.4 % of non-disabled population (Please see also Annex Table 15). That is a significant disability equality gap in comparison to other EU countries (apart from Estonia). 42 Linked to this, out-of-pocket expenditure for healthcare in Greece (35 %) is among the highest in EU. 43 The Greek Ombudsman 44 highlights disability specific obstacles to equal access to healthcare which results to increased costs for households with disabled members: \u2022 Access to full range, high quality healthcare services, including rehabilitation, tends to be linked with social insurance status rather than welfare status. It is explained that welfare status is limited to covering disability assessment and hospital care, thus medical supplies and/or specialized inpatient care requires out of pocket payments. \u2022 Delay in payments for specialized healthcare services (not provided by the public sector) and inadequate coverage of available specialized services in the community (in kind and in number) following changes in health service provision regulations since 2016. Access to specialized health services for children is further hindered by lack of child-friendly disability assessment procedures, lack of specialized medical staff in respective health committees and requirement for frequent reassessment. At the same time there has been a decreasing trend in government investment in public health and rehabilitation services. Latest data shows a significant reduction in disability rehabilitation services in the community (by 61.79 %) over 2014/2015. 45 Respectively, there has been limited use of public inpatient rehabilitation services, namely physiotherapy, speech therapy, occupational therapy and psychotherapy/ 39 Staff Working Document Country Report Greece 2020, p. 36. 40 As mentioned above 18 Supported Living Shelters are run by civil society.

However the Greek Ombudsman Annual Report (2019) highlights that there has been a tendency for individuals to be illegally charged higher rates for services than those covered by public expenditure (EOPPY), to which there was a recent corrective legislative measure. 50 The effectiveness of this measure must be monitored in order to reduce risk of out-of-pocket payment for healthcare services that are effectively covered by the state. 4.2 Analysis of social policies relevant to the Semester For reference, see also the 2020 National Reform Programme for Greece (there is no specific chapter on social policies and healthcare in the 2020 NRP).

The challenge of de-institutionalization particularly for children is closely linked with deficiencies in the national child protection system. The Greek Ombudsman 55 underlines the need for reform in line with latest guidelines and the Convention of the Rights of the Child, in order to prevent institutionalization, including: \u2022 provision of community based mental health and family support services; \u2022 expanding and strengthening foster care; \u2022 putting in place a legal framework and quality standards for child protection structures, including specifically assigned monitoring bodies, currently missing entirely. For adults, independent living is hindered by general lack of social housing schemes in country, 56 while there is no access to housing loans with favourable conditions since the start of the economic crisis. 57 Access to affordable and accessible housing is a clear recommendation for investment by the Greek Ombudsman in the field of independent living for disabled people. Other social protection measures Policy measures are effectively lacking to ensure equal access to social protection, goods and services, even though Law 4448/2017 foresaw the expansion of the equal treatment directive in those sectors. There are wide ranging challenges which could be addressed should such enacting measures were in force: \u2022 Private healthcare: medical clinics were recently allowed to operate in residential buildings, however general building regulations include mandatory accessibility standards in outdoor and common spaces only; accessibility of internal spaces in existing or new buildings is not a requirement for licensing private medical clinics. 58 \u2022 Access to early childhood education and care: although \u2018more children have access\u2019, 59 primarily owing to targeted co-funded programs (2014-2020), children with disabilities continue to be denied access to early childhood education, most frequently on the claim of lack of specialized staff. 60 \u2022 Social Transfers: based on numerous reports to the Greek Ombudsman, welfare disability benefits were initially calculated as income in applications for the Rent Subsidy scheme, affecting eligibility, and despite available official guidance, 55 Greek Ombudsman (2019b) Annual Report 2019 , pp. 59-63 https://www.synigoros.gr/resources/ee2019-p00-plires-keimeno.pdf. 56 Commission Staff Working Document Country Report Greece 2020, p. 42. 57 Greek Ombudsman (2019a) Report on Implementation of UN CRPD (ar.72 L. 4488/2017) first report, p. 20, https://www.synigoros.gr/resources/ohe_el--2.pdf. 58 Greek Ombudsman (2019a) Report on Implementation of UN CRPD (ar.72 L. 4488/2017) first report, p. 26, https://www.synigoros.gr/resources/ohe_el--2.pdf. 59 Commission Staff Working Document Country Report Greece 2020 , p. 36. 60 Greek Ombudsman (2019a) Report on Implementation of UN CRPD (ar.72 L. 4488/2017) first report, p. 7, https://www.synigoros.gr/resources/ohe_el--2.pdf.

In addition, a Ministerial Decision (FEK 5855/B/28.12.2018) established that disability welfare benefits are not taxable and should not be counted as part of income. It should be noted however that there has been a failure to integrate this guidance in the Income Tax Code and as a result, disability welfare benefits continue to be calculated as income in the official tax declaration system, rendering eligibility to various means tested provisions at risk. 62 The new public health Bill Finally, it is worth mentioning the new public health Bill which aims to enhance quality of health service provision, more specifically focusing on patient safety, service reform, equal access and universal coverage. 63 The law establishes a new state and third party co- funded agency, ODIPY S.A, under the auspice of the Ministry of Health (Article 4). Its main responsibilities include mapping services in the public and private sector, developing quality standards and indicators, conducting assessments and making service specific recommendations, as well as identifying gaps in healthcare overall, informing policy making and providing training to healthcare staff (Article 5). It should be noted that evaluation criteria specifically include responsive and patient centred services, and accessibility of services to all citizens (Article 8). The law applies to all public primary healthcare services, including rehabilitation centres and social care units of the Ministry of Health, noting this includes day care centres for persons with disabilities, but not long-term residential care units. Private sector healthcare providers can also apply to be audited (Article 1). It is noted that the new agency has authority to impose administrative penalties, including revocation of license in cases of severe violations and/or non - compliance to recommendations (Article 10). This is indeed a positive development provided that disability considerations are adequately mainstreamed, for instance in quality framework, and training of staff. Addressing internal efficiency and responsiveness is also crucial as health and social security sectors \u2018accumulate almost 50 % of reports during which maladministration (is) identified\u2019, noting overall that maladministration continues to be the root cause of 60 % cases investigated by the Greek Ombudsman, a trend that has remained stable across years. 64 61 Greek Ombudsman (2019b) Annual Report 2019, p. 76, https://www.synigoros.gr/resources/ee2019-p00-plires-keimeno.pdf. 62 Greek Ombudsman (2019a) Report on Implementation of UN CRPD (ar.72 L. 4488/2017) first report, p. 32, https://www.synigoros.gr/resources/ohe_el--2.pdf. 63 Ministry of Health 149 A'/01.08.2020 Regulations for ensuring access to quality health services, https://www.hellenicparliament.gr/Nomothetiko-Ergo/Anazitisi-Nomothetikou- Ergou?law_id=b9bdf6fa-1b15-4aa7-a496-ac00016cf310. 64 Greek Ombudsman (2019b) Annual Report (reference year 2018), p. 44, https://www.synigoros.gr/resources/ee2019-p00-plires-keimeno.pdf.

Recalling its general comment No. 4 (2016) on the right to inclusive education, and taking into account Sustainable Development Goal 4, especially targets 4.5 and 4.a, the Committee recommends that the State party increase its efforts to guarantee inclusive education, and in particular that it: (a) adopt and implement a coherent strategy on inclusive education in the mainstream educational system; (b) ensure the accessibility of school and university environments, in line with the Convention, by promoting universal design, the provision of specific measures and individualized support, such as accessible and adapted materials, inclusive curricula, inclusive information and communication technologies for pupils and students with disabilities, and digital pedagogy; (c) immediately ensure access to formal education for all refugee, asylum- seeking and migrant children with disabilities, and for Roma children with disabilities; (d) allocate effective and sufficient financial and material resources and adequately and regularly trained personnel, including persons with disabilities, to effectively guarantee inclusive education; (e) incorporate inclusive education training into higher education curricula for trainee teachers, and into training programmes for current teaching staff, with an adequate budget.\u2019 Specific actions for education are prioritised under Specific Objective 2.3 Equal Opportunities for All (SDGs 3,4,8,9,11,16) of the proposed National Program for the implementation of the Convention for the Rights of persons with disabilities 2019 65 including suggested measures such as: \u2022 Development of a National Action Plan on transitioning from segregated Special Education to a \u2018school for all\u2019: ensuring quality pre-school, primary and secondary education, universal accessibility of schools, training material and educational approaches, reasonable accommodation provisions, parallel support, equal access to tertiary education.

Youth with disabilities (aged 18-24) tend to leave school significantly more than non-disabled peers of the same age groups (and this is reinforced by widening the sample size to age 18-29). Table 17 shows completion rate of tertiary education disaggregated by disability and age group. Persons with disabilities (age 30-34) are less likely to complete tertiary education than their peers (and this is reinforced in the wider sample for age 30-39). Based on this data for 2018, the early school leaving rate of young disabled people (18-24) was 18.5 %, in high contrast with just 3.3 % for non-disabled peers (Table 16). Most pupils with disabilities in Greece (88 %) attend mainstream rather than segregated special education. 66 However, that is far from guaranteeing inclusive education as evidence shows. School education continues to suffer from numerous deficiencies. 67 For children and youth with disabilities, this translates to higher risk of early school leaving and low educational outcomes, linked directly with reduced access to tertiary education and/or post secondary vocational education schemes. 68 The UN CRPD Concluding Observations for Greece highlight that: \u201834.

The UN Committee makes specific reference to the use of new technologies in its recommendations to Greece in the field of education (34.b). Despite recent advances in digital accessibility in national legislation, 77 websites and mobile applications of schools, kindergartens or nurseries may be excluded from relevant obligations, apart for content and services relating to essential online administrative functions (L. 4591/2019 Article 2 paragraph 4). With regard to tertiary education, a series of educational policy reforms since 2010 have aimed to bridge the gap between education and access to the labour market, 78 nevertheless their effectiveness has been limited: \u2018Those policies were introduced in a period where the labour market in Greece recorded the highest unemployment rates in the last decades and experienced the deepest economic recession in the last 50 years. As a result, many of the policies and practices whose success is mainly based on the \u201cmarket\u201d factor, were led to a failure or have had very limited positive effects.\u2019 79 There is currently lack of evidence around access to mainstream vocational education/ apprenticeship schemes for disabled students, which would be important to monitor as such schemes are expanding. 80 It is moreover acknowledged that adult learning is 75 Greek Ombudsman (2019a) Report on Implementation of UN CRPD (ar.72 L. 4488/2017) first report, p. 24, https://www.synigoros.gr/resources/ohe_el--2.pdf. 76 Staff Working Document Country Report Greece 2020, p. 76. 77 Law 4591/2019 (Government Gazette 19 A / 12-2-19): Incorporation into Greek law of: a) Directive (EU) 2016/2102 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 October 2016 on accessibility of websites and applications for mobile devices of public sector organisations and (b) Article 1 of Council Directive (EU) 2017/2455 of 5 December 2017 https://www.taxheaven.gr/law/4591/2019. 78 National Institute of Labour and Labour force (2017) Annual Report p. 67.

A call for supporting self- employment/ entrepreneurship of disabled people was recently published, expected to benefit 200 individuals in total. 84 In the field of education, the following actions and cumulative results are reported: 85 \u2022 special education: 48,000 pupils benefiting in 7,100 schools and 300 additional support structures; \u2022 inclusion of vulnerable social groups in primary schools (reception classes) for Roma and Muslim community (22,000 pupils in 1,350 schools); \u2022 supported more than 6,700 school classes at primary and pre-school education with targeted actions aimed to reduce early school leaving. No specific reference is made to parallel support to disabled pupils in the progress report despite funding being available. 86 Furthermore, supporting access to tertiary education for students with disabilities (scholarships) is expected to benefit 3,770 individuals. 87 This action is placed within a wider program for strengthening disability support structures in tertiary institutions. 88 83 EISF 2nd Progress Report August 2019 , p. 12, https://www.espa.gr/elibrary/2h_Ekthesi_Proodou_ESPA_2014-2020_Aug2019.pdf. 84 Investment priority of combating discrimination and promoting equal opportunities https://www.espa.gr/el/Pages/ProclamationsFS.aspx?item=4528. 85 EISF 2nd Progress Report August 20 19, p. 12, https://www.espa.gr/elibrary/2h_Ekthesi_Proodou_ESPA_2014-2020_Aug2019.pdf. 86 See for instance Call Open in Attika since 2016, https://www.espa.gr/el/Pages/ProclamationsFS.aspx?item=3102. 87 Investment priority: Improving quality, effectiveness and access to tertiary education/ specific objective: enhancing equal access of disabled people and other vulnerable groups https://www.espa.gr/el/Pages/ProclamationsFS.aspx?item=4961. 88 https://www.espa.gr/el/Pages/ProclamationsFS.aspx?item=4357.

Nevertheless, the progress report does not include data on outputs in this field. A recent call for building capacity of staff in church led welfare institutions 91 is however concerning in terms of accountable use of structural funds. 6.2 Priorities for future investment (after 2020) 92 Access to digital environment and universal design (Law 4488/2017 Article 63 & 64) are cross cutting priorities for investment aligned with Digital EU priorities for \u2018digital transition\u2019, 93 and Country Specific Recommendations (CSR) for \u2018safe and sustainable transport\u2019, \u2018digitalisation of the public administration\u2019 and \u2018digital transformation of businesses\u2019. 94 Emphasis must be placed on the use of new technologies in education, indicatively \u2018supporting the digital transformation of schools, use of ICT in pedagogies /demonstration of personalised and inclusive learning, and inquiry-based teaching\u2019. 95 Further linking with CSR for \u2018mitigating employment and social impacts of the crisis\u2019, 96 Active Labour Policies investment should be increased and target creation of new jobs, as low demand of workforce during and in the aftermath of the economic crisis remains the principal reason for low employment rates, 97 while this is expected to be compounded by COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, for delivering on the European Pillar of Social Rights (Principles 17, 18 & 19), disability specific Council observations for access to social services, 98 community based support for long-term care, social housing schemes and programs supporting transition from institutions to community based schemes, must be a clear investment priority in the new programmatic period. 89 Including Supported Living Shelters, for which there are ongoing calls, see for instance most recent in Ionian islands https://www.espa.gr/el/Pages/ProclamationsFS.aspx?item=4944. 90 Please see for instance https://www.espa.gr/el/Pages/ProclamationsFS.aspx?item=4926. 91 Call under investment priority for Lifelong Learning https://www.espa.gr/Lists/Proclamations/Attachments/4967/PR_EDBM128_ADA.pdf. 92 Annex D in the Commission\u2019s Country Report Greece 2020 is not very relevant to disability mainstreaming (focused on National Energy and Climate Plan and particularly closure of the lignite sector by 2028 and possible social and economic challenges for local workforce).
