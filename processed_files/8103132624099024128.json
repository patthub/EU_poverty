In terms of our publication, 1997 will be rich in content and the subjects it covers. Some articles will relate specifically to equal opportunities and mainstreaming, others will be more general focusing, for example, on the fight against international organised crime which includes trafficking in and vi\u00ad olence against women, and others will cover major Community programmes and policies such as prepa\u00ad rations for EMU or the 5th RDT framework programme which should take account of the gender dimension. But the most critical deadline for 1997 is the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) for which the official negotiations began last March in Italy and should conclude next June in the Netherlands. The progress document put forward by the Irish Presidency last December on the negotiations begins as follows: \"The European Union belongs to its citizens.The Treaties founding the Union should address their most direct concerns.\" This is a good beginning and one which we, as citizens and women, fully support. Negotiators should keep this in mind when tempted to ignore the human dimension which should be part and parcel of all Community activities, even those of an economic or monetary nature. Other aspects of the proposed text are less satisfying. For example, there would be an obligation to respect the fundamental rights of citizens but this would be limited to civil rights. What about other rights? Although equality between men and women becomes one of the missions of the Community, it unfortunately does not constitute a fundamental right But there have also been some breakthroughs, notably the rewording of article 119 which concerns equal pay. It is proposed that the concept of \"equal work\" is replaced by that of \"work of equal value\", and a clause is added to this article providing for the adoption of equality measures by a qualified majority vote and no longer by unanimity. There is also question of the implementation of the equality principle and not just its promotion. Negotiations will gather pace between now and the end of June and the mobilisation of women will have to be maintained right to the end.This is why we will be keeping you informed, as clearly as possi\u00ad ble, of the results of the IGC negotiations which will have a considerable influence on our future as women citizens of the European Union. \u00b7 V\u00e9ronique Houdart-Blazy of Section \u00ad Information for Women wove council Monetary union domin\u00e2tes Dublin Summit \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 heads of state and government, meeting in Dublin in December, ^W I agreed in a Declaration to a broad range of measures to boost \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 ^0 employment and made \"decisive progress\" on preparations for European Monetary Union (EMU). Their resolve to combat organised crime, including the sexual exploitation of women and children, was strengthened. But the toughest part of the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) negotiations, which will decide the future shape of the EU, was deferred (see article page 2). It is now up to the Dutch Government to navigate Member States through this politically sensitive phase. The date for signing the new EU constitutional treaty was set by EU leaders as June 1997, at the Amsterdam Summit. They have given themselves six months to arrive at an agreement. The Dublin Summit's greatest success was arguably the financial deal concerning the euro. This will ensure that EMU will re\u00ad main on schedule with a starting date 1 Jan\u00ad uary 1999. It took 24 hours of negotiations for the deal to be reached. It covers the structure of the new exchange rate mecha\u00ad nism, the legal framework for the use of the euro and a stability and growth pact to en\u00ad sure \"durable budget discipline\" among par\u00ad ticipating countries. To bring the euro clos\u00ad er to reality, the new bank notes featuring images of Europe's architectural heritage were unveiled. European leaders were keen to show the link between this financial agreement and employment, and reaffirmed the impor\u00ad tance of equal opportunities. Mr John Bruton, the Irish premier said the Dublin Summit was about \"stable mon\u00ad ey, more jobs and safer streets\". In a Decla\u00ad ration on employment, adopted at the Sum\u00ad mit, they said \"there is no conflict between sound macroeconomics and budget policies on the one hand and strong and sustainable growth in output and employment on the other\". In the Declaration, governments promised \"vulnerable groups\" such as un\u00ad employed women, unemployed young peo\u00ad ple and the long\u00adterm unemployed \"partic\u00ad ular support\". They \"encouraged\" Member States to retake steps \"to desegregate the labour market and ensure the high represen\u00ad tation of women in part\u00adtime employment does not exclude them from training to en\u00ad hance their future employability\". To pro\u00ad mote jobs, they urged a reform of taxation and social protection systems to make them more \"employment\u00adfriendly\". Committing themselves to a European area of freedom, security and justice, EU leaders expressed their \"abhorrence\" of the sexual exploitation of children and traffick\u00ad ing in human beings and undertook \"to take all the necessary action to protect those most vulnerable in society\". They wel\u00ad comed the joint approach agreed by Mem\u00ad ber States to tackle offences against children and improve judicial cooperation and said Community funds had been set aside to fight \"these odious crimes\". Dutch Presidency opts for pragmatic approach The Dutch government announcing its work programme for its six months' Presi\u00ad dency, which started on 1 January, said it would adopt \"a pragmatic approach\". Holding the Presidency puts a country in the spotlight, said the Dutch government, but it explained that it will \"resist the temp\u00ad tation to advance topics that are primarily for domestic consumption\". \u2022 \u00b7 \u00b7 ",
        "Women OfGurope newsletter The realities of the European situation, it said, mean that top priority will be given to the IGC, and preparations for EMU and en\u00ad largement. It said it will continue reinforc\u00ad ing EU internal policies such as cooperation to combat racism, cross\u00adborder crime and drug trafficking. It promised to pay atten\u00ad tion to measures to promote equal treat\u00ad ment of women and men during the next six months and will also try to work towards a code of conduct to end the traffic in Social Affairs ministers support equality Two important equal treatment directives were given the go ahead by the Council of Social Affairs Ministers meeting in Decem\u00ad ber, following a political agreement. The first concerns the burden of proof in sex discrimination cases (see Women of Europe Newsletter No 64). This proposed EU direc\u00ad tive will share the burden of proof between the employer defending an action and the person complaining of discrimination. Under the proposed law, a person taking a case to court must establish facts \"from which it can be presumed that there has been direct or indirect discrimination\". They do not have to prove the employer in\u00ad tended to discriminate. It is then for the employer to prove that there had been no violation of the principle of equal treatment between women and men. The draft direc\u00ad tive also gives a definition of indirect dis\u00ad crimination for the first time in EU legisla\u00ad tion. The second proposal would bring the 1986 directive on equal treatment in occu\u00ad pational social security schemes into line with the Barber ruling of the European Court of Justice (see Women of Europe Newsletter No's 64 and 65). The draft direc\u00ad tive specifies that employers which set up supplementary pension schemes for their employees must respect the principle of equal treatment between women and men as laid down in Article 119 of the Rome Treaty. Ministers did not follow the European Commission in its suggestion to amend the 1976 equal treatment directive in the wake of the Kalanke ruling (see Women of Europe Newsletter No 61). The Commission pro\u00ad posed this amendment to affirm that posi\u00ad tive action measures are lawful on condition that the employer has the possibility to take account of the particular circumstances of an individual case. But ministers remained unconvinced that the ruling had called into question the validity of the 1976 directive. They said that any changes to the directive were premature and preferred to wait for further clarification from the European Court of Justice which is now reviewing a new case from Germany, the Marschall case (C\u00ad409/95). This concerns a promotion system giving priority to women in the land of Nordrhein\u00adWestfalen. No date has been set for the preliminary hearing expected lat\u00ad er this year. \u00b7 New Treaty takes shape \u03a4 I he Irish Presidency drew up a 140 page document for the Dublin Summit to outline progress made at the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) since it was launched over nine months ago (see Women of Europe Newsletter No 59). But, if anything, the document showed \"that deep divisions remain on the more sensitive issues concerning this major constitutional reform. The Irish Presi\u00ad * dency could not be faulted for its at\u00ad m tempt to secure \u00ab agreement at the \u00b7 I IGC talks. The \u00b7 outline document \u25a0 \u25a0\u00bfk. \u00ad\u00abA\u00e5%fc. ^L\u00b7 clearly lays out the Trii \u25a0 \u039b areas wh , erc V W M agreement has f^ajW m \u039b been reached or V w \u00c6 \u039b \u0397 is near. But the ^taB^^^PPaai more politically ^^ sensitive issues \u00b7 are left up to the Dutch * government which took over the presiden\u00ad cy of the EU Council of Ministers on 1 Jan\u00ad r uary and with it the responsibility to push \u00ab for an agreement by June 1997. The Irish \u00b7 Presidency admitted that \"the final trade offs \u00ab ... can come only next year (1997)\". \u25a0 The contentious issues go to the heart of this constitutional reform to update the s Maastricht Treaty. They in\u00ad volve the power balance be\u00ad tween the smaller and larger Member States, how far each government is pre\u00ad pared to develop policies at EU level in common with its colleagues and if it is ready to cede its national veto in favour of majority voting and over which is\u00ad sues. It also means a deci\u00ad sion on the notion of \"flex\u00ad ibility\" allowing Member States to cooperate more closely without being held back by more reticent members. In an interview with Women of Europe Newsletter, MEP Raymonde Dury (PSE, B) who was one of the main organisers of the public hearings on the IGC held at the European Parliament in 1996 and a keen follower of the IGC talks, said she regretted there had been \"little obvious progress\" in the negoti\u00ad ations. The \"major\" questions have not been dealt with, she said. Amongst the changes she would like to see is a clear legal distinction in the new Treaty between equality of opportunity and positive action. She wanted the employ\u00ad ment chapter to be strengthened giving the EU the possibility to go beyond coordina\u00ad tion and develop policy in this field and for citizen's rights to be clearly defined. Raymonde Dury Source: European Parliament Equality reinforced in Citizen's Europe In its outline document, the Irish Presi\u00ad dency recommended adding two new chap\u00ad ters. The first would create an area of \"free\u00ad dom, security and justice\" within the EU ensuring that basic human rights are upheld by Member States. The second would im\u00ad prove EU action on employment. A new article on non\u00addiscrimination would give the EU the right to take action banning discrimination based on \"sex, racial, ethnic or social origin, religious be\u00ad lief, disability, age or sexual orientation\". Additions are also proposed to promote equality between women and men and bet\u00ad ter guarantee the application of the princi\u00ad ple of equal treatment in employment. The right to equal pay for work of equal value would be written into the proposed Treaty and a new clause would also expressly allow Member States to maintain or adopt posi\u00ad tive action measures. Improved coordination of existing national policies is the approach adopted in the chapter on employ\u00ad ment. If adopted, the EU Council of Ministers would propose common guidelines and national measures would be assessed annually. There also seems to be majority support to incorporate the Social Pro\u00ad tocol into the new Treaty. IGC, a necessary step for enlargement Foreign policy is another key area where it is pro\u00ad posed to strengthen the EU's influence to reflect the fact the EU is the world's largest trading entity. Negotiations are expected to continue on a weekly basis in the hope that the June 1997 deadline for finalising the Treaty can be met, opening the way for enlargement. Raymonde Dury emphasised that ensuring stability and peace in the European conti\u00ad nent through enlargement is the real politi\u00ad cal impetus behind the IGC. \u00b7 \u2022 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 a \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7 ",
        "January \u25a0 February 1997 \u00b7 n' 67 parliament Committee on Women's Rights A hearing on Aids prevention in prosti\u00ad tution, organised by the Committee on Women's Rights in November, was told that the way laws on prostitution were enforced was a barrier to HIV preven\u00ad tion. Prostitution is a social reality, said Dr Ruugh Mak of Europap (European Interven\u00ad tion Projects Aids Prevention for Prostitutes, Ghent University Hospital/ As such, it has to be organised in a way that minimises the risk for HIV transmission. He urged specif\u00ad ic health and social services for prostitutes in every major town in Europe with appropri\u00ad ately trained staff. Pia Covre of the Commit\u00ad tee on Civil Rights for Prostitutes, Rome, said illegal immigrants were often forced into prostitution because of poverty. She called for free and anonymous access to health screening services for these people. Both speakers emphasised the need to fund pro\u00ad jects tackling the problem of Aids amongst prostitutes. During a first discussion to launch an EU\u00adwide campaign for zero tolerance of vi\u00ad olence against women, the link between prostitution and pornography and pornog\u00ad raphy and violence in the home was high\u00ad lighted by some Committee members. Separately, an opinion on the EU and the external dimension of human rights policy was adopted by the Committee calling for an inclusion of human dignity and the pro\u00ad tection of children. At its December meeting, Lean Rantanan from the Finnish Equality Ombudsman Insti\u00ad tution explained to the Committee how the Finnish system of job evaluation worked. She said such systems were essential to nar\u00ad row the wages gap between women and men because they evaluate the job and not the person carrying it out. But some Com\u00ad mittee members were concerned that such systems could also have a negative impact because the classification of jobs is not gen\u00ad der neutral. A report on the situation of the wives of self\u00ademployed workers was adopted with several amendments, notably to give mar\u00ad ried and non\u00admarried partners independent social security rights including sickness and retirement pensions, maternity benefits, ac\u00ad cess to training and the right to be repre\u00ad sented in professional bodies. Committee members in another opinion unanimously adopted, said the transposition at national level of EU equality laws was highly unsatisfactory. They asked the Com\u00ad mission to use its powers under the Treaty to ensure full transposition by governments. \u00b7 For further information: Mary Brennan European Commission, General Secretariat Avenue des Nervlens \u03b8, B-1049 Brussels Tel.: (32.2) 295 96 36 - Fax: (32.2) 296 59 57 Ending the innovation deficit The European Commission has unveiled its first Action Plan for Innovation in the EU.

        "ip97 ; European Year Against Racism T oday in the EU violent racist crimes are reported in all Member States with sickening regularity. This is coupled with an undercurrent of prejudice and discrimination in many walks of life and increased use of racist language in public political manifestations. All the EU institutions have repeatedly condemned racism over the last ten years in declarations, resolutions and reports. To give a clear signal of the depth of European level determination, 1997 was declared as the European Year Against Racism, Xenophobia and Anti-semi tism. Its aim is to provide a vehicle for the EU, to show that it is far from silent on this issue and wants to make a practical contribution to the fight against racism to complement local, regional and national action. The continuing presence of racism, xeno phobia and anti-semitism is a major chal lenge for European societies, which have at their core the principle of equal treatment and freedom from discrimination, said the European Commission. The EU itself was inspired by the need \"to build the founda tions of a wider and deeper community be tween peoples who had too often opposed each other in violent conflict\". The defense of human rights and fundamental freedoms, \"core values of the European integration project, cannot be separated from the rejec tion of racism\". Yehudi Menuhin: fighting racism through the arts In an interview with the Women of Europe Newsletter, Yehudi Menuhin, the world fa mous violinist who has dedicated his life to defending human rights, said \"if we really want to fight racism and xenophobia, born out of a hostile confrontation caused by our need to dominate everything that is foreign or non-conforming with our exclusive ig norance, whether it be collective or individ ual, it is necessary to address the deceitful nature of humankind\". From the beginning, he said, it has to be taught that \"just as the earth rotates and is not flat despite appearances, a person who is foreign enriches rather than threatens us. That creativity can only take place where there is difference\". His International Yehudi Menuhin Founda tion tries to prevent racism and xenophobia by introducing in primary schools an artis tic dimension through dance, mime, corpo ral expression and music. \"I am convinced that by giving children a chance to express their emotions through the arts and by giv ing those that are not represented the abili ty to communicate and be heard, much vi olence and incomprehension can be avoid ed.\" Irrational prejudice only part of the problem The Commission warned that the root causes of racism go well beyond blatant, ir rational prejudice. Other factors such as poor education, unemployment, poverty, exclusion and urban decay also contribute to create a climate conducive to racism. Broader cultural factors such as increased individualism and uncertainty about the fu ture also play a role in making people more susceptible to racist prejudice. The EU Council of Ministers also recog nised that an increase in economic difficul ties excludes many in the EU from any eco nomic, social and political participation and represents fertile ground for racist and xenophobic attitudes. This is why action against racism will be effective only if it is embedded in a wider range of policies, explained the Commis sion, promising that it will be particularly vigilant in the implementation of all its policies to see how they can contribute to the fight against racism. Prevention urged The Commission wants to see a strength ening of legal provision to ensure that in all countries there are effective sanctions to racist behaviour. This could be done through EU level leg islation designed to guarantee minimum levels of protection against discrimination throughout the Community. 1997 A survey of existing provi sions in Member States CICIClin' showed that incitement to racial hatred constituted some form of offence in most of them and that most sanctioned the circulation and distrib ution of racist and xenophobic material. There were, however, considerable differ ences in how Member States legislated against racist organisations. Prevention must be the key aim of any strategy against racism, urged the Commis sion. Prosecution and coercion have an in dispensable role to play, it said, but long- term strategies must create the conditions where all members of society realise that the ethnic and cultural diversity of contempo rary Europe is ultimately a source of mea surable benefit. The Commission said it was important to realize that no social or cultur al group can be certain never to become the victim of racism. Projects to be funded The European Year will be launched at a conference organised by the Commission under the auspices of the Dutch Presidency in The Hague on 30 and 31 January. Following this date, numerous activities will take place in all Member States ranging from local projects, regional and national initiatives, national and EU campaigns and high-profile events. National coordinating committees have been set up by each Mem ber State. Organisations already involved in anti- racism work can use the Year to publicise their work. Political, sport and cultural events are expected. The Year will encour age cooperation and partnerships between NGOs, the business and political world. It will include information, publicity, communication, awareness raising, training activities, prizes and competitions, studies and surveys. The Commission will co-fi nance some of these activities through a call for projects early this year. The Commission has already funded a se ries of projects in the past focusing exclu sively on combating racism with the sup port of the European Parliament. Their aim was the prevention of racist violence and youth delinquency, better monitoring of racist inci- European year dents, revitalization of urban neighbourhoods and pro motion of local democracy and participation. The Commission has also pro posed the creation of a Eu- I O C \u00cc S I TI ropean Monitoring Centre on Racism, Xenophobia. This follows the 1996 Flo rence European Council which called for a speedy establishment of the Centre. A deci sion setting out the details is expected under the Dutch Presidency. The European Year Against Racism should provide a clear message against racism, xenophobia and anti-semitism and develop strategies to ensure that such be haviour becomes a thing of the past. \u00b7 For information and the list of the national coordination committees: European Commission Unit V/D/4 Rue Joseph II 37, B-1049 Brussels Fax: (32.2) 295 18 99 Editor in Chief - Director of publication: Postal address: Rue de la Lol 200, B-1049 Bruxelles/W Productio lazy, Head of Section, Information for Women - Directorate-General X Contact address: Rue de Treves 120, B-1C mation, Communication.
