(2) The new open method of coordination in the field of social inclusion as well as the structural indicators to be produced for the annual synthesis report increase the need for comparable and timely cross-sectional and longitudinal data on income distri- bution and on the level and composition of poverty and social exclusion for establishing reliable and relevant comparisons between the Member States. (3) Decision No 50/2002/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 December 2001 establishing a programme of Community action to encourage cooperation between Member States to combat social exclusion ( 4 ) has established, under Action 1.2 of Strand 1 concerning the \u2018 analysis of social exclusion \u2019 , the necessary conditions in relation to the funding of measures concerning the collection and dissemination of comparable statistics and in particular supporting the improvement of surveys and analysis of poverty and social exclusion. (4) The best method of assessing the situation as regards income, poverty and social exclusion is to compile Community statistics using harmonised methods and definitions. Some Member States may require additional time to adapt their systems to these harmonised methods and definitions. \u25bc B 2003R1177 \u2014 EN \u2014 11.12.2008 \u2014 002.001 \u2014 2 ( 1 ) OJ C 103 E, 30.4.2002, p. 198, and amended proposal of 15 November 2002.

        "(5) To reflect changes taking place in the distribution of income and in the level and composition of poverty and social exclusion, the statistics need to be updated annually. (6) To investigate major issues of social concern, especially new issues requiring specific research, the Commission needs cross- sectional and longitudinal micro-data at household and personal level. (7) Priority should be given to the production of timely and comparable annual cross-sectional data on income, poverty and social exclusion. (8) Flexibility in terms of data sources, in particular the use of existing national data sources, whether they be surveys or registers, and national sample designs should be encouraged and the integration of the new source(s) into established national statistical systems should be promoted. (9) Commission Regulation (EC) No 831/2002 of 17 May 2002 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 322/97 on Community statistics, concerning access to confidential data for scientific purposes ( 1 ) has established, for the purpose of enabling statistical conclusions to be drawn for scientific purposes, the conditions pursuant to which access to confidential data trans- mitted to the Community authority may be granted. (10) The production of specific Community statistics is governed by the rules set out in Council Regulation (EC) No 322/97 of 17 February 1997 on Community Statistics ( 2 ). (11) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission ( 3 ). (12) The Statistical Programme Committee (SPC) has been consulted in accordance with Article 3 of Council Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom ( 4 ), HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1 Aim The aim of this Regulation shall be to establish a common framework for the systematic production of Community statistics on income and living conditions (hereinafter referred to as EU-SILC), encompassing comparable and timely cross-sectional and longitudinal data on income and on the level and composition of poverty and social exclusion at national and European levels. Comparability of data between Member States shall be a fundamental objective and shall be pursued through the development of methodo- logical studies from the outset of EU-SILC data collection, carried out in close cooperation between the Member States and Eurostat. \u25bc B 2003R1177 \u2014 EN \u2014 11.12.2008 \u2014 002.001 \u2014 3 ( 1 ) OJ L 133, 18.5.2002, p. 7.

        "Article 3 Scope The EU-SILC shall cover cross-sectional data on income, poverty, social exclusion and other living conditions as well as longitudinal data restricted to income, labour and a limited number of non- monetary indicators of social exclusion. Article 4 Time reference 1. The cross-sectional and longitudinal data shall be produced annually as from 2004. In any given Member State, the timing of collection shall be kept the same from one year to the next as far as possible. \u25bc M1 2. By way of derogation from paragraph 1, the Czech Republic, Germany, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Slovenia, Slovakia and the United Kingdom may start the annual cross-sectional and longitudinal data collection in 2005. This authorisation is subject to the condition that those Member States shall supply comparable data for the year 2004 for the cross-sectional common European Union indicators which were adopted by the Council before 1 January 2003 in the context of the open method of coordi- nation and which can be derived on the basis of the EU-SILC instrument. \u25bc B 3. The income reference period shall be a 12-month period. This may be a fixed 12-month period (such as the previous calendar or tax year) or a moving 12-month period (such as the 12 months preceding the interview) or be based on a comparable measure. 4. If a fixed income reference period is used, fieldwork for the survey component shall be carried out over a limited period as close as possible to the income reference period or to the tax declaration period so as to minimise time lag between income and current variables. Article 5 Characteristics of the data 1. In order to permit multi-dimensional analysis at the level of households and persons and in particular investigation of major issues of social concern that are new and require specific research, all household and individual data shall be linkable in the cross-sectional component. Similarly, all household and personal data shall be linkable in the long- itudinal component. Longitudinal micro-data do not need to be linkable with cross-sectional micro-data. The longitudinal component shall cover at least four years. 2. In order to reduce response burdens, to help in income imputation procedures and to test data quality, the national authorities shall have access to relevant administrative data sources in accordance with Regu- lation (EC) No 322/97. \u25bc B 2003R1177 \u2014 EN \u2014 11.12.2008 \u2014 002.001 \u2014 5 ",
        "Article 6 Data required 1. The target primary areas and corresponding reference periods to be covered by the cross-sectional and the longitudinal components are laid down in Annex I. \u25bc M3 2. Target secondary areas shall be included every year starting from 2005 in the cross-sectional component only. One secondary area shall be covered each year. Measures defining such target areas, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 14(3). \u25bc B Article 7 Collection unit 1. The reference population for the EU-SILC shall be all private households and their current members residing in the territory of the Member State at the time of the data collection. 2. The main information collected shall pertain to (a) private households, including data on household size, composition and basic characteristics of its current members; and (b) persons aged 16 and over. 3. The collection unit, together with the mode of collection for household and personal information, shall be as laid down in Annex I. Article 8 Sampling and tracing rules 1. Cross-sectional and longitudinal data shall be based on nationally representative probability samples. 2. By way of exception to paragraph 1, Germany shall supply cross- sectional data based on a nationally representative probability sample for the first time for the year 2008. For the year 2005, Germany shall supply data of which 25 % shall be based on probability sampling and 75 % shall be based on quota samples, the latter to be progressively replaced by random selection so as to achieve fully representative prob- ability sampling by 2008. For the longitudinal component, Germany shall supply for the year 2006 one third of longitudinal data (data for years 2005 and 2006) based on probability sampling and two thirds based on quota samples. For the year 2007, half of the longitudinal data relating to years 2005, 2006 and 2007 shall be based on probability sampling and half on quota samples. After 2007 all longitudinal data shall be based on probability sampling. \u25bc M3 3. In the longitudinal component, individuals included in the initial sample, namely sample persons, shall be followed over the duration of the panel. Every sample person who has moved to a private household within the national boundaries shall be followed up to the new location in accordance with tracing rules and procedures to be defined by the Commission. Those measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 14(3). \u25bc B 2003R1177 \u2014 EN \u2014 11.12.2008 \u2014 002.001 \u2014 6 ",
        "Article 9 Sample sizes 1. On the basis of various statistical and practical considerations and the precision requirements for the most critical variables, the minimum effective sample sizes to be achieved shall be as set out in the table in Annex II. 2. Sample size for the longitudinal component refers, for any pair of consecutive years, to the number of households successfully interviewed in the first year in which all or at least a majority of the household members aged 16 or over are successfully interviewed in both the years. 3. Member States using registers for income and other data may use a sample of persons rather than a sample of complete households in the interview survey. The minimum effective sample size in terms of the number of persons aged 16 or over to be interviewed in detail shall be taken as 75 % of the figures shown in columns 3 and 4 of the table in Annex II, for the cross-sectional and longitudinal components respec- tively. Information on income and other data shall also be collected for the household of each selected respondent and for all its members. Article 10 Transmission of data 1. Member States shall transmit to the Commission (Eurostat) in the form of micro-data files weighted cross-sectional and longitudinal data which has been fully checked, edited and imputed in relation to income. Member States shall transmit the data in electronic form, in conformity with an appropriate technical format to be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 14(2). 2. Regarding the cross-sectional component, Member States shall transmit the micro-data files relating to year of survey N to the Commission (Eurostat), preferably within 11 months after the end of the data collection. The extreme deadline for the transmission of micro- data to Eurostat shall be 30 November (N+1) for Member States where data are collected at the end of year N or through a continuous survey or through registers and 1 October (N+1) for other Member States. Together with the micro-data files, Member States shall transmit social cohesion indicators based on the cross-sectional sample of year N which will be included in the annual Spring report of year (N+2) to the European Council. The dates of transmission of data also apply for the transmission of comparable data for cross-sectional common EU indicators for those Member States which start annual collection of data after 2004 in accordance with Article 4(2). 3. As for the longitudinal component, Member States shall transmit the micro-data files up to year N to the Commission (Eurostat) preferably within 15 months after the end of the fieldwork. The mandatory deadline for the transmission of micro-data to Eurostat shall be the end of March (N+2), each year starting from the second year of EU-SILC.

The actual sample sizes will have to be larger to the extent that the design effects exceed 1,0 and to compensate for all kinds of non-response. Furthermore, the sample size refers to the number of valid households which are households for which, and for all members of which, all or nearly all the required information has been obtained \u25bc M1 2003R1177 \u2014 EN \u2014 11.12.2008 \u2014 002.001 \u2014 14 "
