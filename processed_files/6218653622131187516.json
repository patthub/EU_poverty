        "II Foreword By S\u00e9amus Boland President of the Diversity Europe Group (October 2020 \u2013 April 2023) European Economic and Social Committee It is with great pleasure that I present this study, which was commissioned by the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC), at the request of the Diversity Europe Group. In soliciting a review of how civil society organisations (CSOs) in Europe responded to the Covid-19 pandemic and on how they were impacted, our Group sought to address two significant and inter-related issues. Firstly, to raise awareness of the essential socio-economic role fulfilled by CSOs in their communities during this health crisis. Secondly, to reflect on the post Covid-19 civic space and on the types of societies and economies we wish to create. As is clearly illustrated by the qualitative and quantitative results of this study, CSOs have acted as a bulwark at the local and community levels, providing incalculable assistance, notably in the provision of essential health and social care services. Working on behalf of or in addition to local authorities, CSOs applied their creativity, adaptability and energy to finding innovative solutions for the common good. The speed with which CSOs in European countries sprang into action and mustered community solidarity is truly impressive and illustrates the dedication of these organisations to the well-being of their communities! As the Group within the EESC which at the European level represents this breadth of CSOs, I considered it our duty to bring to light their prodigious contribution. The second dimension that this study raises, relates to our European societies and communities post Covid. We are fortunate enough in Europe to be able to imagine our lives in the aftermath of this pandemic. However, with opportunities, there are also responsibilities. As representatives of European civil society, it will be our responsibility to participate in shaping this post Covid era and to making our communities more sustainable, resilient, equitable, productive and socially just, whilst also upholding the highest levels of democratic governance, respect for rights and the rule of law. The ability to effectively carry out this role will depend on public and institutional support to rebuild and strengthen the capacities of CSOs, which as illustrated by this study, have been seriously undermined during the pandemic. Rendering European civil society more sustainable, involving them in the design and implementation of the Recovery Plan for Europe and helping them to redesign their own structures, should be the prerogative of all of us. In this context, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the many Members of the Diversity Europe Group, who directly contributed to this study. ",
        "III Ultimately, the Covid-19 pandemic has taught us one fundamental lesson: we need and are reliant on a well-functioning civil society. A civil society that can innovate, take ownership and drive community resilience. What remains to be seen, is the extent to which the positive legacies of this health crisis, such as greater respect for care, wellbeing and community goods, as well as increased mutual solidarity, will outlive the pandemic. This belongs to the future and that future belongs to all of us! S\u00e9amus Boland President of the Diversity Europe Group ",
        "IV Abstract As the COVID-19 pandemic hits societies and economies, bringing a global and unprecedented public health and social crisis, civil society organisations (CSOs) are responding by providing frontline help and defending the rights of people across the world. At the same time, CSOs have faced themselves profound impacts that may harm their capacities to continue playing their central roles in delivering services, advocating for rights and protecting the most fragile, while safeguarding participatory democracy and civic debate in the near future. In this context, the present study commissioned by the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) at the request of the Diversity Europe Group has a twofold goal: 1) to shed light on the effects of the pandemic and the measures put in place by European countries to contain the virus spread on CSOs and their activities; 2) to collect quantitative and qualitative relevant information about the reactions of CSOs across Europe, through a mixed method combining desk search and the administration of an in-depth online survey of the EESC Diversity Group members, as well as similar CSOs as per scope and mission. The resulting mapping of new and adapted services and initiatives carried out by the CSOs participating in the study, triangulated with the findings of several recent studies and reports, allows for a thorough understanding of the main challenges faced by the CSOs and their members and users, as well as the enormous contribution made by CSOs in helping to cope with the consequences of the pandemic. Moreover, the study highlights key topics, such as the lack of stable funding streams, legal frameworks and adequate resources and skillsets to take full advantage of the ongoing digital transformation while leaving no one behind, which will require future reflection and bold political decisions to make sure that CSOs' capacities are maintained and strengthened in the post-COVID-19 recovery phase.

        "V Executive summary The COVID-19 pandemic is having a profound impact on civil society and its organized forms. According to the EESC 1 , civil society is a collective term for all types of social action, by individuals or groups, that do not emanate from the state and are not run by it and the uniqueness of this concept is its dynamic nature, that creates an opportunity to strengthen confidence in the democratic system, favouring the climate for reform and innovation. It is broadly recognized that Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) were some of the frontrunners supporting populations and organisations in Europe during the first wave of the pandemic, but they were and are still also impacted by the consequent restrictive measures adopted in many countries. The twofold aim of this commissioned study is to (1) map the responses of European CSOs to the COVID-19 crisis in order to identify their inputs and contributions and learn from possible shortcomings and (2) to outline major consequences and challenges for CSOs in the aftermath of the crisis. The methodology adopted by the authors relies on a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods of data collection and analysis. The main presented findings are based on an online survey developed and disseminated between the end of August and October 2020, that gathered 112 eligible and meaningful contributions from EESC Diversity Group members and other CSOs across Europe. The geographical coverage of respondents is also very positive, as 26 out of the current 27 European Union countries, plus additional European (outside the European Union) countries participated with relevant contributions to this study. Nevertheless, it is important to stress the specific focus of the study on CSOs belonging to the EESC Diversity Europe Group and others deemed similar for their purposes and missions, thus the findings cannot be considered as representative for the whole community of European CSOs. It is also important, from a methodological point of view, to highlight the choice made by the commissioning EESC Group to follow a thematic and content-based approach, rather than by sector and by country, thus bringing as a result a mapping of new or adapted initiatives put in place by the study participants across the six EESC categories (Associational Life - Consumers and Environment \u2013 Farmers \u2013 Liberal Professions - SMEs crafts and family business - Social Economy). Consequently, the resulting mapping reflects the variety of sectors, sizes and scopes of such categories which is an inherent characteristic of the Diversity Europe Group itself. Though, a wide range of types of stakeholders and respective interests are represented among the members and/or the target groups of the CSOs in the sample, with a predominance of groups in vulnerable contexts or conditions, which makes sense as such groups have been indeed among the most affected by the sudden implementation of the restrictive measures to combat the spread of the virus and in many cases have been hit by the closure of publicly provided services they were heavily relying upon. The CSOs that responded are distributed throughout the 6 main categories of activity acknowledged by Group III of EESC and mentioned above, with a higher predominance of those involved in Associational Life and Social Economy. In addition to the survey, an extensive desk research was performed, mainly to allow varied sources of information and opinions on the areas where less representation was gathered from the consultation. The results of the survey spot interesting lights on two main types of challenges: first, the societal challenges that the CSOs participating in the study have observed as the most pressing issues the 1 EESC (1999), The Civil Society organized at European level.

        "VI pandemic raised in the society and they helped tackle; and second, those organizational, economic and political challenges the CSOs found themselves to face with as consequences of the emergency state declared in most of the countries. The main societal challenges that the members and groups targeted by the CSOs consulted have been confronted with are: the interruption of essential services during the lockdown, with specific emphasis on the disruption of several health and care services; the sharp increase of people in vulnerable socio- economic situations due to job loss, sharpened inequalities and impoverishment; the accentuation of discrimination phenomena such as ageism; the lack of protection against domestic violence; the worsened conditions of people suffering from intellectual, mental, physical and learning disabilities; the effects of digital divide, digital illiteracy and correlated inequalities in access and capacity to take advantage of the remote opportunities for learning, working and service provision across the population; the threats posed by the pandemic on food supply and agricultural workforce shrinking in several regions; and, overall, the disruption of economic activities having a heavy impact on SMEs and liberal professions, and more in general, on trade relations and consumers\u2019 habits. On a different perspective, the main challenges for the CSOs\u2019 operations and mission included the leapfrog shift to telework and the varied degree of preparedness of CSOs to adapt to it depending on their size, structure and types of services offered, which in some cases was affected by the low digital literacy of workers and users and the lack of appropriate digital tools, equipment and infrastructure; the sudden increase of the demand for basic services such as shelters, food, protection equipment, etc. in their communities, as well as he interruption of many health and social care services that in several regions CSOs are traditionally providing in conjunction to or on behalf of the public authorities; the need to keep their informative services up and running and in many cases also reinforce them due to the huge increase of requests for clear, up-to-date and easy-to-access information about the pandemic evolution, the restrictions, and the extraordinary services and aids put in place. In addition, although to different extents, CSOs have had to face reduction in donations, impossibility to arrange fund-raising events or have decided to waive their association fees to their members struggling with the economic crisis. This, coupled with the interruption of many non-essential projects, activities and services that were in the past an important revenue source for them, has meant for many a considerable shrinking in economic resources. Departing from these challenges, the impacts perceived by the CSOs, on the economic and organizational perspectives are reported and debriefed. As one of the major conclusions, several CSOs across Europe are calling the attention of European institutions on the financing difficulties they are facing and will likely continue to undermine their capacity to fulfil their mission in the aftermath of the crisis. Consistently with this, 33% of the respondents stated that the CSOs they represent have seen their operations strongly affected by COVID-19, 30% of them expect lower revenues in 2020 than in 2019, and 42% incurred higher costs for either the rise in demand for their services or the need to invest in IT or physical equipment to adapt facilities. In response to the pandemic and the containment measures, 101 out of the 112 participants presented newly launched or adapted initiatives which witness the breadth of coverage and swift capacity to adapt demonstrated by the CSOs as well as their main concerns for the near future and for their further work and participation in society. These aspects are mapped per EESC category of activity and analysed in detail in this report. Namely, the mapping findings are based on the responses received from: 42 CSOs ",
        "VII that recognized themselves as either belonging to (for the EESC members) or assimilable (for the non EESC members) to the \u201cAssociational Life\u201d category, 9 from \u201cConsumers and Environment\u201d, 9 from \u201cFarmers\u201d, 6 from \u201cLiberal Professions\u201d, 3 from \u201cSMEs, Crafts and Family Business\u201d, 24 from \u201cSocial Economy\u201d and 8 from other categories. Lastly, a catalogue of some of those successful initiatives is also presented in Annex 3, as a rich collection of examples of the varied and complex interventions of organized civil society during the pandemic. In terms of next steps to the work developed, two main themes were clustered as relevant for deeper analysis and for future reflections: the threats to the future role of CSOs in participatory democracy and their capacity to advocate for human and basic rights; the challenges that could hamper the CSOs\u2019 ability to recover from the crisis and be sustainable over time imperilling their capacity to protect the most fragile from social exclusion and poverty. Building on these reflections and also on the main conclusions retrieved and clustered per area of activity of the CSOs involved in the study, six main areas of recommendations are further elaborated. In summary, the study offers solid basis to argument the necessity that in the post-COVID-19 recovery, both European institutions and national and regional governments, concentrate their political efforts and financial resources to: \uf0b7 Foster and encourage new solidarity and new form of social activism while promoting links and cross-fertilisation mechanisms between newly emerged groups and established CSOs. \uf0b7 Tackle the risks and take advantage of the opportunities brought by digitalization. \uf0b7 Promote youth engagement and innovative programmes to encourage job creation linked to civic action. \uf0b7 Equip CSOs with the needed skills and resources to take the most advantage from networking, national and international cooperation. \uf0b7 Relieve bureaucracy and administrative burdens. \uf0b7 Engage CSOs in the design of climate- and environment-friendly recovery plans. With this overall framework, the main picture emerging from the study is the essential role of CSOs to the next recovery period and the need to reinforce their capability and sustainability towards the promotion of a fairer, more equal and sustainable society. This makes it even more important to secure mechanisms for governments\u2019 accountability and open and transparent decision-making processes, allowing CSOs to keep their role of vigilant actors, safeguarding rights and nurturing an open civic space, which is the utmost condition for lively democracies to progress.

        "The response of civil society organisations to face the COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent restrictive measures adopted in Europe 1 1. Introduction The area of play of the present study concerns the reaction of Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) to the COVID-19 pandemic and to the consequent measures adopted in Europe. To this purpose the study authors adopt as guidance definition of \u201ccivil society\u201d the one emanating from the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) 2 , \u201cCivil society is a collective term for all types of social action, by individuals or groups, that do not emanate from the state and are not run by it. What is particular to the concept of civil society is its dynamic nature, the fact that it denotes both situation and action. The participatory model of civil society also provides an opportunity to strengthen confidence in the democratic system so that a more favourable climate for reform and innovation can develop\u201d. The World Bank has a concordant definition, conceptualising civil society as \u201cthe wide array of non- governmental and not for profit organizations that have a presence in public life, express the interests and values of their members and others, based on ethical, cultural, political, scientific, religious or philanthropic considerations\u201d 3 . Similarly, UNDP has stated that the \u201cCivil society is an arena of voluntary collective actions around shared interests, purposes and values distinct from families, state and profit seeking institutions. The term civil society includes the full range of formal and informal organizations that are outside the state and the market \u2013 including social movements, volunteer involving organizations, mass-based membership organizations, faith-based groups, NGOs, and community-based organizations, as well as communities and citizens acting individually and collectively.\u201d 4 Based on this concept of civil society, the EESC defines CSOs as in abstract terms as the sum of all organisational structures whose members have objectives and responsibilities that are of general interest and who also act as mediators between the public authorities and citizens. Their effectiveness is crucially dependent on the extent to which their players are prepared to help achieve consensus through public and democratic debate and to accept the outcome of a democratic policy-making process. In this frame, the EESC Diversity Europe Group (Group III) plays an essential role, as it includes \u201crepresentatives and stakeholders of civil society, particularly in the economic, civic, professional and cultural field\u201d, such as \u201cfarmers' organisations, small businesses, the crafts sector, the professions, social economy actors (mutualities, cooperatives, foundations and non-profit associations), consumer organisations, environmental organisations, and associations representing the family, women's and gender equality issues, youth, minority and underprivileged groups, persons with disabilities, the voluntary sector and the medical, legal, scientific and academic communities\u201d 5 ,.. The main aim of this group is to achieve actual economic, social and participatory democracy in the European Union (EU), through a triple-based set of objectives: Diversity in democracy : at the 1295 th meeting of the Ministers\u2019 Deputies on 27 September 2017, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe adopted a set of guidelines 6 for civil participation in political decision making, underlining the centrality of citizens\u2019 participation to democracy, which is in 2 EESC (2020), Participatory Democracy.

        "2 turn essential to protect European values in light of the growingly spread of populism that makes evident the polarization of society and the need to put in place or strengthen effective mechanisms to preserve democracy across Europe. Consensus building: it is of utmost important to preserve and reinforce the role of CSOs as intermediaries in many economic and societal contexts, whereas the active participation of civil society proves to help find common grounds and advance the diverse interests of counterparts. European civic engagement - local action : organised groups exist to highlight the needs of their members and for the benefit of wider society; therefore, they act as a key channel of participation and multiplier for the engagement of citizens 7 . In a complex social landscape, challenges are massive and require unprecedented resource mobilisation. This can be achieved only working in a cross-sectoral and multi-disciplinary manner in order to identify solutions. Organised civil society is a catalyst for social innovation, a movement which has contributed to design welfare systems resulting in new policies, structures, products, services and working methods. The participation of civil society is needed now more than ever \u2013 but true social innovation only happens when organised civil society is involved 8 . As it can be perceived from its objectives, the Group III of the EESC has a broad and inclusive mission, which is reinforced by the fact that it includes organisations representing social and economic players that are not social partners in the strict sense of the term (which are represented under the umbrella of Group I and II, respectively gathering the Employers and the Workers), such as non-governmental organisations (NGOs), community-based organisations and religious communities. Even before the advent of the health, social and economic crisis brought into the scene by the spread of coronavirus Sars-COV-2, CSOs were facing a number of barriers preventing them to fulfil their role in the society, as decision makers were in some cases reluctant to engage with civil society 9 . Notable progresses were made in the last years, which have seen the remarkable rise of civil society as a global phenomenon and its increased influence in sectors such as international affairs and development, 10 as well as health policy making and care service delivery 11 . Nevertheless, governmental institutions across Europe still lack full capacity to harness the democratizing potential of civil society consultation and engagement. 12 Fewer funding opportunities and decreased financing from private and public donors for certain activities and areas aggravate this scenario: CSOs themselves are among the victims of inequalities and weaknesses in the system, as they witness a shrinking in their space for action and influence. As the EESC highlighted in their recent proposals for post-COVID-19 crisis reconstruction and recovery, \u201cthe current and future ability of CSOs to respond to needs is threatened by often scarce and fluctuating resources\u201d. This poses the urgent necessity of ensuring reliable funding mechanisms for CSOs. 7 Council of Europe (2019), Code of Good Practice for Civil Participation in the Decision-making Process, adopted by the Conference of INGOs on 30 October 2019.

        "The response of civil society organisations to face the COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent restrictive measures adopted in Europe 3 Furthermore, growing administrative hurdles and the redirection of funding towards certain CSOs and government-sponsored NGOs 13 pose considerable obstacles to their work across the EU and beyond. Today, with many countries facing the second COVID-19 wave and a worryingly sharp increase of cases and hospitalizations that are putting under renovated pressure healthcare and welfare systems, such as Spain and France, governments and organisations at all levels (international, national, regional, municipal) are in urgent need of information to support their decision-making to manage the health, social and economic crises brought about by COVID-19 outbreaks. Even more, CSOs need to have their role as active intermediaries in the democratic process reinforced, to fulfil their mission of advocacy and of indirect representation of the citizens in the societal challenges, which is now increasingly necessary in the context of the pandemic and the consequent economic crisis and social discussion currently ongoing. Despite an increased demand for services from the target groups CSOs serve, the majority of them had to adapt their offer, or even reduce or cease to operate their programs. On the other side, many of these organizations have also made human and material resources available to face the crisis, started offering new services and initiated public campaigns of support and/or advocacy. They fulfilled an essential social role and it is important to map it and evaluate its impact as well as their capacity to continue to perform it in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. 1.1 Purpose and structure of the study The present document is meant to provide a comprehensive view of how CSOs related to EESC Diversity Group members or similar as per scope and mission reacted to the COVID-19 pandemic and to the consequent restrictive measures adopted in Europe. This study maps the responses of European CSOs to the current crisis in order to identify their inputs and contributions and learn from possible shortcomings, also outlining the major consequences and challenges for CSOs in the aftermath of the crisis, aiming at an increased visibility of CSOs actions and their benefit for European societies. The present report follows the subsequent structure. Chapter 2 summarises the overall study methodological approach and the data collection process, including the online survey administered to the EESC Diversity Group members and other CSOs across Europe and beyond and which results have been complemented and substantiated through tailored desk search. Chapter 3 is the core chapter gathering the findings of the study, specifically the economic and organizational impacts generated by the pandemic and the governmental responses on the CSOs, providing also an overview of the reactions put in place by the CSOs that participated in the study and a more in-depth analysis of such initiatives by mapping them according to the core activity area the CSOs declared to belong to. Lastly, Chapter 4 presents the recommendations formulated by the study authors based on the knowledge gained about the consequences of the pandemic on the future of the organized European civil society, as they are perceived by the survey respondents. The content of this section is rooted with references to sources identified through a desk search and, most importantly, on the insights provided by the respondents when consulted about their views and concerns in relation to the mission and role of CSOs in the post-COVID-19 recovery and the way this unprecedented global challenge will eventually change their capacity to foster civic dialogue and participatory democracy.

        "6 2.2 Online survey In consideration of the short timeline of the assignment, the cornerstone of the data collection methodology chosen for this study was an online questionnaire aimed to identify the response of CSOs to the new challenges brought by the pandemic, namely the actions they took to respond to societal needs arisen as a consequence of the COVID-19 crisis. As for the structure of the survey, it was composed by 4 sections, grouped in 2 phases (see Annex 1). Phase 1 had the purpose of MAPPING . It includes sections 1 and 2 and respondents had time to fill them out until the 15 th of September (nevertheless upon request of several CSOs\u2019 networks and with the aim to grant the new EESC Diversity Group members, the study team and the EESC study responsible officer have agreed to keep the whole survey open until the Phase 2 deadline). Section 1 intended to profile the CSOs that participated in the survey and asked for information that characterizes each organization and its area of work. Section 2 was focused on the new or adapted activities the CSOs have developed on the ground, namely those in three main areas: \uf0b7 directed to target groups in need of support due to the COVID-19 pandemic. \uf0b7 actions of information and support to members and target groups. \uf0b7 advocacy and awareness-raising measures towards public authorities. If the respondents filled in Section 2, they were then eligible to pass on to the second phase of the survey and provide more detailed information regarding these new or adapted initiatives the CSO had implemented, their societal impact and the impact of the pandemic on the CSO. Phase 2 intended to IDENTIFY and understand the impact of CSO\u2019s activities. The expected deadline to complete sections 3 and 4 was settled on the 1 st of October 2020. Nevertheless, in consideration of the end of the EESC term of office and in order to allow more time for respondents (with particular attention to the new EESC members) to fill out the survey, the final deadline has been extended until the 9 th of October 2020. Section 3 asked for more details concerning the new activities and initiatives implemented during the pandemic and mapped in phase 1. Specifically, the objective was to collect more in-depth information concerning their rationale, scope and their impacts on members and target groups, the human and material resources involved, costs, revenues, obstacles and accomplishments 14 . Lastly, Section 4 intended to understand the impact of the pandemic in each CSO, mainly asking for the challenges they had to cope with during this period and the ways the COVID-19 crisis and the consequent measures affected their role in society. The respondents were expected to spend around 15-30 minutes to fill out all sections of this survey. The invitation to complete the survey have been sent to all the 103 members composing the EESC Diversity Group (at the time when the survey was launched), as well as to the following networks: \uf0b7 Stakeholders Network on Age-Friendly Environments (SHAFE) ; \uf0b7 European Covenant on Demographic Change ; \uf0b7 Caritas Network ; \uf0b7 PROgramma Mattone Internazionale Salute (PROMIS) , Italian network of health regional and local authorities promoting multi-stakeholder international cooperation in health and social care domain; 14 The questions related to operational aspects of the organizations were not mandatory for those CSOs that do not have access to the related information.

Furthermore, in order to increase coverage and with the intent to pursue the best possible balance in terms of geographical and area coverage, tailored posts have been broadly disseminated on social media (namely, LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter) with the support of the EESC communication staff and the survey was sent to the European CSO networks members of the EESC Liaison Group that spread it around their national members. On the 2 nd of October, the EESC staff has also invited the new Diversity Group members (50) to participate in the study and/or help reach out possible respondents among CSOs in their national networks of influence. Since the results of the survey represent the main source of information and learnings that guided to the formulation of recommendations, aimed to define the best strategies and measures necessary to support the CSOs for the coming period, ensuring the broadest coverage possible in terms of geographical representations, as well as diversity of types and scopes of the CSOs represented in the sample, has been considered a central criterion to shape the methodology. For this reason, all the respondents, regardless they were formal EESC members or not, have been asked to state whether they recognize their organization as potentially affiliated to one of the following activity areas which represent the various economic and social interests of organised EU civil society in the EESC: \uf0b7 Associational Life \uf0b7 Consumers and Environment \uf0b7 Farmers \uf0b7 Liberal Professions \uf0b7 SMEs, Crafts and Family Business \uf0b7 Social Economy. In the event the respondents did not express any specific choice and whereas possible, the authors have assigned their input to the EESC categories most aligned with their specific field of activity. As a consequence, only a small number of survey respondents have been kept in the residual group \u201cOther\u201d as they did not consider that the scope and mission of their organizations were categorizable in any of those above and the authors considered that in fact they were fitting none of the EESC categories. Such categorization has allowed the study team to gain an in-depth understanding of the diversity of problems and challenges faced by CSOs operating in different sectors of the economy and society. The lack of capacity to provide structured and consistent categorizations by either type of organization or area of activity is the major limitation affecting any study which investigates the heterogeneous, varied and multi-dimensional complexity of the organized civil society. If it is clear that academics and practitioners find it difficult to agree which organisations are rightly included among CSOs 15 , the same difficulty is encountered by representatives of CSOs that, in consideration of their mission and scope, might be affiliate to both the EESC areas Social Economy and Associational Life, for instance. 15 Kohler-Koch B, Quittkat C (2009), What is civil society and who represents civil society in the EU?

Although the contractual arrangements, timeframe and scope of the study did not per se allow for a systematic review, the study authors have made an extensive search through official reports from international institutions, CSOs\u2019 networks and European institution, as well as web articles and scientific papers whereas relevant, with the threefold aim to: \uf0b7 Supply the reader with broader statistics to support key statements on trends and patterns; \uf0b7 Account for the wealth and variety of research studies and surveys conducted by independent bodies and CSOs\u2019 networks, in the attempt to document the ongoing impacts affecting the operations of CSOs across the EU and worldwide; \uf0b7 Ground conclusions and recommendations drawn from the results of the survey by linking to internationally acknowledged sources. To these purposes, the authors consulted and cited a broad range of sources, namely from: \uf0b7 European Economic and Social Committee studies, opinions, proposals and articles published in the EESC Diversity Group newsletters \uf0b7 European Commission, the Council of Europe and EU agencies, such as the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, reports, studies and press releases \uf0b7 World Health Organization press releases and reports \uf0b7 International Labour Organization and EUROFOUND studies \uf0b7 OECD collection of papers \u201cOECD Policy Responses to Coronavirus (COVID-19)\u201d \uf0b7 United Nations guidance documents and its main bodies and agencies such as UNECE, UNESCO, OHCHR, among others \uf0b7 World Economic Forum publications \uf0b7 CSOs\u2019 networks\u2019 (such as CONCORD, Civil Society Europe, Social Platform, AGE Platform Europe, SDG Watch, among others) studies, position papers and statements.

Study findings The present chapter constitutes the backbone of the study, as it presents the findings of the online survey in relation to the impacts of the pandemic on the European CSOs, their members and target groups, and the information gathered on their reactions across Europe. For the sake of readiness of the documents, the graphics illustrating the statistics obtained from the quantitative analysis of the online survey results are included in the Annex 2. The first section of this chapter illustrates the analysis of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the containment measures adopted across Europe on the CSOs, their operations and finances. In the second section, the varied responses put forward by the CSOs in the form of newly settled or adapted services, initiatives and activities are mapped by activity area. Per each of the areas, a mixed set of sources is used leveraging the wealth of information provided by the survey respondents and complementing it with tailored desk research whereas suitable and needed. In total, 112 people have completed the survey. Gender, age and education profiles of the respondents are summarized in Annex 2. Overall, CSOs headquartered in 26 out of the current 27 European Union countries, plus additional European (outside the European Union) countries participated with relevant contributions to this study. Figure 2. Geographical distribution of the CSOs participating in the study The geographical coverage of the CSOs they represent is predominantly national (56%), followed by European-level networks and organisations, accounting for the 16% of the participating CSOs. 41% of the respondents have stated to be EESC members, all of them belonging to Group III (Diversity) except for two in Group I (Employers) and one in Group II (Workers). In two cases only, two organisations have submitted two different survey answers each. These were the cases of the Danish Consumer Council, where both the respondents are EESC members, and AGE Platform Europe, as they have highlighted two different new actions put in place in the context of the pandemic and run by different departments: being both relevant and pertinent they are considered valid for the study purpose. 3.1 Economic and organizational impacts of the pandemic and the containment measures adopted by governments Estonia 1 Georgia 1 Latvia 1 Slovakia 1 Sweden 1 Turkey 1 Czech Republic 2 Lithuania 2 Malta 2 Romania 2 Ukraine 2 Bulgaria 3 Croatia 3 Cyprus 3 Denmark 3 Germany 3 Ireland 3 Netherlands 3 Poland 3 Austria 4 France 4 Slovenia 4 United Kingdom 4 Finland 5 Hungary 5 Greece 6 Spain 7 Italy 9 Belgium (4 Nationaland 8 EU Networks) 12 Portugal 12 N. ofCSOsheadquarteredin a country ",
        "10 On March 11 th 2020, the World Health Organisation declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Since then, the governments of countries all over the world have responded differently to contain the spread of the virus. Based on the survey results, it is possible to state that the restrictions that governments implemented have made it difficult for CSOs to continue with their traditional activities , thus, producing a substantial effect on the groups they work with. During the ongoing second COVID-19 wave, the organized civil society is still facing several constraints on its ability to carry out its work, as a result of lockdowns, distancing, and quarantine measures. However, they keep their work and unveiled new and innovative, flexible and adapted ways of maintaining their core mission and the support to those most in need , as especially section 3.3 will highlight. The survey respondents stated that 33% of them have seen their operations strongly affected by COVID- 19 and 30% of them expect lower revenues than in 2019. This reflects the outcomes of the several studies and rapid analyses carried out so far across Europe 16 and in some cases in specific regions such as the Balkans 17 as well as in neighbour regions like the ones belonging to the Eastern Partnership 18 , which unanimously report that the main financial problems CSOs are facing relate to the postponement or cancellation of projects, programs or activities, lack of financial resources, drop-in donations, the impossibility of organizing fundraising events, etc. Similar results were obtained from the Joint Council on Youth (CMJ), a European Union\u2013Council of Europe youth partnership, that has commissioned a survey 19 with the aim to hear from people working or volunteering in youth organisations, initiatives and networks across Europe on the effects of COVID-19 on youth work and youth activities. All the 48 youth organisations participating in the questionnaire stated they have been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. This included project delays, reduced outreach and a decrease in visibility, as well as lack of financial support from private and public institutions. Almost all their projects were cancelled, such as volunteering or mobility programmes and youth centres were closed. International networks such as CIVICUS has echoed the appeal from CSOs asking donors and intermediaries to offer \u201cas much flexibility, certainty, and stability towards grantees and partners as possible\u201d 20 . In this direction, goes the Opinion of the European Parliament Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs 21 , that called for the allocation of appropriate funding in the 2021 budget to CSOs that promote democratic and funding values of the EU. When asked about the main ways COVID-19 pandemic has affected their operations, the key points raised by the participants to the present study were mobility restrictions, struggles in introducing and getting adapted to new modalities of work and services\u2019 delivery as well as reduced or 16 Solidar Foundation (2020) Briefing Note \u201cPutting Solidarity in Social Distancing: CSOs at the Forefront of Social Innovation\u201d, available at https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Social_Solidarity_Social_Distancing_April_%281%29.pdf 17 Balkan Civil Society Development Network (2020), COVID-19 Pandemic: The Effects to and the Impact of Civil Society in the Balkan Region The State of CSOs, their Involvement in the Crisis Response & State and Donor Support, available at: http://civicspacewatch.eu/wp- content/uploads/2020/06/78-6-Balkan-Civil-Society-in-the-COVID-19-Crisis-Part-II.pdf. 18 Eastern Partnership Civil Society Forum (2020), Supporting the viability and sustainability of EaP civil society during the COVID-19 crisis, EAP CSF COVID-19 Briefing Paper, September 2020.

        "The response of civil society organisations to face the COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent restrictive measures adopted in Europe 11 cancelled operations and, most importantly, reduced face-to-face interactions . Loss of funding has been mentioned as a critical point by almost one fourth of the respondents. The costs incurred by the CSOs participating in the study have increased for 42% of them, which reflects either the rise in demand for many of their services or the need to invest in IT infrastructures and digital equipment or physical equipment to adapt facilities. With particular reference to ICT systems or platforms to keep members and/or users connected, communicate and provide them with assistance, 39% of the CSOs participating in the survey stated they needed to acquire one. In line with the above, those CSOs which work could not fully convert their activities in online modalities had to make the bigger investments in terms of equipment and adaptation of their installations to the new regulations. When asked whether the CSOs had to hire or not new staff to perform their new or adapted actions in response to the pandemic, the majority of the respondents have answered they didn\u2019t need to hire new employees across the EESC different areas, with the highest percentage shown in the Associational Life area (67%). Nevertheless, some differences could be noticed. For instance, Social Economy and SMEs, crafts and family businesses were the EESC categories where the CSOs participating in the study most needed to contract new personnel while all the respondents belonging to the Liberal Professions area declared that they did not contract any new staff members. Interestingly, in the latter case it is important to differentiate between the CSOs themselves and their members: while the associations and networks of liberal professionals kept the same staff, their members operating on the \u201cground\u201d (e.g., labour consultants, tax accountants, legal and financial advisors, etc.) have witnessed a huge increase of activity that has led many of them to have employees working extra hours and/or hire new employees due to the surge of requests for support from their clients to apply for pandemic-specific financial aids. In relation to the need of hiring new staff or not for those CSOs categorized as \u201cOthers\u201d (thus not recognizing themselves as categorizable in any of the EESC activity areas), the diversity of answers reflects the heterogeneity of respondents and corresponding CSOs spanning from healthcare focused organization carrying out operational duties and service provision on the ground and networks and federations acting more on a lobbying and advocacy level. Lastly, with regard to funding sources, own funds, private sector donations, membership fees and European funding are the most common ways the CSOs stated they finance their activities with. Most of them have provided multiple answers, highlighting that blended funding is the most frequent option, i.e., not having a unique source for financial support. None of them have provided the relative shares and no centralized databases exist to analyse retrospectively time series of such shares, so it is hard to say how the typologies of funding sources and their respective weights have changed as a consequence of the outbreak. Nevertheless, when asked about the extent and utility of the financial aids provided in their respective countries, most of the CSOs have responded that either there were no specific programmes for their type of organisation (38,2%) or the existing programmes were not relevant for their organisation (23,7%). Several CSOs across Europe are calling the attention of European institutions on the financing difficulties they are undertaking and will be still facing in the attempt to continue to fulfil their essential mission . This applies to EU-level networks which get a considerable part of their funding from the EU through a range of EU programmes, including the Rights Equality and Citizenship programme, among others. Given the exceptional circumstances caused by the pandemic, a group of European networks, including the European Disability Forum and AGE Platform Europe, have sent a formal letter ",
        "12 to the EU Commissioner for Budget and Administration 22 , to ask for enabling more flexibility in the reallocation of resources, allowing redirection of planned activities and types of deliverables and waiving or significantly reducing the 20% co-financing requirement for the operating grants for 2020 and 2021. In the same direction, the SDG Watch Europe which is an EU-level, cross sectoral CSO alliance of CSOs from the development, environment, social, human rights and other sectors, has warned that the already scarce public funding for civil society has to be excluded from any budgetary cuts 23 . 3.2 Overview of the CSOs\u2019 response to the COVID-19 pandemic and containment measures There have been several discussions and conversations on various virtual platforms about the response of civil society to the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of adaptation of operations, but also how effectively the sector is engaging with communities. From the desk search carried out by the study\u2019s authors 24 , it emerges that a wide range of initiatives have been undertaken by CSOs and their networks as a massive reaction to the pandemic crisis. Many organizations have made human and material resources available to face the crisis, started offering new services and initiated public campaigns of support and/or advocacy. They fulfilled an essential social role and it is important to map it and evaluate its impact, as well as their capacity to continue to perform it in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic . However, despite their incredible efforts and an increased demand for services from the target groups CSOs serve, several of them had to adapt their offer, or even reduce or cease to operate their programs. International organisations and networks have concentrated their effort on making the voice of CSOs and the sectors of societies they represent heard in a rapidly changing scenarios with the many governments taking centralized decisions to cope with the emergency. Among them, last 18 th of June 2020 Civil Society Europe claimed a \u201crights-based recovery\u201d plan in a letter signed together with 52 platforms of civil society organisations to the European Commission, the European Council, the German Presidency of the EU and the European Parliament 25 . Focusing on the protection of open, inclusive and accountable governance, the civil society members of Open Government Partnership\u2019s Steering Committee have released a statement on COVID-19 and its risks to open government 26 . In parallel, an initiative supported by a large number of CSOs and CSOs\u2019 networks across EU has led to the publication of a Joint Statement 27 to influence the future developments of the European Democracy Action Plan, which aim will be to increase resilience of our democracies and address threats affecting elections and the democratic debate that the crisis has contributed to exacerbate. Furthermore, many umbrella organisations and federations have continuously supported their members and partners to stay informed, adapt their programmes and keep their organisations safe. 22 European Disability Forum (2020).

The present mapping is built based upon the responses provided by the CSOs participating in the survey and integrated with relevant considerations extracted from the analysis of other relevant collections 28 , 29 , 30 of initiatives and actions. The analysis of the results of the mapping allows to spot the light on key trends, commonalities, innovative solutions and challenges that are left untackled. Figure 3. Distribution of respondents who have declared to have put in place new or adapted initiatives across EESC areas The vast majority of the respondents declared that they have designed and put in place new initiatives or adapted services to face the extraordinary circumstances brought by the pandemic, with only 11 out of 112 stating that they have continued to run their regular activities with no major changes. All those CSOs that have reported that they didn\u2019t put any specific new activity in place in response to the pandemic challenges are either networks and federations (i.e. second level organisations not active in the field but performing exclusively informative and representative activities aimed at providing reliable documentation sources to their members or advocating for their rights and needs) or they are small-sized national ones with prominently informative or educational activities, which have been partially interrupted or whereas possible converted in online formats while keeping the same aim and targets. The same applies to those respondents who did not tick any of the six EESC activity areas and selected \u201cother\u201d.

Geographic distribution of the CSOs that have declared they have put in place new or adapted activities These organisations have been also asked to explain what strategic approaches they adopted to reconvert rapidly their activities and maximise efficacy of the new services and initiatives (Figure 5). The respondents were allowed to select more than one answer in order to better capture the variety of strategies which in many cases brought to adopting a combination of different approaches. It is relevant to highlight that 77 of them have stated that they have continued to offer their existing services adapting the provision modalities to the new regulations, 55 reported they have strengthened existing services and 69 declared they have converted those services into online services. It is thus clear that the first main purpose of CSOs was to encounter manners to still be able to provide the services that are at the core of their mission and which prosecution was somehow threatened by the pandemic and the confinement measures, which is also confirmed by the fact that 85 out of 101 (84%) told that the activities performed were aligned to their mission. However, more than one quarter of the CSOs were able to progress further and provide new responses to the new needs: 26 reported that they have launched brand new or customized new services while 6 have also expanded their service portfolio addressing different groups than their traditional members and targets. This demonstrates the quick adaptation capacity of CSOs and their sensitivity to the emerging societal needs as they appear. 02468 10 12 A U S T R I A B E L G I U M ( N A T I O N A L ) B E L G I U M ( E U N E T W O R K ) B U L G A R I A C R O A T I A C Y P R U S C Z E C H I A D E N M A R K F I N L A N D F R A N C E G E O R G I A G E R M A N Y G R E E C E H U N G A R Y I R E L A N D I T A L Y L A T V I A L I T H U A N I A M A L T A N E T H E R L A N D S P O L A N D P O R T U G A L S L O V A K I A S L O V E N I A S P A I N S W E D E N T U R K E Y U K R A I N E U N I T E D K I N G D O M ( U K ) ",

This shows that the CSOs participating in the study cover evenly the three types of aims. Among those CSOs that have put in place activities with \u201cother\u201d aims than the traditional ones their statutory mission calls for, it is worth to note that several CSOs that had not been directly performing studies and surveys before, have proactively undertaken monitoring, data collection and analysis initiatives to map and study the impacts of the pandemic and the restrictions on their members and target groups and report on those. Also, in some cases, the CSOs have taken actions that were not usually in their portfolio of activities such as providing humanitarian aid and shelters to the most marginalized and impacted by the pandemic\u2019s consequences as well as putting in place brand new and innovative services. An example of those is the \"business advice programme\" delivered by Volunteer Ireland which is giving company volunteers the opportunity to share their business knowledge, experience and expertise with the community and voluntary sector via their company\u2019s employee volunteer programme 31 .

The newly adopted category name \u201cAssociational Life\u201d (formerly \u201cVoluntary Sector\u201d) covers then a broad range of organized civil society groups working to foster the common good, striving for equality of rights, freedoms and opportunities, and playing \u201cthe role of a mediator between individuals and the state, defending the general interest and the crucial values of mutual respect and altruism, whose corollaries are pluralism and social benefit\u201d. It is of utmost importance to stress that this category is the most varied in terms of types of activities and targeted stakeholders, being a distinctive feature of these CSOs their ability to bring together a combination of mostly highly motivated volunteers and dedicated employees around a range of activities, in the sense of active civic participation that strengthens common European values, such as solidarity and social cohesion 33 . 3.3.1.2 Stakeholder consultation Associational Life is one of the broadest activity areas covered by nearly half the respondents to the survey (N=47 out of N=112 and N=42 of the N=101 that have stated they have put in place new or adapted initiatives).

Among the CSOs based in Belgium, 6 out of 8 are European organisations and networks, one is operating at regional level and one at national level. The initiatives collected are either specifically targeted to certain population groups or generically oriented to broader audiences (N=14). The beneficiaries of the target-specific activities and initiatives put in place by the CSOs included in the sample range from women (N=2), families (N=1), youth (N=4), older people (N=12), disabled persons (N=4), patients suffering from specific diseases (namely, Alzheimer and multiple sclerosis), and migrants (N=2). In terms of legal and organizational forms, the outcomes of the survey reflect the variety of types of organisations that recognize themselves as belonging to the \u201cAssociational Life\u201d sphere, with a predominant presence of associations (N=31). 3.3.1.3 Main challenges reported Member States including Belgium, France, Latvia and Greece reported an increase in domestic violence during the lockdown, with incidents tripling within one month in Greece, for example 34 . The French Secretary of State for Gender Equality declared that the French platform dedicated to domestic violence received five times more reports during the eight weeks of confinement than in a normal period 35 . One of the survey respondents, the Women\u2019s Room \u2013 Center for Sexual Rights, established in Croatia, highlighted there were not any exceptional services and/or measures made available during the COVID-19 pandemic to protect women from violence. Thus, they suddenly had to face with major problems, especially about accommodation of women and children in shelters due to lack of self- isolation facilities and insufficient protective equipment. The necessary equipment for shelters and counselling centers was provided by local authorities and the Croatian government only at the end of May. Furthermore, although there was an increase of violence against women during the lockdown the courts worked in a lesser extent, only urgent proceedings were resolved while other hearings (including cases of violence against women) were adjourned. Several older persons\u2019 and pensioners\u2019 associations and networks went through similar experiences with the sudden necessity to shift as many activities as possible online, although with an additional hurdle connected to generally lower digital literacy level of older people , as reported by the European Ageing Network (EAN) along with several confederation of retired persons across France, Portugal, Belgium, Slovenia and Turkey, the Spanish Confederation of Older People Organizations (CEOMA) and the German National Association of Senior Citizens' Organisations (BAGSO). Furthermore, in several media and in society in general, COVID-19 is being considered as a problem of older people, falling on numerous occasions into ageist approaches 36 which have been documented in early research works conducted by independent research institutes and supported by movements and civic groups protecting older people rights and advocating against discriminatory attitudes. A good sample of those, both at EU and national level, are represented among the catalogued initiatives.

        "20 Age (UK) has denounced increased levels of ageist discrimination in employment due to large numbers of newly unemployed younger people and the fact that government COVID-19 responses in employment were geared massively towards the young. This implied, for instance, less opportunities to take part in training programmes for 50+ unemployed. This sector of the population, in UK as in most of the EU countries, includes the majority of the persons at higher risk of suffering the worst consequences of the disease due to their age and/or chronic diseases as well as those that are digitally excluded because of digital illiteracy or lack of good quality connectivity and equipment, thus being unable to participate in COVID-proof alternative provision. In the same regard, AGE Platform has highlighted generally scarce funding for acquiring the necessary equipment and skills, stressed or lacking human resources in senior organizations coupled with lack of volunteers able to operate and cope with the psychological fatigue connected to work in a context where older people's organisations were on the front line being elderly the most exposed to worse COVID-19 outcomes as well as uncertainty about future plans. AGE released a report on COVID-19 and human rights concerns for older people . The report refers both to alarming situations and promising practices for respecting older people\u2019s human rights. The latest version of the report includes: - risks to the right to health, including mental health and palliative care, - how digital exclusion adversely impacts older people\u2019s opportunities for social contact and access to information, medical and other essential goods and services, - the increased risk of violence and abuse during the lockdown, - the specific challenges faced by older people in residential settings, those who live alone and those who receive care at home. The report has also been enriched with new insights about the multiple disadvantages faced by older women, older LGBTI people and older Roma people. Finally, it includes some recommendations useful for policy makers, service providers, and the media. Moreover, AGE Platform Europe reported another initiative which is the setup of a specific webpage 37 to provide reliable information on the pandemic and the challenges it raises to older persons and to the whole society, by gathering recommendations, good practices and initiatives from members and other partners. Worsened conditions of people suffering from intellectual, mental, physical and learning disabilities , loneliness and increased need for psychological and emotional support for them and their carers, combined with the unpreparedness of the educational system and the social services represent another core challenge that associations and NGOs are contributing to tackle. Changes in personal routines, worries and enduring self-isolation are extremely stressful for any person, but they are likely to have a greater impact on disabled persons or contribute to worsen existing mental health conditions, as denounced by the Global Disability Movement (Greece) and the European Disability Forum at international level. The increase of people in vulnerable socio-economic situations due to job loss, sharpened inequalities and impoverishment of the most disadvantaged ones are indeed among the biggest societal challenges that the pandemic brought in and Europe will take long time to revert. The most vulnerable includes poorer households and those dependent on informal employment, including casual day labour, seasonal migration or mobile livelihoods; small-scale producers; those without savings and with little recourse to insurance or alternative sources of income. For those with employment, many are low paid workers in essential services and highly exposed to the virus. As reported by Caritas Europa, a broad network of 49 national member organisations in 46 European countries, job losses, increase in poverty, inequality, precarious work and untenable living conditions for certain groups, such as those suffering, 37 AGE Platform Europe, website (page dedicated to COVID 19) https://www.age-platform.eu/coronavirus-covid-19.

        "The response of civil society organisations to face the COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent restrictive measures adopted in Europe 21 on top of COVID-19, from the consequences of the fires in the Moria refugee camp and in Roma settlements. The network has repeatedly called the attention of governments and media on the fact that the third sector indeed faces a disproportionate burden of death and illness during the spread of the virus due to the higher health risks faced by workers on the front line, typically taking care of the most vulnerable people, providing food, emergency support as well as the lack of protective clothing, masks, other supplies, etc. In some countries where national Caritas organisations are present, such as Italy, the network reported staff members and members of their families have died thus leading to increased mental ill-health, stress, and psychological challenges of the staff. Further, budget cuts have been impacting staff and almost all their usual service provision needed to change as a result of COVID-19 and whereas possible taking advantage of new technologies. Voluntary organisations reported that in many cases (such as the National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO)) they witnessed a twofold challenge. The need to increase resources due to the rising demand for the services they provide (often on behalf of the public sector) and the lack of revenues which they usually used to support such activities, as they were mainly based on parallel social enterprise activities that could not take place during the pandemic . Nevertheless, the overall effort put in place by the voluntary sector has been tremendous and the collection presented in the catalogue in Annex 3 offers a broad overview of actions put in place by CSOs to answer emergency needs such as food, medicine, hygiene product, childcare support for those parents who could not telework, etc. 3.3.1.4 Highlights of successful practices in Europe The Women\u2019s Council of Denmark and several organisations working to protect women rights, older people rights and youth rights and foster their participation, inclusion and employability such as Youth Work Ireland, report they switched their services to digital. For example, the Youth Information Online chat service has been the first of its kind in Ireland. Youth Work Ireland, together with other two organisations Crosscare and SpunOut, had long-planned this service, and they have expedited the launch to support young people during COVID-19 lockdown. The Youth Information online chat service builds on a long-standing partnership of professional youth information providers in Ireland and relies on the development of commitment to joined up working on communications, safeguarding, data protection, and youth information practice, as well as the support of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. Innovative modalities to reach out the youngest sector of the population and provide them with reliable, accurate and transparent information have been reported also in other countries, such as Spain, where the organization JUVEUCAN (European Youth of Canary Islands) has organized a web streamed event along with other organization and broadcasted in through StreamYard on YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. Another example of youth sensibilization actions run primarily through internet and social media, it is the initiative \u201cYouth for You\u201d the Student Youth Council in Georgia reported and run in collaboration with the organization Arbeiter-Samariter-Bund (ASB) for the benefit of disabled people, thanks to the mobilization of part of the resources assigned to the funded project \u201cEqual Opportunities for Persons with Disability \u2013 Supporting Social Service Providers in Rural Georgia\u201d. The survey results show that several CSOs having as their core mission social care, but also other entities from the associative world aiming to different statutory objectives, have stepped in delivering aid to those who lack other forms of social protection and support, either through formal or even informal movements, bringing to light emerging solidarity circles and new forms of civic activism . This is the case of the Scout organization in Czech Republic which is the largest organisation of children and youth in the nation. Nationwide, scouts could participate as individuals in the system (www.skautskapomoc.cz) connected to the Elpida Seniors' Line: the line received inquiries from seniors, entered them into the online system and volunteers applied to meet them. Over 700 volunteers registered ",
        "22 in the system. Being a telephone line, it was also suitable for seniors who are not used to working with the Internet and their reactions were very positive, also due to the fact that scouts are an overall trusted organisation. Similarly, the Volunteer Center Augsburg (Germany) started a call to action in the city and reached out - most of them online - 1.400 citizens willing to volunteer in this crisis. They matched those volunteers to citizens in need (doing shopping, visiting by phone, staying in contact, driving service) while other volunteers helped at service association for homeless people and at the food bank (risking to be closed because they had older volunteers being themselves at risk). As they were overwhelmed with volunteering offers, they also started the brokerage to other associations who are in need of volunteers. Several CSOs across EU have helped bring awareness of the pandemic\u2019s impact on persons with disabilities and their rights and draw attention to promising practices and key actions for States and other stakeholders. The Spanish Confederation of Families of Deaf People (FIAPAS) has put the spotlight on the lack of accessible public information and communication, accessible distance education, adapted teaching materials and modalities as well as evaluation processes at school for deaf students. The use of facial masks makes clearly impossible lipreading for people with a hearing disability, thus FIAPAS' Accessibility Services have increased its activities addressed to make public information accessible through live subtitling for the Spanish population with hearing loss (more than 1 million citizens). In the framework of the Cooperation Agreement between FIAPAS and the Parliament, main hearings at the Parliament have included live subtitling provided by FIAPAS. This service of live subtitling has also been provided to the press conferences issued after Council of Ministers. To respond to the need of digitalisation , several training and courses were organized with the aim to reduce the literacy gap and allow older people to take the most benefit from online connectivity. In the case of Caritas Germany, it has developed an \u201copen source\u201d software for online counselling services, which can be accessed and modified by anyone 38 interested and thus might serve as a good basis for other Caritas Europa members that are setting up or already working with online counselling services. On another note, renowned CSOs are also active across Europe in the field of scientific research . The Italian Multiple Sclerosis Society (AISM) and its Foundation (FISM), along with the Multiple Sclerosis Study Group of the Italian Neurological Society (SIN), have set up a Research Program that is meant to represent an answer, as complete as possible, to this unprecedented event for people suffering from this progressive neurodegenerative disease. Multiple Sclerosis and COVID-19 (MuSC-19) platform 39 is collecting national and international clinical data to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 infection on people affected by MS. More than 1000 subjects are currently included in the study. Lastly, it is also important to stress that several CSOs and CSOs\u2019 networks have themselves promoted studies and large-scale surveys to gather a better understanding of the situation , the main needs and challenges faced by Europeans and try to identify fast and effective solutions. From the desk search carried out by the study team, for instance, it has emerged that SOS Malta as the Fund Operator for the Active Citizen\u2019s Fund, is asking for citizens\u2019 and citizen groups\u2019 support in identifying the main shortcomings experienced or that are highly likely to be caused by the COVID-19 outbreak upon voluntary organisations\u2019 activities and their level of support for end beneficiaries through a survey that is currently ongoing 40 . On the same note, the European Research Network on Philanthropy (ERNOP) has set up a living webpage where they publish relevant studies on the effects of (the fallout of and 38 The code can be accessed via the following websites: https://caritasdeutschland.github.io/documentation/ and https://github.com/CaritasDeutschland (both in English). 39 Multiple Sclerosis and COVID-19 (MuSC-19) platform, available at https://musc-19.dibris.unige.it/. 40 Survey on COVID-19 effects on Voluntary Organisations, available at https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/ACFCOVID-19effects.

This makes particularly hard to draw univocal conclusions with respect to the extent and the gravity of the impacts that the pandemic has generated on the CSOs composing this sub-group and their members and service end users. Nevertheless, based on the analysis of the reactions they have reported some common traits can be emphasized as follows: 1. Among the initiatives mentioned by the respondents, most of them highlighted that all kinds of activities they were previously running in a physical modality that could be shifted to online mode were converted to virtual and processes and services consequently adapted. 2. Almost all the CSOs from the \u201cAssociational Life\u201d area participating in the survey, although at different levels and within diverse geographic scopes, have tried to keep their information services running and have even intensified their efforts in documenting the evolution of the situation and its consequences on the most vulnerable segments of the population (namely, on older people, women and children victims of abuses, disabled people, patients suffering from other diseases who have seen their treatments and care services they rely upon disrupted). 3. New solidarity circles and also the new forms of civic activism erupted during the pandemic. Although many of these took the form of spontaneous individual or collective actions from citizens willing to help those most affected by the pandemic consequences, in many cases the respondents have highlighted the key role of their CSOs in acting as collectors and catalysers of such sense of sense of solidarity and responsibility making available their platform, mobilization capacities and experiences to channel and amplify the good outcomes of diverse and dispersed initiatives. 4. Another common trait was the fast capacity to shift priorities and adapt to the rapidly worsening situation demonstrated by those CSOs which stepped in offering types of services that were not in their portfolio of activities before COVID-19 spread or fastening the launch of services that were in their future pipelines but not in place yet. 3.3.2 Consumers and environment 3.3.2.1 Background and context The main objective of the CSOs working under this area is to ensure that consumer rights and environmental protection are taken into consideration in policy and implementation measures in Europe and the EESC group under this theme works also as a forum for participants to discuss the policies implemented in their own countries. Civil society plays indeed a relevant role in promoting environmentally responsible choices and sustainability, being a potential driver for positive transformation e.g., local initiatives can pioneer and model new practices that can then be used and leveraged by other actors, including policy makers, 41 ERNOP.EU, European research on the effects of COVID-19 for philanthropy, available at https://ernop.eu/european-research-on-the-effects- of-covid-19-for-philanthropy/ ",
        "24 leading eventually to either incremental or radical changes in practices and policy. Civil society can also influence the market indirectly, for example by increasing consumer awareness 42 . 3.3.2.2 Stakeholder consultation Twelve CSOs from eleven different countries, either belonging to the EESC \u201cConsumers and environment\u201d activity area or self-recognising themselves as potentially affiliated to it, have participated in the study, thus including both consumers\u2019 organisations and environmentalist organisations. From these, the majority are associations (N=10). However, besides these CSOs, it is also relevant to report on those that, when asked what categories of stakeholders they were targeting in their actions, ticked the \u201cConsumers\u201d category as it is common to assimilate consumers to the broader definition of \u201cCitizens\u201d (see question Q25, Annex 2). Also, some of the activities generally typical of consumers organisations such as fighting against illegal trading practices might be relevant also for other CSOs predominantly active in the \u201cSMEs, Crafts and Family Business\u201d EESC area, as well as the \u201cSocial Economy\u201d EESC Area. Further, the stakeholders were asked to highlight the specific kind of interest or relevant issue connected to consumers their CSOs were mainly dealing with. The majority emphasized that their actions were, directly or indirectly, meant to safeguard consumers\u2019 safety and promote sustainable consumption (see question Q25B, Annex 2). 3.3.2.3 Main challenges reported For what concerns consumption, the European Consumers Organisation 43 is calling the attention on the unprecedented disruption brought by COVID-19 to people\u2019s daily lives, travels and finances . Many have lost their income, are struggling to repay their credit and worrying about how to cope with their energy bills. A recent special issue of the Journal of Business Research has collected 13 papers illustrating the dramatic changes in how businesses act and consumers behave across various economic sectors 44 . As the crisis is also rapidly changing policy actions by the EU and its Member States, European consumers\u2019 networks have been advocating for and asking governments to make sure that measures taken at EU and national level to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 on the economy take full account of consumers\u2019 interests. During the pandemic, the main challenges reported focus on a number of issues that were already pressing for consumers before the virus spread and saw a dramatic surge in statistics during the first pandemic wave, namely: \uf0b7 travelling restrictions and other restrictions causing cancellations and lack of refund from the sellers; \uf0b7 different kinds of scams (mainly online) taking advantage of consumers being scared of COVID-19. \uf0b7 broader economic impacts linked to the increase in unemployment rate, resulting in possible over indebtedness and taking of high-interest loans (flash loans). In the area of environment, no specific challenges were reported in the survey developed under this study, but from a broader desk search, some are possible to highlight 45 : 42 ARTS (Accelerating and Rescaling Transitions to Sustainability) project (2016), Transition Read (n. 3).

Among these, they published a report 46 taking stock of the actions conducted by consumer organisations across Europe during the pandemic. As the report illustrates, \u201cin only a few weeks\u2019 time consumer organisations managed to re-organise their work to ensure that the rights of consumers remain protected even in time of crisis\u201d. Their outcomes help to inform the main actions that may be recommended for the future in this area. In line with the above-mentioned core objectives that most of the consumers organizations are pursuing at COVID-19 times, the Consumers Protection Center Greece warned about the watering down of consumers rights especially in the transport sector: they edited several press releases and sent several letters of protest to Greek and European institutions to complain against the undermining of consumers rights. The Polish Consumer Federation witnessed, as many others in Europe, abrupt changes in daily consumers life due to lockdown. They tried to compensate the limited direct access to consumer advisors by providing advice and information on-line and by phone only as well as arranging thematic webinars e.g., on energy savings and energy bills at households while spending more time at home with, in many cases, lower economic resources available. The Consumers\u00b4 Union of Finland advised consumers on scams related to COVID-19 through their website, social media accounts and also by organizing webinars on the matter and through their telephone advice line. This awareness-raising was not targeted to a specific group as anyone can fall a victim to such scams and it is delivered as part of a more general project focusing on any digital scams 47 . In addition, the Danish Consumer Council reported that they took direct action in helping consumers choose the safer face coverings in the market and to this purpose they tested 13 different protective masks and disclosed the results among their members and beyond, so that all consumers can make an informed choice about purchasing and using PPE 48 . Lastly, the Lithuanian Solar Energy Association, aiming to educate the public about the technologies for the use and production of solar energy, intensified their information services directed to producing consumers of solar electricity, via on-line consultations and support. When it comes to organizations devoted to environmental protection and education as well as promotion of sustainable development and climate-friendly practices and policies, the universe of actors is broad and varied. Among the respondents to the survey, Natuur & Milieu - Nature and Environment, Dutch environmental organization committed to creating a healthy natural environment, published a sustainable travel guide ( Holiday without flying ) with 13 dream destinations in the Netherlands 49 .

        "26 environmental organizations heavily involved in educational activities, such as ODRAZ - Sustainable Community Development (Croatia), were not able to go to schools and regularly keep their workshops with children related to sustainable development and SDGs, thus they prepared on-line training materials that can be used by them or by their teachers. They also invited school children to send us the drawings, watercolours, collages related to 17 SDGs and will prepare on-line exhibition of children's works. As illustrated in the Associational Life area, it was also common to see environmental organizations traditionally devoted to support sustainable development shifting their activities or launching new initiatives to help cope with the emergency. An example is provided by \u201cTERRAS DENTRO - Association for the Integrated Development\u201d that adjusted its intervention to the conditions and needs of the populations and the crisis through the implementation of social intervention projects, in support of young people who do not have computer equipment and Internet access for schoolwork. In partnership with the Schools, they prepared print and distribute educational materials to the students, supporting the use of digital tools and articulating between teacher families. Terras Dentro also provides emotional and social support to families, children and young people to those in need and a psychological and wellness support line was created, with the aim of informing, supporting, advising and referring, especially older adults. 3.3.2.5 Conclusion This thematic area includes a varied array of challenges and initiatives. The pandemic brought several situations that harmed consumers, such as cancelled flights and travel reimbursement or safety policies in touristic installations, and queries related to online shopping. The more prevalent activities related to consumers rights included (i) empowering consumers through personal assistance and advice ; (ii) providing consumers with trustworthy and regularly updated information , through publication of articles, setup of dedicated webpages and appearance on traditional media; (iii) Launching online tools ; (iv) Engaging with traders, public authorities and monitoring legislation . In the area of environment protection and building on the information reported in the survey of the study and on the desk search performed, it is clear that, the pandemic brought several challenges and environmental issues, but also represents an opportunity for turning around from unsustainable consumption and production patterns . To this aim, two main activities appear as the most relevant: 1. The CSOs demonstrated willingness and capacities to react proactively and find out innovative formats and methods for educational activities focused on the environment and sustainable development, when outdoor and group activities are restricted. 2. The CSOs active in the field of environmental protection are having an important role in fostering alternatives for recycling disposable materials that highly increased during the pandemic, such as masks and related protective materials. 3.3.3 Farmers 3.3.3.1 Background and context Many CSOs concerned in this thematic area refer to smallholder farmers, including crop farmers, fishers, livestock keepers and other resource users. These civil society organisations aim to ensure that smallholder farmers\u2019 voices, priorities, and interests are actively heard and reflected in the design, implementation, and monitoring of policy making and related initiatives.

        "The response of civil society organisations to face the COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent restrictive measures adopted in Europe 27 CSOs often also provide technical expertise, knowledge and capacity to ensure transparency and accountability and implement projects in the ground. At global fora, the CSOs in this category play also a central role in advocating, for example, by raising awareness for the farmers needs and supporting policy-making changes with the governments. 3.3.3.2 Stakeholder consultation Nine respondents declared they are or would affiliate to the Farmers activity area in consideration of their mission and scope. Each of them is from a different European country, with a good representation of all European macro-regions. The majority of the respondents are Professional associations (N=5), followed by other types of associations (N=3). 3.3.3.3 Main challenges reported Limits on the mobility of people across borders and lockdowns are contributing to workforce shortages in agriculture in many countries, particularly those characterised by seasonal demand peaks or labour- intensive production. For example, newly implemented travel bans within the European Union, as well as the closure of the Schengen Area, have significantly reduced the available workforce for the fruit and vegetable sector in a number of European countries 50 . The Austrian Chamber of Agriculture, amongst others, reported significant changes in consumers\u2019 habits that are threatening entire sectors such as floriculture. The Spanish Coordinator of Farmers and Livestock Organizations (COAG) warned about a number of issues such as: (i) the lack of technical and digital means in rural areas to carry out meetings with sufficient quality and keep the communication between farmers and union leaders; (ii) great difficulties in hiring agricultural workers and guaranteeing adequate conditions in accommodation, etc. as well as all the necessary means to guarantee that they are free from being infected by COVID-19, highlighted also by the Central Union of Agricultural Producers and Forest Owners in Finland among others; (iii) problems related to agriculture sales due to the closure of markets and (iv) in the livestock sector, animal feeding systems based on the use of soybeans creating a very serious dependency and fragility in situations like this pandemic. The Farmers Union of Cyprus witnessed a number of negative effects due to the pandemic on their members of and in the primary sector. In Cyprus, where the economy depends to a large extent on tourism. many hotels and restaurant did not work . Farmers who planned their crops before the pandemic, saw their crops discarded or not harvested, this resulting in huge economic problems for them. In addition, the agricultural sector of Cyprus is highly dependent on the labour force coming from Third Countries. The Government's decision to ban and not issue new permits for foreign workers in agriculture is another negative factor in this area. According to some relevant studies (e.g., the Sustainability assessment of food and agriculture systems, - FAO United Nations 51 ), the pathway to agricultural sustainability is found in the size, scale, and organizational characteristics of farms and the social matrix in which these farms are embedded, meaning that agricultural sustainability is more prevalent in areas with high levels of civic engagement and through middle-size or family operations, rather than large-scale, corporate farms 52 .

        "28 smaller farming structures were especially threatened by the COVID-19 pandemic, as their financial resources are scarce. 3.3.3.4 Highlights of successful practices To react to this situation, several farmers\u2019 associations, cooperatives\u2019 networks and chambers of commerce, such as the Netherlands Agricultural and Horticultural Association (LTO) and the Federation of Swedish Farmers (LRF) have activated initiatives and online platform to help farmers match with jobseekers , mainly from sectors affected by the closedown, such as nearby hotels and restaurants. COAG participated in an initiative that brought together more than 200 agricultural organizations and NGOs of state and local character about the importance of direct sales from farmers to consumers demanding the opening of local markets and fairs. In addition, together with organizations of self- employed workers, they released a document 53 to stress the value of local commerce with different support proposals, including support for local commerce in rural areas as a way to face depopulation 54 . Several other organizations, such as the Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration Paysanne Farmers' Union in France, the Irish Farmers Association and the Chamber of Agriculture and Forestry of Slovenia (CAFS) have emphasized how crucial digitization of communication has been in keeping their work ongoing. Lobbying activities toward the government for obtaining financial assistance for entrepreneurs who were impacted by the COVID-19 crisis, as well as providing online or phone assistance to members to help them apply for such aids were among the most common actions undertaken across Europe. In response to increasing demands and time pressures on farmers and growers, the National Farmers Union 55 increased its support services, offering help with legal, planning and taxation matters, marketing and food promotion. NFU CallFirst also provides every member with unlimited access to no-fee professional and legal support on business matters from in-house specialists. 3.3.3.5 Conclusions According to what was reported, the farming structures were especially threatened by the COVID-19, namely due to the lack of human resources available on one side; one the other hand, because the demand for agricultural and animal products severely diminished with the closing of restaurants, hotels and the decrease in tourism. The CSOs backing this sector provided support especially through online tools and phone assistance , mainly aiming at clarifying the access to aid mechanisms and funding measures and also promoting awareness raising regarding the difficulties of the sector. One of the key assets they report is the involvement and commitment of the different actors (governments, agrarian organizations, NCFF, international organizations) in the protection of farmers, thus advocating for the development of policies that favour their sustained development, namely through national and regional action plans and the promotion of youth and women in family farming. 53 COAG (2020) Reactivar el comercio de proximidad: aut\u00f3nomos del sector lanzan 57 propuestas para rescatar \u201cel alma de nuestros pueblos y ciudades\u201d, available at http://coag.chil.me/post/reactivar-el-comercio-de-proximidad-autonomos-del-sector-lanzan-57-propuestas-pa- 300809 54 Agroinformacion (2020) Los aut\u00f3nomos reclaman un impulso al comercio en el medio rural como revulsivo frente a la despoblaci\u00f3n, available at https://agroinformacion.com/los-autonomos-reclaman-un-impulso-al-comercio-en-el-medio-rural-como-revulsivo-frente-a-la- despoblacion/?cn-reloaded=1 55 National Farmers Association website, available at http://www.nfuonline.com/ ",
        "The response of civil society organisations to face the COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent restrictive measures adopted in Europe 29 3.3.4 Liberal Professions 3.3.4.1 Background and context Liberal professions include a broad variety of actors and contexts, with 47 million people in Europe working in regulated professions in 2017, which accounts for 22% of the working population 56 . According to the EESC study The State of Liberal Professions Concerning their Functions and Relevance to European Civil Society 57 \u201cthese tasks carried out for the common good and in the public interest include; ensuring legal protection for citizens, ensuring the rule of law within the tax and social levy system and a functioning market economy, as well as providing health care for the population. In all these areas, members of the liberal professions serve as particularly qualified service providers (E.g., as lawyers, auditors, accountants, engineers, medical practitioners).\u201d The crisis brought to light the importance and role of the liberal professions in the functioning of society, namely in the protection of health and fundamental rights, as well as in business advice and support. 3.3.4.2 Stakeholder consultation The respondents to the survey developed under the present study that are categorised in the area of liberal professions (N=6) are mostly EESC Members (83%). From the survey and also from desk research it is visible that several examples of initiatives adopted by liberal professions were highlighted during the confinement: the pharmacist as the first point of access to advice and care has been consolidated; the role of health and social caregivers was essential to overcome isolation and support the older and more fragile; lawyers were able to continue to plead in various cases; accountants were daily interlocutors of companies who needed advice on how to benefit from government aid. In Belgium, for example, notaries 58 have further increased the digitization of their activities, having obtained the right to perform Acts remotely, by teleconference, within the framework of special powers, using electronic signatures. The respondents to the survey developed under the present study refer that labour and tax consultants have witnessed a sharp increase of request for labour, legal and financial support from businesses and self-employed, as well as workers in need of help to apply for subsidies. However, for others, in particular those related to culture, the interruption on paid work was more severe and the recovery may still be not close. \u201cWhile many industries are slowly beginning to recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the arts and culture sector is still struggling with the widespread closure of theatres that is preventing many artists from performing in front of an audience, depriving them of their main source of income.\u201d 59 Also, for architects, for example, the crisis will have significant repercussions on activity in 2021. 3.3.4.3 Main challenges reported 56 EESC (2017) news item on the Conference \u201cThe liberal professions, a lever for the development of Europe: towards a European manifesto of professionals\u201d, available at https://www.eesc.europa.eu/en/agenda/our-events/events/liberal-professions-lever-development- europe-towards-european-manifesto-professionals 57 EESC (2013) The State of Liberal Professions Concerning their Functions and Relevance to European Civil Society, available at https://www.eesc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/resources/docs/qe-01-13-678-en-c.pdf 58 CEPLIS (2020), Interview to Bernard Jacquemin, available at https://ceplis.org/interview-the-belgian-liberal-professions-and-the-covid-19- crisis-by-bernard-jacquemin-president-of-unplib/ 59 New Brunswick Liberal Association (2020).

        "30 The pandemic and the subsequent measures implemented had a heavy impact on liberal professions. The self-employed work mainly in the hardest-hit sectors by the lockdown : 44% of self-employed workers versus 37% of employees60. Furthermore, in most European countries, small businesses and self-employed workers must prove that their earnings have been negatively affected by the coronavirus to access rescue funds and this requires to afford high administrative costs which several liberal professions\u2019 associations and networks have been working to try to relieve. The liberal professions were included in support measures, but not thoroughly or completely on government\u2019s support , as it is reported by several representatives of these professionals, such as CEPLIS61. Measures such as the spread of payments, social security contributions and the repayment of certain loans was made available, but they will have to be paid later. When compared to classes such as civil servants, in many situations and countries working on a reduced regime but still able to keep all their income, liberal professionals were forced to draw on their reserves as support was not provided or still much lower. 3.3.4.4 Highlights of successful practices in Europe From the survey respondents and the desk research developed, it is reported that a significant action of the CSOs representing the liberal professionals has been to advocate nearby the governments that they should be explicitly included as beneficiaries of business support measures. They were reported as often forgotten or excluded from unemployment benefit schemes, daily allowances for health reasons or for the care of children. The daily sickness allowances are one of the claims that was highlighted during the pandemic and that is now being a reason for political pressure in most EU countries. The actions of these CSOs (e.g. UNAPL 62 ) were essential to promote the re-shape of policies and obtain benefits and public support measures: \u201cThe proposal to perpetuate \u2013 until December 31, 2020 \u2013 and strengthen the solidarity fund for all companies suffering from the effects of the crisis on a long-term basis, to materialize the reductions in charges for the liberal professions in proportion to the decrease of their turnover, to transform the loan guaranteed by the State into a ten-year loan, with a fixed rate capped at 1%, to support very small businesses in the implementation of a digital strategy.\u201d 63 A general overview of testimonies and reports of networks supporting these professionals inform that teleworking was set up very effectively, videoconferences replaced physical meetings (sometimes with higher efficiency than face-to-face meetings) and many services were successfully maintained. The new and adapted initiatives mentioned by the respondents include: - support to intellectual professionals , either economic, as also psychological and through coaching; - information on prevention and protection measures , especially for front liner workers, when they come in physical contact with their clients; - awareness and lobby , namely through the development of surveys on the impact of COVID on mental and physical issues, as well as the economic factors and the actions taken by Government; - offer to members of a free digital platform in order to facilitate remote connections with companies and workers; 60 Bruegel using Eurostat data https://www.bruegel.org/2020/04/covid-19-the-self-employed-are-hardest-hit-and-least-supported/. 61 https://ceplis.org/interview-the-belgian-liberal-professions-and-the-covid-19-crisis-by-bernard-jacquemin-president-of-unplib/ 62 CNASIM, website page dedicated to COVID19, available at https://www.cnasim.fr/cat/covid-19/ 63 CEPLIS (2020).

These go in line with the outcomes collected through desk research. This action also presented a number of good examples of policy measures that are presented in the following paragraphs. In Germany 64 , the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy is \u201c funding consulting services for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), including members of the liberal professions, that have been affected by the coronavirus crisis. Assistance for consulting of up to \u20ac4,000 without any company- own contribution can be provided\u201d. Luxembourg 65 notified to the Commission a scheme for companies affected by the coronavirus outbreak under the Temporary Framework, with an estimated budget of \u20ac300 million, that also includes liberal professions, through a repayable advance granted in one or more instalments to allow beneficiaries to face their operating costs. Even if outside of Europe, one additional interesting example is the measure, under evaluation in Canada 66 , of officially recognizing the profession of artist , which would allow this industry to have rights comparable to other professions. Also, there are interesting examples of successful legal initiatives on tax reliefs of donations of drugs, equipment and other items for combating COVID-19 67 (e.g., SMEs could make deductible donations of such items to hospitals and other social economy enterprises in full, beyond the standard deduction of 4% profits). The European Council of the Liberal Professions issued a Position Paper in June 2020 68 where they call on the European institutions to re-think their approach to national professional regulations, especially to maintain high standards in ethics and quality of the work delivered to the citizens. On one side, there is a need to ensure that the liberal professionals can access government support, access to protective measures and participate on the social dialogue; on the other side, there is also an expectation of a long- term planning that encompasses the increased qualification of professionals, along with the promotion of innovation and digitalisation in the sector. 3.3.4.5 Conclusions From the challenges and initiatives reported, it is clear and also aligned with other areas, such as SMEs, for example, that the crisis has, on one side, accelerated or made visible the needed transformation and digitalisation of liberal companies, but also highlighted some of its challenges, e.g., teleconsultation in the health sector, often rising the public discussion and ethical dilemmas associated to these themes. The challenges reported in the survey are mostly connected to bureaucracy , mainly accelerated by the rapid evolution of the pandemic and the lack of preparation to deal with emergency situations.

        "32 large number of cases handled, the complexity of administrative procedures and the difficulties in communication with public authorities is also presented as challenging. The political choice on the rules or beneficiaries of the public funds for support are also identified as a potential problem in some of the countries, which needs to be in the future priorities for this area. 3.3.5 SMEs, Crafts and Family Business 3.3.5.1 Background and context In economically developed countries in Europe, family businesses represent the oldest form of business and are still a significant part of the existing entities, playing an important social role in creating jobs, both in economically developed countries as well as in disadvantaged ones 69 . Their contribution to the gross domestic product of most European countries and the creation of job opportunities is also very relevant: the contribution of small and medium-sized enterprises to the non-financial business sector in the European Union in 2017 totalised 85,2% of total employment in Greece, closely followed by Cyprus (84,1%) and Malta (80,9%) 70 . Even the country with the lowest influence of SMEs in employment (of the current EU countries), that was France, still holds a percentage of 61,6. Across the European Union, 99.8 % of all enterprises are considered to be SMEs, employing 66% of the total workforce and accounting for 56.4 % of value added (European Commission, 2019; Eurostat, 2020) 71 . 3.3.5.2 Stakeholder consultation From the total respondents to the survey developed under the present study classified within the category of SMEs, Crafts and Family Businesses (N=4), half are EESC members and they are all organisations that support small companies and commerce from four different countries (Hungary, Belgium, Greece and Austria), being 2 professional associations, 1 association and 1 foundation. 3.3.5.3 Main challenges reported Many of the current main goals of the EU Member States for businesses cannot be achieved without innovation and increased performance. Increasing the competitiveness depends on innovation and creativity 72 , which is highly influenced by external factors, such as a sufficient number of skilled workers and a favourable business environment in the country. Beynon et al. (2020) 73 examined the relationship between small and medium-sized enterprises\u2019 strategies and their intention to drive future innovations, highlighting that business strategies focused on the internal environment, directly controlled by the company increased confidence in planning future innovations.

        "The response of civil society organisations to face the COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent restrictive measures adopted in Europe 33 the changes it caused to traditional business and it is therefore to be considered within the analysis of the CSOs acting under the category of SMEs, Crafts and Family Businesses. The main challenges reported concern to 3 main areas: \uf0b7 human resources (especially connected to telework); \uf0b7 technical infrastructure , (e.g., poor internet connection) and; \uf0b7 contextual (daily updates on legislation, bureaucracy to access funding). COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on small businesses, mainly because of their limited financial resources and scale of business 74 . The confinement period that took place in almost all of the EU countries changed dramatically the life and the work of many micro, small and medium enterprises, forcing them to uncover hypothetical solutions to accelerate and strengthen the re-starting of their economic recovery. Furthermore, SMEs are highly represented in sectors significantly affected by the containment measures , such as tourism, mobility, fashion and food 75 . OECD summarised the outcomes of 41 SME surveys identified world-wide on the impact of COVID-19, concluding that more than half of SMEs face severe losses in revenues; one third of SMEs fear to be out of business without further support within 1 month, and up to 50% within three months. However, this was not impacted in the same way across the whole small business\u2019s context, as they are quite broad and diverse . For example, even if many artists suffered the effects of the crisis, there has been an increase in demand for a variety of arts-and-crafts activities during the confinement period and such retailers were considered more \u2018essential\u2019 as they were able to facilitate enjoyment during times of self-isolation 76 . Many individual crafters could also find ways to provide online trainings through YouTube and thus publicise their work and maintain sales. Also, on a general angle, OECD refers that \u201cwhereas surveys since February show that SMEs and entrepreneurs are extremely worried about the impact of COVID-19 on their liquidity position and business survival, the most recent business surveys show some confidence improvements, possibly related to the significant policy efforts to address the SME liquidity gap and the lifting of lockdown measures in a number of countries. In this context, the policy perspective is gradually shifting from liquidity support measures for SME survival, which still remains a priority in most countries, to support for recovery.\u201d 77 The bureaucracy and delay in accessing lay-off and other types of funding support provided by the different governments to SMEs was highlighted as a \u201cbad example\u201d that should not be repeated in the future. Although a good relationship with authorities is overall reported, the urgency of the measures and often the lack of human resources from public administrations to respond to all the requests was seen as an area in need of improvement. 3.3.5.4 Highlights of successful practices in Europe It is not a simple task to collect a common pattern for the sector and neither a plain set of conclusions on the challenges and necessary measures to take for the future. However, even through diversity, from 74 Carruthers, P. (2020). How Coronavirus can kill small businesses: COVID-19.

        "34 a broad desk search 78,79,80,81 and also based on the answers provided by the CSOs that participated in the survey developed under the current study, it is adequate to aggregate the obtained results, related to the SMEs strategy to face COVID-19 in four main areas : \uf0b7 adapt to new customer demands; \uf0b7 increase the quality of the products; \uf0b7 improve the quality of services; \uf0b7 increase the use of technology. Digitalisation appears to be the main strategy to respond to the new and emerging needs. The Greek CSO reports they are making a high investment on digital tools to be able to improve high quality response to members and Austria informs that besides an info-point, they implemented a chatbot to facilitate navigation of users, given the high demand. However, these are the good examples, as a survey in Europe suggests that only 56 percent of all companies with 50 or fewer employees provided remote access to email, applications, and documents for their employees, compared with 93 percent of all companies with more than 250 employees 82 (McKinsey, 2020[15]). Overall, the response of these CSOs is acknowledged as a success, since they were able to adapt and provide the usual services, added to the emerging needs directly related to the COVID-19 topics. The capacity of adaptation and the commitment of the teams are seen as the highlights. From the desk search developed 83 , most of the CSOs supporting SMEs report similar types of services, mainly focusing on phone and email information; support to understand the rights and accompany the constant updates to regulations; training or actions to raise awareness on prevention and protection measures; facilitate access to financial support. Given the specific circumstances SMEs are currently facing, countries have put measures in place to support them. While the first concern is public health, a wide array of measures is being introduced to mitigate the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak on businesses. Specifically, many countries are urgently deploying measures to support SMEs and the self-employed during this severely challenging time, with a strong focus on initiatives to sustain short-term liquidity. Such policies take various shapes. Some countries have focused on more general policies that have the potential to cushion the blow for the economy and for all businesses. For instance, in many countries, Central Banks have stepped in to support lending by alleviating monetary conditions and enabling commercial banks to provide more loans to SMEs. Examples include the unprecedented measures taken by the US Federal Reserve and European Central Bank. Most EU countries have introduced specific policy measures 84 , many of them either specific to SMEs or being applicable to them. These include working time shortening, temporary lay-off and sick leave; 78 Winarsih, Indriastuti M., Fuad K.

Furthermore, although 75% of these organisations stated that they implemented new or adapted services in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and containment measures, they all refer to informative services made available to SMEs (e.g. information phone line 24/7; webpage with updated information on COVID-19 legislation and possible lines of financial support) or the adaptation of face-to-face processes into digital ones, that allow companies to keep their activity without the need to presential actions (e.g. in Greece, the paperwork that required personal attendance of an SME associate can now be provided online). The demand from SMEs was very high \u2013 e.g., in the survey, the Belgium respondent reports that in the first week of the lockdown they received 50.000 phone calls and emails requesting information and support; the Austrian CSO informs that in the period between March and August their dedicated webpage counted 15 million downloads and a specific task force was set up to answer around 80.000 requests via phone and email. According to the IMD World Competitiveness Ranking 85 , \u201ca marked pattern in this year\u2019s results, which are an amalgam of hard data taken from 2019 and survey responses from early 2020, is the strength of smaller economies. The benefit of small economies in the current crisis comes from their ability to fight a pandemic and from their economic competitiveness. In part these may be fed by the fact it is easy to find social consensus \u201d (Arturo Bris, Director of the IMD World Competitiveness Center and Professor of Finance). This was the case of Denmark, who ranked second in the study, followed by Switzerland in third. SMEs are mostly owner managed and combine high innovativeness with a national or international perspective on markets and high levels of social responsibility. The future of this successful model thus depends on the ability to recognize the most important trends at a strategic level and, at the same time, to formulate answers to them at the operational level 86 . Collaboration with the relevant actors in the business and societal field has a significant effect on business resilience and it may be essential to allow a proper implementation of the COVID-19 protocol in SME practices. 3.3.5.5 Conclusions The organisations acting under this area faced several challenges with the pandemic, mainly derived to their small dimension and scale and also their lack of resources and cashflow . Most of the SMEs and small businesses report they \u201c went digital \u201d whenever possible and searched for alternatives to sell their products or provide their services. The most urgent need reported relates to the modernisation of SMEs , through either digitalisation or the strengthening of their innovation capabilities. One key enabler reported in some countries was the implementation of structural policies to help SMEs to continue operations, even under containment measures and that allow them to update and become resilient 87 . However, the consultation developed also highlighted a high level of bureaucracy and several difficulties from SMEs to access funding support from governments and points out to the need of strengthening the connection between local, regional and national partners and therefore promoting coordination and rapid consensus . 85 IMD (2020) The IMD World Competitiveness Ranking, available at https://worldcompetitiveness.imd.org/rankings/wcy 86 Astor, Rammer, Klaus, Klose, & B\u00f6llhoff, (2016).

        "36 3.3.6 Social economy 3.3.6.1 Background and context Social economy includes \u201ccooperatives, mutual societies, non-profit associations, foundations and social enterprises. They operate a very broad number of commercial activities, provide a wide range of products and services across the European single market and generate millions of jobs. Social enterprises are also the engine for social innovation. They have different legal forms and various objectives ranging from agriculture and banking to provision of employment and sheltered workshops.\u201d 88 . This area refers to organisations whose primary purpose is to create social impact rather than profit. It is often called the third sector, civil society or the not-for-profit sector and is independent from local and national government, and distinct from the private sector 89 . Charities, community benefit societies and co-operatives, not-for-profit community businesses or community interest companies (CICs), credit unions and small informal community groups, as well as associations and foundations are the most common examples within this category. According to the European Commission, social economy organisations are ranging the 2 million, hiring 6% of the EU\u2019s employees (11 million people) and representing 10% of all businesses in the EU. They have different legal forms and various objectives ranging from agriculture and banking to provision of employment and sheltered workshops. The sector has a strategic weight in the European market and during the pandemic played an essential role, that will be even more relevant in addressing and mitigating the short- and long-term impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on economy and society, by promoting inclusive and sustainable economic models. 3.3.6.2 Stakeholder consultation Social economy is a widely represented area in the CSOs participating in the survey performed within the current study (N=26). From the total of respondents, 23% acknowledged being EESC members. The country distribution of their headquarters is distributed by several EU countries (although their action is broader, as some of the CSOs act throughout Europe, e.g., Association PINS). Even if sharing common principles and practices, social economy organisations in general show a great diversity in terms of legal forms, size, outreach and sectors, potentially including not-for-profit (focusing more on the social component) and for-profit entities (more economic-oriented) 90 . This diversity is also clear in the legal forms chosen by the CSOs participating in the survey as best describing their structure, which range through the following options (7 CSOs chose 2 or 3 different legal forms to describe their organisation). From the respondents, 9 refer to be associations, 4 social enterprises, 4 research institutions and 7 refer \u201cother\u201d types than the ones listed. Social economy organisations were traditionally involved in the provision of social services and healthcare but are currently are active in a wide range of sectors throughout the economic landscape 91 . Most of these organisations are CSOs but there are also some examples of large entities and groups of social economy organisations that can be competitive even with large companies. The business models for social economy are diverse but quite rooted in societal values and sustainable governance: they mobilise multiple resources, often apply sustainable operating practices, are locally anchored and facilitate co-operation and social innovation. Moreover, they adopt inclusive and democratic 88 European Commission (2020) Social economy in the EU, available at https://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/social-economy_en 89 Reach Volunteering website.

        "The response of civil society organisations to face the COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent restrictive measures adopted in Europe 37 governance, involving and empowering diverse stakeholders in their decision-making processes, thus promoting informed decisions about economic and social impact and a high degree of democracy in society. 3.3.6.3 Main challenges reported The changes brought by the COVID-19 containment measures involved many aspects of the organisations: from remote work which has become a customary modality, to the reorganization of spaces and working times; to the implementation of all safety and protection devices for workers, users, volunteers. In the sectors of the organisations dealing with welfare and health, the impact has also been powerful because it is requiring an overall rethinking of the way of working and designing services. If some CSOs report that they continued providing their services through virtual means and even increased their requests (e.g., in some liberal professions), there are also sectors, especially in social economy, where the impacts were incredibly negative: Citing a respondent to the study survey: \u201cthe pandemic significantly changed the situation of SOSTE's member organisations, social and health CSOs in Finland: 80% cancelled face-to-face group and peer support meetings; 40% closed their offices; 30% cancelled their services . CSOs that provide services reported monthly losses of up to hundreds of thousands of euros and even the risk of bankruptcies. As a result, the lives of many changed significantly. Limiting social contacts meant loneliness and isolation for many. Many lost their income and people could not access all the social and health services they needed. People in the most vulnerable situation may not have been able to access digital services and may not have received enough information about the corona virus and restrictions. Their situation may have deteriorated considerably without anyone noticing. Social debt began to build up and that is one of the major challenges to solve now, as the future funding of social and health CSO's is uncertain.\" During the pandemic, according to the reported information in the survey delivered under this study, several CSOs having as their core mission social care, but also other entities aiming to different statutory objectives, have stepped in delivering aid to those who lack other forms of social protection . Also, due to the interruption of many health and social care services during the lockdown, online and phone-based psychological support to users and family members have become determinant. Due to the closure of the daily services for disabled, mentally impaired and older people, amongst others, caregivers and family members were suddenly overwhelmed by the huge increase in the demand. In this regard, several of the participating CSOs have been at the forefront in coping with the need to secure continuity in basic health and care services to frail older people, long term patients and patients at higher COVID- 19 risk such as oncological patients. The respondents reported that the increase of people in vulnerable socio-economic situations due to job loss, sharpened inequalities and impoverishment of the most disadvantaged ones were the biggest societal challenges that the pandemic brought in and Europe will take long time to revert. The most hurt by job loss are often those depending on forms of informal employment, such as migrants in seasonal labour or those on casual day labour. Moreover, the most vulnerable are usually also those without savings or few alternative income sources and thus the pandemic and the containment measures increased their need of support for essential needs. In this regard, the collection presented in the catalogue in Annex 3 offers a comprehensive overview of actions put in place by CSOs to answer emergency needs such as food, medicine, hygiene product, childcare support for those parents who could not telework, etc. The fear of dying from COVID-19 and the social isolation that this implied, especially to the most vulnerable groups (disabled, mentally impaired, older adults) are the major societal impacts that the respondents indicate. Frail patients had many difficult to be admitted to the hospital for acute disease ",
        "38 and relapsing of chronic disease due to the shortage of hospital beds and fear to be infected. The stop and reduction of the possibility to perform visits in an outpatient department have determined a delay in the diagnosis of several diseases and a worsening of chronic diseases. In particular, patients with dementia presented a worsening in the behavioural symptoms, cognitive impairment and consequently a caregiver burden . This was determined also by social distancing, lockdown rules and the crisis itself. Children and youth also had to comply with health and safety regulations, which implied an increased emotional and psychological distress. For different reasons, the same emotional effects were heavy for the most vulnerable groups, namely due to lack of financial resources or a higher risk of unemployment. Sexual and Gender Based Violence, as well as discrimination followed an increasing trend 92 during the confinement period, with a specific focus on domestic violence; in the same direction, structural inequality and racism had a higher impact on Black and minority communities. Food, health and social assistance were some of the main basic needs that the CSOs understood as needed. The mandatory closure of some services, e.g., Day Care Centres, meant that most of the older citizens were left without basic support (food and personal hygiene) and regular visits. This implied an increased need of emotional and psychological support. The provision of all of these services implied that CSOs had to overcome a series of constraints, which were mainly caused by contextual factors but also to the less good implementation of the contingency measures and related actions and that can therefore be improved for the future. The need to rapidly implement the COVID-19 contingency plans and their implementation in real contexts was not always simple. On one side, the regulations were being revised and new decrees released with an incredibly high frequency, which implied constant changes in the field conditions of service delivery . Furthermore, the plans often implied the purchase of protective equipment , tools and materials that were not immediately accessible or were temporarily unavailable due to excessive demand (e.g., individual protection equipment; some medicines; ventilators). In addition, the need for workers who can replace the ones in isolation and ensure teams working in mirror demanded a workforce that is non-existing, for example, in the social care sector. Furthermore, teleworking also brought enormous challenges. The more direct were connected to insufficient tools or poor digital infrastructure . However, more difficult to easily solve, the lack of skills and competences to use online facilities, combined with lack of the necessary equipment / devices, whether from the professionals as well as on the users' side, made it difficult to ensure a complete digital transition that was possible in other sectors. Also, for seasonal workers , such as the tourism sector where most of them are under seasonal contracts, the unemployment and lack of qualifications to reformulate their professional careers led to financial difficulties that impacted on their personal life. CSOs in the area of social economy also reported difficulties in adapting the general measures adopted by the Government and the EU in favour of enterprises to the specific needs of social economy, which was not always possible (e.g., restrictions on SME economic activities and their needs in fiscal moratoria and fiscal incentives). 3.3.6.4 Highlights of successful practices in Europe In this area, it is worth to mention positive examples, such as the one of CEPES (Confederaci\u00f3n Empresarial de Economia Social), that is working in close cooperation with the Spanish Government to 92 World Health Organisation (2020). Coronavirus disease (COVID-19): Violence against women, available at https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/violence-against-women-during- covid-19?gclid=Cj0KCQjwuL_8BRCXARIsAGiC51D_xohfhmK6kUaxmQZ7t2RomyjDShiJCuNq13_5hf9x1lfCaijtHF0aAkAuEALw_wcB ",
        "The response of civil society organisations to face the COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent restrictive measures adopted in Europe 39 jointly set up new measures to develop and strengthen social economy enterprises in industrial, new emerging and service sectors in medium- and long-term. Also in Spain, the social economy financial entities (cooperative and ethical banks) have created new financial products to freeing up liquidity to all private sector in general and to support social economy enterprises in particular. The work and dialogue with numerous actors and stakeholders, mainly transdisciplinary/cross- sectoral exchanges between scientists and practitioners, as well as dissemination and information of research results, is recognised by the respondent CSOs as a powerful tool to influencing/achieving societal and public policy changes. This was partially hindered in the first months of the pandemic in 2020, but it is now acknowledged that new forms of collaboration are solid and established virtually and will now be leveraged for the next period. Regarding the societal challenges, the list of difficulties was long; however, the new solidarity initiatives brought up by these CSOs to address and face these challenges are worthy to mention: The European Food Banks Federation (FEBA) remained open to prevent food waste and redistribute food, operating in a new and increasingly complex environment: an increased demand for food, a shortage of volunteers, a drop in financial resources 93 , 94 . They launched a European COVID-19 Social Emergency Fund, an effort to secure the activity of European Food Banks calling on corporations, foundations, organizations, and private citizens to join efforts supporting Food Banks in Europe. The goal is to raise EUR 10 million in three years. During the period March-July 2020 FEBA had contacts with more than 80 corporations, foundations, and organizations for a total commitment of EUR 4.4 million. C\u00e1ritas Coimbra kicked-off two campaigns to support families in financial difficulties. Through M\u00e1scara Solid\u00e1ria (Solidary Mask), which consisted of the making and selling of non-surgical social masks by the clients and workers of a Community Centre, it was possible to buy fresh products such as yogurt, meat, fish, vegetables and fruits for selected families in need. At the same time, Somos Fam\u00edlia (We Are Family) aimed to attract families from civil society that \u201cadopted\u201d families in need and to whom they delivered monthly a basket filled with essential products 95 . The Lithuanian Association of Emotional Support Services noticed an increased level of anxiety and a pick in support requests. Their organisational challenge was to start providing telephone-based emotional support services partly from home (which had not been possible before). In this case, the challenge was transformed in an opportunity to revise the provision of services. ConfCooperative transformed 3 hotels in the Bergamo province, adapted to accommodate the people discharged from the hospitals, just after them are stabilized, so as to free up beds in the hospital facilities. This service allowed to welcome about 500 people in 9 weeks of activity. AFEdemy, in cooperation with the Hague Municipality, developed a unique default questionnaire to validate among the older citizens the age-friendliness of the environments in the city. Training activities were reported by several CSOs, either directed to workers, users or member organisations. For example, Pellervo Coop provided training for SME cooperatives: social media, digital communication, finance, with participants from 30 different cooperatives.

PRAKSIS supported the infrastructure of 120 places established by the Athens Municipality in order to facilitate the needs of homeless people in Athens during the lockdown (and after) and provide them with holistic support (accommodation included), namely provision of staff (medical, administrative, social workers), sharing and implementing of protocols, support in social intakes, referrals and street work. Imkaan informed in the survey of an increased activity in strategic advocacy with government departments and local government, specifically advocating on behalf of beneficiaries and members, increasing also the CSO capacity for policy work. 3.3.6.5 Conclusions Social economy, being a wide and varied field, brings to the table a number of challenges, needs and areas to be tackled, such as a huge increase of loneliness and isolation , racism and discrimination , as well as sharpened inequalities and impoverishment . Several CSOs stepped in delivering aid to those who lack other forms of social protection, but also searched for alternative financial products and measures to facilitate the survival of social economy enterprises. Two areas were highlighted in the consultation and desk search carried out in this study: 1. Digitalisation is a transversal theme referred to in the challenges, needs and initiatives. Several organisations used digital means and tools to provide their services and develop initiatives and this was therefore something referred as an opportunity. However, CSOs also report the need to invest in equipment and infrastructure, which requires support measures and funding lines. Moreover, training for professionals, actions of literacy in several areas, for citizens in general and for specific publics, with targeted information, were also reported as hindering factors for a proper use of technologies, and therefore increased the digital divide. 2. One other main aspect relates to actions of advocacy for the protection and promotion of the most fragile in society. Such actions are reported amongst the initiatives that responded to the pandemic, with the main aim to maintain and increase the societal agenda at the top of the priorities , namely by promoting awareness-raising campaigns to gather wide public support and ensuring the creation of the necessary channels to policy makers, especially during the forthcoming financial crisis. 3.3.7 Others This section reports about the initiatives put forward by those CSOs whose representatives did not recognize their organization as belonging or potentially connected to any of the EESC Diversity Group areas. The three members of EESC Group I and II that participated in the study have ticked this category. 3.3.7.1 Stakeholder consultation The category \u201cOthers\u201d gathered 8 answers in the survey, 4 of which EESC members (1 in Group I, 1 in Group II and 2 in Group III). They include trade unions and trade associations, employer and industrial associations, CSOs connected to education, such as a Third Age university, public health and one aimed at the touristic sector and are distributes by seven European countries. 3.3.7.2 Main challenges reported ",
        "The response of civil society organisations to face the COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent restrictive measures adopted in Europe 41 Although the respondents have not self-classified themselves as belonging to any of the EESC areas, most of the challenges they have reported are clearly similarly or in line with those raised the other respondents. In particular, according to the respondents representing employers\u2019 organisations, many businesses have partially or totally closed during the confinement period, having huge losses of sales and revenue . Many will never reopen and those who did, have serious breaks in activity due to the safety precautions. Plenty have used lay-off and other extraordinary measures to avoid firing workers, but the continuity of the containment measures will hinder a sustainable recovery of the businesses. The introduction of new forms of employment such as teleworking and the increase of part-time jobs also implied an additional load for organisations and companies. The implementation of health and safety protocols, as well as the regular control hygiene measures implied an added burden, either in terms of procedures, as well as to labour costs and the non-labour costs (individual protection equipment, for example), especially due to the increase of the prices of products relevant to hygiene and safety (mask, antiseptic, COVID-19 tests). In a societal perspective, main challenges are reported in relation to the huge burden posed by the pandemic on the health system such as the increased negative outcome risk (death, complications, hospitalisation) by COVID-19, worsening of existing disease and new development of disease and the postponement of urgent interventions, such as the start of dialysis or transplantation as well as the increase of unemployment, emphasized by one organisation of Group II, thus representing the workers\u2019 perspectives. The increase of domestic violence during the lockdown and the difficulties faced by undocumented migrants without any unemployment benefit and health protection are also cited. 3.3.7.3 Highlights of successful practices In line with the challenges exposed above, the main initiatives to be highlighted in the \u201cOther\u201d activity area pertain to either health and healthcare focused organisations or labour and employers\u2019 organisations. In the health sector, notable advocacy activities and policy influence efforts have been put in place by networks such as the European Kidney Diseases Alliance (EKHA) and the European Chronic Diseases Alliance. Their representative has participated in the hearing of the \u2018Expert Panel on effective ways of investing in health\u2019 held by the Commission during which EKHA has presented 96 a position paper on the heavy toll taken by Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patients as a result of the outbreak, the lessons learnt from this crisis and potential solutions to improve kidney care in the context of healthcare systems resilience. At the ground national level, an example of proactive reaction is provided by the non-profit association \u201cHouse Hospital Onlus\u201d in Italy that has been collaborating with Local Health Agency Naples 3 (ASL NA 3) in order to strengthen services to frail older adults and oncological patients . The employers\u2019 perspective has been brought into light by the Confederation of Trade and Services in Portugal (CCP) and the Cyprus Employers & Industrialists Federation (OEB), the latter belonging to EESC Group I. Similarly to what has been done by the SMEs\u2019 organisations mentioned above, both organisations have reported that they have launched a phone assistance service providing advisory support services to businesses regarding the Economic/Work Support Schemes, the new COVID-19 related regulations, directives, health and safety protocols, measures and other labour/business issues as well as intensified their online information activities through their websites, newsletters and social media channels. 96 European Kidney Health Alliance (2020) input for \u201cThe Expert Panel on effective ways of investing in health\u201d In contribution to \u201cA framework for resilient organisation of health and social care following the covid-19 pandemic\u201d, available at http://ekha.eu/wp- content/uploads/20020-09-EKHA-input-sustainable-health_DEF.pdf ",
        "42 On the other hand, the Group II member who joined the study brought in the perspectives of workers\u2019 organisations and reported from Cyprus an interesting example of policy influence and lobbying to obtain legislative protection for workers in the new forms of employment such as telework that is further illustrated in section 3.4 3.3.7.4 Conclusions The main conclusions to be retrieved from the organisations not included in the six categories of the EESC Diversity Group are aligned with those previously reported and do not imply any further consideration. 3.4 Societal impacts of the new or adapted activities and initiatives put in place by the CSOs Only 27% of the respondents reported they have been monitoring the impact of their new or adapted activities on their respective recipients, which reiterates somehow the general lack of resources, as well- established impact assessment systems and methods usually require specialized competences and effort and are rarely put in place by small and local organizations. It is not a surprise that among the most common indicators used, the highest ranked are those relatively easier to calculate, such as the number of members or users reached out by direct support measures, the number of requests for support received and the number of followers on social media, closely followed by the number of people engaged in consultations and the number of visits to the organisations\u2019 websites. For the ones that created campaigns for awareness raising or to raise additional resources, the reaction from society or from policy makers, as well as media coverage, were the most frequent \u201csign\u201d to measure achievement. Nevertheless, none of the respondents have provided reports and sources on such measures and indicators. The reasons are mainly rooted in two aspects: smaller organisations have no resources to carry on systematic tracking and analytical tasks while the biggest networks have declared they are still elaborating data and information collected and the results are not publicly disclosed yet. Figure 8. Indicators used to measure the impact of CSOs actions However, when asked about the numbers of users that have been reached out by or benefitted of their initiatives, 92 out of 112 respondents have been able to provide estimations that serve to draw a picture of the overall type and size of organisations that are being most active in the pandemic response.

        "The response of civil society organisations to face the COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent restrictive measures adopted in Europe 43 to reach either between 1 and 100 people (27%) and between 101 and 1000 (27%), those ranges being typical of small sized organisations operating at local or regional level. The rest of respondents declared their initiatives have benefited between 1.001 and 10.000 people (13%), between 10.001 and 100.000 (12%) and between 100.001 and 1.000.000 (10%). Only 3% of the CSOs (representing EU-wide networks and national social economy confederations) participating in the survey declared their initiatives were capable to reach more than 1.000.000 of users or members. Similarly to impact, only 42% of the CSOs stated they are monitoring satisfaction of their users. In a few situations, specific evaluation/monitoring was performed and is reported with quantitative results: for example, the time of response was measured, user satisfaction was assessed (e.g. after the conclusion of an online training or informative session, as reported by the European Social Action Network (ESAN)) and the number of actions (e.g. number of calls, number of donations) was registered. Regarding the perception of success of the initiatives implemented, only one respondent considered the reported initiative as not achieved. It was the case of a policy influence activity that did not progress as expected, which was the formal issuing of a Ministerial Decree. On the contrary, other respondents have highlighted cases of successful policy influence, which are summarised in the subsequent paragraph. All the other initiatives presented in the following section were considered as successful by their promoters. From an overall qualitative assessment of the descriptive responses where the participants described the reasons why they assessed their initiative as successful, it is possible to perceive the following: \uf0b7 In most of the situations, the initiative intended to find means, tools or methods to provide the existing services in an alternative modality, e.g., psychological support provided by videoconference; information to members provided by phone, videocall or through online tools; facilitating family connections, among others. In these situations, the suitable solution was identified and put in place, even if some of the promoters stress the need to increase broadband connectivity (internet coverage in rural areas, for example), digital literacy and awareness on existing tools for online communication. \uf0b7 For services connected to social aid or support to certain professional classes, in many cases, there was a raise in the demand, which even implied a bigger investment on resources (e.g., on human resources for services working 7/7; on collecting more food or money donations for support to persons who lost their jobs or found themselves in problematic financial situations). \uf0b7 For new activities, the indicators for success were more varied: for example, for those CSOs who installed hospitals or medical services, the low or inexistent number of casualties was considered as a metric for success. \uf0b7 On the area of research, new data collected and publicly shared or new instruments developed under this framework are also reported as a positive outcome. Research activities have been undertaken by both organisations which were used to perform studies and release reports and organisations that did not have such type of activities in their original scope. From farmers\u2019 associations to women rights\u2019 activist groups, it is visible a tremendous capacity of quick reaction and adaptation to remote work , although scrambling with limited resources which has been affecting more the small and local organisations than the well-established national organisations and international networks. The outbreak-induced necessity to work from home has removed, at least temporarily, many of the barriers to telework. ",
        "44 However, CSOs are also playing a key role in claiming that teleworking is still not for everybody . According to a new report by the JRC and Eurofound 97 , scientists warn about the emergence of a new divide and the possibility that teleworking may also exacerbate existing gender divides, notably on working mothers. National research examples 98 and expert opinions 99 as well as international organizations such as UNESCO 100 have raised particular concerns about the consequences of school closure for children from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds with data clearly showing that pupils from advantaged backgrounds receive more parental support, have better connectivity availably at home and more resources (e.g., own computer) for home-schooling. Similarly, their parents have on average lower digital literacy skills to support them. Several CSOs have settled intervention to support the educational system in the production of materials, training teachers and pupils with basic IT competences and equipping economically disadvantaged families with devices for distance learning. Services sectors have been heavily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Tourism, transport and distribution services, for example, have suffered as a result of mobility restrictions and social distancing measures imposed for public health reasons. Confinement measures have moved consumers further online, changed their demands and exacerbated behavioural biases. This leads to a massive crisis impact small commerce\u2019s, arts & crafts, family businesses and SMEs that were not prepared to a smooth and quick shift to e-commerce as well as increasing reports of unfair, misleading and fraudulent commercial practices online which urge consumers\u2019 associations and networks to strive for more protective measures to safeguard consumers \u2019 health and safety. On another note, the continued pressure and advocacy work of consumers organisations and environmental CSOs has recently played an important role in making a focus on green stimulus packages emerge in many regions as governments recognize that rebuilding green can spur economic and job growth and create a more resilient system. The EU has already confirmed 101 the health crisis won\u2019t stop Europe from developing bolder 2030 climate targets, and that green finance will be a key focus of the post-recovery phase. This is a relevant note that will further explored in section 4.2.6. As Civil Society Europe reported, CSOs across Europe are playing a \u201cwatchdog\u201d role by monitoring the policy development\u201d and calling for policy changes and legislation adjustments, whereas the impact of decisions to contain the pandemic and calling for changes appear to be disproportionate or unjustified. Some examples of successful policy influence actions have been brought to the attention of this study team by the survey respondents and are presented hereby. In this regard, it is interesting to see how civic legal and policy \u201cwatch\u201d initiatives such as the European Center for Not-for-Profit Law Stichting (ECNL) based in The Hague are warning on how CSOs can use EU law to safeguard access to funding which is considered a \u201ca core component of the right to freedom 97 Sostero M., Milasi S., Hurley J., Fern\u00e1ndez-Mac\u00edas E., Bisello M.

With regard to vulnerable and particularly disabled people, Inclusion Europe submitted a Petition at the PETI Committee (No 0470/2020) on the rights of persons with intellectual disabilities in the COVID- 19 crisis, which resulted in a Resolution adopted by European Parliament (2020/2680(RSP)) 103 . Other examples that are worth to note belong to the sphere of financial legislations, aids and tax regulations. The most relevant activity carried out by CEPES (Spain) has been to allow social economy enterprises to call for Temporary Employment Regulation ( Expediente de regulaci\u00f3n temporal de Empleo, ERTE ). In a first moment, ERTE procedures were not applicable to social economy enterprises, and this problem was fixed after a legal proposal of CEPES in front of the Spanish Government. Similarly, lobbying activities toward the government reported by the Central Union of Agricultural Producers and Forest Owners in Finland were successful in getting more advantageous financial assistance for entrepreneurs who suffered for the COVID-19 crisis. Relevant noteworthy examples have been provided also by some EESC members from Group II, such as the Pancyprian Federation of Labour (PEO) that has engaged in a campaign to promote a new law concerning the protection of the workers in the new forms of employment such as telework. The Ministry of Labour has prepared a draft legislation still pending for approval, although remote working has been applied, where applicable, throughout the public sector and among local authorities since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and the pressures from civil society have made possible its extension for certain groups (groups facing high risk and parents of children under the age of 15). From the non-EU countries, other cases of successful legal initiatives were referred to tax reliefs. For instance, the Ukrainian Chamber of Tax Advisers played an important role in shaping the Business Support Law so as to allow full deductibility for Ukrainian taxpayers on donations made to non-profit organisations or medical institutions with the aim to prevent the spread of COVID-19 within Ukraine. Such donations may include funds, medicines, disinfection products, medical equipment, protective equipment, expendable materials, reagents, food, other equipment or materials as per the list approved by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. Earlier, taxpayers were allowed to deduct these donations for tax purposes only in the amount of up to 4% of their taxable profit for the previous year. 102 OSCE\u2019s Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) (2015), Guidelines on Freedom of Association, OSCE/ODIHR 2015 ISBN 978-92-9234-906-6.

        "46 4. Recommendations In June 2020, the EESC adopted a resolution containing its \u201cProposal for post-COVID-19 crisis reconstruction and recovery\u201d 104 . According to this document, the pandemic brought a key moment to re- think, restructure and improve society, not only to tackle the negative effects visible in the short-term and, thus, this process \u201cwill have to be based on the principles underpinning all our work: protecting human and social rights, democratic values and the rule of law, unlock the full potential of the Single Market, achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), creating a circular economy and achieving climate neutrality in the EU by 2050 at the latest. We must also ensure good governance and democratic accountability. It is also imperative to understand why certain social groups were left more vulnerable during the crisis, both in terms of insufficient protection against contagion and loss of livelihood, and to work to limit such vulnerability going forward.\u201d The report \u201cThe Future of Civil Society Organisations\u201d released by a group of leaders of civil society networks and platforms and coordinated by the International Council of Voluntary Agencies (ICVA) 105 goes in the same direction, stating that \u201cthe current challenges and opportunities brought by the COVID- 19 pandemic call for a conversation over the transformations we want to see in society, and in the humanitarian, social justice and environmental sector. (\u2026) If civil society is challenged, so are democracy and participatory decision-making; if civil society is challenged, so are equality, social cohesion and non-discrimination; if civil society is challenged, so are transparency and accountability, especially as regards those in position of power. That cannot be allowed.\u201d The present study, even though focusing on certain segments of civil society, allows to reaffirm that CSOs have played and are playing an essential role in addressing and mitigating the short- and long- term impacts of the pandemic, namely complementing public services and the government action in an innovative and flexible way (63 out of the 76 participants who completed all the survey sections, i.e. 83% stated that they either agree or strongly agree that the CSOs are playing a critical role in the national response to COVID-19, as depicted in Figure 9 below). This last section takes stock of the information collected and the relevant conclusions drawn by other studies published in the last months and summarizes the arguments supporting the central role of civil society organisations, not only in the immediate response but also to \u201creshape the post-crisis economy by promoting inclusive and sustainable economic models\u201d 106 First, the authors identify key areas for reflection on the future of European CSOs departing from the ground considerations that can be drawn from the survey results\u2019 analysis, in addition to the review of some specific and relevant literature sources. Second, a set of policy recommendations for the European institutions and governments is proposed and argued with the overall aim to highlight that \u201conly a holistic response based on cross-sectoral collaboration at all levels of society can build adaptive capacity to respond to the immediate and long- term effects of COVID-19\u201d 107 . Such response is ultimately viable, only if policy-making shifts to 104 EESC (2020), EESC proposals for post-COVID-19 crisis reconstruction and recovery: \"The EU must be guided by the principle of being considered a community of common destiny.\" Resolution based on the work of the Subcommittee on post-COVID-19 recovery and reconstruction, adopted on 11 th June 2020.

A series of statements have been proposed to the CSOs seeking to gather their position in relation to them. Matching the collected answers (76 organizations out of the total of 112 participants have completed this part of the survey, see Figure 9) with the desk search findings, it is possible to cluster two main areas as relevant for analysis and for future reflections as follows: \uf0b7 Threats to the future role of CSOs in participatory democracy and their capacity to advocate for human and basic rights; \uf0b7 Challenges that could hamper the CSOs\u2019 ability to recover from the crisis and be sustainable over time imperilling their capacity to protect the most fragile from social exclusion and poverty. .

        "48 4.1.1 Threats to the future role of CSOs in participatory democracy and their capacity to advocate for human and basic rights The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Spring 2020 has made evident, in most countries, that \u201ca sense of emergency has a direct result on motivation and willingness to help\u201d, as reported by the EESC study Finding a new consensus on European civil society values and their evaluation 108 . Many CSOs reported being approached in greater numbers than usual by people offering to help, donate or volunteer and the above-mentioned study even reports that \u201cthe profound and sudden impact of the Coronavirus on all European societies has had the effect of replacing divisive talk about immigration and other hot-button topics, allowing a less highly-charged and confrontational debate to emerge\u201d. However, with the second wave of the pandemic currently ongoing as the present document is drafted, the same conclusions cannot be fully applicable anymore. The study previously referred already predicted that populism would remain an extensive challenge and this is being confirmed as the year of 2020 reaches its end. The catastrophic impact of the containment measures in many vital sectors of the economy, namely on the capacity of companies and organisations to remain open and labouring and the effects on employment, is hindering social consensus. There have been protests and demonstrations around Europe against responses to the pandemic by governmental bodies and many populist replies 109 , including several based on racist and discriminatory ideologies and principles attempting against basic human rights, such as not considering the rights of all to adequate healthcare provision. The caring context that was predominant during the first wave period is no longer cohesive and a fundamental division is being created in several countries, between health provision and economic survival, but this seems not to be duly supported by objective data: \u201c\u2026among countries with available GDP data, we do not see any evidence of a trade-off between protecting people\u2019s health and protecting the economy. Rather the relationship we see between the health and economic impacts of the pandemic goes in the opposite direction. As well as saving lives, countries controlling the outbreak effectively may have adopted the best economic strategy too 110 \u201d. However, the message is often shared in non- objective ways and the societal agenda is being threatened by the desire to rescue economy, prevent poverty and decrease unemployment. Furthermore, not all democratic regimes across Member States are identical and there are a few hostile reactions to CSOs being critical towards the government, this being a connotation of the pre-pandemic political context which still persists. According to a report from the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) 111 well before the global crisis COVID-19 entailed, media reports were suggesting an \u201cincrease in negative public and political discourse against CSOs and activists in a number of countries. This includes belittling CSOs or accusing them of allegedly serving as people smugglers, undermining security, or acting as foreign agents\u201d 112 . Even when this is not the case, despite the essential role of CSOs, the huge differences in terms of political influence, lobbying and networking capacity due to the variety of the organized civil society 108 EESC (2020). \u201cFinding a new consensus on European civil society values and their evaluation\u201d, available at https://www.eesc.europa.eu/en/our-work/publications-other-work/publications/finding-new-consensus-european-civil-society-values-and- their-evaluation-study. 109 Henley J.

        "The response of civil society organisations to face the COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent restrictive measures adopted in Europe 49 landscape very often implies a lack of representation/visibility, when compared to other established stakeholders in the European landscape. At the level of the European institutions, relevant initiatives keep working to improve such unbalance, such as the Policy Forum on Development (PFD), a multi- stakeholder space for dialogue on EU development policy established by the European Commission and including in its membership 75 CSOs and associations of local authorities (ALAs), carrying out research to understand how development cooperation, specifically its work in support to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), is affected by COVID-19 113 . There are also a number of relevant initiatives reported by the participants of the survey (cfr. Section 3.4) and at the national level, several Member States have established mechanisms for different types of consultations and engagement with CSOs, including specific legislative or policy proposals but also broader cooperation, as reported in this country-specific bulletins 114 compiled by the European Committee on Democracy and Governance (CDDG), i.e. the Council of Europe intergovernmental forum where representatives of the Member States meet to exchange and follow up on the state of democratic governance in Europe. However, this practice is not identical among Member States and some of these participatory roles have been actually been abolished in the last years, taking as examples Poland and the Netherlands, in the areas of minorities and discrimination 115 . This is corroborated by the consultation held under this study, as 51% of the respondents consider that \u201cgovernments failed to recognize and utilize local CSOs\u2019 skills, experience and networks in responding to COVID-19\u201d and 55% refer that \u201cthe works conducted by CSOs in documenting structural inequalities and advocating for political changes is threatened by the power centralisation which is characterising many national responses\u201d (Figure 9). Especially when compared to the industrial actors, the influence that CSOs can gather as a sector is insufficient and this is a genuine threat to the right of participation in public affairs, namely to civil participation , defined as \u201cthe engagement of individuals, NGOs and civil society at large in decision- making processes by public authorities\u201d, as recognised in Article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 116 and recently reaffirmed in the Council of Europe Guidelines for civil participation in political decision-making 117 , as well as in article 15, n. 1. of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, that states: \u201cIn order to promote good governance and ensure the participation of civil society, the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies shall conduct their work as openly as possible.\u201d 118 . It is important to state that the intrinsic value of civil society is attributed to its mission and power to mobilise citizens and communities to support social causes. The Coronavirus pandemic involves both human rights and ethical and political responsibilities. A range of human rights that need to be taken into account include our right to health, but also a right to freedom and movement, to education, to information, to shelter. As countries ramp up exclusionary travel and border policies, some of these rights (e.g. right to circulate) may be imperilled, and governments need 113 European Commission Policy Forum on Development (PFD) (2020), 2020 PFD Consultation: responses on COVID-19, available at: https://europa.eu/capacity4dev/policy-forum-development/wiki/analysis-pfd-members-responses-covid-19. 114 Council of Europe website, European Committee on Democracy and Governance and COVID-19, at: https://www.coe.int/en/web/good- governance/cddg-and-covid#{%2264787140%22:[21]}. 115 FRA (2018).

        "50 to strike a balance between protecting health and respecting human rights 119 . In this regard, 32% of the respondents to the survey considered that the special legislations to authorise rapid actions pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic adopted in the country/countries where their organization operate had negative effects on the capacity of CSOs to promote rights and democracy. One relevant example in this direction is the Joint Position Paper 120 subscribed by several European networks, such as FEANTSA and C\u00e1ritas Europa, where they report that the COVID-19 pandemic laid bare and exacerbated many of these challenges and that, for instance, social service providers, workers and people using these services have been largely voiceless during the pandemic. In this context, there have been a plethora of voices calling the attention of the governments to those risks endangering human rights, such as the United Nations that called upon all States to ensure that all human rights were respected, protected, and fulfilled while combating the pandemic and that their responses to the COVID-19 pandemic were in full compliance with their human rights obligations and commitments 121 . The recommendations in this study address this threat and aim to foster the maintenance and even the increase of civil participation. These forecasts make even more important to secure mechanisms for governments\u2019 accountability and open and transparent decision-making processes, allowing CSOs\u2019 to keep their role of vigilant actors safeguarding rights and nurturing an open civic space, which is the utmost condition for lively democracies to progress . 4.1.2 Challenges that could hamper the CSOs\u2019 ability to recover from the crisis and be sustainable over time imperilling their capacity to protect the most fragile from social exclusion and poverty Whereas it will be surely the subject of further debates and reflections whether COVID-19 has presented an existential threat to civil society\u2019s relevance and legitimacy, it is a broadly recognized fact that \u201ccivil society, from local to international levels, is often the first responder in situations of emergency, including public health emergencies, natural disasters and human induced humanitarian crises, including those caused by conflict. [\u2026] However, sometimes, despite its best efforts, civil society is overwhelmed by the scale of the crisis too\u201d 122 . In this regard, 64,5% of the respondents to the survey either agreed or strongly agreed that it is going to have a devastating impact on the sustainability of many CSOs. The funding of CSOs is indeed quite unstable, as the sources that they can take advantage of are not very diverse and, as stated by the survey respondents, they are heavily dependent upon donations, membership fees and European funding. A recent study from Forus 123 , which corroborates these results, adds that most of the platforms and networks rely largely or exclusively on EU funding and the smaller national CSO platforms rely on member fees, that vary \u201caccording to the local civil society context, including factors such as the political and funding environment\u201d. Moreover, some of these organisations avoid mandatory fees to prevent members from feeling obliged to contribute. This is of course a 119 Harvard Kennedy School (2020).

        "The response of civil society organisations to face the COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent restrictive measures adopted in Europe 51 challenge to stability of resources, capacity for investments and for sustainability in times of social and economic crisis. If CSOs that provide services to users in subsidiarity from the State (e.g., social care or health services) can more often have stable funding from the public budget, the CSOs that are mostly connected to advocacy and human rights usually prefer not to accept government funds to maintain their independence and neutrality. According to one of the EESC studies, \u201cseveral organisations in Italy and Greece reported that they have to depend on project-based funding more than they would like. This type of funding is problematic because it means they only have time to chase short-term projects rather than focusing on their long-term goals. Funding often comes with conditions that de facto determine the whole organisation\u2019s work.\u201d 124 . The funding difficulties were referred in section 3 and their impacts were directly felt by several CSOs that struggled with severe difficulties to face the emerging needs coming from the COVID-19 restriction measures, either to acquire new digital tools, protective equipment, or even the lack of direct revenues to face monthly expenses. In line with this, when asked about the main threats that can hamper the existence of their organization, the loss of funding was the top ranked threat (12,5%) followed by the reduced face-to-face community interaction (12.1%) and the extent of the reduced and cancelled operations due to COVID-19 (9,7%). Stable funding, allowing for long term planning, flexibility and certainty, is thus a critical point for CSOs\u2019 sustainability and one major risk for imperilling their capacity to protect the most fragile from social exclusion and poverty. Moreover, the pandemic can be misused by governments to undermine the role of CSOs. The above mentioned FRA report relates an \u201cemerging narrative distinguishing \u2018good\u2019 versus \u2018bad\u2019 CSOs. This in particular affects CSOs working on human rights issues (advocacy or litigation), putting them against service providing CSOs, which are often depicted as \u2018genuinely useful\u2019 or \u2018good\u2019 CSOs in the public discourse\u201d 125 . This discourse does not recognise the capacity demonstrated by several CSOs , including several among the participants to the present study, to offer multiple forms of response simultaneously , and it could potentially offer a partial explanation to the fact that only 42 out of 76 CSOs agreed that COVID- 19 will result in a greater public appreciation for their work. As the recent report from CIVICUS acknowledges 126 , \u201cthey were effective precisely because they combined different responses, such as providing essential goods and services to communities, sharing information and advocating towards states for rights, and in connecting these responses, they used a variety of tactics\u201d. In summary, the main societal challenge to be tackled will most likely be connected to the increase of poverty and the enormous inequalities arising from it, which can be successfully addressed only with a combination of strategies. According to a study developed by UNI-WIDER 127 , \u201cCOVID-19 poses a real challenge to the UN Sustainable Development Goal of ending poverty by 2030 because global poverty could increase for the first time since 1990 and, depending on the poverty line, such increase could represent a reversal of approximately a decade in the world\u2019s progress in reducing poverty. In some regions the adverse impacts could result in poverty levels similar to those recorded 30 years ago.

        "52 living in poverty could increase by 420\u2013580 million, relative to the latest official recorded figures for 2018.\u201d The answers of most of the CSOs to the survey developed under this study, especially those in the areas of Associational Life (cfr. Section 3.3.1) and Social Economy (cfr. 3.3.6), already anticipated this concern: the huge increase of several inequalities, namely caused by poverty, discrimination and social exclusion will thus bring as one of the CSOs\u2019 major roles to be the guardian of common good and social progress. 4.2 Policy recommendations In this section, departing from the results of the survey exposed at the webinar held with the Members of the Diversity Group Presidency, a series of actionable policy recommendations are formulated around the topics highlighted in the following figure: Figure 10. Policy recommendations 4.2.1 Leverage and voice new solidarity and new form of social activism, while promoting links and cross-fertilisation mechanisms between newly emerged groups and established CSOs \u201cSince the pandemic started, we have seen neighbours smiling at each other, friends and family talking more often, communities supporting those hit hardest, supermarkets prioritizing vulnerable customers, children displaying teddy bears and rainbows in their windows, people and companies making masks and protective equipment, volunteers helping in foodbanks. This is how the future could look like: caring and supporting each other more \u2013 more solidarity\u201d 128 . From the survey respondents and several search sources, it is clear that new solidarity circles and also new forms of civic activism that erupted during the pandemic are an opportunity to increase public awareness and engagement, as well as the democratic participation of citizens in selecting policy and investment priorities. Several of these movement networks also intend to address \u201cdemocratic deficits 128 Valls D.

These new activism movements are informal and varied and often based on social media or informal digital tools. As they are rooted on common ideas (usually formulated in a simple and easy-to- understand manner) instead of formal organisation and administrative rules, they are easy to build, agile to respond and to rapidly swift or adapt depending on societal emergent needs. From the survey replies, it was brought forward that informal volunteering is \u201con the rise\u201d and if some of the CSOs saw these movements as positive and even supported them by providing capacity-building and training, other see them as potentially harmful, as they often are not fully aware of liability or safety, for example with proper insurance for volunteers. Nevertheless, 65% of the respondents agree or strongly agree that \u201cchallenges and opportunities of online technologies will lead to a shift from traditionally organised CSOs to more informal activism (e.g. self-help groups, social solidarity networks)\u201d, which foresees that this swift is already foreseen by the CSOs. Being \u201cdigitally-rooted\u201d in terms of aggregation of supporters and engagement 132 , these movements are often being preferred by many in detriment of the more traditional CSOs 133 and the integration of these two types of civic organisations benefit from being aligned, thus enhancing their mutual strength and advocacy capacity. As referred, the reaction of CSOs to the rise of informal volunteering and activism is diverse, but a first recommendation in terms of further action is directed to the CSOs in terms of fostering this collaboration and to EESC in terms of investigation, as the forms to leverage this opportunity are broad and this is thus a potential area for further study and developments. Based on the outcomes of the consultation done to CSOs under this study, (cfr. conclusions of section 3.3.1) it was evident that gathering wide public support for the societal agenda and promoting effective awareness-raising campaigns was key in the pandemic period and will be even more essential for the mid- and long-term period to come. This will imply that CSOs are able to rethink strategy and external communications , as traditional CSOs can learn and evolve from youth activism and many of the emerging social movements. Communication needs to be timely, constant, engaging and simple. Digital tools are essential and social media need to be included as a major engagement resource. Several organisations reported this knowledge and used it in their answers to the survey (cfr. Sections 3.3.1.4 and 3.3.5.4 for example), but there is still room to evolve and CSOs, indifferent of size, need to have solid communication strategies and plans, with clear objectives and messages that can prove their value to the common citizen. To this end, training is essential, mainly on more technical aspects as communication, strategic planning and digital tools; benchmarking and knowledge sharing between CSOs, between CSOs and informal movements, and also with commercial organisations that often can share their knowledge as part of social responsibility programmes are also very important practical measures to implement. Platforms and network CSOs are one of the actors that can provide this training and benchmark. 129 Polyak L.

        "54 In this context, this is thus an important role for umbrella CSOs and international organisations: 1. Recommendation to the EESC and international organisations: foster strategic alignment and broad collaborative efforts between different types of civil society movements and organisations Divide and conquer is contrary to the basic roots of civil society. The work of CSOs, as well as the work of EESC and of several other international organisations with similar societal goals can only be leveraged with broad consensus and collaboration. During the pandemic many Opinion or Position Papers were delivered, as well as several policy recommendations that gathered support from different institutions. However, increased efforts can be done to ensure a more extensive strategic alignment within the European organisations that have as core mission the strengthening of the democratic legitimacy and of the role of civil society. The selection of 2-3 core objectives within an intersectional campaign that can be broadly supported and brought to the European Commission and Member States as being supported by millions of citizens and grassroot stakeholders will favour the negotiation power of the civil society and increase the inclusion of these concerns in policy implementation. The first part of the recommendations is directed to the CSOs and their overarching representatives, which will have a crucial role at the ground level, to promote the cross-fertilisation and the creation of significant links between CSOs and other informal movements of the civil society, voicing the citizens as one. However, even with this work being successful, there is still a gap towards the final objective if these voices are not heard and included in the political agenda. The political institutions also need to take the responsibility for the promotion of the social agenda and engage all civil society representatives as meaningful and empowered stakeholders in the construction of the future. In this context, the following preliminary actions are recommended towards urgent implementation: 2. Recommendation to the European institutions and national governments: prioritise human rights and the social contract as a key area in the policy drafting for the Recovery Plans. Despite the impacts of the pandemic in the economy and in the health and care provision in particular, the \u201cobligations to respect human rights and the rule of law remain in place. This is not purely a legal requirement but a value-based approach which grounds the well-being of our societies\u201d 134 . There will only be sustainability in a post-recovery plan if principles of trust, accountability and justice are deemed and protected as essential and a social transformation underlined this process. The crisis highlighted many of the system\u2019s weaknesses and can be used as an opportunity to tackle these and strengthen the system in the long-term. Despite any short-term needs, the social contract 135 must be at the heart of any negotiations if a strong and fruitful recovery is desired. A full and constant representation of the civil society, in the drafting and implementation of the Recovery Plan 136 is highly recommended, both at the European as at the Member State level. Another perspective that reinforces this recommendation is further referred to in section 4.2.6, connected to sustainability and green policy. In conclusion : advocacy for the protection and promotion of the most fragile in society, many of them with increased vulnerabilities due to the COVID-19 containment measures, is one essential aspect to be considered in the European Agenda. This implies the creation of the necessary channels to policy UNDP (2020), Discussing Human Rights, Rule of Law and the renewed social contract in the COVID-19 reality, Posted on June 29, 2020, at: https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/news-centre/speeches/2020/human-rights-and-rule-of-law-.html 135 European Commission (2020), A strong social Europe for just transition, Brussels, 14 January 2020, COM(2020) 14 final, available at: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/fs_20_49. 136 European Commission, webpage illustrating the key component of the \u201cRecoviery Plan for Europe\u201d, at: https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/recovery-plan-europe_en.

        "The response of civil society organisations to face the COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent restrictive measures adopted in Europe 55 makers, the need to keep the societal agenda at the top of the priorities and to gather wide public support, namely through increased awareness-raising campaigns, especially during the forthcoming financial crisis. 4.2.2 Tackle the risks and take advantage of the opportunities brought by digitalisation COVID-19 has dramatically accelerated the adoption of digital technologies and tools across many sectors such as retail 137 , financial services 138 , education and healthcare and many organisations and businesses had to change their whole business model. Telemedicine and remote diagnostics are helping patients get medical advice and diagnoses at home, so that they don\u2019t need to come in to the doctor\u2019s office or hospital, and 3D printing is being used to expedite the production of critical medical supplies, such as personal protective equipment. In the absence of a vaccine or proven treatment, the best prevention strategy to contain the virus spread is digital contact tracing which has already been used to effectively slow the propagation in East Asia during the first wave. When it comes to the organized civil society, the results of the survey which was the primary data collection method supporting this study, as well as several consultations run by international and national organisations, reveal that digital transition has been pivotal for the prosecution of the activities at all levels (with 74% of the participants declaring they have relied on digital technologies to put in place the novel services or initiatives they have illustrated in their responses), from information and documentation to training, education, awareness, counselling and professional support. Furthermore, a large majority of the respondents agreed that the fast spread of online technologies\u2019 use will be one of the factors contributing to the above-mentioned emergence of informal activism (e.g. self-help groups, etc.). For all the above, the involvement of CSOs in this digitalisation movement is essential: 1. Recommendation to national and regional governments: Guarantee a prominent involvement of civil society in the specification, design, development, and testing of technologies for crisis response with a view to support democratic, inclusive, and transparent implementation. Nevertheless, while many respondents emphasized their ability to reach people they would not have been able to reach before and the increased flexibility for staff as positive aspects of digitalisation, the shift to digital modalities unavoidably has also represented a huge hurdle to overcome for those CSOs, which services cannot be smoothly or 100% converted and for those that were not adequately prepared to embark in the fast adaptation that the COVID-19 containment measures have imposed worldwide. This is confirmed by the opinion expressed by the survey respondents who considered team and project management skills for online work (21,3%), as well as techniques and methods for effective building of online relationships with their audiences (17,6%) and online communication skills with the institutions and the wide public (15,2%), among the most important new skills their organizations would need to work in this changing environment. Furthermore, the accelerated digital transformation has reiterated the urgency to address the well-known digital divide, which persists across the European population with regard to both the opportunities to access communication technologies and the skills to use them thus posing a high risk of broadening existing vulnerability gaps. 137 Bezjak T.

        "56 Experts across the globe are claiming that the unequal access to broadband connectivity means poor or no access to telemedicine, tele-schooling, work, job searches, food, social connections, and other services and goods essential to health, ultimately recognizing Internet access as a social determinant of wellbeing 139 . In order to tackle such negative effects and considering the numerous statements made by international networks, such as the Cities Coalition for Digital Rights 140 , launched by the Cities of Amsterdam, Barcelona and New York in November 2018 and gathering today over 50 cities worldwide, and organisations, the following recommendations for the EU and national, regional and local governments emerge from the present study,: 2. Recommendation for the European institutions: Promote the use of cohesion policy funds such as the European Social Fund to support digital literacy and training programmes for CSO workers and marginalised civil society groups , in partnership with international CSOs and national networks, in line with the recent Council Conclusions on the Europe\u2019s Digital Future 141 and the request posed by the EU Leaders participating in the special European Council meeting which took place on 1-2 October 2020 142 , who invited the Commission to present, by March 2021, a comprehensive Digital Compass which sets out the EUs concrete digital ambitions for 2030. 3. Recommendation for national and regional governments: Unleash the potential role of structural funds for driving modernization in post-COVID-19 , by coordinating their use through national and regional operational programmes to support investments in digital infrastructure and digital equipment and tools for the organisations of the civil society. 4.2.3 Promote youth engagement and innovative programmes to encourage job creation linked to civic action With the objective to mobilise all sectors of the populations against the threats of coronavirus spread, many governments have made special calls on youth to embrace the effort to protect themselves and the overall population. Youth are also in a position to help those who are most vulnerable, and to aid in increasing public health social awareness campaigns among their communities. Thus, youth are critical and part of the active plan to limit the virus\u2019s spread and its impact on public health, society, and the economy at large. Through voluntary initiatives, for instance, many young people have supported vulnerable members of their community, for example in the distribution of groceries and medicines. This was the case highlighted in the survey consultation held under this study, by the Volunteer Center Augsburg (Germany), that started a call to action in the city and reached out 1.400 citizens willing to volunteer in this crisis. They matched those volunteers to citizens in need (doing shopping, visiting by phone, staying in contact, driving service) while other volunteers helped at service association for homeless people and at the food bank and, as they were overwhelmed with volunteering offers, they also started the brokerage to other associations who are in need of volunteers. 136 Benda N. at Al.

        "The response of civil society organisations to face the COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent restrictive measures adopted in Europe 57 While the youth\u2019s response to such call for individual responsibility and social commitment is undoubtedly heart-warming, it is crucial to remind the unprecedented disadvantages that youth is likely to face in consequence of the pandemic if adequate and bold policies are not put in place. According to a broad survey launched by OECD between 7-20 April 2020 with the participation of 90 youth-led organisations from 48 countries 143 , youth organisations expressed greatest concern about the impact of COVID-19 on mental well-being, employment, income loss, disruptions to education, familial relations and friendships. Prior to the onset of COVID-19, youth (aged 15 to 24) were indeed already three times more likely to be unemployed compared to adults, while 126 million young workers were in extreme and moderate poverty worldwide (International Labour Organization, 2020). Young workers are also more likely to be in precarious employment than other age groups. After the major surge in youth unemployment brought about by the global financial crisis in 2008, another dramatic trends of such magnitude due to COVID-19 pandemic could take a decade or more to heal. In Europe, youth unemployment has increased from 15 to 17% between February and September 2020, although measures of labour market slack for the young are up by some 5 percentage points, as are the percentages of young people who have even given up searching for a job. Some countries such as Spain or Croatia 144 are more severely hit. In fact, Spanish youth unemployment increased from an already high 32% in February to 40% in September while the Croatian rate increased from 17% to almost 24%. In the UK, youth unemployment rose from 11 to almost 14% in July. As Europe entered its second significant wave, the risk is that these numbers will rapidly deteriorate further. Expert opinions 145 and international bodies, such as the Council of Europe 146 , are thus warning European institutions and national governments to prevent the disastrous consequences of COVID-19 in terms of destroyed opportunities and unemployment for young people. Based on the above, the following twofold recommendation calls for immediate and well-balanced actions from national governments and EU institutions: 1. Recommendations to national governments: Consult and meaningfully engage youth in the development of health, economic, and social interventions in response to COVID-19 and in its recovery . Part of such meaningful involvement must build on actions aimed to incentivize youth innovation and creativity for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 and the management of its corollary socioeconomic impacts both during the outbreak and in the post-pandemic reconstruction. Some promising examples can show the way forward such as the recent commitment expressed by the Prime Minister of the Netherlands to involving children, young people, and youth organisations in the design of recovery measures 147 . 2. Recommendation to the European institutions: Help protect youth\u2019s future by designing, developing and using proactively governance tools and pre- and post- assessment 143 OECD (2020), Youth and COVID-19: Response, recovery and resilience, 11 June 2020, available at: http://www.oecd.org/coronavirus/policy-responses/youth-and-covid-19-response-recovery-and-resilience-c40e61c6/ 144 EUROSTAT, Unemployment by sex and age \u2013 monthly data, data retrieved on the 23 rd November 2020, available at: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/UNE_RT_M__custom_188328/default/table?lang=en. 145 Wolff G.

        "58 measures that can help policy makers allocate public resources for recovery in a fair manner across generations . Mainstreaming intergenerational and long-term considerations in all government sectors and levels is fundamental to make our economy and society more resilient to future similar crisis that might heavily affect the wellbeing of next generations. In conclusion , it is fundamental to place intergenerational solidarity at the centre of recovery plans and policies articulating the right positive messages towards the younger. Young people can act as a \u201cconnective tissue\u201d in public institutions, decision-making processes and public consultations to bridge short-term concerns and long-term objectives and build more fair and inclusive policy outcomes and societal resilience 148 . However, in order for the youth to feel the societal belonging required to play such role, intergenerational solidarity benefits must be adequately communicated and leverage so as to contrast the sentiments of intergenerational \u201cinjustices\u201d that have often characterised political and media discourses recently 149 . 4.2.4 Equip CSOs with the needed skills and resources to take the most advantage from networking, national and international cooperation As referred in section 4.2.1., a broad and cross-sectorial collaboration in the advocacy level is one of the key recommendations to progress to a fairer Europe. In the first recommendation, the main aspect to be highlighted concerns the links between organised and informal civil society movements. However, even within the vast diversity of organised civil society, there is a diversity of realities, contexts, areas of work and even cultural perspectives, which are often a barrier to developing common ground or coordinated campaigning 150 or, when this is achieved, the diverse viewpoints can be discarded and made empty of valuable content to achieve consensus on shared values and discourses 151 . Several CSOs work at the grassroots, while other are active at state or national levels, which increases the differences in specific aims and types of activity. Nevertheless, when diversity is valued, its potential to promote a shared purpose through collaboration is huge, as it provides multiple resources to broader audiences, thus facilitating comprehensive understandings 152 . If, on one side, the \u2018power base\u2019 provides credibility and legitimacy, on the other, the overarching network collaboration across Europe can ensure the power to act collectively and translate this diversity into access and action 153 . This often happened during the pandemic with several joint papers and campaigns, especially in the areas of Associational Life and Social Economy (cfr. Sections 3.3.1 and 3.3.6). Still, international networking is not easy to achieve for many local and regional CSOs, that often do not possess the necessary skills, tools and resources to actively participate in international cooperation and, thus, this specific question needs to be considered and tackled in the near future. For example, in the consultation developed under this study, several CSOs reported this lack of digital tools and skills in the Farmers area (cfr. Section 3.3.3). However, when umbrella CSOs that support these organisations 148 OECD (2018), State of Fragility, OECD Publishing, available at: OECD Highlights documents_web.pdf. 149 Intergenerational Foundation (2020), The Pandemic: Testing Intergenerational Solidarity, blogpost published on 1 st Oct 2020, at: https://www.if.org.uk/2020/10/01/pandemic-testing-intergenerational-solidarity/. 150 Wong, W.

        "The response of civil society organisations to face the COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent restrictive measures adopted in Europe 59 were able to provide the necessary tools (e.g. COAG initiative cfr. Section 3.3.3.4), these proved to be extremely important to go beyond borders and increase the voices of CSOs. As referred in section 3.3.5.5, the consultation developed reported that the area of SMEs, Crafts and Family Business highlighted a high level of bureaucracy and several difficulties from SMEs to access funding support from governments and points out to the need to strengthen the connection between local, regional and national partners and therefore of promoting coordination and rapid consensus. According to a recent EESC study \u201cThe work of organisations seems to have become more transnational. (...) This trend will continue in the future \u2013 as interviewees describe \u2013 also because they recognise that speaking in one voice is necessary in order to make an impact. Small organisations are worried about their future role at the European level, given that it is harder to be heard in times of social media and European representation, since there is so much competition of ideas. Since the European and national institutions mostly consult big associations, joining a European association themselves is the only way to bring in their interests and concerns\u201d 154 . In this context, there are several layers of collaboration that are relevant, either to civil society organisations transversally, as also in specific sectors or areas of activity. At the ground level, there is a solid challenge for umbrella CSOs and international organisations, which is to create and promote capacity-building programmes for grassroot CSOs . These programmes can tackle more basic knowledge such as language difficulties (e.g. providing training in English, on translation tools) or create forums of policy discussion with local organisations that can be further translated and crossed with conclusions form several countries. Also, periodic information on the European initiatives, new programs or regulations issued, as well as on the European agenda and priorities are also relevant to capacitate CSOs for transnational collaboration. However, this will only be effective if governments and the European institutions provide the needed support: 1. Recommendation to the national governments: reinforce the role of national networks, clusters, chambers and associations that support civil society As it was possible to conclude from the results highlighted in sections 3.3.4 and 3.3.5, strengthening the connection between local, regional and national partners and therefore promoting coordination and rapid consensus is an expected strategy for the future, that should be combined with the modernisation of CSOs, either through digitalisation, but also in what concerns innovation capabilities. For example, the questions raised by the respondents in the areas of liberal professionals and SMEs, such as the public discussion and ethical dilemmas related to the tele-provision of services were identified and thus, a reinforcement in the role of the national networks and organisations that support CSOs and can bring such issues to a broad and concerted discussion appears as a distinct need for the period (economic and societal) to come. However, what is the feasibility of such cooperation for local organisations and what is its effectiveness? The different contexts, regulations and frameworks at the Member State level tend to increase CSOs difficulties to network and coordinate at the transnational level. This leads to the need of an international coordination and to highlight the role that EESC can play, as it is composed of Members coming from national organisations. 2. Recommendation to the European institutions: promote focused benchmarking tools and guidelines to national organisations. 154 EESC (2020), Finding a new consensus on European civil society values and their evaluation, Study published on 25 th June 2020, doi: 10.2864/73724.

        "60 To provide some specific target areas, it is possible to refer structural policies to help CSOs to continue operations even under containment measures, that are being increasingly studied and adopted in some EU countries 155 . These aim specially to promote the adoption of new working methods, as well as (digital) technologies and to find new markets and sales channels. If on one side they already address urgent needs such as teleworking, they also contribute to strengthening the resilience of these businesses in a structural way, thus favouring their growth and diminishing the potential negative impact of COVID-19. While having preferential channels to reach a broad diversity of relevant national organisations in all sectors, the EESC is recommended to regularly collect and share the most successful national initiatives in this sector, providing tools and guidelines to favour their benchmark in other countries, thus promoting transnational knowledge sharing and progress in successful implementation. 4.2.5 Relieve bureaucracy and administrative burdens The economic support, both to citizens, as well as to organisations, were one of the central actions of European governments in order to balance the effects of the confinement measures 156 . The rapid evolution of the pandemic and the general lack of preparation to deal with the emergency situation, was however exacerbated by the slow capacity of organisations and systems to react, due to complex and obsolete procedures. The constant change in the epidemiological situation in the different countries and, consequently, on the degree of confinement to be implemented often implied quick changes in rules, procedures and support lines. The large number of cases handled, the complexity of administrative procedures in applying, receiving funding and reporting on it, as well as the bureaucracy and difficulties in communication with public authorities was reported by CSOs of all areas in the survey developed under this study as one of the major challenges during the first wave of confinement. The political choice on the rules or beneficiaries of the public funds for support was also identified as a problem in some of the countries, which leads to the need of proposing changes in the rules. Concerns on the administrative burden are also mentioned and have even been used as grounds to organize joint positions and advocacy measures. When asked to indicate the governmental measures that would be most helpful to their organisation in order to cope with the COVID-19 crisis, the top three types of aid selected by the survey respondents were unemployment and social security aids, financial programmes (e.g., low interest credit line) and tax waivers or temporary tax breaks. The participants also informed about adequacy of the adopted measures stating that either there were no specific programmes for their type of organisation (38%) or the existing programmes were not relevant to them (24%). In those countries were COVID-19 related CSOs\u2019 assistance programmes were put in place, 15 out of 76 respondents (19,7%) found it was not easy to access information about them (see questions Q75, Q76 and Q77 in Annex 2). For all the above it may be concluded that there is a considerable room for improvements which might be enabled by the following recommendations: 1. Recommendation to the European institutions: create an Advisory Task Force to agree on a simplified process for emergency funding to CSOs Although many difficulties were reported, during the Spring and Summer 2020 there were also very good examples worldwide of organisations that implemented expedited and simplified funding 155 OECD (2020), Coronavirus (COVID-19): SME policy responses, Updated on 15 July 2020, available at: https://www.oecd.org/coronavirus/policy-responses/coronavirus-covid-19-sme-policy-responses-04440101/. 156 European Commission (2020), Policy measures taken against the spread and impact of the coronavirus \u2013 20 August 2020, available at: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/coronovirus_policy_measures_20_august.pdf.

        "The response of civil society organisations to face the COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent restrictive measures adopted in Europe 61 processes, as it is the case of the Global Fund 157 or the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) 158 . In the EU, there is a good example in the French government, that adopted a fast-track expenditure authorization procedure, where a step in the spending authorization procedure has been removed to accelerate the release of funds. In the revised law, full amounts are automatically released for expenditure authorization and are equal to appropriations 159 . The World Health Organisation refers other good practices such as simplified procurement processes, advance payments and ex-post and/or risk-based controls (e.g., focus controls on high costs such as large purchases or infrastructure upgrades that are more susceptible to fraud). A task force grounded on EESC that could bring up the best practices collected nationally and that would work with the EC on the creation of a proposal on common European guidelines of a simplified process of financial support to CSOs would, on one hand, facilitate a broad transnational cooperation between the civil society organisations; eliminate a substantial amount of the challenges they faced during the first wave of the pandemic and reinsure their role and sustainability; and create a positive benchmark that could possibly be used by other areas of activity others than civil society. 2. Recommendation to national governments: implement simplified and expedited processes at national level Once a simplified procedure is agreed at the EU level, it is recommended that all EU countries adopt it and put it in place rapidly. National networks and CSOs can be of great help in this process by promoting a quick spread of the procedures, providing EESC and the EC with an immediate report on challenges and good examples and supporting the grassroot organisations to easily access support and funding. 4.2.6 Engage CSOs in the design of climate- and environment-friendly recovery plans The European Recovery Plans seek to address the immediate crisis, but also to lay the foundations for a more resilient and more sustainable Europe. In a recent opinion adopted by EESC last October 160 , it is stressed that the post-COVID-19 recovery should follow sustainable principles and a correlation of efforts between the ERDF, Cohesion Funds and other European programmes will be pivotal in supporting it. From the organized civil society perspective, many networks and organizations have raised the attention on the necessity to make substantial and effective links between post-recovery plans and climate and environmental priorities under the framework of the Sustainable Development Goals and the fairness and equality principles that the Agenda 2030 pledges for. In the same direction, independent institutions such as the Institute for European Environmental Policy (IEEP) have proposed to introduce an independent assessment of recovery plans to fuel democratic debate and have compiled lists of criteria recovery plans and any economic stimulus must comply with 161 . The respondents to the survey referred that the pandemic brought several challenges and environmental issues, but also represents an opportunity for turning around from unsustainable consumption and production patterns. 157 The Global Fund (2020), COVID-19 Response Mechanism, 8th June 2020, available at: https://www.theglobalfund.org/media/9757/covid19_responsemechanism_procedures_en.pdf. 158 Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) (2020), \u201cPublic Assistance Simplified Application\u201d, at: https://www.fema.gov/fact- sheet/public-assistance-simplified-application. 159 WHO (2020), How to budget for COVID-19 response?

        "62 Two main recommendations arise from the reflections made through the study: 1. Recommendations for national and regional governments: Establish alliance with social economy and other civil society actors and equip them with the needed legal frameworks and resources to scale up their innovative climate- and environment-friendly solutions. At the time of the survey realization (October 2020), more than half of the respondents (41 out of 76) felt that CSOs were not sufficiently involved in the recovery and reconstruction phase. This recommendation has the main aim of highlighting a step further beyond consulting and listening to CSOs, but also to uptake their lessons by creating supportive environments and investing adequate resources in the scaling up of the many promising forms of social experimentations, business models built around the principles of solidarity, co-operation and responsibility and alternative ways of organising economic activities, which they are pioneering 162 but still in a too small scale to be able to generate enduring impacts. 2. Recommendation for the European institutions: Foster balanced approaches that address both localization and coordination principles as key pillar in the alignment of recovery plans to SDGs . Local and regional governments have been at the forefront of the global response to the pandemic and they were championing innovative policies addressing the different dimensions of the SDGs (e.g. poverty reduction, sustainable urban development, climate change, social inclusion, the social economy, culture, etc.) well before the pandemic started 163 . Furthermore, local and regional governments have developed a wealth of initiatives in collaboration with CSOs operating at local and regional level demonstrating that multi-stakeholder cooperation is a fundamental vehicle for localized SDG implementation plans to be embraced by civil society at large and rooted in the diverse urban and rural contexts. Nevertheless, for SDG localization efforts to be effective there is a need for national coordination, mapping and costing analyses as well as for an institutionalized dialogue between levels of government so as to accelerate the identification of the adequate technical support and funding streams needed in each context and territory. Thus, the aforementioned balance is crucial to examine and strengthening synergies between local and national plans. 162 OECD (2020), Social economy and the COVID-19 crisis: current and future roles, 30 July 2020, available at: http://www.oecd.org/coronavirus/policy-responses/social-economy-and-the-covid-19-crisis-current-and-future-roles-f904b89f/. 163 United Cities and Local Governments (2020), TOWARDS THE LOCALIZATION OF THE SDGs, How to accelerate transformative actions in the aftermath of the COVID-19 outbreak, available at: https://www.uclg.org/sites/default/files/report_localization_hlpf_2020.pdf.

Section 1 intends to profile the CSOs that are participating in the survey and will thus ask for information that characterizes your organisation and its area of work. Section 2 is focused on the new or adapted activities your CSO developed on the ground, namely those in three main areas: \uf0b7 directed to target groups in need of support due to the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g. shopping delivery, sanitary assistance, virtual social contacts with isolated persons). \uf0b7 actions of information and support to members and target groups (e.g. help to farmers to find other ways of delivering their products or to professionals/SMEs to understand how they can get public financial support or continue operating). \uf0b7 advocacy and awareness-raising measures towards public authorities. If you fill in Section 2, you are eligible to pass on to the second phase of the survey and provide more detailed information regarding these new initiatives your CSO has implemented, their societal impact and the impact of the pandemic on your CSO. Phase 2 intends to IDENTIFY and understand the impact of your activities. The deadline to complete sections 3 and 4 will be the 9 th of October 2020. Section 3 will ask you for more details concerning the new activities and initiatives that you implemented during the pandemic mapped in phase 1. Specifically, we will ask some details concerning their rationale, scope and their impacts on members and target groups, the human and material resources involved, costs, revenues, obstacles and accomplishments. Section 4 intends to understand the impact of the pandemic in your CSO, mainly asking you for the challenges you had to cope with during this period and the ways the COVID-19 crisis and the consequent measures are likely to affect your role in the society. If you believe you have this information already available, you can complete sections 3 and 4 within the same deadline of phase 1. If you need more time to collect it, you can finish sections 1 and 2 for now and we will ask you soon to fill in the remaining fields. It will take around 15-30 minutes to fill out all sections of this survey. Thank you for your collaboration. ",
