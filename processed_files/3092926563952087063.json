        "COUNCIL DECISION of 12 July 2011 addressed to Greece with a view to reinforcing and deepening fiscal surveillance and giving notice to Greece to take measures for the deficit reduction judged necessary to remedy the situation of excessive deficit (recast) (2011/734/EU) THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 126(9) and Article 136 thereof, Having regard to the recommendation from the European Commission, Whereas: (1) Council Decision 2010/320/EU of 10 May 2010 addressed to Greece with a view to reinforcing and deepening fiscal surveillance and giving notice to Greece to take measures for the deficit reduction judged necessary to remedy the situation of excessive deficit ( 1 ) has been substantially amended several times ( 2 ). Since further amendments are to be made, it should be recast in the interests of clarity. (2) Article 136(1)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) foresees the possibility of adopting measures specific to the Member States whose currency is the euro with a view to strengthening the coordination and surveillance of their budgetary discipline. (3) Article 126 TFEU establishes that Member States are to avoid excessive government deficits and sets out the excessive deficit procedure to that effect. The Stability and Growth Pact, which in its corrective arm implements the excessive deficit procedure, provides the framework supporting government policies for a prompt return to sound budgetary positions taking account of the economic situation. \u25bc B 2011D0734 \u2014 EN \u2014 25.04.2012 \u2014 002.001 \u2014 2 ( 1 ) OJ L 145, 11.6.2010, p. 6. ( 2 ) See Annex I. ",
        "(4) On 27 April 2009, the Council decided, in accordance with Article 104(6) of the Treaty establishing the European Community (TEC), that an excessive deficit existed in Greece and issued recommendations to correct that deficit by 2010 at the latest, in accordance with Article 104(7) (TEC) and Article 3(4) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 of 7 July 1997 on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure ( 1 ). The Council also set a deadline of 27 October 2009 for Greece to take effective action. On 30 November 2009, the Council established, in accordance with Article 126(8) TFEU, that Greece had not taken effective action; consequently, on 16 February 2010, the Council gave notice to Greece in accordance with Article 126(9) TFEU to take measures to correct the excessive deficit by 2012 at the latest (hereinafter \u2018the Council Decision pursuant to Article 126(9)\u2019). The Council also set a deadline of 15 May 2010 for effective action to be taken. (5) According to Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1467/97, if effective action has been taken in compliance with Article 126(9) TFEU and unexpected adverse economic events with major unfavourable consequences for government finances occur after the adoption of that notice, the Council may decide, on a recommendation from the Commission, to adopt a revised notice pursuant to Article 126(9) TFEU. (6) According to the Commission services\u2019 autumn 2009 forecasts, which provided the basis for the initial notice addressed to Greece, GDP was expected to contract by \u00bc % in 2010, and recover as from 2011, when the economy was forecast to grow by 0,7 %. A deeper contraction in real GDP took place in 2010 and this contraction is expected to continue in 2011. A gradual resumption of growth is expected thereafter. This marked worsening of the economic scenario implies a corresponding deterioration of the outlook for public finances at unchanged policy. To this should be added the upward revision of the government deficit outcome for 2009 (from an estimated 12,7 % of GDP at the time of the Council Decision pursuant to Article 126(9) to 13,6 % of GDP according to the fiscal notification submitted by Greece on 1 April 2010) ( 2 ) and later on to 15,4 % of GDP following completion of the investigations that Eurostat undertook with the Greek Statistical Authorities ( 3 ). Lastly, concerns in the markets for the public finances outlook have been reflected in a sharp rise in risk premiums on government debt, compounding the difficulties in controlling the path of government deficit and debt. \u25bc B 2011D0734 \u2014 EN \u2014 25.04.2012 \u2014 002.001 \u2014 3 ( 1 ) OJ L 209, 2.8.1997, p. 6.

        "(7) Gross government debt at the end of 2009 stood at 127,1 % of GDP. This is the highest debt ratio in the EU, and is considerably higher than the 60 %-of-GDP reference value of the Treaty. Achieving the deficit reduction path that is considered necessary and feasible in the light of the circumstances would imply that the increase in debt would be reversed from 2013. In addition to persistently high government deficits, certain financial operations have further increased debt. These factors have contributed to undermining market confidence in the ability of the Greek Government to service the debt going forward. There is an urgent need for Greece to take decisive action, on an unprece \u00ad dented scale, on its deficit and on other factors contributing to the increase in debt, in order to reverse the increase in the debt-to- GDP ratio and allow it to return as soon as possible to market financing. (8) The very severe deterioration of the financial situation of the Greek Government has led the other euro area Member States to decide to provide stability support to Greece, with a view to safeguarding the financial stability of the euro area as a whole, in conjunction with multilateral assistance provided by the Inter \u00ad national Monetary Fund. Support provided by the euro area Member States will take the form of a pooling of bilateral loans, coordinated by the Commission. The lenders have decided that their support shall be conditional on Greece respecting this Decision. In particular, Greece is expected to carry out the measures specified in this Decision in accordance with the calendar set out herein. (9) In June 2011, it became evident that, taking into account the 2010 budgetary slippage and budgetary execution until May, with unchanged policies, the 2011 target for the deficit would be missed by a significant amount which would jeopardise the overall credibility of the programme. Therefore, there has been a need to update specific budgetary measures to allow Greece to stick to the deficit target in 2011 and respect the deficit ceilings for the following years established by Decision 2010/320/EU. These measures have been extensively discussed with the Greek government and commonly agreed by the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund. (10) In the light of the above considerations, it appears appropriate to amend Decision 2010/320/EU in a number of respects, while keeping unchanged the deadline for the correction of the excessive deficit, HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: Article 1 1. Greece shall put an end to the present excessive deficit situation as rapidly as possible and, at the latest, by the deadline of 2014. \u25bc B 2011D0734 \u2014 EN \u2014 25.04.2012 \u2014 002.001 \u2014 4 ",
        "2. The adjustment path towards the correction of the excessive deficit shall aim to achieve a general government primary deficit (deficit excluding interest expenditure) not exceeding EUR 2 037 million (1,0 % of GDP) in 2012, and primary surpluses of at least EUR 3 652 million (1,8 % of GDP) in 2013 and EUR 9 352 million (4,5 % of GDP) in 2014. Following the debt exchange, these targets for the primary deficit/surplus are consistent with an overall deficit of EUR 14 811 million (7,3 % of GDP) in 2012, EUR 9 462 million (4,7 % of GDP) in 2013 and EUR 4 499 million (2,2 % of GDP) in 2014. To this aim, an improvement in the structural balance of at least 10 % of GDP will have been achieved over the period 2009-2014. Proceeds from the privatisation of assets (financial and non-financial assets), as well as all transfers related to the Eurogroup decision of 21 February 2012 with regard to the income of euro zone national central banks, including the Bank of Greece, stemming from their investment portfolio holdings of Greek government bonds shall not reduce the required fiscal consolidation effort and shall not be counted in the assessment of these targets. 3. The adjustment path referred to in paragraph 2 is consistent with an annual change in the general government consolidated debt of EUR - 26 954 million in 2012, of EUR 6 775 million in 2013 and of EUR 1 492 million in 2014. \u25bc B Article 2 1.

Greece shall adopt the following measures by the end of September 2010: (a) fiscal consolidation measures amounting to at least 3,2 % of GDP (4,3 % of GDP if carryovers from measures implemented in 2010 are considered) to be included in the draft budget for 2011: a reduction in intermediate consumption of the general government by at least EUR 300 million compared to the 2010 level (on top of savings stemming from the reform of public administration and of local government referred to in this paragraph); a freeze in the indexation of pensions (with the aim of saving EUR 100 million); a temporary crisis levy on highly profitable firms (yielding at least EUR 600 million in additional revenue per year in 2011, 2012 and 2013); a presumptive taxation of professionals (with a yield of at least EUR 400 million in 2011 and increasing returns by at least EUR 100 million per year in 2012 and 2013); a broadening of the VAT base by including certain services currently exempted and by moving 30 % of goods and services from the reduced rate to the main rate (with a yield of EUR 1 billion); a phased-in green tax on CO 2 emissions (with a yield of at least EUR 300 million in 2011); the implementation by the government of the legislation reforming the public administration and a reor \u00ad ganisation of local government (with the aim of reducing costs by at least EUR 500 million in 2011, and additional EUR 500 million in each year 2012 and 2013); a reduction in domestically-financed investments (by at least EUR 500 million) by giving priority to investment projects financed by EU structural funds, incentives to regularise land-use violations (yielding at least EUR 1 500 million from 2011 to 2013, of which at least EUR 500 million in 2011); a collection of revenue from the licensing of gaming (at least EUR 500 million in sales of licences and EUR 200 million in annual royalties); an expansion of the base of the real estate tax by updating asset values (to yield at least EUR 400 million additional revenue); an increased taxation of wages in kind, including by taxing car lease payments (by at least EUR 150 million); an increased taxation of luxury goods (by at least EUR 100 million); a special tax on unauthorised establishments (to yield at \u25bc B 2011D0734 \u2014 EN \u2014 25.04.2012 \u2014 002.001 \u2014 6 ",
