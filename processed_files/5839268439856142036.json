        "EP NEWS November 1997 E u r o p e an P a r l i a m e nt AX-AD 97-011-EN-C ISSN-0250 5754 EP NEWS E ll acts to c o m b at i n t e r n a t i o n al c r i me W ITH cross-border crime now estimated to be running at Ecu60 billion per year as new groups of sophisticated criminals take advantage of electronic means of communication and exploit dif ferences in national legislation, MEPs endorsed a new EU Action Plan to com bat international crime. The plan involves much closer co-oper ation between national investigative forces, with each member state designat ing a new national body to be responsible for strengthening links between countries. Unlike in the US, there is no European federal body with investigative powers to operate throughout the 15 member states. In view of national sensitivities over criminal matters, Europol, the embryonic European body responsible for co-ordinating co-operation between the different national police forces, is essentially a data-gathering organisation, although MEPs would like it to take on a more operational role. Charlotte Cederschi\u00f6ld(S, EPP) singled out co-operation arrangements between Nordic countries as a model for the way forward. In Scandinavia, the police, judi ciary, customs services and coastguard plug into the same computer system and there is close co-operation to act against the criminals. Her resolution, adopted by Parliament, called on the member states to ratify vari ous international conventions supports improving co-operation in such areas as tackling money laundering, fraud in elec tronic transfers and credit card fraud. MEPs also want the EU to follow US practice and use informers who operate across borders. In addition, there is sup port for joint investigative multinational teams and a US-style European witness protection programme. But there are differences not only in the definition of crimes but also in proce dures between the member states and this can hamper operations. Recently a multi-million pound cus toms fraud trial collapsed in the UK fol lowing the failure of the authorities to force a key witness from Spain to attend the proceedings. A new European Judicial Network is to facilitate closer co operation. But MEPs are highly critical of the snail's space at which co-operation is developing, and many believe this is due to procedures being based on co-ordina tion between national authorities rather than creating a pan-European body to tackle the problem. This trend was con firmed by the Amsterdam Treaty, and indeed all the proposals approved by Parliament this month were brought in under national intergovernmental arrangements. The Commissioner responsible for tackling fraud, Anita Gradin, did, how ever, see the new moves on a positive step forward and emphasised the fact that the Commission would play a key role in co ordination. The EU's own anti-fraud squad, UCLAF, responsible for tackling fraud against the EU's budget, was, she said, now extending its areas of activity and investigating reports of the illegal smug gling of environmentally dangerous mate rials. Bringing the Schengen arrange ments for free movement, coupled with safeguards such as a European comput erised system of wanted criminals, under the EU umbrella, as provided for in the Amsterdam Treaty, should also help. I UHI KA Ml UNI All eyes will be on New York as the EU seeks closer understanding in talks with US leaders next month THE MONTH IN STRASBOURG AND BRUSSELS Yes to Amsterdam IN approving the Amsterdam Treaty, MEPs this month reaffirmed their support for ongoing reforms to the EU's decision-making structures in the interest of improving the way the EU is run. Parliament is, however, far from convinced that tackling major international problems such as drug trafficking and money laundering on the basis of inter-governmental co operation is the best way forward. Indeed, the Court of Auditors report revealed that the management of EU funds is far from satisfactory, and the discovery of numerous irregularities revealed defects in the systems of cross-border co-operation. MEPs voted 348 to 101, with 34 absten tions, in favour of a resolution recom mending that the Member States ratify the Amsterdam Treaty despite its short comings. Those voting for the resolution included most PES members, including British Labour MEPs apart from three, the European People's Party, with the exception of British Conservatives, Liberals and the two Scottish Nation alists, while those voting against incl uded British Conservatives, Greens, French Gaullists and MEPs from the Left Group combination of Green/Left members and former Communists. PES leader Pauline Green felt, on balance, the treaty represented progress in bringing the EU closer to the people. On the positive side there was a new commitment to tackling unemployment, a boost to equal opportunities, greater transparency and a strong determina tion to combat fraud. Yet she acknowl edged weaknesses, in particular the fail ure to bring in institutional change to enable a wider union of 25 Member States to function effectively. Indeed, Parliament's resolution \"regrets the absence from the Amsterdam Treaty of the institutional reforms needed for the effective and democratic functioning of an enlarged union and affirms that these reforms should be completed before enlargement\". The resolution goes on to call on the European Council to \"affirm that no new Member States will be admitted before the completion of the institu tional reform necessary for the proper functioning of an enlarged union\". It also calls on the UK, Danish and Irish governments to take part at the earliest opportunity in the plans to bring the Schengen system for free movement and abolition of passport controls under the EU umbrella. The resolution also takes the view that insufficient progress was made at Amst erdam in developing a common defence policy. Parliament wants the co-deci sion procedure involving an equal role for MEPs in adopting EU legislation to be extended to agriculture, fisheries and taxation. The resolution calls for adjustments to be made in the weighting or values of votes in Council and the number of Commissioners per Member State. Qualified majority voting should be (he norm. Explaining the position ol' British Conservatives, Group Leader Edward McMillan-Scott (UK, EPP) said: \"Con servative Euro-MPs are not able to sup port the Amsterdam Treaty, as negoti ated by Tony Blair. It brings the Social Chapter into the UK, something to which we have been consistently opposed. We have already seen that the Commis sion has begun to bring forward new and unwelcome proposals affecting small business under the Social Chapter, since it was accepted by New Labour.\" The general feeling in the debate, however, was that there would have to be another inter-institutional confer ence to bring in the necessary institu tional reforms for enlargement while Council President Jacques Poos empha sised that Amsterdam should be seen as part of an ongoing process. Indeed one speaker pointed out that Parliament was now in a position to influence some 75% of European legislation since the adoption of the Single Act in 1987. However, one MEP to oppose further integration was Georges Berthu (F, I- EN) who contented that greater democ racy at an EU level could only be achieved through national Parliaments. He called for an EU wider referendum. To come into force the Treaty now needs to be ratified in all 15 Member States. There are to be referendums in Denmark and Ireland. EU/US summit to discuss trade ties NEXT month's bi-annual summit between the EU and the United States is likely to be an important chapter in EL- US trade relations. One of the main topics of discussion will be the Trans-Atlantic Business Dialogue (TABU), which involves discussion and co-operation between business men on various trade issues. The dialogue is designed to help reduce existing transatlantic barriers that atleet the movement of goods, services and capital between the two continents. It also backs the idea of the gradual introduction of a harmonised regulatory business system. Subjects on December's agenda include the pharmaceutical industry. The industry, which supports the 'I'ABD, recently expressed concern following the Commission's decision in (he light of the BSE crisis to ban items such as gelatine and tallow derivatives which are used in pharmaceutical products. The industry has pointed out that such a ban may have serious implications for patients, given (hat up to 85% of all pharmaceutical products currently in use would be affected. The industry will be working with the Commission to find a solution that will ensure (he continuity and consistent supply of sale medicinal products whilst ensuring high standards of'public health. However, despite co-operation in areas such as pharmaceuticals, (here are still substantial differences between the EU and the US over Congress's efforts to penalise European firms which trade with what the US terms as \"hostile\" regimes such us Cuba, Libya and Iran. In advance of the summit, MEPs voted in favour of a resolution which rejects the principle of extra-territorial legislation such as the Helms- Burton and d'Amato Acts, and expresses the hope that the summit will give an impetus to the process of eliminating non-tariff barriers to trade. Speaking to MEPs, the EU trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan welcomed moves to resolve the issue. He declared that \"the root problem with US extra-territorial legislation lies with its legislation [and that] European parliamentarians have an important role to play in presenting our views to them\".

        "European Parliament \u2014 EP News 2 MEP's want Coca-Cola Cup winners in Europe REPRESENTATIVES of the English Football League visited the European Parliament this month to obtain backing for their campaign to persuade UEFA, European football's governing body, to reinstate the right of this season's League Cup winners to play in next season's UEFA Cup. MEP's Mark Hendrick (UK, PES), Clive Needle (UK, PES), Susan Waddington (UK, PES) and Simon Murphy (UK, PES) met the delegation and voiced their full support for the Football League's position. Football League president David Sheepshanks warned that without a reversal of the decision, \"terrible damage\" could be inflicted on smaller clubs in England. The League estimates that \u00a332.5 million is generated for the 72 League clubs from their competition, roughly 20% of their income. There is additional concern that the competition could lose television interest and support from Coca\u00adCola, the League Cup's current sponsors, if immediate re\u00adinstatement of the UEFA Cup berth for this season's competition winners is not forthcoming. The Football League argues that UEFA's decision amounts to \"an abuse of a dominant position\" under the EU's competition rules and a clear case of a conflict of interest. Due to the rise in the number of fixtures, UEFA decided in 1994 to limit the number of league games played in a season to 34 matches in the first divisions of all its member countries. The Premier League were warned that entitlement to a European place for the country's League Cup winner would be lost unless it complied. The League however feels unjustly treated in that the decision taken by the English Premier League \u00ad over which the Football League has no control \u00ad to keep the number of Premiership games to 38 should result in their competition being penalised. What is more, the lost place was allocated by UEFA to the Premiership. The League also pointed out that the number of games played has increased due to UEFA's decision to expand the European Champions' Cup into a \"Champions' League\". The League has reduced the number of games played in their competition. Elsewhere, \"Show Racism the Red Card\", a film designed to tackle the problem of racism in society, was launched this month in Brussels with the backing of Labour MEP Alan Donnelly (UK, PES). The video was produced with the help of football players from across Europe including Viv Anderson, Ian Wright and David Ginola. It is a frank account of the destructive influence racism can have on those targeted. The objective of the video is to use the growing influence of football players to educate youngsters in the dangers of racism and promote multi\u00adculturalism. \"Show Racism the Red Card\" is the latest in a string of initiatives designed to tackle those who continue to use football stadia as a launch pad for racial abuse, challenging the majority of fans who wish to enjoy their sport in the tradition of mutual respect and fair play. 1993 saw the high profile launch of the \"Lets Kick Racism out of Football Campaign\". In 1995, the Advisory Group Against Racism and Intimidation (ACARI) was formed. Both initia\u00ad tives won support a number of high\u00adprofile players such as the current Chelsea manager Ruud Gullit and former England player John Barnes. Meanwhile, in Strasbourg, local MEP Richard Corbett (Merseyside West, PES) protested at the eight\u00admonth prison sentences imposed on three Liverpool supporters after the game in Strasbourg last month. Parliament's President to visit the UK PARLIAMENT'S President Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gil\u00adRobles will pay an official visit to the United Kingdom next month. During his stay in London the President will hold talks with Prime Minister Tony Blair and with other senior members of the UK government, including Gordon Brown, Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook. Discussions are likely to focus on the forthcoming UK Presidency of the EU, enlargement of the European Union and electoral changes for the 1999 European elections. Mr Gil\u00adRobles will also meet representatives of other political parties, including Conservative leader William Hague and members of the House of Commons and the House of Lords. Among others meeting the President will be John Monks, TUC General Secretary, Adair Turner, Director\u00ad General of the CBI, and Eddie George, Governor of the Bank of England. After his meeting with the Prime Minister on Tuesday 2 December, Mr Gil\u00adRobles will be received by the Prince of Wales at St James's Palace. An audience with HM The Queen will take place on Friday 5 December 1997. Regional push for Wales THE new Secretary of State for Wales Ron Davies, came to Brussels this month for talks on the future of regional policy, at present undergoing reforms. He told MEPs and guests at a meeting organised by the Wales European Centre that some \u00a3560m in EU funding would be going to the principality over the 1994\u00ad1999 period, helping to cre\u00ad ate 45,000 jobs. And with GDP in Wales at just 80% of the EU average, he was anxious to make the case for Wales to continue to receive a substantial share of regional fund expenditure in the future. At the same time he emphasised that theUK government was committed to supporting restraints on regional fund expenditure and did not want to see enlargement used as an excuse to increase funding above the present limit of .46% of GNP. This being the case, emphasis would be placed on securing value for money in future projects. Euro e l e c t i on c h a n ge f or UK REFORMING electoral systems can be a hot potato. The behaviour of the electorate is never easy to predict and when a newly elected government has done well through the existing system \u00ad as in the United Kingdom today \u00ad the tempta\u00ad tion to keep it intact grows. Electoral reform has, however, been on the political agenda in the United Kingdom for several years and especially since 1 May, the date of the last general election. A referendum has been promised on the issue regarding general elections. With regard to European Parliament elections, the government has already tabled proposals to introduce a new electoral system in time for the next European Parliamentary elections, due in June 1999. This month EP News examines: the proposals for changing the way British MEPs are elected; the strengths and weaknesses of the current electoral system; the way the rest of the EU elect their MEPs; and the benefits and dangers in changing electoral systems. T HE British Govern\u00ad ment has proposed a system based on pro\u00ad portional representa\u00ad tion for the next elections to the European Parliament, due in 1999. Currently, Britain is the only member of the European Union to use the first\u00adpast\u00adthe\u00adpost system in single\u00admember constituen\u00ad cies for elections to the European Parliament. All the others use a form of propor\u00ad tional representation. Furthermore, a system of PR, the single transferable vote, is used for the three seats in Northern Ireland to take account for the need for minorities to be represented, making the United Kingdom the only member state in the EU to have two different sys\u00ad tems of election to the European Parliament. The proposed changes introduced under the European Parliamentary Elections Bill would mean a change from the current sys\u00ad tem based on constituencies to a proportional list system based on larger multi\u00admem\u00ad ber regions for England, Scotland and Wales. Early introduction of the proposals within eight months of the new government taking office is designed to give the parties time to re\u00adadjust their structures to cater for the new system. The government has pro\u00ad posed introducing a \"closed list system\". It would mean WHICH ELECTORAL SYSTEM? PROPORTIONAL representation is intended to ensure that parlies are represented according to their share of the rote. Critics argue that the issue at hand is not necessarily representa\u00ad tion of minorities hut providing the country with strong accountable government and that PR can only weaken this. In European Parliamentary elections, however, obtaining a majority to form a government is not an issue. Representation is by far the more important issue in order to bring lite electorate of Europe closer to the EU decision\u00admaking mechanism. The current British electoral system for the European Parliament, where the objective is to come first in as many constituencies as possible, is considered to have the advantage of maintaining a link between the voter and lhe MEP. However, the current government has argued that given lhe size of the constituencies, this is nol as important as for elections to Westminster. Furthermore, the current system that has been used for the four European Parliament elections since 1979 has produced several examples of disproportionate representation. In 1979, the Conseiratives won nearly 51% of the vote but gained nearly 77% of the seals. The Labour Party despite gaining 33\u00b0/t of the vote was only entitled lo 22% of the seats. The Liberals, despite obtaining 13% of the vote, ended up with no seats ami had to wait until 1994 to obtain representation. In 1989, the Green Party, despile gaining an impressive 157i of the vote and 2.3 million voles, failed to gain a single seat. In 1994, it was the tum of the Labour Party to gain proportionally more seats than their percentage of the vote was worth. Thanks to the concentration of their vote in a large number of constituencies, the party polled 44% of the vote but ended up with 74%> of the seats. The result could have been far worse for the Conseiratives, given that a further swing of 2\u00ad4%: in some areas might have haired lhe \u00a18 seats they finally obtained. These \"wasted\" rotes raise another weakness of lhe current electoral system. Unlike PR, where all votes have equal value, the first\u00ad past\u00adthe\u00adpost system can discourage voters in certain areas where their preferred candidate has no chance of winning. Voters in certain areas are therefore more valuable in what are termed \"key marginals. \" Under this scenario, the electorate may not bother to rote or decide to caste a negative rote against a candidale. One final problem with lhe present first\u00adpast\u00adthe\u00adpost system is thai in lhe \u00a1nist, parties hare displayed a degree of reticence in presenting women, representatives from ethnic minorities or simply anyone who might be regarded as \"unsuitable\" in a safe seat. The result has been the under representation of these groups in the European Parliament. Traditionalists hare always stressed that introducing such candidates can be too risky. But under lhe new system, the electorate will be voting for party lists not individual candidates unless an independent is standing. The issue will, however, be importam when the parties come to draw up their lists. that political party lists would appear on the ballot paper together with the names of the parties' candidates. An independent candidate will appear under his/her name. BALLOT PAPER 7 Seats to be filled. Place one cross on the ballot paper Conservative Party \u0392\u00bb\u00b7\u00bb\u039c\u0399 \u25a1 Green Party \u25a1 Labour Party \u03c1 Uberai Democratic Party \u25a1 Jeff Williams Michael Sullivan David Stamm Fred White Mildred Black Thomas Green Vanesie White Frank Brown Leonard Blue Malcolm Walle Guy Powell Kathy Pearce Michelle Thomas Adam Richards Olyn Watson Lesley Dennis Jennifer Anderson Patrick Wilson Stephen Shepherd Evan Farley Susan Scott Russell Devlin Eluabeth Hubbard Independent Candidates J John Brand - Anti-whale fishing J Paul Ughi - Stop the bypass J David Butch - Monster Raving Loony Party How \u03b1 European election ballot paper might look Voters would be invited to mark one cross, either for a party list or an independent candidate. Once votes were counted, seats would be allo\u00ad cated according to the pro\u00ad portion of the vote obtained for each party. Parties rather than voters would have a much greater say over which individual politicians actually ended up in Strasbourg and would therefore be in a better position to exercise more con\u00ad trol over individual candidates when it came to ranking them on the pre\u00adselected lists. At the last European Parliament elections in 1994, the electorate voted for candi\u00ad dates standing in separate constituencies as in general elections \u00ad although they could not split their vote between party and candidate. These constituencies will now be abolished. Standing for election will become more expensive. Both political parties and indepen\u00ad dent candidates will be obliged to pay a \u00a35,000 deposit, up from \u00a31,000 at the last election. In the event of the death or resignation of an elected MEP, a by\u00adelection would only be held if there was no candidate left on the party list or if in the seat con\u00ad cerned the voters had elected an independent candidate. In other words, the electorate would have already decided a replacement. Article 138 of the Treaty of Rome envisages a uniform system of electing members of the European Parliament. This commitment was in the Amsterdam Treaty to be in accordance with principles common to all Member States. The task of drawing up a common system was allotted to the European Parliament with the final decisions left to all 15 Member States. MEPs have been trying since 1979 to persuade Council to accept a common system based on some form of proportional representation. Parliament is once again looking at the issue. This is not the first time TAKING WOMEN SERIOUSLY Women's representation in the European Parliament has been improving slowly but surely. Currently, there are 166 women MEPs in the European Parliament, roughly 27% of the total. The United Kingdom sends 87 MEPs to Strasbourg of whom 16 are women. Despite the encouraging signals from the British electorate in the last general election, the first-past-the-post system has often been blamed for the lack of women in both the European Parliament and Westminster. But what are the parties now doing to ensure that women secure representation under the new system proposed? Labour In the past, the party has taken the issue of selecting women seriously. Currently 13 of the United Kingdom's 16 women MEPs were elected under Labour colours. Due to the party's policy of putting up more female candidates in the last general election, the number of women at Westminster has doubled from 65 to 118. 101 of them are Labour members. Liberal Democrats The Liberal Democrats recognise the benefits of positive discrimination with regard to selecting women. To ensure a fair representational balance between men and women among their candidates, they propose two different lists separating male and female candidates having reached or passed a predetermined threshold in an internal party election. These successful candidates, merged into a single list, would then fill the seats on an alternate basis. For example, a woman would head the list in London and a man in Wales Conservative Party The Conservative Party in its \"Blueprints for Change\" recognises the need to improve the participation of women \"women are currently underrcpresented in all parts of the party, particularly at Westminster. Whereas over 160 constituency chairmen are women, at the last elec\u00ad tion only 10% of candidates were women and there are only 13 conservative women Members of Parliament. We have to look at this imbalance seriously and so far change has been very slow. The creation of an inclusive and participative party should naturally encourage people from all walks of life to join us\". ",

It is also used by numerous countries for general elections. In this system, as in all forms of PR, instead of each constituency electing its own representative, several MEPs representing a larger area are elected. Parties put up a list of candidates which can equal the number of seats to be contested. The voter simply casts one vote for the party he or she favours and seats are allocated in proportion to the parties' share of votes. If there are 100 seats available, for exam\u00ad ple, and the Smart party wins 15% of the vote, it is entitled to 15% of the seats, which in this case is 15. These newly elected representatives would be the first 15 candidates from the Smart party list, placed in order by the party, in other words a list order that voters do not determine. PR AND THE OPEN LIST SYSTEM Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Sweden utilise the other form of Party List PR called the open list system. In this system voters have some control over the final listed order of candidates. Voters have the option of voting for the party, accepting the party list order, or the voter can indicate preference for an individual candidate. This \"preference vote\" counts towards the party total, but may also change the order of candidates on the list. In some countries, well\u00adknown personalities are placed in party lists with a view to attracting extra votes. PR AND THE SINGLE TRANSFERABLE VOTE (STV) The Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland both use the Single Transferable Vote system of PR. Like the Party List systems, representatives are elected in multi\u00admember con\u00ad stituencies with parties putting up a number of candidates which may equal the total seats con\u00ad tested. The biggest differences lie in the method of vote casting and vote counting. Candidates are listed alphabetically on the ballot paper and voters rank their order of preference by putting a num\u00ad ber 1 beside their first choice, 2 next to their second, and so on. A quota must be established which will represent the minimum number of first choice votes a candidate must receive to get elected. This number can be derived by taking the total votes cast divided by the sum of the number of seats to be filled plus one. When the voting has concluded, all of the number one choices are then counted. If any candidate receives more than the threshold, he or she is declared elected. If after the first count all of the seats are not filled, then a vote transfer process is engaged to determine the remainder of the seats. For example, the last placed finisher is eliminated and his or her votes are transferred to the second choice candidates. The votes are then recounted to see if any more candidates reached the threshold, and this procedure continues until all available seats have been filled. To determine the quota of votes candidates would need for an STV election add one to the seat total and take the inverse of the figure: for instance, in a four\u00adseat district, take the inverse of (4 + 1) or 1 divided by 5, and you get a figure of 20%. THE UK PROPOSAL Under the UK government proposals, the current single constituency MEP will be abolished and the UK will be divided into regions. Scotland and Wales will each be single regions and continue to return eight and five MEPs respectively. England will be divided into nine regions using the same boundaries currently employed by the Government Offices for Regions, the exception being the unification of Merseyside and North West into a single region. Ten of the Member States have the whole country as a single constituency for MEP elections, Belgium, Ireland, Italy, like the UK, have divided their national territory into a number of constituencies. Finland has a mixed system. THE TWO TYPES OF THRESHOLDS Five of the Member States using a form of Party List PR have established thresholds, a minimum percentage of votes a party needs to qualify for seat allocation. In Fiance and Germany parties need at least 5% of the vote to qualify; in Austria and Sweden the level is 4%, in Greece 3%. Thresholds are designed primarily to prevent the development of loo many very small parties.

Twenty years ago, the last Labour government proposed in the \"European Assembly Elections Bill\" a choice between the current systems used or a PR system which would have introduced regional lists. This was rejected by the House of Commons. Supporters of reform argue that the new proposals will result in a fairer distribution of the votes among parties and encourage the electorate to take a greater interest in elections to the European Parliament. In 1994, for example, the turnout was just 36% in England, much lower than that of other Member States. LABOUR The selection and ranking of Labour Party candidates for European election is currently under discussion. A working group, elected by the European Parliamentary Labour Party is currently looking at selection procedures for the 1999 European Parliamentary Elections in conjunction with the party's National Executive Committee. It is too early to say what the final outcome will be. CONSERVATIVE: Leader of the British Conservatives in the European Parliament Edward McMillan\u00ad Scott (North Yorkshire, EPP) writes: \"Conservative MEPs dislike PR because it breaks the constituency link but we take comfort that even with PR every Conservative vote will count in strong Labour, Lib Dem or Nationalist areas alike and for the first time most parts of the country will have a Conservative MEP.\" He is opposed to the \"closed list\" system. LIBERAL DEMOCRATS The Liberal Democrats are traditionally strong supporters of proportional representa\u00ad tion, but they continue to recommend an \"open\" rather than \"closed\" list system, thereby giving the electorate some influence over the elected candidate. Party members will have a say in choosing candidates. The party is also pressing for the tightening up of the registration of party names after the con\u00ad fusion caused in 1994 when an independent candidate put himself forward as a \"Literal Democrat\" on the ballot paper and possibly denied them victory in one constituency. THE GREENS The Greens support the regional list system, but recommend that the parties have the option of submitting the same list in each region, effectively creating a national lisi. Finally, all the lists are counted nationally as is done in European Parliament elections in Germany. The Greens believe that this method gives fairer and proportional results. They believe that closed lists restrict voters' choice and therefore prefer an open list. SCOTTISH NATIONAL PARTY According to Allan Macartney (UK, ERA), the SNP prefers lhe additional member system as used in German national elections under which half the seats are divided by c\u00ad onstituency, the other half as a \"lop up\" using a list system under PR. As for selecting candidates for future European Parliament elections, it is loo early to say what will be adopled. However, under one proposal which Mr Macartney is advocating is to hold a primary for each of the European seats. All members could then vote for candidates to contest the seal. The party organisation and constituency members could propose candidates for these primaries. The ranking of these candidates would be done al a special national conference with several hundred delegations representing all lhe parly branches. PLAID CYMRU The party has in the past supported the additional member system for elections, bul recently Plaid Cymru has also voiced support for lhe single transferable vote. As for the selection of candidates, lhe parly has yet to decide a method of choosing and ranking candidates. I lowever, il will he done using some form of electoral college. Greens Women are currently encouraged by the Greens to participate as candidates in elections. Their candidates are to be selected by the regional party membership. Peter Barnett, External Communications co\u00adordinator, states that the party will encourage the regional membership to select more women nominations if they are underrepresented. Scottish National Party In the absence of quotas, the party has always sought to promote women in politics and has agreed to try to improve their numbers. Currently, one of the SNP's two MEPs is a woman, and in the UK parliament two out of the SNP's six MPs are women. There is the possibility that the SNP might decide to rank women alternately with men for the seats, although this has yet to be decided. Plaid Cymru There will definitely be some system installed to promote the selection and representa\u00ad tion of female MEPs. However, the details have not yet been finalised. A suitable system has yet to be found.

The UK and lhe Uniled Slates as well as Canada, France, Serbia, Ukraine. Pakistan,and India arc the only countries that use lhe first\u00adpast\u00adthe\u00adpost, or winner\u00ad take\u00adall system for their general elections. Voters are restricted lo voting for only one candidale, no malter how many sland. There are generally two ways citizens vole in illese systems; either plurality voting, where the candidale willi lhe most voles wins, or plurality voting, with a runoff between lhe lop two vole getters in a second election, lhe one with the most votes wins. Runoff elections are held only if lhe winner in lhe first election does not receive an absolute majority over all of the other candidates or some other predeter\u00ad mined percentage of the vole (usually 40%). When South Africa began its ascent into the democratic world the winner\u00adtake\u00adall syslcm was nol considered as \u00a11 was univer\u00ad sally recognised that the success of the new democracy depended greatly upon the degree to which their newly elected government reflected the racial and politi\u00ad cal diversity of society. In opting for Party List PR, South Africans ensured that the white minority (14% of the population) had a voice and representation. The Additional Member System (AMS), used in Germany's general elections, has grown increasingly popular over the last decade. In this system, half the seals available in a constituency are \"at\u00adlarge\" seats and the other half are \"district seals\". Voters have two votes, an at\u00adlarge vote given to the party Ihey favour and a district\u00advole for lhe candidate of choice in the voter's home districi. If the Greens get 2i)% of lhe at\u00adlarge vote in a 100\u00adseat elec\u00ad tion, for example, they are entitled to 20% of the total seats in lhe constituency: in this case, the Greens receive 20 seats. Let's say the Greens won seven individual district seats, they would then be entitled to an additional 13 at\u00adlarge seats taken dirceli) from the top of their party list. This system is currently used by Iceland and many of the new emerging democracies in eastern Lumpe and die former Soviel Union like Russia, Lithuania, and Hungary. In 1994 New Zealand switched from their winner\u00ad take\u00adall system of 140 years lo the Additional, or Mixed, Member System. During lhe pasl year Japan, Mexico, and Italy have till adopted a version of the German AMS. combining geographically based districts with Party Lisi PR. STV or Preference Voting, like thai in lhe Republic of Ireland, is used by lhe Maltese government and also by Australia in electing representatives lo their upper chambers. Until the 1950s preference voting was used by 22 American cities, including New York, lo eleet their local governments until it was thrown oui during lhe McCarthy erti after communists and blacks were elected to office. Cumulative Voling is yet another form of PR. Again candidates are elecled lo multi\u00admember constituencies and voters have as many votes as seats being contested. They can then allocale voles to one or any number of candidates. This sys\u00ad lcm is currently used in Luxembourg's MLP elections as well as in several counties and cities in the US. Some corporations use the cumulative vote when electing boards of directors. Another newer form of PR called Approval Voting is seen by many experts lo offer the most compelling advantages over other voting procedures. Proposed independently by several analysts in the 1970s, it is used in various governments and organisations around the world including the United Nations.

        "EU accounts rejected European Parliament \u2014 EP News 4 T HE President of the Court of Auditors Bernhard Friedmann, in presenting his annual report to MEPs, said the Court had covered so many irregularities and cases of fraud amounting to 5.4% of the Ecu77bn 1996 budget or a total figure of Ecu3.7bn that it was not able to give the Com\u00ad mission a clean bill of health for its management of lhe funds. Mr Friedmann singled out duty free zones, VAT on exports where the tax is col\u00ad lected in the country of destina\u00ad tion and the EU's preferential tariff arrangements as areas prone to fraud. False certifi\u00ad cates of origin were being used to export goods and take advantage of cheaper rates of duty, and, indeed, in one case il was discovered that the volume of orange juice imported into the EU from one particular country with advantageous rates of duty amounted to three times lhe production capacity of the country concerned. Duty free ports whose goods are stored up to 45 days after unloading are notoriously diffi\u00ad cult to police, and the court's report singles out Tilbury Freeport as one zone where controls are weak and duly free goods not separated from other goods liable to import duly. The reporl comments thai secu\u00ad rity arrangements are worse or nearly non\u00adexistent in Ireland, where lhe Irish authorities rely almost totally on documentary records to control the flow of goods. Mr Friedmann had some par\u00ad ticularly harsh comments to make on the management of farm spending, where he said the failure of EU ministers to adjust EU subsidies to cereal farmers at a time of rising world prices cost the taxpayer some Ecu3bn, and, he added, the situation was hardly any better in the beef sector where excess payments of around EcuSOOm were made because the relevant regulations were not changed at the right time. Indeed, the report notes that compensation for some 1,695 cattle in England under a Ecu34m beef marketing pay\u00ad ment scheme should not have been paid since the animals were over 30 months old and thus considered prone to BSE. Mr Friedmann then turned his attention to tobacco, and questioned lhe policy of contin\u00ad uing production subsidies, amounting lo Ecu6,800 per hectare, or five times the mar\u00ad ket value of the product con\u00ad cerned. In addition, further enquiries discovered that controls by the Greek administration were non\u00adexistent, with fraud known to the national authorities. In fact, the Greek authorities were forced to repay Ecu82m and the Italians EcuISm following lhe discovery of irregularities in lhe tobacco sector Cases of BSE are now being discovered in Belgium BSE \u00ad Commission responds to criticisms WITH (he Commission respond\u00ad ing to damning criticism from MEPs for its management of (lie USE crisis hy introducing whole\u00ad sale administrative reforms, opening up the workings of the secretive scientific committees and announcing lhe appointment of 100 extra inspectors to ensure food quality, the work of Parlia\u00ad ment's special enquiry committee set up to investigate the handling of lhe crisis came to an end. In adopting (he recommendations of the committee in February, Parl\u00ad iament gave the Commission to the end of the year to reform its procedures or face censure. Reimer H\u00f6ge (I), EPP), respon\u00ad sible for drawing up the commit\u00ad tee's report, welcomed the Com\u00ad mission's response, although without naming names he was far from complimentary about the attitude of some member states. Former UK agriculture minister Douglas Hogg declined an invita\u00ad tion to appear before the commit\u00ad tee, and in future Parliament wants a commitment from Mem\u00ad ber States to abide by any such request from a parliamentary committee. The committee was also dissat\u00ad isfied with the Commission's fail\u00ad ure to sack any officials consid\u00ad ered responsible for the mishan\u00ad dling of the crisis, and its deci\u00ad sion not to demand a refund from the UK of EU financial assistance. In his defence. Com\u00ad mission President Jacques Santer said there were insuffi\u00ad cient grounds for sacking offi\u00ad cials or for demanding a refund from the UK, although he would nol hesitate to do this should the UK fail to comply with EU legis\u00ad lation. On a positive note, the President was more sympathetic to calls from MEPs for compen\u00ad sation (o go to CJD victims. MEPs will he monitoring future developments closely. John Corrie (Worcestershire and South Warwickshire, EPP) said there was no doubt that mis\u00ad takes were made at all levels in the early days. But with the num\u00ad ber of cases reduced from 37,000 three years ago to just 3,000 this year, he felt the problem was now being tackled seriously. Mr Fernand Boden argued that the Council had sought to guarantee public health. Mr Boden said that it was still not appropriate for Council to decide on a possible lifting of the emb\u00ad argo of British beef and it was for the Commission to decide when the UK met the relevant criteria. Court of Auditors President Bernhard Friedmann tells MEPs where money management is going wrong But in its defence, the Com\u00ad mission accepted the criticisms, with Budget Commissioner Erkki Liikanen emphasising his concern to seek improvements in the management of EU finances. Indeed, he said, these would be seen in the 1998 budget. He accepted criticisms of the management of the cereal sec\u00ad tor, bul pointed out that it was the Commission that had made proposals to rectify this. Unfortunately they were not accepted either by Council or the European Parliament. He was pleased to note that improvements in other areas of the management of the CAP had been recognised, although he accepted criticisms over the regional fund. These have been acted upon, he said, with the rules on eligibility for funding having been changed. The over\u00ad all conclusion by the Commis\u00ad sioner was, however, that the EU budget was financing too many small\u00adscale projects with too many objectives which were difficult to control. Reform, he said, should concentrate on simplifying goals and bringing more areas of spending together. Mr Friedmann also accepted a point made by John Tomlinson (UK, PES) that the Member States responsible for handling some 80% of EU funds also had considerable responsibility for proper man\u00ad agement of the funds. Development policy under scrutiny WITH the EU's special develop\u00ad ment aid treaty known as the Lom\u00e9 Convention with lhe 70 African, Caribbean and Pacific developing countries due to expire in the year 2002, MEPs and dele\u00ad gates from the countries con\u00ad cerned lasi month examined in dettai prospects lor reform at lhe 25th meeting of the Joint Assembly held in Lom\u00e9, the capi\u00ad tal of Togo. The joint co\u00adchairman of the Assembly, Lord Plumb (The Cotswolds, EPP) lamented the fact that, as he put it, after 22 years of development aid under Lom\u00e9, the results were meagre with precious little to show for it. There was no reason for compla\u00ad cency. In laet. it could be argued that living conditions iti the poorest countries had declined, with some three billion people on the planet lacing the daily grind of living on under $2 a day. and 150 million children without the opportunity of going lo school. Of the poorest 50 countries in (he world classed as least devel\u00ad oped, some 41 are ACP stales. Yet with the pressure lo pro\u00ad vide economic assistance closer to home on Europe's borders with Eastern Europe, there are fears amongst the ACP states that their cause will he neglected. And willi \"r\u00e9gionalisation\" and \"differentiation\" the new buzz words, the ACP states are worried that a new EU approach based on categorising aid and trade rela\u00ad tions according to the degree of poverty in the developing coun\u00ad tries and adopting a regional approach to the different conti\u00ad nents, the positions of the ACP states will be undermined. There are further fears lliat the push for free trade and rulings from the WTO against advanta\u00ad geous arrangements for Carib\u00ad bean banana growers will only further undermine special prefer\u00ad ential measures for other products. The British Approach The timing of the Joint Assembly in Togo coincided with the publi\u00ad cation of the British government's proposals for overseas aid in a paper with the ambitious title \"Eliminating World Poverty: A challenge for the 21st Century\". The report sets out a series of international development targets which are designed to provide milestones against which progress towards the goal of poverty elimi\u00ad nation can be measured. These include the aim of reducing the proportion of people living in extreme poverty by one half by the year 2015. establishing minimal primary education in all countries and halving child immortality rates by the same date. Over 30% ol' the UK's develop\u00ad ment aid programme is spent through the EU, and the govern\u00ad ment is proposing to direct a large share of resources to the poorest countries, to secure commitments from the Commission and other Member States to measurable tar\u00ad gets and to ensure that these funds are used more effectively. The Government also aims to simplify the rules governing eligi\u00ad bility for preferential access to the EU market. This, it hopes, will allow developing countries to take full advantage of such arrange\u00ad ments. It is also committed to a funda\u00ad mental reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and to bring the benefits of this reform to help developing countries. To support these proposals the government is committing \u00a1(self to reversing the decline in the British development assistance budget and increasing it from 1999/2000. It will he aiming to reach the United Nations target of 0.7% of GDP. The report concludes by arguing that \"sustainable develop\u00ad ments is central to our aim of building a new society ... a new global society ... The Government commits itself to this high endeavour\". International fund for Ireland THIS MONTH, MEPs overwhelmingly supported the Commission's proposal to continue the European Union's commitment and financial support to the International Fund for Ireland (IFI) with a contribution of some Ecu17m over each of the next two years. This international organisation, established by the British and Irish governments in 1986 after the Anglo\u00adIrish agreement, was set up to develop the means for social and economic co\u00ad operation between the two communities in Northern Ireland and foster cross\u00adborder initiatives. Viewed by most as a true success, the IFI has produced impressive results. Some 28,000 jobs have been created that are directly related to the Fund. It has directly assisted over 3,400 business projects and has contributed to developing 639 cross\u00adcountry and cross\u00adborder groups involving over 7,600 community leaders. Among some current IFI projects are: \u2022 Communities in Action Programme: a three\u00adyear pilot programme started in 1996 designed to promote initiatives focusing on the needs of young children, marginalised adolescents and women out of work. Currently, 30 individual projects in the most needy rural and urban areas receive a share of the \u00a32.5m annually available. \u2022 The Communities Bridges Programme. Started in 1996, it aims to support cross\u00adcommunity groups which promote greater dialogue and understanding by tackling such issues as the division between people from different cultural and religious traditions on the island. 16 projects were selected to receive support in 1996. \u2022 The Small Business Loan Fund was introduced in 1994 and was handed over to private sector management in 1996. It aims to develop small business in Northern Ireland's most disadvantaged areas. In over two years operation it has directly assisted over 211 small businesses with loans ranging from \u00a35,000, totalling over \u00a33m and creating over 900 new jobs. MEPs do, however, want to see close co\u00adordination between programmes financed by the Fund and other EU aid for the region. The search for a new EU fisheries policy THE expiry of the current Common Fisheries Policy in 2002 prompted a lively debate among MEPs in Brussels this month with Maria Fraga Estevez (EPP, E) calling for a new policy that takes account of the needs of the industry and addresses the problem of the fishing fleet across the EU which she considered to be too large in view of limitations on stocks. Most controversially, she drew attention to the transitional derogation until the end of 2002 from the principle of freedom of access for member states to all Community fishing grounds that has been enjoyed by the UK, Denmark and Ireland since they joined the EU in 1973. Mrs Fraga argued that the single market principle of freedom of access should apply automatically after 2002 in the absence of a decision by the Council of Ministers. Although there was some general support for Mrs Fraga Estevez's views from a number of British MEPs such as dames Provan (South Downs West, EPP) and Peter Crampton (Humberside, PES), others were less happy. Allan Macartney (North East Scotland, ERA), in particular, argued that her proposals would undermine conservation, the viability of small coastal communities dependent on fisheries and, perhaps most importantly of all, support at grass roots level for an EU fisherles policy. There was, he said, a danger that the approach she was recommending would only assist those who were opposed to a common fisheries policy and indeed favoured leaving the EU. Despite these reservations, however, MEPs voted by a large majority in favour of Mrs Fraga Estevez's proposals, which stress the importance of treating fisheries as \"simply another sector of economic activity\", although it has special problems relating to the environment, employment and conservation stocks.
