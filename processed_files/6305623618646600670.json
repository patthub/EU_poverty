        "For centuries Europe has been an idea, holding out hope of peace and understanding. That hope has been fulfilled. European unification has made peace and prosperity possible. It has brought about a sense of community and overcome differences. Each Member State has helped to unite Europe and to strengthen democracy and the rule of law. Thanks to the yearning for freedom of the peo- ples of central and eastern Europe the unnatural division of Europe is now consigned to the past. European integration shows that we have learnt the painful lessons of a history marked by bloody conflict. Today we live together as was never pos- sible before. We, the citizens of the European Union, have united for the better. I. In the European Union, we are turning our common ideals into reality: for us, the individual is paramount. His dignity is inviolable. His rights are inalienable. Women and men enjoy equal rights. We are striving for peace and freedom, for democracy and the rule of law, for mutual respect and shared responsibility, for prosperity and secu- rity, for tolerance and participation, for justice and solidarity. We have a unique way of living and working to- gether in the European Union. This is expressed through the democratic interaction of the Member States and the European institutions. The European Union is founded on equal rights and mutually supportive cooperation. This enables us to strike a fair balance between Member States\u2019 interests. We preserve in the European Union the identi- ties and diverse traditions of its Member States. We are enriched by open borders and a lively variety of languages, cultures and regions. There are many goals which we cannot achieve on our own, but only in concert. Tasks are shared between the European Union, the Member States and their regions and local authorities. II. We are facing major challenges which do not stop at national borders. The European Union is our response to these challenges. Only together can we continue to preserve our ideal of European society in future for the good of all European Union citizens. This European model combines economic success and social responsibility. The common market and the euro make us strong. We can thus shape the increasing interdependence of the global economy and ever-growing competition on international markets according to our values. Europe\u2019s wealth lies in the knowledge and ability of its people; that is the key to growth, employ- ment and social cohesion. Decl aration on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the signature of the Treaties of Rome ",
        "We will fight terrorism, organised crime and illegal immigration together. We stand up for lib- erties and civil rights also in the struggle against those who oppose them. Racism and xenophobia must never again be given any rein. We are committed to the peaceful resolution of conflicts in the world and to ensuring that people do not become victims of war, terrorism and vio- lence. The European Union wants to promote free- dom and development in the world. We want to drive back poverty, hunger and disease. We want to continue to take a leading role in that fight. We intend jointly to lead the way in energy policy and climate protection and make our con- tribution to averting the global threat of climate change.

The European Union will continue to thrive both on openness and on the will of its Member States to consolidate the Union\u2019s internal develop- ment. The European Union will continue to pro- mote democracy, stability and prosperity beyond its borders. With European unification a dream of earlier generations has become a reality. Our history re- minds us that we must protect this for the good of future generations. For that reason we must al- ways renew the political shape of Europe in keep- ing with the times. That is why today, 50 years after the signing of the Treaties of Rome, we are united in our aim of placing the European Union on a renewed common basis before the European Parliament elections in 2009. For we know, Europe is our common future. Done at Berlin on the twenty-fifth day of March in the year two thousand and seven. "
