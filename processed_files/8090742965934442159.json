        "3 Abstract The European Commission finances projects enabling public, private and civil society actors deliver new services, assess new policies and exchange good practices in the fields of employment, working conditions, and social protection and inclusion. To facilitate the dissemination of the achieved results, this report reviews good practice examples of projects supported by the EURES financial instrument and PROGRESS Programme (2007-2013). Although the new EaSI programme has already started, the projects reviewed in this report were started between 2012 and 2014 and ended between 2013 and 2015. The group of projects \u2018Your first Eures Job\u2019 initiative focused on fostering activities in the area of job mobility and filling the bottleneck vacancies across the EU with a high quality workforce. It also aimed to provide employment for young jobseekers and engage business in intra-EU labour mobility. The PROGRESS group of projects focused on activities relating to employment, social protection and working conditions. All projects collected a solid and comparative knowledge base, good practice examples from different EU countries and policy recommendations, which may be beneficial to policy-makers designing or implementing policy interventions in the respective policy areas. The projects covered by this report are good practice examples of fostering employment among the youth, developing pension models, creating European Sectoral Skills Councils and developing inclusion models for vulnerable groups and simulation models. R\u00e9sum\u00e9 La Commission europ\u00e9enne finance des projets qui permettent aux acteurs publics, priv\u00e9s et de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 civile d\u2019apporter de nouveaux services, d\u2019\u00e9valuer les nouvelles politiques et d\u2019\u00e9changer des bonnes pratiques dans les domaines de l\u2019emploi, des conditions de travail, de la protection sociale et de l\u2019inclusion sociale. Pour faciliter la diffusion des r\u00e9sultats obtenus, le pr\u00e9sent rapport analyse les exemples de bonnes pratiques des projets soutenus par l\u2019instrument financier EURES et le programme PROGRESS (2007-2013). M\u00eame si le nouveau programme EaSI a d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9but\u00e9, les projets analys\u00e9s dans le pr\u00e9sent rapport ont d\u00e9but\u00e9 entre 2012 et 2014 et se sont termin\u00e9s entre 2013 et 2015.

        "5 Introduction Monitoring good practices is part of the performance monitoring of the European Union\u2019s Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) 2014-2020. It foresees four biannual reports on projects considered to be examples of good practice, with a view to facilitating their dissemination. This is the fourth biannual report, which follows the first one issued in 2014, the second one issued in January 2015 and the third one issued in September 2015. This report reviews projects that were funded through earlier EURES financial instrument and Progress programme before the EaSI was started. As the projects usually last between 2 and 3 years, the results that can be reported at the moment are of projects that were initiated between 2012 and 2014. The aim of the identification and sharing of good practices is to capture evidence on the effectiveness of a practice, to improve its visibility and dissemination so that it becomes easily accessible and reusable by all informed stakeholders: decision-makers, socioeconomic partners, NGOs, academia, media, and civil society at large, and facilitates learning from others. It is expected that the sharing of good practices will inspire further change and \u2018better practice\u2019. This report covers projects funded under previous programmes now integrated under EaSI within the policy areas of employment, social protection and inclusion and working conditions, specifically, the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Solidarity \u2013 PROGRESS (2007-2013) and the European Employment Services \u2013 EURES between 2012 and 2015 (including Your First EURES Job pilot schemes). The projects were funded by the Commission as a result of specific calls for proposals and following the selection procedures of each call. Please note that Your first EURES job was a pilot scheme intended to prepare for the targeted mobility schemes launched under the EaSI Programme. Since none of the targeted mobility schemes funded under EaSI have finished yet, it was decided to present the \u201cYour First EURES Job\u201d projects, which were also funded under the EURES budget line. In the policy area of employment, the Commission has funded projects to support cooperation among public and private employment services and the exchange of good practices in employment and labour mobility, following nine calls for proposals (see box 1). In the policy area of social protection and social inclusion the Commission has funded projects to support policies for active ageing and the development of social, health and long-term care services, social experimentation and equality, following seven calls for proposals (see box 2).

        "6 In the policy area of working conditions the Commission has funded projects that deal with restructuring, well-being at work and financial participation as well as with posting of workers, following three calls for proposals (see box 3). Box 2.

Calls for proposals in the policy area of working conditions This report includes projects that were completed and submitted their final reports to the Commission before 15 August 2015. Such projects were identified within six calls for proposals: 1. VP/2011/006 preparatory action \u2018Your first EURES job\u2019 2. VP/2011/009 \u2018Call For Proposals For Social Experimentations Progress 2011\u2019 in the policy areas of social protection and social inclusion; 3.

They should rather be seen as distinct examples of good practice. ",
        "7 When selecting projects to be included in the good practice monitoring reports, a broad definition of the term \u2018good practice\u2019 has been adopted. It encompasses a process or a methodology that represents an effective way of achieving a specific objective, one that has been proven to work well and produce expected results, and is therefore recommended as a model or as a useful example. The selection is carried out following a three-step approach: \u2022 First, a review of the final technical reports of the relevant action grants is carried out and a number of projects are selected according to the core criteria of effectiveness, transferability, sustainability, innovativeness and impact/European added value, and the horizontal criteria of gender equality, non-discrimination, inclusion of vulnerable groups, and contribution to employment and social protection and inclusion. \u2022 Then, the projects which meet quantitative criteria and have a positive qualitative assessment are subject to a more in-depth analysis of additional information and consultations with the curators of the calls. Thus, the initial assessment is verified and the strongest aspects of the selected good practices are identified. \u2022 Finally, the projects are classified according to broad policy areas. Context-related keywords on policy sub-areas, types of activities and target groups are assigned to each of them to facilitate the search for and dissemination of necessary information. The report is structured according to the two areas (EURES and PROGRESS) and the projects are grouped according to their respective call for proposals. The PROGRESS part is further subdivided into policy areas. The description of each project includes general information on its policy area and sub-area, type of activity, target groups, participating countries and organisations, EU contribution and project duration, as well as specific information on the project\u2019s results, activities, context and sustainability. Links to additional information are provided at the end of each description. ",
        "8 EURES Your first Eures Job For intra-EU labour mobility, the Commission has been testing a mobility scheme called \u2018Your first EURES job\u2019 (YfEJ). The scheme aims to help young people to find a job, traineeship or apprenticeship in another Member State (remunerated, minimum 6 month contract). It also supports employers to find workforce in another EU country for their bottleneck vacancies. All candidates must be 18 to 30 years old, nationals of any of the EU28 countries, Norway and Iceland and resident in any of these countries. The main objectives of YfEJ are a) to foster the exercise of workers\u2019 freedom of movement as set out in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU, Art.45); b) to address labour market mismatches and imbalances and, c) to reduce intra-EU labour mobility obstacles (e.g. knowledge of languages, recognition of qualifications or the costs of moving abroad). YfEJ was implemented as a preparatory action (budget years 2011-2013) in the framework of the \u2018Youth on the Move\u2019 flagship initiative 1 and the Youth Opportunities Initiative 2 . Activities were funded by calls for proposals. The target for the three calls launched in the period 2011-2013 was to ensure 5000 work placements for young people with an overall budget of EUR 12 million. The scheme combines the provision of information, recruitment, matching and placement services with EU financial incentives. It finances language courses or other training needs and travel expenses for young candidates (for job interviews and relocation to other EU countries). It also provides a contribution to an integration programme in the case of recruitment by a small or medium-sized company (SME). At the end of the second quarter of 2015, around 4300 participants had obtained a work placement in another Member State. Projects under the preparatory action will only be finalised by the end of the third quarter of 2015. A mid-term evaluation (2014) 3 confirmed the relevance and EU added value of YfEJ and proposed also some options for the future. As from 2014, the continuation of the scheme has been ensured under the EU Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (2014-2020 EaSI, EURES Axis) as a Targeted Mobility Scheme, with an annual budget of between EUR 6 and 9 million euros. Under the preparatory action, the following three calls for proposals, were published: VP/2011/006, VP/2012/006 and VP/2013/014. The VP/2012/006 call was already covered by the 3rd report on monitoring good case practices. This report includes the projects granted under the VP/2011/006 and VP/2013/014 calls. 1 European Commission, Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions.

        "9 VP/2011/006 The call for proposals VP/2011/006 had a budget of EUR 4 000 000. Grants could amount to 95% of the total project costs, of which: a minimum of 80% was aimed at granting third parties (young people and SMEs) and a maximum of 20% at co-funding the eligible costs borne by the selected organisations for the implementation of the action. The duration of each project has been at least 18 months. The overarching priorities of the preparatory action were to contribute to fill bottleneck vacancies with available youth workforce at EU level and to foster youth job mobility across the EU-27 Member States. Organisations applying for this grant had to belong to a category of \u2018general employment services\u2019, i.e. organisations whose main mission is to provide employment services to all types of jobseekers, job changers and employers covering a variety of occupations and jobs in different economic sectors. In addition, the organisations were required to have experience in recruitment, job matching and job placement activities and a thorough knowledge of EU labour markets. Also, the organisations had to demonstrate that they have the required management capacity, necessary resources and were able to integrate the requested activities into their business model with a view to supporting and distributing grants to young European mobile jobseekers and recruiting businesses. A total of four projects were funded through this call for proposals. Three projects were presented in the third report and one report is presented below. ",

        "11 Results : Under the YfEJ project, the German Federal Employment Agency (Bundesagentur f\u00fcr Arbeit) provided support \u2013 information, recruitment, matching, placement and funding \u2013 for both young jobseekers and businesses interested in recruiting skilled young people from outside Germany. During the 18-month programme duration, 361 young people were supported through the payment of travel expenses, travel and relocation expenses as well as through preparatory language training. Also, 32 SMEs benefited from financial support for a total of 46 integration programs. Project description : The \u2018Your first EURES Job\u2019 (YfEJ) project (Dein erster EURES-Arbeitsplatz, DEEA) of the German Federal Employment Agency built on the existing infrastructures and cooperation formats of the EURES network. YfEJ is an EU job mobility scheme that helps young Europeans between 18 to 35 years old find a job or work-based training opportunity in other Member State, Norway or Iceland and also helps employers find qualified young workers within a larger territory. Context: The project\u2019s target groups were companies based in Germany faced with a lack of staff, as well as young people from Europe looking for professional training opportunities in Germany. The YfEJ project aimed at providing mediation between these two groups by supporting placement opportunities. Notable aspects of good practice : The project was implemented effectively and achieved most of its goals. The project contributed directly to combating unemployment and achieved impact by providing young people with help in finding employment in Germany, as well as helped German companies to find skilled young workers. The preparatory language courses, simple application procedure and rapid payment of travel expenses provided by the program were identified as key elements to support the successful integration of young Europeans into the German labour market. Finally, the practices and methods developed in this project could be transferred to other contexts. Conclusion and follow-up : One of the greatest success of the DEEA project was the introduction of the national mobility program \u2018The job of my life\u2019, which secured the sustainability of YfEJ in Germany. In addition to DEEA, \u2018The job of my life\u2019 program supports young people from Europe and brings together promoters and companies looking for young talents.

        "12 VP/2013/014 The call for proposals VP/2013/014 shared similar goals as call VP/2011/006 and aimed to fill bottleneck vacan- cies and foster youth employment through intra-EU labour mobility. It funded a third wave of YfEJ projects. The total available budget was 5 million euros and for the first time the activities had the possibility to extend support measures to trainees and apprentices. The European Union\u2019s financial contribution could not exceed 95% of the total eligible costs of the proposed activities, of which: a minimum of 70% of the total eligible costs were aimed at direct support grants to young people and SMEs and financing \u201cOther support measures by \u2018YfEj beneficiaries\u2019\u201d (i.e. the preparatory training and mentoring support for recruited trainees and apprentices). The duration of the projects was 12 months. In total, six projects were funded through this call for proposals. Before the cut-off date for this report, three of them had been completed and assessed as good case practice examples. The projects are presented below. ",

        "14 Results : Building on experience and lesson learnt in the previous YfEJ project, YfEJ 3.0 increased its performance reaching a higher number of beneficiaries (jobseekers and employers), and further developed and improved its service model. A new version of the web matching tool (EUJOB4EU Platform) was implemented, facilitating the management and monitoring of all the mobility processes, from pre-departure to the selection and post-placement phases. During the year covered by the project, 373 young jobseekers found a job in 17 different countries, 345 benefited from a relocation grant and 109 from an interview allowance. Also, 53 integration programmes organised by SMEs were funded. Project description : YfEJ 3.0\u2019s main aims were to assist youth in making successful transitions into the EU labour market and to support employers in recruiting EU youth workers, thereby resulting in increased employment, filled bottleneck vacancies and in sustained worker\u2019s freedom of movement. The project was implemented as a continuity to a previous YfEJ project that created a model of European hub for youth mobility. Context : The project approached labour demand and supply from a holistic point of view, with a specific attention to building bridges and strengthening the cooperation with other labour market stakeholders. This cooperation was particularly important when focusing on bottleneck vacancies. Notable aspects of good practice : The YfEJ was an effective project that achieved it goals and contributed to fighting unemployment in several EU Member States. One of the successes of the project was that its sustainability was ensured through another grant until 2017. The project model was also transferred to National EURES Advisers and Regional and local PES operators. Conclusion and follow-up : Building on experience and lesson learnt in the previous YfEJ project, YfEJ 3.0 increased its performance reaching a higher number of beneficiaries (jobseekers and employers), and further developed and improved its service model. A new version of a web matching tool (EUJOB4EU Platform) was developed, the project\u2019s network of partners and stakeholders was strengthened all over Europe and new services were tested and offered to beneficiaries.

        "16 Results : This project achieved its initial target of finding employment for 500 young jobseekers (in total 504 were employed). The financial support provided by the project enabled them to participate in the interview trip and relocate. In addition, 148 jobseekers were granted interview trips and 11 jobseekers were granted recognition of qualification. Finally, 10 SMEs were supported for employing 85 persons. Project description : The main aims of the project included: 1) providing job placements by using information, recruitment and job matching; 2) providing young jobseekers with the opportunity to find real jobs in another EU country, ensure sustainable mobility by personal and financial support to young jobseekers; and 3) assisting SMEs to make sustainable recruitments among young jobseekers. Context : The preparatory action YfEJ was run for the second time by the EURES of the Swedish Public Employment Service (PES). Hence, the implementation of the second action was carried out more cost-effectively, relying on an already established organisation. In addition, the project overall correlated with the objectives of the Swedish PES prio- ritizing work with young jobseekers and employers and ensuring swift implementation within the whole PES organization. Aspects of good practice : The implementation of this action was effective and the project achieved most of its aims. The momentum it has achieved was sustained through a new grant of Targeted Mobility Scheme \u2018Your first EURES job\u2019 that EURES Sweden will be leading. Finally, the action has been an important tool to fight the increasing number of unemployed youth in Sweden as well as in other EU-countries.

        "18 Results : In total, there were 173 applications approved and 96 applicants received support for relocations. In addition, 75 applicants were reimbursed for their job interviews abroad and 2 applicants were reimbursed for costs related to the recognition of their academic and/or professional qualifications. There were 14 integration programmes approved in 4 different companies. The Employment Service of Slovenia (ESS) created a dedicated website in Slovenian and English language with clear information about the programme and application procedure for financial support for the job seekers and employers. The ESS also carried out extensive dissemination activities that included seminars and individual meetings for jobseekers, participation in job days, liaising with Career centres of Universities, youth unions and organising other targeted recruitment events. Project description : In line with the Youth Opportunities Initiative for the year 2014, the project aimed to provide young people a job in another Member State, to regulate labour market imbalances and bottleneck vacancies as well as to tap into the quality of employment services directed at young people and employers. The project also intended to boost intra-EU youth job mobility by reducing obstacles for moving to and recruiting from another Member State and by facilitating transitions in the labour market from education to work. Notable aspects of good practice : The project was effective in conducting its activities and achieving its goals in broad terms. The project collected information from participants to evaluate customer satisfaction and the responses were positive. By providing employment the project made an impact in several EU Member States in reducing unemployment rates among the youth. The practices and methods applied in this project could be transferred to and adapted in other countries. Conclusion and follow-up : One of the biggest achievements of the project was that the YfEJ programme was well integrated and recognised by ESS. Also, the participants of the YfEj in Slovenia were mostly satisfied by the service and would recommend the programme to other young people according to the questionnaire conducted by the ESS.

        "21 Results : The \u2018Tremplin\u2019 project has allowed to structure and formalise numerous actions related to labour market integration in pilot vocational education and training schools in the Lille and Grenoble school districts. Sixteen info points dedicated to labour market integration (\u2018P\u00f4les premier emploi\u2019) were created, aimed at facilitating the accession of future graduates to the labour market. In the context of these info points, numerous activities have been developed such as providing information and advice, training, awareness raising, network development and boosting mobility. Moreover, three study visits carried out in Scotland, Germany and Poland have allowed contact points from the selected schools to discover the educational systems of the countries visited, initiate contacts with local vocational schools and business and secure reception conditions of the selected exchange students. Project description : The project aimed at supporting schools to facilitate the integration of recent graduates to the labour market by mobilising relevant actors at the level of the school system and employment agencies and by promoting intra-European mobility. The main objective of the project was to enhance the employability of young graduates by creating innovative facilities (\u2018P\u00f4les premier emploi\u2019) identified within 16 pilot vocational education and training schools. These new areas fully dedicated to labour market integration were organised along 4 main axes: 1. Developing a school project taking into account labour market integration; 2. Building a network of local social actors and professionals; 3. Increasing young people\u2019s employability; 4. Fighting against inequality in employment. Context : Statistics show that the length of this transition period between school graduation and labour market integration has increased for young graduates from vocational education and training schools, particularly in the context of the economic crisis, and in higher proportions for girls. The \u2018Tremplin\u2019 project was a social experimentation aimed at reducing the period of transition between school and labour market and fighting inequality in employment. Notable aspects of good practice : The project\u2019s results advocate for the continuing development of synergies between stakeholders aimed at enhancing young people\u2019s employability and mobility. The project made an impact in better preparing students for labour market integration, developing and reinforcing relations with local economic partners and by creating targeted training for teachers. Finally, the project promoted transnational synergies by creating mobility periods abroad and reinforcing partnerships with foreign economic actors, and this practice could be transferred to other Member States. Conclusion and follow-up : Overall the experimentation results have been positive. All of the 16 school\u2019s management teams have underlined that they considered continuing the activities in favour of graduate students\u2019 labour market integration and mobility. It was also recommended to promote the best practices identified in order for other school districts to prolong the experience of the project.

        "23 Results : The EMPAC project helped to prevent underachievement and improve the integration of migrant pupils in the partner countries. It supported the development and implementation of innovative training pedagogies as well as effective strategies to involve parents in school life leading to increased attendance. The project helped early years\u2019 practitioners and teachers to improve and develop the use of innovative pedagogies during class work as well as to increase understanding and awareness of approaches and educational strategies which can be used to support migrant and socially disadvantaged pupils and their families. Project description : The overarching aim of the EMPAC project was to improve the integration and educational achievement of under-performing newly-arrived migrant pupils aged three to 11 years old. The project aimed to identify and pilot new and existing strategies for supporting the integration of newly-arrived families and children into school life within a rigorous research framework in the London Borough of Ealing (UK), Bologna (Italy) and the \u00dast\u00ed region (Czech Republic). Context : The target group of the EMPAC project were under-performing newly-arrived migrant pupils (and members of ethnic minorities such as Roma) and their families. In the UK, newly arrived pupils were defined as those admitted to the school/centre during the current or previous school year from families new to the country, culture or language. In the Czech Republic the focus was on children and families from the Roma community and in Bologna their target group was extended to include all \u2018foreign students and parents\u2019, irrespective of when they arrived in the country. Notable aspects of good practice : The EMPAC project was effectively implemented and achieved its objectives in making an impact in fighting under-achievement and improving the integration of migrant pupils and their families. It provided many opportunities for sharing innovative ideas and transferrable practices across partner countries during the project lifetime, including four transnational meetings, a final conference, an additional study visit and a dissemi- nation conference. Conclusion and follow-up : The project led schools to re-examine their existing practice and make innovative and significant changes regarding the integration and educational achievement of newly-arrived migrant pupils. A wide range of resources were developed by the project including a \u201cfamily engagement\u201d evaluation tool and action planning template, a teachers\u2019 attitude and confidence survey, a \u201ctheory of change\u201d template, language and cultural background country profiles (providing information on migrant pupils\u2019 main countries of origin on topics such as social customs, etiquette and education) as well as videos for disseminating the approach employed by the project and lessons learnt.

        "25 Results : Aimed at supporting young low-qualified job seekers from disadvantaged urban areas, the project has allowed the creation of 30 \u2018job-seeking clubs\u2019 in 15 regions, supporting up to 3400 young job-seekers. Overall, the results have been positive in terms of access to sustainable employment. Moreover, the project helped to enhance and increase the quality of the support provided by facilitators helping young job-seekers to gain confidence and job-seeking skills. Finally, the project has shown that individual counselling proved to be one the most effective approaches in terms of results and cost-effectiveness to increase the access to employment of disadvantaged young people. Project description : The project aimed at experimenting and evaluating an intensive job-seeking support mechanism for low-qualified young people under 30 years old living in disadvantaged urban areas. This experimentation led to the creation of 30 \u2018job clubs\u2019 for three months, gathering each from 12 to 14 young people. The objective of the project was to evaluate the impact of the clubs in comparison to \u2018traditional\u2019 job-seeking support on access to and quality of employment as well as on job-seeking behaviours. Context : The project focused on disadvantaged urban areas where unemployment rates are particularly high. This initiative was in line with the French public employment service\u2019s priorities to target job-seekers facing difficulties in accessing or returning to employment. It aimed at developing different forms of reinforced job-seeking support in collaboration with different public and private stakeholders in the area of urban policy and to experiment innovative and transferrable approaches. Notable aspects of good practice : Results showed that \u2018job clubs\u2019 had a stronger impact on access to qualitative employment than regular job-seeking support. The impact of the project was higher for young women, for young people under 25, for young people with lower qualifications as well as for young people registered in employment organisations for less than six months. Results underlined the key role of facilitators in helping young people involved in the project to increase their job-seeking skills. The project promoted transnational synergies and transferrable practices in the context of three international workshops and a closing seminar. Conclusion and follow-up : The conclusions of the project directly influenced the implementation of the Youth Guarantee in France. The clubs currently constitute one of the two modalities of implementation of the Youth Guarantee. Moreover, the closing and dissemination seminar gathered 12 European public employment services (PES) as well as social partners and decision-makers, allowing for an efficient discussion and dissemination of the project\u2019s best practices.

        "27 Results : The project provided first evidence that the door-to-door approach adopted was useful in improving societal participation of people who are long-term unemployed and in helping them to obtain sheltered or regular employment. This was in particular the case for improving the working situation, regardless whether this concerned paid or unpaid work and regardless whether it involved supported or competitive work. The project involved 150 persons dependent on social welfare benefits for more than three years and having one or more children under 18 years old. Project description : The project was based on a door-to-door intervention focused on social inclusion of families coming from disadvantaged urban areas. This method was designed by the municipality of The Hague with the objective to support people dependent on social welfare benefits to access employment, decrease levels of poverty and improve living conditions and levels of safety in the Schilderswijk neighbourhood of The Hague. The method consisted of several house visits to determine motivations, ambitions and capacities of the persons included, and to help them find suitable daytime occupations and relieve of impediments hindering their participation. Context : The Schilderswijk is The Hague\u2019s poorest, most densely populated as well as most culturally diverse district. The level of integration of its inhabitants into the wider Dutch society is poor and the number of unemployed people on long-term social welfare benefits is high. Within an inter-sectoral plan currently prepared by the municipality, the project aimed at tackling social exclusion and trans-generational cycle of poverty, criminality and social problems in the district. Notable aspects of good practice : The project successfully achieved its objectives and had a positive impact on societal participation and work among long-term unemployed and disadvantaged people. The project\u2019s results underlined the importance of differentiating subgroups and providing differential programme elements to specific subgroups. Moreover, it confirmed the need to concentrate on people who need vocational support the most and underlined that it is possible to positively influence societal participation among long-term unemployed. The door-to-door approach was a promising intervention model which could be repeated in similar contexts elsewhere in Europe. The project activities involved networking and sharing of good practices, awareness raising and dissemination campaigns at national and international levels. Conclusion and follow-up : The study provided first evidence that the door-to-door approach could improve participation of people who are long-term unemployed. Further research should focus on the effectiveness of a well-implemented door-to-door model that incorporates adjustments based on the findings of this study.

        "30 Results : The goal of the project was to improve and further develop the Lithuanian Social Insurance Model (LSIM), Lithuania\u2019s standard cohort pension system model. The project aimed at looking into how it could be applied in implementing pension reforms in order to provide national policy makers with a good social policy projection tool. The improved model enables analysis and discussion of the consequences regarding birth cohorts and generations. In addition, the project fulfilled the EU\u2019s requirement that Member States possess the technical capacity to produce long-term social expenditure (primarily pension) calculations for various given scenarios: for the development of the demography, the labour force and the economy. Project description : The key objective of the project was to further develop the National standard cohort pension model (LSIM) which will be used for national projections of long-term financial sustainability and adequacy of benefits and analysis of planned pension reforms. The project dealt with an already existing forecasting tool. During the project new functionalities of the model were added in order to reflect the new legal regulation, expected reforms and new EU reporting standards. Context : In recent years, many EU countries have invested into the development of highly sophisticated pension modelling tools to enable them to better understand their pension systems and especially the long-term impact of proposed policy changes. Although some work has already been done in Lithuania in the area of pension modelling, the model was still lagging behind the EU standards in complexity and needed some improvements to be able to facilitate the level of understanding of pension policies used in other Member States. Notable aspects of good practice : The project had a strong impact and greatly contributed to the general objectives of the PROGRESS programme, especially in the areas of shared understanding and partnerships. The improvements of the pension model will greatly enhance the understanding of the long-term behaviour of the pension system and will provide decision-makers a basis on which to judge proposed policy changes in the area of pensions. The use of the model is strictly limited to the special pension scheme of Lithuania and has therefore limited transferable features. However, the improved pension model could provide valuable comparative information for other EU Member States which could serve as a common ground for discussions on pension policies in the EU. Conclusion and follow-up : Successful implementation of the project\u2019s activities has allowed to better evaluate the impact of changes in pension legislation, planned on individual pension adequacy (for various income groups and gender) and overall pension expenditure in the future. Close cooperation with the model\u2019s authors helped the ministry\u2019s staff to work better with the model to build modelling capacity, so that in the future they will feel more comfortable implementing changes on their own. The project enhanced the ministry\u2019s ability to generate reliable pension-system forecasts for the Lithuanian Convergence Program, Projections for the Aging Working Group and national pension policy studies.

        "32 Results : The MiDLAS project helped to elaborate the first operational dynamic microsimulation model for population ageing in Luxembourg. Also, the project allowed to scrutinize sustainability and adequacy indicators for an implementation of the dynamic microsimulation model under construction. A comparative descriptive analysis of modelling tools available in Luxembourg was also performed. Finally, through the analysis of interviews with key stakeholders (trade unions and employers\u2019 organizations), recommendations were formulated emphasizing the necessity of transparency and of a clearer expression of the limits of the instruments developed. Project description : The general objective of the MiDLAS project was to develop an advanced analysis platform that would allow Luxembourg to answer policy related questions about pensions and social transfers in the longer term through modelling. More specifically, the MiDLAS project joined forces with other partners such as the Federal Planning Bureau in Belgium in order to create a sophisticated instrument for the analysis of the adequacy of the pension system (a dynamic microsimulation model) and to launch a comparative analysis of outcomes resulting from several modelling tools available in Luxembourg. In parallel, the MiDLAS project aimed at assessing attitudes of stakeholders towards \u2018expertise\u2019 in general and \u2018modelling exercises\u2019 in particular. Context : Demographic projections show that Luxembourg will be increasingly confronted with an ageing population due to an increase of the life expectancy and a decrease of the fertility rate. The MiDLAS project therefore aimed to bring Luxembourg further on the path towards an integrated assessment of the budgetary and adequacy impacts of an ageing population as well as to identify obstacles to a reception of modelling approaches from stakeholders. Notable aspects of good practice : The project was conducted effectively and an innovative microsimulation model was developed. Although the project (the first of its kind in the country) was mainly targeting Luxembourg and Luxembourg\u2019s needs, it has helped to identify transferrable practices that could be implemented in other EU countries. Conclusion and follow-up : The dissemination and availability of the project\u2019s results to an expert and non-expert audience after the completion of projects or analyses was seen as essential. Moreover, the need for an open and well informed debate, as largely upstream as possible with regard the policy agenda, was underlined as one way to improve the stakeholders\u2019 receptivity vis-\u00e0-vis the external experts involved and the new tools implemented in the context of the MiDLAS project.

Other results included the development of a database for the analysis of Hungary\u2019s economic and employment history in the last decades, ensuring further versatile support for the decision-making process in the area of pension reform, for professional analysis as well as for informing the public. Based on the newly developed methodology, a cleaned dataset from the administrative database and model points were also created. Project description : The project led to the acceleration of the development of the dynamic microsimulation pension forecast model named MIDAS_HU. The other main objectives of the project included: 1) the preparation of an adminis- trative dataset easily accessible for analytical purposes; 2) the construction of model points to facilitate the analytical and modelling activity; 3) the further development of the forecast tools; and 4) the public dissemination of the results of model and the project. Context : The demand for pension forecast models has been increasing worldwide, including in Hungary. This is because these types of models are able to effectively supplement macro models, to present the micro effects on social groups detailing the macro-economic impacts and to analyse different profiles of careers and earning patterns. More and more countries have the necessary conditions available for constructing microsimulation models. These conditions consist of micro level \u2013 administrative or survey based \u2013 database as well as well-developed statistical methods and IT equipment for the forecast. Notable aspects of good practice : The project had a significant impact and added value. The MIDAS_HU model gave the possibility to analyse most pension structures in the world, therefore, making it a very practical and transferable tool. It also represented a direct support to governmental decision making process. The MIDAS_HU dynamic model also supported international comparative assessments using microsimulation methods and the cooperation of experts from different countries. Conclusion and follow-up : The model developed in the context of the project led to the creation of effective tools for the decision making process in the area of pension reform. Thanks to its abilities, the MIDAS_HU model can also strongly support the completion of international comparative analyses of pension systems. More information http://mikroszimulacio.onyf.hu/en/ ",

It also identified the areas with the biggest job potential for the future: the green economy, health services and ICT. This call was divided into the following areas: \u2022 Mutual learning in the field of skills and employment \u2022 EU Sector Skills Councils \u2022 Restructuring The objective of the first area was to encourage exchanges and mutual learning at all levels and to enhance the transferability of the most effective policies, good practices and innovative approaches to implement the skills dimension of the flagship initiative \u2018An Agenda for New Skills and Jobs \u2013 Equipping people with the right skills for employment\u2019 and the Employment Package Communication \u2018Towards a job-rich recovery\u2019. A large variety of actions could be financed under this area of the call: conferences, seminars, round tables, negotiations, studies, surveys, publications, monitoring exercises, and the development of promising practices. The area of EU sector skills councils supported the creation of EU Sector Councils on Employment and Skills when there is a demand for their creation from stakeholders, in particular from the European social partners. This area was further divided into two actions: 1. Exploratory step that was intended to perform an analysis of the feasibility of creating such a body at the European level (grants up to 100 000 euros); 2. The actual set up of an EU sector skills council (grants up to 300 000 euros). The area of Restructuring aimed to support the development and dissemination of better expertise and capabilities among the actors concerned in the areas of anticipation, preparation and the accompanying of socially responsible restructuring processes as highlighted in the Commission communication on \u2018Restructuring and employment \u2013 anticipa- ting and accompanying restructuring in order to develop employment: the role of the European Union\u2019 (COM(2005) 120 final) and subsequent policy documents, notably the Green Paper on \u2018Restructuring and anticipation of change: what lessons from recent experience?\u2019 (COM(2012) 7 final).

        "37 Results : The project achieved several positive results. Research activities were carried out at the level of implementation of EU policies on patient\u2019s safety and on health structures with an emergency department. The project led to an exchange of best practices/experiences among the partners by visiting four simulation centres and by exchanging knowledge on the training course programmes. A seminar with demonstrative visits and a final conference were also organised. Project description : The aim of the project was to foster the improvement of the practical skills of personnel working in emergency departments as well as of medical students in order to better respond to EU policies on patients\u2019 safety, occupational policies and women\u2019s inclusion. The project\u2019s specific objectives were: 1) to improve the competencies of health operators in the field of emergency medicine; 2) to stimulate the training of decision makers in the health sector using innovative training tools and methodologies; 3) to exchange best practices in the field of emergency medicine (mutual learning); and 4) to create new national and international job opportunities with a particular attention to women\u2019s inclusion. Context : In the last decades, reports of \u2018malpractices\u2019 in the area of emergency medicine have been increasing in Europe. Studies have tried to assess the impact of errors and of \u2018adverse events\u2019 occurring in hospitals and to provide data on how they could be avoided. Some analysis showed that around 70% of medical errors are caused by \u2018human factors\u2019. It has become essential to define new care process mechanisms which include a \u2018safety culture\u2019 dimension. Clinical education based on innovative methodologies such as simulations that allows the development of skills related to the analysis and management of complex situations are considered to be complementary to patients\u2019 safety policies. Notable aspects of good practice : The project had a strong and sustainable impact at the occupational level and developed technologically innovative practices in the health sector. The project helped to improve the skills of the involved emergency personnel through the promotion of innovative training tools. Moreover, the project contributed to the implementation of the principles of the Europe 2020 strategy as it fostered employment opportunities in partner and other EU Countries as well as contributed to gender equality. Finally, the project helped to identify transferrable innovative measures which could be used and reproduced elsewhere. Conclusion and follow-up: The project\u2019s information tools, such as its internal database and final publication on best practices in the field of patients\u2019 safety with a focus on emergency departments, are accessible information sources for all. They contributed to facilitate knowledge transferability on \u2018simulation technologies\u2019 in order to achieve the project\u2019s long term objectives. ",

        "39 Results : The project\u2019s primary result is a catalogue of skills and qualifications aimed to enrich the knowledge of workers in Geothermal and Solar Systems and to be used as a teaching and learning aid for training institutions. The second main result of the project was the creation of a sectoral network, the Project Network, which is also the official owner of the skills catalogue. Project description : The aim of the GSSkills project was to improve the efficiency and adequacy of existing training practices in the field of green installations and in particular that of geothermal and solar ones, and to promote training for low skilled workers in related professional sectors. More specifically, the project aimed to: 1) identify appropriate skills needed for workers to meet needs of Geothermal and Solar Installation Specialists; 2) identify best practices in promoting training; and 3) create a network among education institutions, public authorities, professional associations and the business community in the field of Geothermal and Solar Installations in the four partner countries. Context : The EU\u2019s strategy for sustainable growth and jobs, Europe 2020, puts innovation and green growth at the heart of its blueprint for competitiveness. In order to adapt faster, an environmentally-skilled workforce is essential. More and better skills have become increasingly needed for the European labour force, as they make it easier to innovate, adopt new green technologies, attract investment, compete in new markets, and diversify the economy. Notable aspects of good practice : In improving the quality of and unifying qualifications in the area of Geothermal and Solar Systems, the GSSkills project had a considerable sustainable impact, allowing greater transferability in the workforce and facilitating the career development of its participants. Furthermore, the catalogue of skills and qualifications developed in the context of the project could help to reduce the unemployment rate, stimulate the economy as well as regional competitiveness. Finally, the project\u2019s tools could be adapted to different contexts and transferred to other Member States. Conclusion and follow-up: In the long term, the skills catalogue could become the basis for a certification system for Geothermal and Solar Installations workers\u2019 skills. Also, in the long run, the project could help to facilitate an intensive cooperation between stakeholders in the sectors of Geothermal and Solar Systems. More information http://www.gs-skills.gr/ ",

        "41 Results : Meeting at least twice a year, the European Sectoral Skills Council (ESSC) for Commerce was conducting activities based on four pillars: \u2022 Harmonisation: aiming at deeper interaction with other skills, employment and training-related EU initiatives and instruments through networking activities; \u2022 Development of sectoral knowledge: research and analytical work carried out in order to gather and produce reliable sectoral intelligence in the field of employment and training; \u2022 Involvement & awareness: enlarging the Council\u2019s network to new stakeholders in the countries currently covered and in new Member States; \u2022 Final Conference: concluding the yearly work programme, raising awareness on the issues addressed, presenting the reports produced and formulating recommendations to key sectorial stakeholders, the press and the public. Project description: The main objective of this project was to launch and conduct the first year of activities of the European Sectoral Skills Council for Commerce. The Council aimed at improving the level and quality of education, skills and employment in the EU\u2019s commerce-related industries by anticipating the future skills\u2019 needs and labour shortages. This core objective was pursued through an effective networking of the National Industry Skills Partnerships and of the EU Social partners of the Commerce sector, as well as through facilitating decision-making on education and training issues in the sector at European, national, regional and company levels. Context : Greater competition, complex supply chains, demographic change, increased migration, changing consumer and media trends, changing technologies, difficulty of attracting young persons and skilled workers have become important challenges for the commerce sector. Skills and competencies of the workforce constitute a significant factor to ensure the sector\u2019s long-term sustainability. Ensuring the competitiveness of the European commerce sector while enhancing the quality of jobs was therefore one of the key objectives of the ESSC Commerce project. Notable aspects of good practice : The ESSC Commerce project helped to identify a series of best practices of innovative tools, national, regional and local strategies and initiatives. These best practices aimed at meeting skills\u2019 needs, developing new qualifications, recognising prior learning, coordinating stakeholders, dealing with the increasing use of e-commerce, facing the challenge of \u2018multi-channel\u2019 retailing, analysing the conditions for transferability, analysing the criteria for successful strategies and addressing the skills\u2019 gaps. Conclusion and follow-up: The practice and experience of the partner organisations in the project showed that the solution to the improvement of the level and quality of education, skills and employment in the EU\u2019s commerce-related industries can be found only by the joint efforts of the relevant stakeholders and social partners. The project led to the creation of a dedicated website and established a European Network of \u2018ESSC Partners\u2019. The main task of the Network consists in the identification and sharing of knowledge and good practices on the current state and needs of stakeholders in the Commerce sector as well as on education, training and skills at European level.

        "44 Results : The RIDE project helped to train 75 trade unionists from Belgium, Hungary, Italy and Slovenia on the phenomena related to transnational posting of workers and control procedures. The project allowed to update data on the phenomena of social dumping and unfair competition in the four Member States involved. An operating manual for control and reference for each Member State involved was published on a newly created multilingual web platform including information on standards, contracts and procedures of the respective countries. Finally, a research report was presented during the project\u2019s final conference and made available on the websites of the project\u2019s partners. Project description : The RIDE Project (Rights Without Borders) aimed at developing the skills of labour unions professionals, administrators and inspectors of the ministries of labour and social security institutions from four EU countries. The project enabled them to implement control and coordination procedures to ensure that the fundamental rights of posted workers are respected and to counter phenomena such as social dumping and unfair competition among enterprises. The project supported the implementation and dissemination of the Posting of Workers Directive (96/71/EC) which foresees the obligation of cooperation between Member States. Context : While worker mobility is increasing across the EU, the Posting of Workers Directive plays an essential role in terms of fair competition, respect for workers\u2019 rights and labour law. However, there is a lack of communication among the relevant stakeholders on the rights and working conditions of posted workers throughout the EU. Notable aspects of good practice : The project has effectively achieved its objectives. It developed good practices which could be transferred to other sectors and environments. A first core of state officers and labour union representatives daily involved in the posted work issues were successfully trained, allowing them to transfer their skills and knowledge to their colleagues. A European operative network of trade unionists has been established, which will assist state officers and trade unionists in the development of their work. Finally, a cooperative environment has been established with relevant institutions in all the Member States involved. Conclusion and follow-up : The dissemination of the project\u2019s results was ensured by the organisation of four national workshops and the participation of European level organizations. This helped to raise workers\u2019 awareness of the issues related to the posting of workers and of procedures and solutions for safeguarding their rights. Moreover, studies and research reports were promoted with institutions, civil society, research centres and universities over the EU. A research project based on the RIDE project findings is currently being carried out by the University Federico II of Naples, supported by 10 other European universities. ",
        "45 Project title Posting of workers: enhancing administrative cooperation and access to information in Baltic region Identification of the call VP/2013/008 Project identification number VS/2014/0011 Policy area Employment Policy sub-area Posting of workers Type of activity Website development Direct target groups Employment services, social partners, public authorities Ultimate target groups Lithuanian, Latvian, and Estonian employers, workers, and competent public authorities Participating countries Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania EU contribution (Euros) 301 235.72 Project duration 30 December 2013-27 February 2015 (14 months) Beneficiary Lietuvos profesin\u0117 s\u0105junga \"Solidarumas\" (Lithuanian trade union \"Solidarity\"), Lithuania Partners Eesti Ameyiuhingute Keskliit (Estonian Trade Union Confederation), Estonia Latvijas Celtnieku arodbiedr\u012bba (Latvian Builders Trade union), Latvia Latvijas Krist\u012bg\u0101 Akad\u0113mija (Latvian Christian Academy), Latvia Valstybin\u0117 darbo inspekcija (State labour inspectorate of the Republic of Lithuania), Lithuania Vilniaus miesto ir apskrities verslininku darbdaviu konfederacija (Vilnius City and County Business Employers Confederation), Lithuania V\u0161\u012e Projekt\u0173 valdymo ir mokymo centras (non-profit organization), Lithuania 16) Posting of workers: enhancing administrative cooperation and access to information in Baltic region ",
        "46 Results : The main outcome of the project was to provide information and practical advice to employers\u2019 and employees\u2019 representatives from Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia concerning the understanding of regulatory requirements regarding posting of workers in the EU. The project helped to enhance the implementation, application and enforcement of the Posting of Workers Directive (96/71/EC). Specifically, the project helped to prepare training materials for social partners, provided a study on how to improve the posting system, supported the creation of an educational film, led to the creation of a dedicated website and to the organisation of several round tables, training sessions, informative events, international conferences and practical consultations in the sectors of transport and services. Project description : The main objectives of the project was to inform and advice social partners, employers and responsible public institutions, establish a partnership network for current and future cooperation, exchange information on issues related to posting of workers of the national institutions, employers\u2019 and workers\u2019 representatives from the Baltic States. The project specifically aimed at: 1) ensuring proper cooperation between public authorities and social partners from the three participating countries; 2) providing information on posting of workers issues to stakeholders; 3) creating practical information measures and materials; and 4) ensuring the transparency of the information on applicable terms and conditions of employment, and proper implementation and enforcement of the Posting of Workers Directive. Context : Aimed to ensure the trans-national provision of services throughout the EU, the posting of workers system allows a worker sent by his employer on a temporary basis to carry out his work in another Member State without a special work permit. However, this system has produced a number of risks and issues that the project intended to explore in cooperation with the respective institutions responsible for informing and consulting with employees and social partners in the three participating countries. Notable aspects of good practice : The project achieved its objectives in enhancing the implementation, application and enforcement of the Posting of Workers Directive. Activities implemented in the framework of the project stimulated sharing of best practices, capacity-building of social partners and testing of innovative policies in the three Baltic States. The cooperation established between the partner countries and organisations will be sustained via the partnership network created. Through the active collaboration established between the different actors involved, the project shall make an impact across the EU. The issues tackled are of international nature and the findings of the project could therefore be transferred to other Member States. Conclusion and follow-up : From March 2015 the Lithuanian trade union \u2018Solidarity\u2019 started to implement a new project \u2013 \u2018Posting of workers: enhancing access to information and effective practical collaboration of administrative and social partners among 3 Baltic States\u2019. This new project is a continuation of the former, facing the gaps identified during the first project and ensuring continuity of strong and successful cooperation between the participating organizations of the three Baltic States. It should enable practical cooperation between the participating countries in information exchange between authorities and social partners and enable the effective information availability to companies and posted workers themselves.
