        "6 \u201c \u201d Support to justice, security and the rule of law is a key mechanism for promot- ing democratic governance, gender equality and respect for human rights. In particular, reform in these sectors can play a crucial role in re-building communities after conflict, and assisting countries in their social, political and economic development. It also helps foster a culture of global responsibil- ity, where national authorities strive to fulfil their regional and international justice and cooperation obligations. The 2007 Treaty of Lisbon, which entered into force in 2009, makes the European Charter of Funda- mental Rights binding upon European institutions in their internal and external policies. This means that the European Union has a legal obligation to ensure that in all its actions, it promotes and re- spects the human rights and freedoms enshrined in the Charter. In addition, the Common Security and Defence Policy, which is a key element of foreign and security policy of the European Union, stressed the importance of an integrated approach combin- ing both military and civilian institutions. For many decades, the EU had already been pro- viding support throughout the world relative to the rule of law, and justice and security. It uses a num- ber of different funding modalities, in cooperation with national and international institutions, project partners, donors, and beneficiaries. These interven- tions are based on specific agreements, strategy papers, and planning documents. The EU aims to align with and build upon existing structures in partner countries, and has embarked on a process of improving its approaches, through problem solving and service delivery. This is intend- ed to provide not only institutional support, but also empower citizens and strengthen accountability. Justice, security and rule of law issues can seem complex to those without specific training. This booklet is intended to provide user-friendly infor- mation on EU support to the rule of law, and justice and security sector reform. It aims to provide guid- ance to authorities and individuals with an interest in these issues, including staff at EU headquarters in Brussels and in its delegations throughout the world, by placing them within society\u2019s broader context, and hence making them more relevant and immediate. This booklet first describes a number of key con- cepts, and explains how these are interlinked. It explains EU approaches and support in the justice and security sectors, which form the basis for in- formed political and community dialogue, and in turn guide the design and implementation of projects. It describes the main difficulties encoun- tered, and gives examples of strategies that can be used to overcome obstacles. It provides recom- mendations concerning justice and security sector support, based on direct EU experiences. Finally, it provides a list of additional sources of information, arranged by subject matter. This is of particular importance, since it is hoped that the booklet will serve as a springboard to further reflection, dia- logue and action. Kristian SCHMIDT Director DEVCO D May 2012 FoREwoRD ",

        "8 EuropeAid is a Directorate\u2013General of the European Commission. EuropeAid is responsible for designing EU development policies and delivering aid through programmes and projects throughout the world. EuropeAid reinforces the ability of the EU to design state-of-the-art development policy for all devel- oping countries, and enhances policy coherence for development, while further improving implementa- tion and delivery mechanisms. EuropeAid plays a leading role in the international debate for devel- opment involving donors, international institutions, developing and emerging countries and non-State actors. EuropeAid delivers external aid through a set of ge- ographic and thematic financial instruments with a focus on ensuring the quality and effectiveness of its aid. . An active and proactive player in the de- velopment field, EuropeAid promotes good govern- ance and human and economic development, and tackles universal issues, such as fighting hunger and preserving natural resources. EuropeAid implements programmes and projects quickly and efficiently to where it is most needed, tailoring its support to fit the region or country be- ing supported. Programmes with a global reach al- low the EU to provide similar support to countries facing similar problems. It carries out a careful analysis before committing funding, undertakes rigorous checks to ensure that money is spent effectively, and monitors activities to ensure they meet quality standards. Unit D1 of Development and Co-operation Directo- rate-General\u2013 EuropeAid (DEVCo D1), which initi- ated and published this booklet, is a sub-section of one of nine departments administered under Euro- peAid. DEVCo D1 ensures the external dimension of Good Governance, Democracy, Gender and Human Rights. These sectors include numerous interlinked issues, such as rule of law including justice and security, electoral assistance, women's rights and role in development, rights of the persons belong- ing to minorities, and LGBTI and children's rights.

        "10 The justice sector is a key part of national govern- ance, has a strong influence on international and legal relations, and plays a crucial role in people\u2019s everyday lives. However there is no single definition or unified application of the concept. The United Nations has defined the concept of jus- tice as \u201csubstantive and procedural protections and guarantees for civil, political, economic, and social rights, and protection from unjust penal sanctions\u201d. This definition includes formal state mechanisms, such as the judiciary, and informal non-state mech- anisms that administer traditional and customary justice. The European Union does not have its own definition and has not yet developed a specific pol- icy for justice sector support and reform. However, the EU approach in development cooperation is reflected by the European Consensus on Develop- ment and more recently by the Agenda for Change. The justice sector includes several structures that enforce rights and obligations, in the criminal, civil, administrative, and customary spheres. This in- cludes courts, law enforcement and prisons, human rights institutions, administrative departments, and legal professionals such as judges, lawyers, court officials, and traditional authorities. The precise structure of the justice system will again vary from country to country, however most countries have several \u201clayers\u201d of courts, and often specialised courts, which are referred to as jurisdictions. A jurisdiction of first instance usually deals with minor civil or criminal matters. There are then usu- ally one or two \u201chigher\u201d jurisdictions that try more complex or serious disputes or crimes. In additional to these \u201cordinary\u201d courts are often specialised ju- risdictions that hear, for example, family disputes, work disputes, or complaints against the state administration. Many countries have special legal or quasi-legal structures that decide, for example, constitutional or human rights issues. Most legal systems have one or more appeal jurisdictions, through which the parties to a legal case can seek the reconsideration of a decision by a lower court, either because the law was incorrectly interpreted, or because the particular circumstances of the case were not adequately taken into account. What is the justice sector? KEy CoNCEPTS ",
        "11 KEy CoNCEPTS The most common definition of the security sec- tor, or system, is provided by the organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (oECD), which refers to all entities that play a role in the security of the State and its people. This includes: What is the security sector? \u2022 State institutions with a formal mandate to ensure the safety of the State and its citizens against violence and coercion. This includes armed forces, police, paramilitary forces, intel- ligence services, border guards, customs authorities, etc.; \u2022 Civil authorities appointed for the control and oversight of these institutions. This includes the parliament, ministries of defence, interior and foreign affairs, national security agencies, and certain non-state actors; \u2022 Criminal justice agencies. This includes ministries of justice, prosecutorial and investigation services, the judiciary and courts, human rights institutions, and traditional and customary justice authorities; \u2022 Unofficial security forces. This includes non-state bodies, private forces, and militias. Security sector reform assists in the creation of a stable environment for democracy, development, and poverty reduction. In addition, there are direct links between internal and external security, as well as between security and conflict prevention and peace building. The EU considers that the concept of security goes beyond the territorial integrity of States and insti- tutions, to include the status of people, with the State being obliged to support human well-being, sound public policy, and good governance. This is reflected in the concept of \"Human Security\", which places people at the heart of security sector concerns, using a broader social perspective. This means that States should guarantee not only law, order, and strategic security interests, but also fun- damental freedoms, including protection against violations by the State itself. In short, there is no development without peace and security in their most holistic sense. The EU therefore considers that the objectives of development, democracy, human rights, good governance and security are intertwined. Citizen security is also a concept used to describe both freedom from physical violence and freedom from fear of violence. It encompasses security at home, in the workplace and in political, social and economic interactions with the state and other members of society. Similar to human security, \"citizen security\" places people at the centre of ef- forts to prevent and recover from violence. Thus, measures to fight national crimes and trans- national crimes (such as terrorism, organised crime, drug or human trafficking, and money laundering) must also respect human rights. Security institu- tions cannot threaten or obstruct liberties such as protection from arbitrary arrest or detention, and due process of law in criminal cases. ",

        "13 KEy CoNCEPTS The United Nations describes the rule of law as: \u201cA principle of governance in which all persons, institutions, and en- tities, public and private, including the State itself, are accountable to laws that are publicly promulgated, equally en- forced, and independently adjudicated, and which are consistent with interna- tional human rights norms and stand- ards.\u201d Luxor Court, Egypt ",
        "14 The rule of law is a set of laws, policies and practices based on the principle that law is supreme, and that therefore government and people should act according to law. The concept can be traced back into the early history of many cultures around the world. The rule of law is fulfilled where the following exist: Supremacy of law means that no person is \u2013 or can be \u2013 above the law, and is closely related to the concept of equality before the law. It is usually ensured through procedural rights and responsibilities, which are categorised as due process of law. What is the rule of law? Constitutional or fundamental laws have supremacy over regular laws Law has priority over the power of individuals, including leaders and officials The Lisbon Treaty places rule of law amongst the values upon which the European Union is founded, and makes it a guiding principle for external relations. Although the EU has not developed a uniform definition, its cooperation with third countries reflects the following priority areas: \u2022 Promoting and protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms; \u2022 Establishing an independent judiciary and modern justice system; \u2022 Strengthening the institutional and administrative capacity of justice institutions; \u2022 Promoting good governance and accountability through fighting corruption, illegality and abuse of power by authorities; \u2022 Modernising the criminal justice system, for example through respect of parties' rights, improved prison conditions, and sentencing reforms; \u2022 Supporting civilian oversight of the justice system. The principle of the separation of powers, described in Justice above, is an essential ingredient of the rule of law. The judiciary must have basic guarantees of autonomy and independence if it is to fulfil its role in the protection of human rights. where the executive branch or legislative branch, or other individuals or entities, are allowed to exert undue influence over the judiciary, this invariably compromises its impartiality, effectiveness, efficiency and credibility.

        "15 KEy CoNCEPTS What is access to justice and legal empowerment? Access to justice refers to right of all citizens (re- ferred to as rights holders), no matter how poor or disadvantaged, to seek remedies for injustice, not only in law but also in practice. Support to the justice sector must therefore adopt an Access to Justice approach, which focuses on justice needs, in particular those of vulnerable people or marginal- ised groups, and addressing the obstacles encoun- tered in seeking justice. This approach has three objectives: \u2022 To empower rights holders to access and utilise state and non-state institutions that are most relevant for claiming a right or obtaining redress; \u2022 To empower rights holders to demand relevant reform of justice institutions; \u2022 To strengthen the capacity of these institutions to deliver justice. Each national context is unique, and different jus- tice needs may be addressed through different institutional setups. An access to justice interven- tion may be directed at traditional justice systems, provided that its purpose is to increase compliance with human rights norms and to reaffirm state re- sponsibility for ensuring that they conform to such norms. Access to justice is affected by a combination of elements, including: \u2022 The number of courts, types of courts, and their geographic distribution. Greater territorial cover- age and specialisation make it easier for parties to take their cases to court; \u2022 The number and distribution of legal profession- als, and possibilities for outreach. Court pro- ceedings depend upon the availability of judges, prosecutors, lawyers, and court officials. In some countries, legal professionals work in rural areas on a rotation basis, or are deployed for special purposes (mobile courts); \u2022 The length and costs of proceedings. If filing fees and court expenses are high, and proceedings take many years, this creates a serious impedi- ment for people of limited means, and under- mines the efficiency and credibility of the Court system; \u2022 The availability of legal aid services. Access to legal counsel is a pre-requisite for access to jus- tice. This should be financed by the State, and delivered by lawyers acting in a pro bono capac- ity, or through institutional arrangements such as legal aid or independent public defenders; \u2022 The role of civil society. Civil society organisa- tions often provide legal information, legal ser- vices, and support for disadvantaged parties facing the criminal justice system. An important role of civil society is also to monitor and ensure institutions are held accountable for their com- mitments regarding access to justice; \u2022 Access to information. Access to justice is in- variably compromised by lack of access to in- formation. Courts can play an important role in providing information, through bulletin boards, transparency of court fees, public access to com- puter terminals, dedicated court personnel, etc.; \u2022 Alternative dispute resolution, traditional justice mechanisms, and religious authorities. These systems can be actively engaged in enhancing access to justice, particularly when the jurisdic- tion of official courts is limited by time, subject- matter or geography. ",
        "16 \u201cOrder is law, and it is more proper that law should govern, than any one of the citizens: upon the same principle, if it is advantageous to place the supreme power in some particular persons, they should be appointed to be only guard- ians, and the servants of the laws\u201d.

        "18 What is traditional, customary and religious justice? Traditional, customary, or religious justice mecha- nisms are of primary importance in many develop- ing countries. Authorities include traditional judges, tribal or community chiefs, local elders, and reli- gious leaders. They provide access to justice and security through unofficial dispute resolution be- tween parties located in smaller communities, or those sharing common customs, languages, and beliefs. They provide streamlined procedures, fa- miliarity, proximity, low cost, speed, common lan- guage, community involvement, and the likelihood that decisions are based on community values. while religious authorities may have exclusive or shared jurisdiction over certain subject matters, such as family-related issues, traditional justice institutions are not usually recognised by the offi- cial legal and court systems. However this does not diminish their importance in practice, particularly at the community level and for specific groups such as indigenous peoples. Indeed, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples states that indigenous peoples have the right to their own institutional structures and customs and, where they exist, juridical systems. Such recognition means that the state accepts the existence of legal pluralism, that is, the validity of other legal systems other than that of the state. This requires coordination between the traditional justice system and the ordinary justice system; such coordination is in many countries regulated through special laws. Traditional and religious laws and justice systems should however be in accord- ance with international human rights standards. In some countries, traditional, customary, or reli- gious authorities exercise so much influence, over such well-defined geographical areas, and for so long, that they can be considered primary rather than alternative forms of dispute resolution. Tradi- tional justice systems tend to lack laws and rules of procedure, are informal by nature and have an oral tradition, take place in rural areas outside of the purview of the official legal system, and are strongly influenced by socio-cultural factors. At the same time it is often more accessible in regard to geographic, financial, cultural, language and un- derstanding of the proceedings. Religious justice is by contrast often hierarchical, well structured, and meticulously documented. This can however make it resistant to outside influences. Cultural and anthropological characteristics can affect traditional, customary, and religious justice, particularly with respect to indigenous peoples and isolated communities. Popular acceptance is a cru- cial attribute of these systems, which often enjoy an extremely close relationship with their commu- nities. KEy CoNCEPTS ",
        "19 KEy CoNCEPTS What is transitional justice? The UN describes transitional justice as \"the full range of processes and mechanisms associated with a society\u2019s attempts to come to terms with a legacy of large-scale past abuses, in order to en- sure accountability, serve justice and achieve rec- onciliation\u201d. Transitional justice plays an important role in frag- ile countries or those emerging from conflict, where the State may be unable to maintain law and or- der, administer the court system, or protect human rights. These circumstances can require extraordi- nary measures, such as new institutions that as- sume State obligations, which exist for a limited period until long-term measures can be put in place. The EU does not have a common definition of transitional justice, however it provides consid- erable support to transitional justice processes in Europe and elsewhere. The international community has established specific tribunals to deal with serious crimes that have taken place in a particular country to region, for example the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former yugoslavia. These courts, in addition to the creation of the International Criminal Court (see below), form part of a spectrum of transitional mechanisms. However transitional justice can also include human rights commissions, or truth and reconciliation proceedings, such as those created in South Africa in the post-apartheid era. Vetting commissions, which help prevent perpetrators from assuming official positions, are another example. Restorative justice is a related concept, which fo- cuses on redressing harm done to the victims, hold- ing offenders accountable for their actions, and engaging the community in peace-building efforts. Reparation programmes, for example, have been adopted in many countries in order to compensate victims and communities for the harm suffered. Traditional justice systems can be mobilised to participate in the transitional process. In the aftermath of the genocide in Rwanda in 1994, and faced with a huge number of pris- oners accused of serious crimes, and a des- perate shortage of courts and legal profes- sionals available to hear cases, a temporary and alternative criminal justice system was established, with EU and other international support. The Gacaca (pronounced ga-cha- cha) tribunals, which existed from 1996 to 2006, were based on principles taken from both official and traditional justice systems, and were established at the local level by communities that had experienced appall- ing crimes. Eligible defendants \u2013 for exam- ple, those who were not considered to have participated in the planning of the geno- cide \u2013 could decide if they were willing to be tried in this manner. Chosen commu- nity leaders would preside over hearings, which were held in open spaces. Hearings were highly participative and relatively informal, with all villagers having the op- portunity to tell the tribunal of events they had witnessed. Those found guilty could be sentenced to imprisonment, but could not receive the death penalty, which existed in national law at the time. The Gacaca courts tried approximately 10,000 pris- oners. By some estimates, it would have taken the ordinary Rwandan legal system over 100 years to achieve the same result. ",
        "20 What is the context for justice sector reform? The justice sector cannot be considered in isolation. It is an integral and integrated component of the State, and affects all aspects of its development. Justice sector reform can therefore encompass a broad range of responses and approaches, includ- ing legislative change, and strengthening institu- tions, or even creating new ones. Reform must al- ways be tailored to each individual context, taking into account a number of specific aspects: The justice needs of the people: Reform should be based on a careful analysis of the specific needs of people, since the reasons they are denied access to justice vary from one context to another. obstacles should be identified, and strategies and mecha- nisms for their removal should be developed. These should be based on a system-wide perspective. The type and nature of the legal system: Each country has a legal system that is based on its own specific laws and institutional structures. The three branches of state described above may be very dif- ferent from one country to another, and indeed may not exist in this form at all, or may be arranged under a complex federalist system. Legal systems are also affected by intricate historical, political, ge- ographic, and cultural concerns, and hence reform must take into account varying legal traditions, and the different legal system categories, which include Common Law, Civil Law, and traditional, religious and mixed systems. The level of development: Justice sector reform is directly affected by the level of development in each country, and should take into consideration the country\u2019s historical origins, its economy and resources, various sociological factors such as cul- tural and linguistic diversity, and the strength of the State. The political situation: Given that the justice sec- tor is at the heart of a society\u2019s power structures, reform must take full account of this inherent po- litical sensitivity, and the forces that may resist, for example, judicial independence. National priorities: Justice sector reform is largely dependent on national priorities, which establish the framework for its implementation. In turn, these priorities depend on the overall development con- text and the country\u2019s specific circumstances, such as post-conflict situations. The socio-cultural context: The justice sector is af- fected by a variety of social elements, including so- cial and personal values, cultural practices, working habits, and demography, which in turn will deter- mine how reform can be best implemented. National, regional and international dimensions: Justice sector reform is affected by a country\u2019s re- lationship to international law and organisations. National legislation must comply with international and regional obligations; governmental institutions interact with multilateral organisations and neigh- bouring countries; legal professionals are part of in- ternational and regional networks and information exchanges; and transitional justice mechanisms often rely upon foreign support.

        "22 The security sector is closely related to the justice sector. Both focus on and include several of the same institutions and actors (mainly criminal jus- tice authorities), such as the judiciary, courts, pros- ecution, investigation services, law enforcement bodies and the penitentiary system. Many of these institutions combine security and justice functions, and both sectors share functional duties such as securing the rights of state and of individuals in criminal cases. EU initiatives supporting security system reform therefore often include justice-re- lated components, and vice versa, to ensure these sectors function in a complementary manner. In spite of their commonalities, security and justice are still distinct concepts, and their exact relation- ship often depends on the specific country context, particularly whether justice institutions are fragile, or transitional measures are required, such as in post-conflict situations. In a similar manner, the justice and security sec- tors cannot be dissociated from the overall human rights situation at the country level, as they are the key vehicles for the protection and realisation of citizens' rights in democratic regimes, or the main repressive actors in authoritarian regimes. There- fore a strong focus on human rights is needed in all support initiatives within the justice sector. In a Human Rights Based Approach (HRBA), the individual is the subject of rights and has claims on the state and its institutions, which have duties and obligations. This is different from a needs ap- proach where there is no duty-bearer. The HRBA makes the accountability clear, since it identifies the rights holders and the duty-bearer, and enables support of the capacities of duty-bearers to meet their obligations, and/or of rights-holders to claim their rights. It also emphasises the importance of the governance principles of inclusion, participation, transparency and accountability. A Human Rights-Based Approach consists of as- sessing the adequacy of laws, policies and strate- gies addressing human rights, identifying the main human rights problems in general and in the justice area, fixing specific human rights objectives, and identifying services and service providers that can promote and protect human rights. The Approach then focuses on reinforcing the prime actors, so that they can engage in dialogue, meet their re- sponsibilities, and hold justice delivery mechanisms and state institutions accountable for their short- comings with respect to human rights. These may include legal and institutional reforms, capacity building and awareness-raising regarding human rights within legal institutions, advocacy activities, education and empowerment of vulnerable groups, and developing services and legal assistance. How are the justice and security sectors linked together, and to human rights and governance? INTERRELATIoNSHIPS ",
        "23 INTERRELATIoNSHIPS The justice and security sectors are also key ele- ments of democratic governance. while there is no internationally-agreed definition of governance, the EU considers that governance concerns the state\u2019s ability to serve its citizens, and refers to the rules, processes, and behaviours by which interests are expressed, resources are managed, and power is exercised in a society. This concept is anchored in a number of universal principles, including respect of human rights; support to democratisation process- es; rule of law and access to independent justice systems; access to information; transparency and accountability; human security; effective institu- tions; access to basic social services; sustainable management of natural and energy resources; and the promotion of sustainable economic growth and social cohesion. The EU has identified six components of good gov- ernance, all of which are affected by, and in some instances depend upon, the sound and efficient functioning of the justice sector: \u2022 Support for democratisation, creation of demo- cratic systems, and free and fair electoral pro- cesses; \u2022 Promotion and protection of human rights; \u2022 Reinforcement of the rule of law and the admin- istration of justice; \u2022 Enhancement of the role and capacity of civil so- ciety; \u2022 Public administration reform; \u2022 Decentralisation, including reform and capacity building for local government institutions. Corruption can undermine attempts to reform the justice and security sectors, and diminish the op- eration and credibility of the sector as a whole. Cor- ruption in the justice sector undermines its capac- ity and moral authority for addressing and fighting corruption in other sectors of society. This in turn has highly detrimental effects on national develop- ment, economic activity, and citizens\u2019 overall wel- fare. Corruption should be addressed in a holistic manner, to include related issues of transparency, accountability, participation, and access to informa- tion. The EU implemented the project Activating Village Courts in Bangladesh from 2007 to 2012. The overall objective of the pro- ject was to improve access to justice for disadvantaged and marginalised groups, and enhancing human rights systems and processes in Bangladesh. The project used a Human Rights-Based Approach in order to promote and protect human rights and security. This project illustrated sound use of the approach, because it linked the con- solidation of Village Courts (formal institu- tions established at the rural level in Un- ion Parishads) with legal reform, capacity building for elected governmental officials and policemen, and raising awareness of citizens, including concerning gender is- sues. The project also included evaluation of court performance through the develop- ment of monitoring, inspection, and evalu- ation procedures on the part of the Minis- try of Local Governance. ",

        "26 As indicated earlier, states must respect an in- creasing number of international and regional obligations, and adapt their national justice and security systems accordingly. Countries emerging from periods of conflict or tyranny must often ad- dress the consequences of severe and systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law. A Accountability is increasingly sought at the inter- national level, when national systems are unable or unwilling to try individuals for crimes they may have committed. In the 1990s, the protracted war in the Balkans and the genocide in Rwanda spurred the international community to create two international courts, the UN International Criminal Tribunal for the Former yugoslavia, and the UN International Criminal Tri- bunal for Rwanda. These were the first international justice initiatives since the Nuremburg and Tokyo war Crimes Trials, held after the Second world war. These two ad hoc tribunals were soon followed by other hybrid courts, including the Special Court for Sierra Leone, the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, and the Special Tribunal for Lebanon. In addition, certain countries have also applied the principle of universal jurisdiction, which allows third-party states to try individuals, regard- less of nationality or country of residence, who are accused of serious human rights violations, includ- ing war crimes and crimes against humanity. An important milestone in the rapid evolution of international justice was the creation of the Inter- national Criminal Court (ICC) after the entry into force of the Rome Statute. The ICC is a permanent international and independent tribunal based in The Hague, which was established to investigate, pros- ecute and try individuals accused of committing the crime of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. The EU has been a staunch supporter of the ICC, and all EU Member States have ratified the Rome Statute. These international justice initiatives represent crucial steps in the fight against impunity. They demonstrate that the international community is prepared to react, in a concrete and enforceable manner, to better protect humanity from atrocity. This can have very concrete impacts at the national level. It serves to sensitise authorities and citizens concerning their country\u2019s international obligations relative to human rights, and it can provide strong incentives to prevent abuses, or to stop them. In- ternational justice mechanisms can form a crucial component of conflict prevention, peace-building and community reconstruction. It can also help in- spire overall justice reform, to bring national insti- tutions in line with international standards. How is national justice linked to international justice? INTERRELATIoNSHIPS ",
        "27 INTERRELATIoNSHIPS The Rome Statute, which establishes the ICC, pro- vides that it is the duty of every State to exercise its criminal jurisdiction over those responsible for the crime of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. Effective prosecution can only be ensured by taking appropriate measures at the na- tional level, and by enhancing international coop- eration. without strengthening domestic prosecu- tion of the most serious crimes, there is a high risk that a culture of impunity will prevail and victims will not receive justice. The ICC is complementary to national criminal jurisdictions. only when a State Party to the Rome Statute is unwilling or unable to carry out the investigation or prosecution of these crimes shall the ICC have jurisdiction. Therefore the ICC is a court of last resort, which is described as the \u201cprinciple of complementarity\u201d. In addition to the principle of complementarity de- scribed above, the main features of the ICC can be summarised as follows: \u2022 Independent: The ICC was established by an in- ternational treaty, the Rome Statute, which en- tered into force on 1 July 2002. There is no spe- cial mandate given by the UN, and it is funded by individual contributions from its States Parties; \u2022 No universal jurisdiction: The ICC can only exer- cise jurisdiction in clearly defined situations. The Rome Statute empowers the Court to exercise jurisdiction only with respect to crimes: \u2022 Committed within the territory of a State Party; or \u2022 Committed by a national of a State Party; or \u2022 Committed within a non-State Party\u2019s territory or by one of its nationals, if referred to the Court by that non-State Party; or \u2022 Referred to the Court for prosecution by the UN Security Council; and \u2022 Committed since the entry into force of the Rome Statute; \u2022 Only the most serious crimes: The jurisdiction of the ICC is limited to the most serious crimes of concern to the international community on the whole, including genocide, crimes against hu- manity and war crimes; \u2022 Individual criminal responsibility: The ICC only prosecutes and tries individuals, including heads of state or government, and does not try groups or States. Amnesties granted at the national level cannot be used to prevent the Court from exercising its jurisdiction. This is consistent with the Court\u2019s objective of investigating and prose- cuting those who bear the greatest responsibility for international crimes. The principle of complementarity provides a unique opening to support the national security and justice sectors in countries where violations of the Rome Statute have occurred, since the inability of states to prosecute is often the obstacle to having justice done \u2013 and seen to be done \u2013 in the communities most affected. In some cases, parallel proceedings in the situation country and in the ICC can realis- tically occur. The principle of complementarity is most likely to be put into practice by ensuring the necessary political will of the national authorities, and other measures such as: \u2022 Strengthening judicial and prosecutorial institu- tions; \u2022 Improving the court system and case manage- ment for criminal cases; \u2022 Restoring the legal system in fragile or post- conflict countries; \u2022 International judicial cooperation in criminal matters.

        "29 The Treaty on European Union establishes democ- racy, the rule of law, and respect for human rights as fundamental values upon which the European Union is based, and as objectives that should be promoted through relations with the rest of the world. The EU is one of the largest donors in the area of governance, justice and the rule of law. The 2011 European Commission Communication Increasing the impact of EU development Policy: an Agenda for Change emphasises that the objectives of development, democracy, human rights, good governance and security are intertwined, and plac- es support to human rights, democracy and other key elements of good governance at the centre of EU development cooperation. In addition, the 2011 European Commission Communication The Future Approach to EU Budget Support to Third Countries stresses that commitment to the fundamental val- ues of human rights, democracy and rule of law is essential for the establishment of any partnership and cooperation between the EU and third coun- tries. Hence justice, security, and rule of law are at the core of European Union objectives and operations, objectives that are constantly being reiterated, up- dated and reinforced. The EU, through the European Commission, uses a set of geographical and thematic financial instru- ments, to carry out justice sector initiatives in part- ner countries. within these instruments, the support provided will vary, depending on the type of pro- gramme agreed upon with host governments. All geographical Instruments are based on regional coverage. In the justice sector, they are used to support reforms that are targeted according to the political and socio-economic context and the status of development in the countries concerned. All the relevant financing instruments are being reviewed for the new multi-annual financing period of 2014- 2020, also mirroring the EU policy commitments to the fundamental values of human rights, democ- racy and rule of law. The European Development Fund (EDF) is the main instrument for providing EU aid for development cooperation in the African, Caribbean and Pacific states and overseas countries and territories. It has been used constantly since it was launched in 1959, through a series financing agreements of around five years each. The focus of justice sec- tor interventions under the EDF has evolved over time, however this focus has been significantly rein- forced in recent years. The ninth EDF for the period 2000 \u2013 2007 emphasised institutional reforms to strengthen the judiciary and justice sector strate- gies; improve judicial efficiency and reinforce fair trial rights; improve prison management and con- ditions; promote alternative sentencing provisions, and raise awareness. The tenth EDF (2008 \u2013 2013) focuses on access to justice, including work on le- gal aid systems, decentralisation of legal services, greater involvement of non-state actors and civil society, improved oversight and monitoring of the justice system, enhanced management of human resources, and supporting gender equality and mi- nority rights. The Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) has covered since 2007 programmes supporting coop- eration in five regions, Latin America, Asia, Central Asia, the Gulf Region, and South Africa. The DCI funds actions focusing on governance, democracy, human rights, and support for institutional reforms, including the justice sector. The DCI also covers the- matic programmes supporting actions in the field of rule of law and justice sector. What is the aim of EU support to justice, security and the rule of law? EU SUPPoRT ",
        "30 The European Neighbourhood and Partnership In- strument (ENPI) is the financial instrument for Eu- ropean neighbourhood policy (ENP). It is addressed to ENP partner countries, and offers support for promoting good governance and equitable social and economic development process. Action Plans prepared by partner countries in the framework of Association Agreements are political documents that set forth strategic objectives for cooperation with the EU, and their implementation helps ad- vance laws, norms, and standards towards those of the EU. Mechanisms such as cross-border coopera- tion, the Governance Facility, Twinning Instruments, and Technical Assistance and Information Exchange (TAIEX) are used to support the justice sector. The Instrument for Stability (IFS) is a thematic in- strument that is specifically designed to address cri- sis situations through a rapid and flexible response. This includes supporting institutions required for maintaining order or enhancing independence of the judiciary, assisting international criminal tri- bunals and judicial mechanisms, promoting and protecting human rights, and implementing obliga- tions. Measures taken under the IFS during crises are limited in time, usually to a maximum of eight- een months. Structural reforms, which require long- term approaches, therefore generally take place in the context of the geographic programmes. The European Instrument for Democracy and Hu- man Rights (EIDHR) can be used to provide assis- tance in the absence of established development cooperation or as a complement to it, without the approval of national governments. It can support non-state actors or civil society organisations work- ing to protect human rights, or channel funding to international organisations working in this field. The EIDHR is noted for its flexibility, which allows interventions under highly sensitive circumstances; in countries that are not meeting requirements for justice; where disadvantaged groups are facing violations of human rights; where interventions are required at the local or community level; and to support international or regional institutions, such as the International Criminal Court. The majority of EIDHR projects in support to justice focus on access to justice, protection and legal defence of detain- ees, rehabilitation of victims, application of inter- national legal standards, fighting impunity, promot- ing transparency, legal reform, peace-building and conflict prevention, capacity building, monitoring of justice and security institutions, and raising aware- ness of human rights and legal issues. EU SUPPoRT ",
        "31 EU SUPPoRT EU support to the justice sector has focused in the past on building institutional capacity within state institutions, with assistance concentrating on technical solutions to justice problems, delivered through training, advice, provision of capital equip- ment, and infrastructure development. This ap- proach is referred to as institutional support , and helps to strengthen capacity and governance of the justice and security sectors. Through this approach, the EU has made many positive contributions to justice sector reform, and reinforced the institutional frameworks necessary for effective justice delivery. However, this approach has not necessarily resulted in more access to jus- tice or security for people. The EU places strong emphasis on national ownership of the justice ini- tiatives it supports, and hence assistance should be tailored to the differing needs and expectations of citizens and other interest groups. This can be con- strained by a focus on state institutions, or by align- ing EU support with governments\u2019 priorities. The EU has therefore moved towards an increased service delivery approach , which seeks to ensure that support is responsive to the needs of differ- ent stakeholder groups, and involves them in ad- dressing obstacles to effective justice and security systems. In keeping with policy commitments re- garding human rights, gender equality and the rule of law, and to place people at the centre of their approach, EU support therefore seeks to apply a strategy, driven by service delivery outcomes. what this means in practice is striking a better balance between seeking to remedy institutional deficits in the justice and security sectors, and fostering the ability of pro-reform groups including civil society organisations, to negotiate the improved services they are seeking. The service delivery approach focuses on the abil- ity of institutions to deliver improved services to people most in need, which in many cases will not necessarily occur without fundamental transforma- tion of organisational culture, within a sector that is long-term by nature. By improving people\u2019s legal awareness and ability to demand services, and use existing legal structures, this long-term organisa- tional transformation is strengthened. Justice sector interventions and service delivery should preferably take place at both the national and local levels. This ensures that the chain of beneficiaries is complete, that local capacity is de- veloped, and that more systematic and integrated results are obtained. Parallel with its institutional and service delivery approaches, European Union assistance is provid- ed to counterpart governments primarily through specific projects that apply a project approach or budget support. The project approach applies where a focused in- tervention is pursued, or when conditions for a sec- tor's eligibility for budget support are not fulfilled. This has been the most frequently used aid modal- ity for interventions in support to justice reforms. The project approach has a number of limitations, since it tends to be donor or supply driven, some- what ad hoc in nature, and more difficult to coordi- nate. National ownership may not be fully ensured, which thus affects the project\u2019s implementation and monitoring, reduces incentives to achieve results, and limits sustainability. In addition, the project ap- What are EU approaches to support in the justice and security sectors? What are the modalities of European Union support to the justice sector? ",
        "32 proach has often been based upon a capacity needs analysis rather than on a strategic orientation for long-term reforms. Consequently, European Union interventions in the justice area have been progressively shifting towards sector budget support. The new Commu- nication on Budget Support , adopted on 13 octo- ber 2011, sets out a modern approach that aims at strengthening the contractual partnership on EU budget support between the EU and partner coun- tries in order to build and consolidate democracies, pursue sustainable economic growth and eradicate poverty. This approach must be based on mutual accountability and shared commitment to funda- mental values of human rights, democracy and the rule of law. It should enable greater differentiation of budget support operations, allowing the EU to better respond to the political, economic and social context of the partner country. Budget support is provided as a \"vector of change\" under three categories of programmes: \u2022 Good Governance and Development Contracts to provide general budget support to a national development or reform policy and strategy. It is only provided when there is trust and confidence that aid will be spent pursuing the fundamental values of human rights, democracy, and rule of law; \u2022 Sector Reform Contracts to provide sector budg- et support in order to address sector reforms and improve service delivery; \u2022 State Building Contracts to provide budget sup- port in fragile situations. The Sector Reform Contract can be used to improve governance at sector level, particularly in the jus- tice sector, as well as to support national control mechanisms. A Sector Reform Contract involves sectoral management systems based on national objectives, with overall implementation under the auspices of national authorities. The key elements are: \u2022 Development of a sector policy and strategy; \u2022 Establishment of a multi-annual sector budget; and \u2022 Establishment of a sector coordination frame- work. In addition, an appropriate institutional setting and performance monitoring are required. The final result of this process should ideally be a guiding strategy that establishes a vision for the justice sector, sets concrete objectives for achiev- ing this vision, identifies the roles of all key parties, sets a timetable for results, identifies target groups and beneficiaries, provides a budgetary framework, presents key indicators for measuring results, and identifies the external assistance required. Non-state actors and civil society organisations are generally associated with the design and im- plementation of justice reform interventions, par- ticularly when the sector approach is applied. They provide crucial guidance concerning sector priori- ties, and the most effective means for achieving them. They are therefore often supported directly, to reinforce their capacity to monitor programme achievements and to provide specific services. EU SUPPoRT ",
        "33 EU SUPPoRT Pursuant to the different approaches referred to earlier, the EU undertakes a broad range of initia- tives. Each project is individually designed, follow- ing established identification and formulation pro- cedures and criteria, to respond to the needs in the specific country, region or institution. when approaching the justice sector, the following entry points are considered of high relevance and importance for analysis and possible support: \u2022 The legal framework; \u2022 The governmental and administrative frame- work; How does the EU support justice and the rule of law? A sector programme on Criminal Justice in Georgia was adopted in 2008, with a budg- et of 15 million euros, to be implemented through budget support. Criminal justice reforms had previously been supported, mainly through institutional support to the Ministry of Justice, the Office of the Pros- ecutor General and the Office of the Public Defender. In parallel, civil society organisa- tions were supported under EIDHR with a fo- cus on torture prevention and rehabilitation of torture victims. EIDHR projects support- ed civil society organisations in providing psycho-social assistance and legal advice to victims of human rights abuse, in under- taking the monitoring of recommendations of psychiatric and other closed institutions, and in training of law enforcement, prison staff, probation officers, etc. Civil society organisations have gained con- siderable expertise in this sector since this programme has been established. The main civil society stakeholders (lawyers, bar as- sociation, etc.) were consulted in the initial phase of the programme, and have been involved in the choice of priorities, namely penitentiary reform, prosecution, and juve- nile justice. The programme also aims at enhancing their role in the reform process. Establishing government sector manage- ment with proper consultation mecha- nisms and the formal inclusion of civil society was considered a strong indicator of progress in the first year of implemen- tation. EIDHR has also been used as a capacity building tool for civil society organisations in areas targeted by the programme. For example, some EIDHR projects have con- centrated on the development of innova- tive juvenile justice practices and alterna- tives to imprisonment. The development of such expertise provides organisations with a stronger voice in policy dialogue and in technical working groups involved in the national reform process.

Naturally, these nine components are closely inter- related, and in certain contexts can substantially overlap. However, they are functionally and concep- tually distinct. Thus, it is imperative to understand their specific nature or identity and roles in order to understand the justice sector. It is also important to understand their relationship with international and regional judicial institutions, which despite being separate still have a major impact on the national justice sector. These entry points can each experi- ence their own difficulties; these challenges and possible responses are de- scribed in Section 5. EU interventions seek to provide quality support to country-led reform programmes, aiming at achiev- ing sustainable results.

The EU will not undertake support to justice and security sector reform without a thorough analysis of the overall country and sector context . The type and nature of the legal system, and the level of development, can usually be assessed through review of available information resources, inves- tigation, and consultations with informed parties. Issues relating to national priorities and the politi- cal situation however require much deeper investi- gation, through dialogue with key actors. This is a sensitive process, which is carefully organised and carried out. The European Commission Sector Governance Analysis Framework treats the justice sector as an essential component of governance, focusing on three dimensions, namely the context, actors, and accountability relations. It establishes a four-step process for analysing and addressing governance in sector operations: Step One: Analysing the context of sector govern- ance. In the justice sector, the context includes in- dependence of the judiciary, the legal framework, organisational capacity, resources, personnel, rati- fication of international treaties, and membership of international, and regional organisations, socio- economic and socio-cultural factors, and the gen- eral human rights situation. Step Two: Mapping the actors. The six clusters of actors identified are non-state actors, supervisory institutions, government and politicians, core pub- lic agencies, service providers, and international, regional, and donor organisations. Mapping covers their legal status and statutory mandates, powers and resources, roles and responsibilities, interests, ability to meet obligations and deliver services, linkages with other actors, and past, current and planned activities in the justice sector. Step Three: Analysing governance and account- ability relations. once the context and key actors are mapped, it is necessary to analyse relationships between the actors, and specifically the governance mechanisms through which authority and power are exercised. Step Four: Analysing and summing up readiness for governance reform. This step brings together the first three steps, and comprises an examination of its features, strengths, weaknesses, opportuni- ties, and threats (SwoT Analysis), and any trends observed. The Sector Governance Analysis Framework is also used to identify the content of justice sector ini- tiatives, design indicators and facilitate monitoring and evaluation. ",

        "37 CHALLENGES & STRATEGIES \u2022 Control over courts and judicial institutions: Leaders may try to influence the courts and in- stitutions of the justice sector, and thus fail to respect judicial independence. \u2022 Under-resourcing: Justice and security sectors may be under-funded, deprived of facilities and equipment, or have limited human resources. \u2022 Lack of capacity: The justice or security sector may suffer from a lack of institutional and hu- man resource capacity. This may or may not be linked to financial resources. \u2022 Political will: The justice sector may have low pri- ority in national or political objectives. \u2022 Resistance to change: Political leaders and jus- tice and security sector personnel may be re- sistant to changes of laws, structures or estab- lished practices. Resistance to change may also be present within traditional and religious justice mechanisms. \u2022 Failure to respect human rights: Numerous vio- lations of human rights can occur, in particular in the criminal justice system. Abuses can range from denial of fair trial rights, through to torture and extra-judicial killings. \u2022 Selective or weak enforcement: Inconsistent ap- plication of the law can be used for political pur- poses, and to repress dissent. weak enforcement may also arise from a lack of institutional capac- ity, or lack of political will. \u2022 Corruption and cronyism: Corrupt practices can significantly undermine the justice and security sectors. These can include favouritism or bribes, whether to influence the outcome in specific cas- es or simply to process administrative require- ments. Corruption is linked to impunity, which undermines the sector and its public image. \u2022 Abuse of authority and powers: Abuse of author- ity may result in unlawful searches and deten- tion, or legal harassment, and serves to assert power and silence opposition. \u2022 Gender bias and other barriers: Laws may fail to protect women, children, poor and other disad- vantaged people. These groups may also experi- ence a lack of protection in practice, even where adequate laws exist. \u2022 Inadequate information: Citizens may not have access to information about laws, procedures and practices, and about their fundamental rights. General challenges The justice and security sectors of every State face unique and often interlinked challenges. These chal- lenges often share however certain characteristics, which are related to specific institutions, groups or interest groups, and are considerably aggravated in under-developed or fragile countries. There are no fixed or guaranteed responses to such difficulties, and strategies must therefore be developed on a case-by-case and holistic basis, taking into account the specific country and sector situation. General challenges may exist that apply throughout the security and legal sectors, and indeed in all of a country\u2019s state institutions. other specific chal- lenges can be grouped around a number of entry points, which are referred to in the Section above. What are the main challenges within the justice and security sectors? ",
        "38 \u2022 Lack of legal aid systems: Citizens may not have access to lawyers, or adequately trained legal professionals. \u2022 Limited public participation: Citizens may not have the ability to participate in reform process- es, or even express their needs and expectations. \u2022 Lack of public confidence: People may avoid the legal system due to economic reasons, fear, lack of confidence, or a sense of futility. \u2022 Poor working conditions: Personnel and in par- ticular members of the judiciary may have their capacity and motivation affected by inadequate facilities and resources, poor remuneration and other work conditions, and a lack of career struc- ture. \u2022 Inadequate training: Security and justice sector personnel and legal professionals may have in- adequate training, in particular in human rights, and gender and juvenile justice issues. \u2022 Where the State cannot fully control national territory. Instead, clandestine groups, organised criminals, or paramilitary organisations may control a significant percentage of the country. \u2022 Where the State has minimal control over the economy. A high percentage of economic activity may be unregulated, informal, untaxed or even illegal. \u2022 Where the State is unable to generate the re- sources it requires. The tax base may be low, and there may be problems generating income from other sources. \u2022 Where the State has difficulty providing social services. This is particularly problematic in rural communities and peripheral zones of urban ar- eas. \u2022 Where the State lacks a professional and inde- pendent civil service. Public employment may be subject to political control, and there can be high turnover when governments change. Situations where these challenges may be aggravated \u2022 Complex or excessive number of laws; \u2022 Complex Court structures or onerous procedures, including excessive court fees, prevent access to justice; \u2022 The Constitution may not provide adequate pro- tection of the independence of the judiciary; \u2022 Fundamental human rights may not be guaran- teed by the Constitution or human rights bill; \u2022 Limited sentencing options, in particular alterna- tives to imprisonment; \u2022 Severe limitations in existing remedies provided either by law or in practice; \u2022 Long delays; \u2022 Inexistent, inadequate or inappropriate alterna- tive dispute resolution mechanisms.

        "40 To overcome these challenges in an effective and sustainable manner, it is essential to maintain a system-wide perspective . while limited resource constraints may make it impossible to address all difficulties in the justice and security sectors, indi- vidual reform initiatives should not be considered in isolation, since improvements in one part of the justice system may be undermined by weaknesses in other parts of the system. Hence, reform cannot be reduced to simply exam- ining cause and effect, or problems and solutions, but rather by anchoring strategies in the specific legal, cultural, historical and political context. If this seems complex and difficult, it is likely because it is. while each situation will present a different com- bination of difficulties, some general guidance can be given as to how certain systemic obstacles can be approached and addressed. Some examples of approaches and strategies include: \u2022 Improving skills and capacity of legal and secu- rity personnel and professionals must take into account existing educational structures, working traditions and norms, and the ability or capac- ity to access information. Professional training needs to be integrated into the institutions that already provide it, and form part of a system. Even small practical improvements can often have immediate impacts. \u2022 Access to justice initiatives must take account of where people go to seek justice, who they prefer to talk to, and which mechanisms they trust. This will then help determine which entry points and activities are likely to be most effective. \u2022 Dialogue at every stage of the reform process, and with a broad and inclusive range of inter- locutors, assists enormously in the identification of key problem areas, and helps determine the most appropriate partners and responses. This also reinforces ownership, which in turn helps ensure the sustainability of reform efforts. \u2022 Related to this, justice reform can be both fa- cilitated and hindered by cultural, traditional and religious practices. Certain practices for example, such as domestic violence, may be tolerated in some communities, despite national laws. Inclu- sive approaches, and awareness raising initia- tives can help foster cultural shifts, and at the same time capitalise on the strengths and com- mon values within communities. \u2022 Public advocacy and awareness raising helps en- sure access to justice, however institutions must be strengthened in parallel to ensure that raised expectations are met in practice. \u2022 Blockages within the justice chain should be addressed by engaging all the institutions con- cerned. For example, where a legal system is ex- periencing significant court delays, there is little point in equipping courts to deal with cases if prisons lack the capacity to process or transport prisoners, or prosecutors lack the resources to prepare their files, or legislation imposes com- plex procedural requirements. \u2022 Developing alternatives to imprisonment and reinforcing access to bail , while sometimes po- litically and practically difficult to introduce, can have a dramatic impact on prison overcrowding. However the security sector should be given ade- quate resources to administer any non-custodial sentences, or to enforce the appearance of de- fendants in court. \u2022 Remote and insecure areas often experience dif- ficulties in the justice and security sectors, and in extreme cases can be transformed into law- less zones. Strategies should therefore include de-centralised initiatives, even if on a rotating or pilot basis, for example through \u201cmobile\u201d courts. What are some strategic responses to these challenges? CHALLENGES & STRATEGIES ",

There is little point in reinventing the wheel, and countries and regions share com- mon difficulties. International, national and local organisations will often have experiences that can be applied to other situations and contexts. The EU project in the Philippines \u201cImprov- ing Governance to Reduce Poverty: Access to Justice for the Poor\u201d (2,7 M euro; 2006 \u2013 2008) aimed to increase access to justice for poor and vulnerable groups of society, and was conceived together with a parallel anti-corruption project. Focusing on vulnerable groups such as poor women and child victims of trafficking and violence, the project worked to increase knowledge of basic rights and the justice system, and institute measures to make the justice system more responsive and accessible. The project helped establish a decentralised information system for mu- nicipal courts, strengthened the traditional Barangay Justice System, institutionalised legal information desks that inform vulnera- ble groups about their rights, trained police, judges, prosecutors and lawyers about the rights of women and children, and reviewed existing laws regarding the rights of women and children, to assess their compliance with international conventions. The project achieved positive results by equally supporting five institutions in- volved at the central and local levels. It en- hanced coordination between official mu- nicipal courts and the traditional Barangay Justice System (including mediating in civil cases), through training on each system, establishment of information services and desks at both levels to advise poor liti- gants on how to use free legal assistance, and by providing assistance to victims of abuse. Improved documentation of cases by the police, and more organised case management by social workers, plus coun- selling and pre-trial proceedings in select communities, helped cases to be resolved and promoted the recovery of victims.

        "42 According to the European Union, and based on oECD criteria, fragile countries are those whose state structures lack capacity or political will to as- sume the core functions to reduce poverty or pro- mote development or ensure public safety and re- spect for human rights. Characteristic signs include: \u2022 weak governmental structures; \u2022 Inability or unwillingness to deal with basic func- tions; \u2022 Lack of capacity to meet obligations regarding service delivery and management of public re- sources; \u2022 Inability to control all of the national territory; \u2022 Inability to uphold the rule of law, and provide safety and security; \u2022 Insufficient protection of human rights. In a very real sense, the \u201csocial contract\u201d has broken down in such countries. Fragility is often related to international or internal conflict, however the risk of conflict is exacerbated by circumstances associated with fragility, such as poverty, inequality, instability, organised crime, or being an \u201corphan state\u201d, that is, one which receives little or no support from the international community. Fragility is often accom- panied by and exacerbated by political instability, or natural and other disasters. Countries that are emerging from conflict face spe- cific development challenges and requirements, in addition to justice sector reform. In order to address these challenges, EU interventions focus globally on establishing and maintaining peace and secu- rity, fighting impunity, meeting emergency needs, ensuring disarmament, demobilisation and reinte- gration of combatants (DDR), supporting economic recovery, preventing further violations of human rights, and promoting reconciliation. Countries that are emerging from conflict, au- thoritarian rule or disaster share many similari- ties, including the need to build democratic political systems, open up economies, integrate into the in- ternational system, establish the rule of law, adopt and respect international obligations and standards regarding human rights, reform justice and secu- rity systems, and prepare legal professions to work independently and according to modern standards. Major challenges in fragile situations include: \u2022 Not only making the third branch of state in- dependent, but changing it from an openly ac- knowledged arm of the government; \u2022 Not only reforming written laws, but making them implementable and respected, so that they do not merely exist on paper; \u2022 Not only strengthening juridical institutions, but creating a culture of institutionalism, whereby independent institutions function collectively; \u2022 Not only improving the skills of judges, lawyers, and prosecutors, but turning them into dedicated professionals; \u2022 Not only improving the delivery of justice and justice services to the population, but also en- suring access to justice for ordinary citizens and disadvantaged social groups. The European Consensus on Development provides guidelines for a comprehensive EU response to fra- gility. It establishes a set of actions for meeting key needs, and preventing security threats and conflict, and focuses on the openings offered by transitional periods to address key human rights issues. EU in- terventions in the justice sector in such States gen- erally take a broad approach towards establishing the rule of law, overcoming political divisions, build- ing governmental institutions, strengthening the economy, generating revenue that can be used to support the public sector, reforming the civil service, promoting democratisation processes, protecting human rights, and restructuring the justice sector.

EU interventions in the justice sector therefore of- ten include: \u2022 Reinforcing the legal framework, including draft- ing new Constitutions and transposing interna- tional human rights obligations; \u2022 Institutional capacity building; \u2022 Supporting traditional and transitional justice mechanisms; \u2022 Criminal reform, to prosecute violations and re- duce criminality and impunity; \u2022 Training for legal professionals on reconciliation and human rights; \u2022 Building the capacity of civil society organisa- tions to promote and protect rights, support reconciliation, expose corruption, and monitor justice sector institutions; \u2022 Community outreach and work with local gov- ernment and municipal authorities, to ensure that the rule of law is not limited to urban areas; \u2022 Promoting access to justice and legal aid for vul- nerable people; \u2022 Mediation services and rehabilitation for ag- grieved parties; \u2022 Rebuilding physical infrastructure and facilities.

In some analyses or approaches, this definition is enlarged to include transgendered or intersex persons. women face specific difficulties within the justice and security sectors. Laws may often be discrimina- tory, in substance and in practice. In addition, they face obstacles relative to access to justice, in par- ticular those who are victims of rape and other vio- lence, who may be punished or ostracised for seek- ing justice. Higher illiteracy rates of women in many parts of the world also exclude them from knowing and exercising their rights. Court proceedings often lack gender sensitivity, and prison systems may have inadequate facilities or protocols, in particular for transgendered persons. Certain categories have a heightened vulnerability, including the disabled, the elderly, those with young dependents, widows and divorcees, and the girl-child. In addition, wom- en are often under-represented within the justice and security sectors themselves. The integration of gender issues in all justice sector interventions makes reform more thorough and sustainable, and has positive effects on the protection of other vul- nerable segments of society, and of the community in general. Gender issues are crucial for any justice sector reform that truly aspires to promote human rights standards, good governance, and democracy. Gender issues should be integrated and form part of all reform initiatives, including dialogue, problem analysis, design and implementation, and monitor- ing and evaluation. The protection of gender rights in justice sector in- terventions: \u2022 Ensures that countries meet their responsibilities under international treaties; \u2022 Promotes equal access to justice and human rights for the entire community; \u2022 Helps reform discriminatory laws and practice; \u2022 Reduces impunity for gender-based violence; \u2022 Ensures balanced representation of different groups in the justice sector; \u2022 Strengthens the legitimacy, credibility and trust of the justice sector; \u2022 Strengthens monitoring and supervision of the justice sector. What is gender equality and why is it important? The EU project in Afghanistan Access to Jus- tice at the District Level (2005-2009) aimed to strengthen the capacity of citizens to claim their rights, using existing local legal systems, and incorporating gender sensitive approaches. The project\u2019s main activities in- cluded the refurbishment of judicial facilities at the district level, including detention cen- tres with gender sensitive practices, training of primary judicial actors, public awareness campaigns specifically targeting disadvan- taged groups, and disseminating judgments, reports and case studies. Gender perspec- tives were integrated into training activities and legal education in schools, radio pro- grammes and other forms of outreach, and success stories were widely disseminated. Given the low rate of female representa- tion in public institutions in Afghanistan, their high rate of illiteracy, obstacles to their participation in local governmental institu- tions, and their inability to appear in person before traditional justice institutions, the project faced serious challenges in enhanc- ing access to justice and recognising rights.

        "46 CHALLENGES & STRATEGIES From 2008 to 2010 the EU provided sup- port to penitentiary reform in Georgia, in- cluding probation for juvenile offenders. The project aimed to create a comprehensive juvenile justice system, focusing on the rehabilitation and reintegration of juvenile offenders, in accordance with international and European standards. The project direct- ly responded to the needs of a number of groups, including convicted juveniles, child probationers, detention facility staff includ- ing teachers, probation officers, civil society representatives, judges, and policy makers. The project established a highly collabora- tive atmosphere, which encouraged policy dialogue, and strengthened links between the penitentiary and probation systems. Significant results were achieved, includ- ing establishing a system of individual re- integration of juveniles at Avchala prison, helping juveniles develop interpersonal and communication skills, providing sports and recreation activities, getting civil soci- ety organisations involved in the rehabili- tation process, and generating acceptance of child-centred reintegration models in- volving trained coaches. Justice for children covers a broad array of inter- ventions, delivered by specialised staff in accord- ance with special legal provisions and procedures on processing children through the justice system. This extends from the realisation and protection of children's interests and rights in matters of civil and family law, to the most appropriate measures and sanctions in criminal matters, as well as the legal treatment of children under the age of criminal re- sponsibility. Despite the international obligations contained in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, children\u2019s basic needs and rights continue to be violated in many countries, and their protec- tion constitutes a key issue for the justice sector. However this often remains problematic, due to insufficient budgetary allocation for the protection of victims, failure to apply the law, discriminatory practices, and insufficient training and sensitisation. In contexts of fragility in particular, children remain vulnerable to all forms of abuse, including harmful traditional practices, corporal punishment, violence, exploitation, child labour trafficking, and recruit- ment by armed groups. Children face persistent barriers to the fulfilment of their rights, such as limited access to justice, com- plexity of procedures, discrimination (in particular the girl-child and children belonging to minority groups or having disabilities) and lack of access to services. Legal protection mechanisms and pro- cedures for child victims and witnesses are inad- equate in most countries. Despite imprisonment being a measure of last resort, many children are still incarcerated, often with adults or in appalling conditions, and without vocational and recreational programmes or psychosocial support. In many de- veloping countries children are not systematically registered at birth, and hence cannot, for instance, prove their age when required, or when it is in their interests to do so. The EU is committed to promoting children\u2019s rights and responding to their basic needs, as an integral part of both its internal and external policies. Chil- dren\u2019s rights are integrated, in parallel to gender issues, when EU justice support or reform projects are designed and implemented. ",
        "47 As indicated earlier, there is a need to constantly identify and apply best practices and lessons gained from previous initiatives in the justice and security sectors. The European Union constantly strives to learn from its own past experiences, and to make these findings available to those who seek reform, whether donors, policy-makers or other stakeholders. Reviews and evaluations 1 of EU jus- tice programmes have revealed a number of key observations and issues, which it now takes into consideration in its own interventions: The EU has substantially increased its engage- ment in justice sector reform , through the use of a wide range of financial and non-financial instru- ments. There has been growing international policy consensus on the need to strengthen justice and security provision as part of wider state responses to poverty, conflict and insecurity. In the past, most EU programmes focused on individual sub-sectors, often adopting a technical focus, to the detriment of dialogue with national authorities. Global EU country support strategies, anchored in improving service delivery, were rarely developed. The design of justice sector reform assistance programmes has not been adequately under- pinned by local knowledge . The amount of analy- sis undertaken in program design varies greatly. Although efforts are made to consult national ac- tors, the EU relies heavily on external consultants to develop projects and frame approaches. This problem is somewhat mitigated by the increasing use of Justice Sector Budget Support. Programmes have nevertheless been weak in their use of base- lines and indicators to assess progress and impact. EU assistance has focused on building insti- tutional capacity, rather than addressing con- straints to service delivery from the perspective of intended beneficiaries . The overwhelming focus of assistance has been on technical solutions to justice problems. However this often had limited impact in terms of improved service delivery. Assistance tailored to the needs of stakeholder groups has been constrained by the focus on state institutions and inflexible programming procedures . In practice, the EU has usually aligned its assistance to governments\u2019 priorities, even where not necessarily responsive to citizen needs. The slow and inflexible nature of EU programming has also hampered efforts to make assistance re- sponsive to needs. The EU has made positive contributions to jus- tice and security sector reform . However while this assistance reinforced the governance of these sectors, it did not in itself result in more access to justice or security for people. Decision-making procedures for long-term geo- graphical assistance programmes are lengthy and complex . Major changes to a project must be submitted for re-approval in the EU Brussels Head- quarters, which is a time-consuming process. In ad- dition, interventions financed by short or long-term instruments have not been sustainable once fund- ing has ended. The move from project approaches to budget support has helped overcome some of these shortcomings.

        "48 Experiences have been mixed regarding the link- age between support to justice and promotion of human rights . on the positive side, the EU has sought to place human rights on the map as an integral part of its external action. However the re- sults of EU action have been hampered by several systemic constraints, including insufficient use of high-level EU political leverage, lack of a clear and effectively implemented \u201cjoint\u201d strategy between the EU and its Member States, a tendency to \"ghet- to-ise\" human rights as a separate issue rather than a transversal one, implementation problems, and insufficient knowledge, capacities and incen- tives to act on human rights. EU action has how- ever generated positive effects on human rights, by capitalising on its global presence, its political credibility, and its financial capacities. EU strategy focuses on the openings offered by transitional periods to address key human rights issues , including the protection of women and mi- norities, through commissions, investigative bodies, legislative reform initiatives, training, and civil so- ciety engagement. The EU position regarding fragile and post- conflict countries has not been always clear, and its support was often bound to a developmental perspective, rather than towards conflict preven- tion and peace building. Support was rarely directly geared towards resolving the conflict or addressing the root causes of conflict. Relief, crisis management, rehabilitation, and support for reconstruction and development must be integrated and linked in order to imple- ment a holistic and sustainable approach. The human rights of specific target groups should be specially protected , in particular women, juve- niles, minorities and other vulnerable people. The fight against impunity requires broad re- forms , including law enforcement, criminal proce- dure, legal aid, protection of victims and witnesses, strong forensic capacity, and communication and education. Transitional and traditional justice has a major role to play in fragile and post-conflict coun- tries, but must be in accordance with human rights norms.

        "49 The main recommendations that the EU has developed concerning justice and security sector reform in- clude the following: A balance must be struck between strengthening institutions, and addressing constraints to service delivery to beneficiaries. Assistance should therefore be anchored in national justice strategies and build on existing foundations, whilst ensuring these are viable resources for reform. Partner government priorities should also be weighed against democracy, human rights, gender equality and rule of law objectives. Support should therefore not just aim to align with authorities\u2019 wishes, but also examine on a case-by-case basis whether their priorities are appropriate, and if not, advocate a different approach. Interventions should be grounded on a firm evidence base, reflecting the views of a wide range of stakeholders. Justice support often focuses on enhancing state provision of justice services, and does so primarily by supporting capacity-building efforts. This can enhance the ability of justice personnel to deliver improved services to citizens, though this often will not occur without fundamental and long-term transformation of organisational cultures within the justice sector. It is therefore important to ensure people are aware of their rights and the services to which they are entitled, as well as enabling them to enforce such rights; this in turn makes justice institutions accountable for services and reform, and strengthens equal access to justice. oversight within the justice sector is essential for democracy and the rule of law, since it helps hold insti- tutions accountable for regulation and reform policies. This can include support to Parliament to improve oversight capacity, and to ombudsmen to strengthen complaints procedures. Sound analysis of the justice sector and its main components and entry points is a prerequisite for suc- cessful implementation of support projects. Understanding impact is key to striking a better balance in programmes between institutional capacity development, and fostering service delivery that directly ben- efits citizens. A baseline study should therefore be conducted as the basis of all support within the justice sector, and tools and mechanisms incorporated to measure programme results, and particularly the impact on people\u2019s lives. Recommendations Balance institutional support with service delivery Empower people to demand services from institutions Support oversight mechanisms Analyse the sector and include mechanisms to measure results and impact CoNCLUSIoN ",
        "50 weaknesses in one part of the justice system can effectively undermine improvements in other parts. A system-wide perspective that recognizes that the justice system is made up of several interlinked sub- sectors should therefore be applied, incorporating civil, criminal, public and international law, and tradi- tional justice mechanisms. Support should be based on realistic objectives, which are achievable according to the country context, the political will of authorities, the interests of stakeholders, the services to be delivered, and available time and financial resources. To be successful, justice sector initiatives require long timeframes and flexible delivery schedules, for example through dividing implementation into stages. Justice sector projects are often centralised, and focused on national institutions in capital cities, whereas rural inhabitants may be most vulnerable and deprived of information and access to justice. Improved communication, information management and outreach make it easier to achieve broader and sustain- able results. This also helps protect human rights on the ground, in particular women, minors, minorities, migrants, and indigenous peoples. Institutional reform initiatives rarely succeed unless national stakeholders are convinced of their benefits, and leaders are prepared to accept certain limitations of their power. The political aspect of interventions must therefore be addressed, including the need for strategic dialogue. ownership and political will should be established from the outset, as well as throughout implementation, combined with mechanisms to monitor initiatives. Apply a system-wide perspective Develop realistic objectives Ensure geographical outreach Combine dialogue with financial support and technical assistance Protection and promotion of human rights and gender equality is a priority in all EU justice support initia- tives, and these crosscutting issues are often referred to in project objectives and expected results. Hu- man rights and gender equality can also be used as a basic perspective by using a Human Rights Based Approach, based on international and regional human rights instruments, focusing on empowering people through principles of non-discrimination, participation, transparency, and accountability. Human rights and gender equality should be included as crosscutting issues and working perspectives CoNCLUSIoN ",
        "51 CoNCLUSIoN Donor coordination and joint programming should be used to increase aid effectiveness, and to avoid scat- tered, duplicated and contradictory initiatives. Donor coordination should ensure that the timing and deliv- ery of support matches the capacity and schedules of project counterparts, and should review demands on justice sector entry points, assess capacity, and encourage South-South cooperation. Ensure donor coordination and complementarity and South-South cooperation ",
