Experts from UNWomen, the European Commission, the European External Action Services, the academia, and civil society organisations set out the need for overcoming the underinvestment in gender equality and women's and girls' empowerment. The Third International Conference for Financing for Development in Addis Ababa in July 2015 has been perceived as a unique opportunity to create a new international framework where resources for gender equality will be present in every policy area, internally and externally. Such financing will contribute to implement the Sustainable Development Goals in a way that enhances gender equality and, as such, to achieving the aims of the post- 2015 development cooperation framework in a better way. However, important preconditions are an agreement on a funding level of 0,7% of GNI available for development cooperation and coherence in the activities of the different actors at international, European and partner country level. Besides, the European institutions will need to create a sense of responsibility at all levels for the implementation of gender equality as a priority goal and ensure transparency in spending as well as monitoring and accountability mechanisms.

        "Policy Hub Transformative financing and goals for gender equality and women's and girls' empowerment - Addis Ababa and New York 2015 ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 7 INTRODUCTION This is the summary of the Policy Hub on \"Transformative financing and goals for gender equality and women's and girls' empowerment - Addis Ababa and New York 2015\" which was held on 17th of June 2015 in the European Parliament (EP) in Brussels 1 . The Policy Hub was organised to inform about the relevance of sustainable financing of gender equality in the post 2015 development cooperation framework. In this sense, it was conceived as a support of Members and staff of the European Parliament in the preparation of the delegation visits to Addis Ababa in July and New York in September 2015. In order to have input from different stakeholders, also representatives of civil society organisations were invited. The Policy Hub addressed several dimensions related to improved development cooperation among which the essential role of gender equality for successful human development, the need for a substantial financial framework to ensure the implementation of the future Sustainable Development Goals, and the relation with other external policy fields, like the implementation of Resolution 1325 on women in armed conflict. The Policy Hub complements other events and publications relevant for policy makers in relation to gender equality and women's and girls' empowerment in the post-2015 development cooperation framework, like the background paper for the delegation visit of Members of the Women's Rights and Gender Equality Committee (FEMM) to the 59th meeting of the Commission on the Status of Women in March 2015 with an evaluation of the implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action (BPfA) 2 and the Key Source of the European Parliamentary Research Service on Development financing and gender equality \u2013 a virtuous circle 3 . As the Chair of the FEMM committee has pointed out recently, the European Year for Development \"offers important opportunities to anchor women\u2019s empowerment firmly in the post 2015 agenda. The EP should seek at these conferences to achieve women\u2019s participation in decision-making at all levels, adequate financing for gender equality, strong accountability mechanisms, and a \u201cgender data revolution\u201d for better policy outcomes for men and women alike.\" 4 In this sense, the Summary of the Policy Hub attempted to provide an evidence base to facilitate informed decision-making. 1 Please find the Programme in Annex 1. 2 Evaluation of the Beijing Platform for Action +20 and the opportunities for achieving gender equality and the empowerment of women in the post-2015 development agenda, PE 519.191. 3 Development financing and gender equality \u2013 a virtuous circle, PE559.506. 4 Policy Departments' monthly highlights, April 2015.

        "Policy Department C: Citizens' Rights and Constitutional Affairs ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 8 1. THE RELEVANCE OF THE CONFERENCE IN ADDIS ABABA FOR GENDER EQUALITY KEY FINDINGS \uf0b7 Goals related to gender equality have been marked by a constant underinvestment which resulted in a slow and uneven progress in closing the gender gaps. Particularly underfunded areas are women's participation in decision-making, women's economic rights, gender-based violence, sexual and reproductive health and rights, and women's peace and security. \uf0b7 The Third International Conference on Financing for Development in Addis Ababa is perceived as a historic opportunity to insist on increased investments for gender equality and women's empowerment that will realize existing and new commitments. After the 20-year review of the BPfA and the review of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the stocktaking exercise showed that global investments remained vastly insufficient to achieve gender equality and that no country has closed the gender gap. Progress has been very slow and uneven not only between countries, but also between different groups of women. This lack of progress is seen as one consequence of constant underinvestment in gender equality and women's empowerment. In addition, this situation has been deepened by austerity measures in the crisis context, widening inequalities and increasing the vulnerability of marginalized women. For example, the recent contribution of the European External Action Service (EEAS) to the Global Strategy on United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1325 Women, Peace and Security identified the lack of earmarked budgets for the National Action Plans as an issue of concern. In order to avoid the pitfalls of the MDGs, gender equality should be a stand-alone goal among the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Member States should take concrete actions to ensure the full, effective and accelerated implementation of the BPfA through significantly increased investments to close the resource gaps which hinder the achievement of gender equality (59th UN CSW). It is necessary to integrate gender equality throughout the financial framework, especially in some underfunded areas such as women's leadership, economic rights, gender-based violence, sexual and reproductive health and rights and women's peace and security. So, it is vital to increase financing for gender equality in scale and scope, and from all sources at all levels. To be able to accomplish this needed transformational change to close the gap in financing for gender equality, the Third International Conference on Financing for Development in Addis Ababa (13-16 July 2015) is a historic opportunity to insist on increased investments for gender equality and women's empowerment that will realize existing and new commitments. Official Development Assistance (ODA) continues to be a central source of financing for development, as shown in the explicit EU's financial target to reach the 0.7% of Gross National Income (GNI) for development cooperation. The importance of the conference is also marked by the presence of high level personalities like Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. The EP will send a delegation. ",

WOMEN\u2019S RIGHTS AND GENDER EQUALITY AS OBJECTIVES OF THE UNION'S EXTERNAL AND DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION POLICIES KEY FINDINGS \uf0b7 Focusing development efforts on women is often an efficient way to pursue broader development objectives. \uf0b7 The EU has to continuously promote gender equality, human rights, and non- discrimination to build the necessary global cooperation partnerships and the willingness to include gender equality as an integral part in the political declaration and to convince States parties to provide the means for the implementation of the gender equality agenda. \uf0b7 For the implementation of the post-2015 development agenda, the new Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy and the Gender Action Plan (GAP) II (2016-2020) will be the relevant documents providing guidance for the integration of gender equality in external relations and development cooperation . Jivka Petkova, Gender Advisor of the European External Action Service (EEAS), underlined that gender equality is a high priority for the Union's external policy agenda. This does not only relate to women's rights as human rights and the commitment of the Union to the implementation of international conventions. Attention has to be drawn to the fact that focusing development efforts on women is often an efficient way to pursue broader development objectives, for example the fact that supporting women small-holder farmers is an efficient way of fighting poverty, improving food security, etc, or the success of the Brazilian Bolsa familia scheme, which provides poor mothers with a small sum of money in return for sending their children to school and to health controls, which has inspired similar initiatives in several other countries. For the integration of a firm commitment to the realisation of gender equality into the post- 2015 development framework, a comprehensive structure between EEAS, Commission (EC) and Member States has been put in place. Financing is vital to evolve gender equality and the Addis Ababa Conference was considered to be a great chance to have a real impact on women's rights and gender equality in the future. For these chances to be realised in Addis, the EU has to continuously promote gender equality, human rights, and non-discrimination to build the necessary global cooperation partnerships and the willingness to include gender equality as an integral part in the political declaration and to convince States parties to provide the means for the implementation of the gender equality agenda. In this context, the leadership of UNWomen was considered as crucial during the whole preparatory process of the post-2015 agenda. The adoption of well-financed and gender-sensitive SDGs would create also the opportunity for the EEAS to demonstrate their advancement regarding gender equality policies and that, if finance is available, many effective measures could be taken. Therefore, the EEAS will also aim at strong language in the political declarations regarding the ",
        "Policy Department C: Citizens' Rights and Constitutional Affairs ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 10 commitment to accelerate the implementation of the BPfA, the Cairo Programme of Action , the outcomes of their review conferences, and the fulfilment of the obligations under the Convention on the elimination of all discrimination against women (CEDAW). The Council Conclusions 5 adopted on 26 of May 2015 describe the Union's position for the Conference in Addis Ababa in July 2015. They support, among others, a stand-alone goal (SDG 5) for gender equality, the inclusion of gender mainstreaming in all policies (EU internally and externally through training and coaching), and the collection of gender and age segregated data . Only a start The conferences in Addis Ababa and New York were highlighted as starting points for the work aiming at gender equality. By the end of the year, for example, the EU and its partner countries will be called upon to ensure the inclusion of a gender perspective into the decisions taken at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris ( COP 21 ) in December 2015. Furthermore, for effective monitoring, evaluation and accountability the UN Statistical Commission will have to present indicators for measuring the achievement of the goals related to gender equality. In this respect, civil society organisations (CSOs) have a very important role in helping to identify the necessarily limited priority activities and their indicators. Therefore, the participative approach is indispensable in EEAS's work. For the implementation of the post-2015 development agenda, the new Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy and the Gender Action Plan (GAP) II (2016-2020) will be the relevant documents providing guidance for the integration of gender equality in external relations and development cooperation. GAP II will be a Commission Working Document evaluated by two Member States, the Netherlands and Spain. GAP II will address and seek to overcome the first GAP's weaknesses. For example, the lack of gender analysis; the lack of data, etc, but also that heads of delegations often did not assume responsibility for the achievement of gender equality as a policy priority of the EU. The aims of GAP II are to tackle all kinds of violence, to empower women economically and to improve women's participation in decision-making. For reaching these objectives, impact assessments were said to be crucial to identify the right measures. 5 Council conclusions on a New Global Partnership for Poverty Eradication and Sustainable Development after 2015 ",

THE INSTITUTIONAL BACKGROUND FOR EFFECTIVE GENDER MAINSTREAMING OF THE UNION'S DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION KEY FINDINGS \uf0b7 The five major criteria used to evaluate how certain weaknesses in gender mainstreaming can be overcome are commitment, context, capacity, accountability and cash. \uf0b7 The EC promotes an institutional cultural shift , also with a view to produce a domino effect in the rest of the decision-making and implementing system which should be accompanied by accountability reporting tools. Marina Marchetti from DG DEVCO of the European Commission (EC) explained how the EC mainstreams gender into development cooperation activities since 2007 and presented the five major criteria used to evaluate how certain weaknesses in gender mainstreaming can be overcome. These are: commitment, context, capacity, accountability and cash. 3.1. Commitment and capacity building to mainstream gender equality in development cooperation policies The analysis of the previous GAP has identified a lack of commitment at different levels of the decision-making and implementation system as well as a lack of understanding on how to include gender equality into development policies. While the Commission is consequently decided to take measures aiming at strengthened and revitalised commitment among their staff, it is necessary for the latter to impose high quality gender analysis of the respective context at the level of the partner countries to enable gender sensitive results. 3.2. Accountability and the attribution of funding for gender equality Gender mainstreaming depends also on methodologies that contribute to shared responsibility with a view to hold every collaborator responsible for the integration of a gender perspective in all areas of work. Notably it means raising the awareness of staff in delegations regarding their responsibility in the implementation of a gender sensitive approach. In this respect, gender focal points are very important. Besides, Martina Marchetti highlighted the need for an institutional cultural shift of the EC to produce a domino effect in the rest of the system which should be accompanied by accountability reporting tools. These have been considered essential for mainstreaming gender equality into the work of all units. Finally, gender equality objectives cannot be reached without adequate financial contributions. ",
        "Policy Department C: Citizens' Rights and Constitutional Affairs ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 12 4. GENDER EQUALITY IN THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OF THE UNION'S DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION KEY FINDINGS \uf0b7 The five development cooperation instruments are IPA, ENI, EIDHR, DCI, and EDF. \uf0b7 The EC uses the GMarker of the OECD to measure the impact of programmes on gender equality. The European Commission has five instruments for the financing of development cooperation measures which will have to provide the \"cash\" necessary for the implementation of gender equality policies in the sense of the fifth criteria mentioned in the previous chapter: \uf0b7 the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) for candidate countries, \uf0b7 the European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI), \uf0b7 the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR), \uf0b7 the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) for geographic and thematic programmes worldwide, and \uf0b7 the European Development Fund (EDF) for African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries (Cotonou Agreement). For the DCI , for example, the total budget is 19 600 million euros for the period 2014 - 2020 to be distributed between geographic and thematic programmes. For thematic programmes , there's the Global Public Goods and Challenges budget where more than 5000 million euros is shared between 'human development', energy, CSOs, food security, and migration. 'Human development' will have at least 25% 6 (about 1250 million) of the budget to be shared among: health, education, gender equality, children, social protection, social inclusion, private development, and culture. While 70 million euros are earmarked for gender equality and another 70 million euros for children for the next 7 years, which includes also girls, it has to be noted that all measures financed by the envelope for human development always also address women and girls. There's a much bigger budget for geographical programmes . To measure how much is spent from this money on gender equality, DG DEVCO uses the OECD Development Assistance Committee Policy Marker for Gender (GMarker). The GMarker has three categories: \uf0b7 G0 - no gender equality objective has been included in the programme; \uf0b7 G1 - a programme is partially gender sensitive; and \uf0b7 G2 - a programme focuses specifically on gender equality. For 2013, EU ODA being 13 700 million euro, it can be concluded that more than 5 billion (39%) was allocated to gender sensitive objectives (G1 and G2). As in 2011 the percentage was 13%, the evolution seems to be promising. The goal for the next 7 years is to achieve 6 EP & Council decision ",

In 2017, there's going to be a mid-term review of the programming period and a strong analysis from a gender equality perspective should be carried out. Monitoring the results will have to be improved to make sure that gender equality forms part of the EU results framework. In addition, a measurement of the impact of EU's spending (affecting every group of people: women, men, boys and girls) must be carried out to know if the indicators used produce the correct results and, at the same time, to verify if these are aligned with the SDGs. 7 7 For further reading, please see The EU Budget for Gender Equality, in particular chapter 6.

        "Policy Department C: Citizens' Rights and Constitutional Affairs ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 14 5. KEY MESSAGES FOR THE CONFERENCE IN ADDIS ABABA KEY FINDINGS \uf0b7 The ten key messages of UNWomen include their support of concerted efforts by all stakeholders to transform the global economic and financial architecture by addressing the structural causes and consequences of gender inequality; the use of gender-responsive budgeting to ensure coherence of national planning, costing and budgeting processes with gender equality objectives; and the increase and commitment to clear contributions to gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment in official development assistance. Dagmar Schumacher, Director of the UNWomen office in Brussels, highlighted various events where success is needed in order to achieve the sustainable development agenda. Apart from the Conferences in Addis Ababa, New York and Paris (COP 21), she also mentioned the Collective Summit of UNWomen on 27th September 2015 on how to close the remaining implementation gaps of the BPfA, and the presentation of the global revision of UN Security Resolution 1325 at the end of October 2015. She also shared UNWomen's ten key messages for future financing in favour of gender equality 8 : 1. Recognize that the ambition of the new post-2015 development agenda will only be met if unprecedented levels of financing, in scale, scope, and quality are committed to implement the gender equality objectives of the agenda . Domestic, international, public and private sources and instruments of financing, including innovative sources of financing must be mobilized and effectively used to achieve the full and accelerated implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action, to meet commitments on the proposed gender equality goal (SDG 5) and gender sensitive targets in other SDGs. Prioritized, dedicated, and gender mainstreaming of resource allocation and investment is an urgent imperative. 2. Support concerted efforts by all stakeholders to transform the global economic and financial architecture by addressing the structural causes and consequences of gender inequality . An under-regulated global economic and financial system has widened income, gender, and geographic inequalities, and produced systemic crises - food, fuel and financial - that have disproportionately affected the livelihoods and wellbeing of women and girls. Austerity measures to manage the crises have resulted in significant cutbacks in essential public services, placing increased demands on women\u2019s unpaid care work to fill the gaps. A global and stable economic and financial system is one that rests not on generating wealth alone but on its redistribution to address inequalities. 8 UNWomen homepage: Transformative financing for gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment commitments: Expectations from Financing for Development Conference ",
        "Policy Hub Transformative financing and goals for gender equality and women's and girls' empowerment - Addis Ababa and New York 2015 ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 15 3. Ensure an enabling policy, regulatory and institutional environment for gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment . States are responsible for putting in place non-discriminatory and gender-responsive laws, institutions, and planning and budgeting systems and processes. States must also promote economic policies, both fiscal and monetary, that mobilize domestic resources by implementing progressive tax systems that fully integrate gender equality objectives and shift the tax burden to groups with higher incomes, especially corporations, the financial sector and extractive industries 4. Enable women\u2019s full and equal participation in the economy . States must promote policies that support the generation of decent work; reduce the gender wage gap; and recognize, reduce and redistribute care work as well as address the barriers women and women-owned businesses face in accessing financial services, new markets, investment, technology, skills and training. States should also prioritize investments in and ensure universal access to essential public services, including care services, social protection and infrastructure. 5. Promote the use of gender-responsive budgeting (GRB) to ensure coherence of national planning, costing and budgeting processes with gender equality objectives . Strengthened knowledge and capacity of States on GRB is needed to ensure the targeted allocation, transparency, and effectiveness of adequate resources to the implementation of policies in support of gender equality. States can also use gender-responsive budgeting to monitor public expenditures and analyze the effects of fiscal, including tax policy, and monetary policies on gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment as well as to strengthen accountability for gender equality commitments. 6. Promote a socially-responsible and accountable private sector for gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment . The private sector is an important actor, particularly in relation to job creation and infrastructure development. It must take full account of the gender implications of its investments as well as its own internal operations and support the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights as well as the Women\u2019s Empowerment Principles that set expectations for business to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment in the workplace, market and community. States are also responsible for regulating the private sector to ensure that their actions are aligned with national development strategies and for holding private actors accountable to the same human rights and environmental standards as public actors. 7. Increase and commit to clear contributions to gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment in official development assistance (ODA) . ODA must continue to be a dynamic driver for advancing gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment globally. To enhance and maximize the quality of gender equality-focused ODA, it should be targeted and mainstreamed across all sectors, not only in health and education but also in agriculture, water and sanitation, transport and energy. Donors must commit to clear allocations for gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment and ODA should be systematically screened against the DAC Gender Equality Creditor Reporting System to enable States to track these allocations and to take action on closing resource gaps in underfunded areas. ",
        "Policy Department C: Citizens' Rights and Constitutional Affairs ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 16 8. Adequately resource women\u2019s organizations at local, national, regional and global level . Women\u2019s organizations play a key role in demanding accountability of all stakeholders for the full implementation of and compliance to international norms and standards on gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment. Decisions on public spending and priority setting should be participatory and inclusive with adequate space and resources for women\u2019s organizations to participate and influence outcomes. Women\u2019s organizations must also be able to meaningfully participate in the design, implementation and monitoring of the post-2015 development agenda. 9. Eradicate global inequalities and power imbalances through a renewed global partnership for sustainable development . Global economic governance institutions must become more democratic in terms of developing country representation and gender balance. In addition, global trade, debt, finance and investment structures and agreements must undergo gender, human rights, and environmental impact assessments to ensure that they contribute to eliminating poverty and inequality within and between countries; promoting gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment; and enforcing core labour standards. In addition, a multilateral legal framework for sovereign debt restructuring processes as mandated by A/Res/68/304 should be established to safeguard women and the poor from any disproportionate impacts of debt restructuring. 10. Significantly invest in national statistical capacities to collect and analyse data disaggregated by sex, age groups, and other factors at national, regional and international levels . This data is essential for effective monitoring of the implementation of global and national commitments on gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment in the post-2015 sustainable development agenda, including in meeting financial commitments, as well as for determining more effective financing allocations.

OPPORTUNITIES AND ALSO THREATS KEY FINDINGS \uf0b7 There is a real risk of a \"priority overload\" given the high number of 17 goals and 169 targets in the proposed framework which could deprioritise the gender equality goal. \uf0b7 Sustainable development, social wellbeing and gender equality should be promoted through the coherent use of partner countries' own domestic resources, foreign direct investment, and the restructuring of external debt. \uf0b7 The need for impartial and gender-sensitive ex-ante impact assessments, also regarding the social costs of trade agreements, was generally underlined. \uf0b7 The following principles should be specifically included in the Addis Ababa outcome document: transparency, accessibility and accountability . Petra Debusscher from the University of Antwerp agreed with the opportunities mentioned above but also stressed the necessity to increase the financing package and commitment because gender equality and gender mainstreaming will not come for free in the post-2015 development framework. She referred to the slow and uneven progress in the implementation of the BPfA and the underinvestment in economic and productive sectors 9 . In this respect it was necessary to remember that gender equality was equal to social justice. One very critical remark is the risk of a \" priority overload \" given the high number of 17 goals and 169 targets in the proposed framework. This could lead to a deprioritisation of gender equality despite being a stand-alone goal. Complementing UNWomen's Key Messages, Petra Debusscher recommended the EU to maintain its strong position in gender equality and to reverse the underinvestment in women's empowerment. Furthermore, coherent policies and realising the aim of 0,7% of GNI for the financing of development cooperation would create the necessary conditions for a successful development cooperation framework. More particularly, her proposals were the following: \uf0b7 Sustainable development, social wellbeing and gender equality should be promoted through the coherent use of partner countries' own domestic resources, foreign direct investment, and the restructuring of external debt; \uf0b7 Public spending should be monitored and gender responsiveness in domestic resource mobilisation should be ensured through the Global Partnership Indicator on Gender Equality 10 .

She agreed with what was mentioned about domestic resource mobilisation in order to introduce a gender-sensitive tax structure and highlighted the Public Private Partnership's (PPPs) role. PPPs must ensure sustainability in human and women's rights. \uf0b7 States must promote policies that support the generation of decent work. \uf0b7 Financing in gender equality should be targeted and mainstreamed across all sectors, not only in the social sectors of health and education. \uf0b7 The EU should support partner countries in gender mainstreaming their budget and should better monitor EU delegation's practices in this respect. \uf0b7 All actors (EU, Member States and partner countries) should include a gender focus in every element of the development policy process such as, for example, expertise, recruitment, training, decision-making, etc. The need for impartial and gender- sensitive ex-ante impact assessments, also regarding the social costs of trade agreements, was generally underlined. \uf0b7 All actors should bring good practices to the table. \uf0b7 The following principles should be specifically included in the Addis Ababa outcome document: transparency, accessibility and accountability. The first two principles contribute to have important information available for financing decisions, which, as a consequence, strengthen governments' and donors' accountability for delivering their commitment to gender equality. To this end, a \"gender data revolution\" was essential. 11 Member of the Women's Working Group on Financing for Development. ",
