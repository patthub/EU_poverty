        "2 Using our natural resources far more efficiently is now an imper- ative, not an option. That is the message which comes through clearly in the Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe the Commission presented this autumn. This sets out a wide-ranging strategy to ensure a better align- ment between supply and demand, presenting clear milestones for different policy areas. It fleshes out the contribution which resource efficiency \u2013 one of the seven flagship initiatives in the Europe 2020 strategy \u2013 can input to the EU\u2019s overall objective of sustainable development. The European Union is making an equally strong contribution to a similar debate taking place globally. Next June, world lead- ers will meet in Rio de Janeiro to consider strategies to green the global economy, eradicate poverty and promote better governance. The EU has already staked out its opening position for the Rio+20 UN Sustainable Development Conference. This identifies the initiatives that could be taken to ensure the outcome of the conference is as ambitious as possible. The desire of countries to join the EU is also being used to raise environmental standards. Croatia, Iceland and Turkey are cur- rently involved in membership negotiations. To conclude these successfully, they must demonstrate they can fully implement all European legislation from the day they join the Union. The environmental obligations are particularly demanding and the Commission actively helps would-be members to meet their new obligations. Governments alone cannot deliver resource efficiency. That is why the European Commission has launched an extensive awareness-raising campaign to encourage the public to con- sider the environmental consequences of their behaviour and purchasing decisions. Similarly, cities can make a huge contribution to environmental goals as Hamburg, this year\u2019s European Green Capital, has clearly demonstrated. The competition for the 2014 laureate is now under way, giving the eventual winner the necessary time to prepare for the prestigious role.

The Train of Ideas began its lengthy journey on 15 April by heading north to Copenhagen, Malm\u00f6, Gothenburg and Oslo before turning south to Zurich, Munich and Warsaw. During its six-month odyssey, the sustainable urban living exhibition stopped over in Riga and Tallinn, Vienna, Brussels, Antwerp and Amsterdam, the French cities of Marseilles, Nantes and Paris, and reached as far south as Barcelona. The Train of Ideas contained seven carriages \u2013 six of which housed the exhibition \u2013 each looking at a different aspect of life in a green city, such as urban development and living, mobility, energy and climate protection, nature and city greenery, resource protection, economy and consumption. The exhibition presented Hamburg\u2019s own best practices and included a range of examples from other cities. The northern German city was also highly active on its own doorstep. During the year, it hosted the first Environmental Youth Summit and the first Environmental Law Conference. Other highlights included the international forum for development strategies for the waste resource sector, the \u2018goodgoods\u2019 exhibition \u2013 Germany\u2019s largest sustainable consumption trade fair \u2013 and the existence of over 80 local envi- ronmental tours. Full speed ahead Not only did Hamburg\u2019s train carry a green message from city to city, it also acted as a catalyst for various local environmentally friendly events during its journey. In Brussels, its arrival coincided with the inauguration of the Brussels, A Sustainable City exhibition. The exhibition, which focuses on different aspects of urban living \u2013 buildings, the local community and the city itself \u2013 illustrates how the Brussels Capital Region plans to make the Belgian capital a European model of sustainable development. Brussels Minister for the Environment, Energy and Urban Renovation, Evelyne Huytebroeck, used the occasion to announce that Brussels was an official candidate for the 2014 European Green Capital award.

Before they can even be opened, a would-be member must demonstrate that it meets the political and economic conditions \u2013 known as the Copenhagen criteria \u2013 EU leaders agreed at their summit in the Danish capital in 1993. That initial assessment is carried out by the Commission, which also conducts an early appraisal of the potential impact of mem- bership on key policy areas.

This becomes a legal commitment contained in the acces- sion treaty and can lead to court action if the timetable is not respected. Croatia closed the overall negotiations at the end of June 2011 and has received transi- tions for some key pieces of environmental legislation. These include urban waste water treatment (2023), landfills (2018) and indus- trial emissions (2017). One advantage of transition periods is that once a full EU member, a former candidate country will have access to greater amounts of EU funding than in the pre-accession stage to help put the necessary administra- tive capacity and infrastructure in place. Own pace Each candidate country is treated on its own merits and circumstances, and proceeds at its own pace towards its ultimate goal. That difference in tempo can be clearly seen in the progress being made by the three coun- tries currently negotiating accession to the Union \u2013 Croatia, Turkey and Iceland. Croatia\u2019s environment chapter was opened in February 2010 and closed in December of the same year. The same chapter for Turkey was also opened in February 2010 and for Iceland five months later, in July. Negotiations for the last two are ongoing. (cid:2) Find out more http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement issues which can cut across many different agencies, departments and stakeholders. It also helps to estimate the cost of apply- ing EU legislation. For Turkey, this is put at around EUR 70 billion and for Croatia at roughly EUR 10 billion for environmental measures alone. The Commission then submits an official screening report to Member States. This may recommend negotiations begin on a particular chapter or set out opening benchmarks that must be met before the process can begin. Once the Member States have given the green light, the candidate country presents an action plan containing its opening position, describing in detail how it will implement the necessary legisla- tion and requesting any transition periods. The Commission responds to this and can propose closing benchmarks that must be satisfied before negotiations are concluded. Once a chapter is closed, a monitoring exercise comes into play until accession. This requires the candidate country to pro- vide the EU with regular data setting out the progress it is making on alignment, administrative capacity and implementing legislation. The Commission also carefully scrutinises any infrastructure investment a future member makes to ensure it respects impact assessments and EU environmental legislation. The process of aligning legislation is far from easy and environmental laws are among the most complex and difficult. As a result, the Commission plays a prominent role in help- ing a candidate country with technical exper- tise, while some EU finance is also available. Transitional periods If a candidate country considers an individual item of legislation to be particularly onerous or expensive, it may request extra time to put it into effect after it joins the EU. These transi- tional periods, however, must comply with clear rules and be limited in time and scope. They are not given for framework legislation or measures to protect nature. The candidate country must submit a de tailed and technically solid imple men- tation plan with intermediary stages and a final date.

Since then a resolution of the European Parliament and EU Council Conclusions on Rio+20 have been adopted and build on this initial proposal. The thrust of the EU approach is to emphasise the impor- tance of sustainable management of resources and natural capital, in particular in developing countries since these are crucial tools in tack- ling poverty. These same countries are the first to be affected by climate change and environ- mental degradation as floods, droughts and other natural disasters undermine efforts for their economic and social development. Closely related to preparations on Rio+20, the EU resource efficiency Roadmap was adopted in September. Resource Efficiency is one of the seven flagship initiatives in the Europe 2020 strategy approved in 2010 (see article on page 8). The Roadmap aims to decouple the use of natural resources from economic growth, and to encourage changes in societal behaviour. Together with the EU's proposals on a low carbon econ- omy, it sets out what is needed to make Europe's economy sustainable by 2050. This package is the approach to the green econ- omy in the EU, building on the efficient and sustainable management of resources. Rio+20 represents a reflection of this strat- egy at the international level. EU proposals for Rio+20 The EU proposals for Rio+20 emphasise the need for agreement on a green economy Roadmap with clear international actions, Two decades after the first Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, world leaders will again meet in the Brazilian city next summer. This fourth summit will formally mark the 20th anniversary of that ground-breaking UN Conference on Environment and Development, and the 10th anniversary of the Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development. Since those landmark events, some progress has been made in tackling poverty and preventing environmental degradation. More of the planet\u2019s inhabitants now have access to education, healthcare and water, and between 2000 and 2005, over 120 mil- lion people rose above the \u2018dollar a day\u2019 benchmark. However, huge challenges remain. Some 1.6 billion people, mostly in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, still live in extreme poverty, one sixth of the world\u2019s popula tion is seriously undernourished, natural resources are being depleted (60 % are being used unsustainably), and greenhouse gas emis- sions are rising. Several Millennium Deve- lopment Goals are way behind schedule and progress is geographically uneven. In addition, the prospect of a world popu- lation of nine billion by 2050, growing urbanisation, the current economic crisis and the continuation of current consump- tion and production patterns will add extra pressures on the environment and finite natural resources. The forthcoming summit will assess areas where more efforts are required under two overarching themes. The first focuses on a green economy in the context of sustaina- ble development and poverty eradication. The second addresses the institutional framework for sustainable development. (cid:2) The Rio+20 UN Sustainable Development Conference in June 2012 will be a major opportunity to give impetus to the transition to a green global economy, eradicate poverty and promote better governance for sustainable development.

It pushes the economy to create more with less, delivering greater value with less input, using resources in a sustainable way and minimising their impact on the environment. \u00a9 i S t o c k p h o t o Demand and supply are increasingly going in different directions. While demand for food, feed and fibre may increase by 70 % by 2050, 60 % of the world\u2019s major ecosys- tems that help meet these needs have been degraded or are being used unsustainably. If resource use continues at the present rate, mankind will require the equivalent of more than two planets by 2050 to satisfy its needs and the hopes of millions for a better quality of life will be dashed. An idea of the scale of change required comes from the World Business Council for Sustainable Development. It estimates that by 2050, a four to tenfold increase in resource efficiency is necessary and that marked progress towards this goal should already be made by 2020. As Environment Commissioner Janez Poto\u010dnik, who is making resource efficiency one of his priorities, explains: \u2018Green growth is the only sustainable future for Europe and the world. Industry and environment need to work hand in hand. In the long term our interests are the same.\u2019 Way ahead The Resource Efficiency Roadmap develops in more detail the flagship initiative of the same name contained in the EU\u2019s 2020 strategy for The Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe the Commission published this autumn offers a coherent strategy to ensure our natural wealth is available to future generations. It emphasises that current practices are no longer sustainable. It contains milestones across different policy areas to arrive at a European economy within 40 years that provides a high standard of living with a much reduced impact on the environment. Charting a path towards resource efficiency The Roadmap presents in stark terms the scale of the problems ahead if there is not a sea change in economic, political and per- sonal behaviour. The days of plentiful supply of inexpensive resources \u2013 a key factor in the major economic progress made during the last two centuries \u2013 are over. Population growth and rising living stand- ards are increasing demand and raising the price and scarcity of natural resources like metals, minerals and foodstuffs we depend upon. Every day, the global popula- tion increases by 200 000. By the end of the next decade, an additional two billion peo- ple may have joined the high-consumption middle classes in developing countries.

It identifies some key resources whose efficient management is a priority: water, air, soil, marine and ecosystem services. It attaches specific medium-term milestones that should be reached by 2020 if the longer term goal is to be achieved. Three action areas are singled out as priori- ties: nutrition, construction and transport. Between them, the trio account for 70-80 % of all negative impacts on the environment. Waste offers a perfect example of the chal- lenges and opportunities. Three billion tonnes of waste are currently thrown away in Europe \u2013 and the figure is on the rise. Yet, Europe\u2019s recycling industry is highly advanced and is already making possible reuse of 40 % of our waste. With the right incentives, including strengthening markets for secondary materi- als, far more could be recycled producing valuable inputs at competitive prices. The Roadmap highlights some of the gen- eral themes which the EU and Member States must address to embed a resource efficient culture and proposes a mix of mar- ket-based policy instruments which national authorities could deploy. Prices, taxes and subsidies that fail to reflect the real societal costs of resource use and encourage unsustainable practices need to be overhauled and supply and demand created for green products. This could be stimulated through initiatives such as eco- design, eco-labels and green public pro- curement and by shifting the tax burden away from labour onto environmentally harmful activities. Encouragement should be given to the development and use of sustainable and innovative practices with the introduction of economic incentives that reward efficiency investments and favour longer-term thinking. The Roadmap also identifies the need for more research to deepen knowledge of nat- ural resources and their interdependencies, for higher public and private investment in R&D and technological innovation and more information and training opportunities. Beyond Europe Resource scarcity and depletion are global problems. Shortages of water, energy and raw materials undermine the development of many economies and can be a threat to stability and peace. While the Resource Efficiency Roadmap sets out what can and should be achieved within the Union, the EU is aware of its high global environmental footprint, and is also looking to advance the same themes and arguments globally (see article on page 6). Consumers have a key role to play in the move towards a more resource-efficient economy. As a result, the Commission has accompanied these policy initiatives with a wide-ranging awareness campaign (see article on page 10).

Your choices make a world of difference!\u2019, the Commission is inviting individuals to open their eyes to the impact their behaviour has on precious resources such as metals, timber and water, which are often taken for granted. The awareness campaign, which was launched by Environment Commissioner Janez Poto\u010dnik and Polish Environment Minister Andrej Kraszewski in Warsaw on 17 October, follows the recent presentation by the Commission of a communication on resource efficiency (see article on page 8). Every day we face important choices when we buy. The key message of the campaign is that we need to consume differently and think before choosing, taking into account the limits of the planet's resources. It is not directed against consumption, but it does urge people instead to take into account the environmental impact of their decisions. The campaign appears light-hearted and amusing, with shopping bags that burst into song, but it has a serious underlying mes- sage emphasising that individual choices make a world of difference.

The EU\u2019s Annual Growth Survey, part of the Europe 2020 strategy, addresses the need to intro- duce green tax reforms, prioritise sustainable growth-friendly expenditure and phase out environmentally harmful subsidies. A wide variety of MBIs already exist, operating locally (fees for cutting trees), nationally (levies on construction aggregate materials) and at European level (the European Emission Trading Scheme). Some Member States have advanced with green tax reforms and accumulated valuable experience in MBI implementation. In 2009, green taxes in front runners Denmark and the Netherlands contributed over 10 % of national tax revenues and supplied more than 4 % of respective national GDPs \u2013 at EU level the corresponding figures were 6.3 % and 2.4 %. Through the annual European Semester exercise, the progress Member States make in implementing MBIs is now monitored as part of the EU\u2019s wider eco- nomic strategy. However, obstacles, notably the failure to take all external costs into account, still need to be overcome. Market-Based Instruments Forum The harmonised introduction of any EU-level tax is hampered by the unanimity required for all taxation decisions. Moreover, action at EU level is not always justified; in some cases locally introduced measures are more effective. A public consultation on the \u2018Green paper on MBIs for the environment and related policy purposes\u2019 indicated that there has been a shift towards environmental taxation in some Member States and there are many areas where MBIs could be further developed and more widely applied. It also showed strong interest in a forum to provide a plat- form for exchange of best practices in using these policy tools. Preparation of the Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe gave further impetus to establishing the Market-Based Instruments Forum. Its first meeting took place in June 2011 and focused on the role of MBIs in achieving a resource-efficient economy as well as transport taxation. Chaired jointly by DGs Environment and Taxation and Customs Union, the meeting attracted a broad attendance from 22 Member States, Norway, Switzerland and Croatia, and confirmed a clear need for, and interest in, continuing discussion and exchange of MBI best practice. After the success of the inaugural forum, the Commission plans to host a similar event in late 2011 or early 2012.

This can have detrimental economic and social consequences, as well as harming human health and the environment. The key responsibility for ensuring effective implementation of EU legislation lies with national authorities. Environment Commis- sioner Janez Poto\u010dnik has made implemen- tation of EU environmental legislation a priority and is keen to encourage compli- ance and empower citizens through improved information systems and better oversight capacities in Member States. The Commission has replaced the ad hoc measures of the past with a more risk-based, systemic approach to enforcement. A stake- holder conference in June 2011 looked at ways to strengthen the twin pillars of this new strategy \u2013 better knowledge and improved governance. The way ahead Proper implementation requires knowledge of the legislation to be implemented, meas- ures taken and failings to be addressed, so the Commission is emphasising the impor- tance of a reliable and accessible knowledge base that conveys information to profession- als and public alike. Information and communication technology now offers possibilities and expectations that were inconceivable a few years ago. It can facilitate comprehensive national and European systems, giving citizens a clear pic- ture of the issues at stake. Implementation depends on many levels of responsibility, and all parts of this govern- ance structure need to be effective. The European Ombudsman has stated that national administrations should respond more directly to environmental complaints and concerns raised by the public, and that systems be in place to ensure they do so. The Commission believes that stronger, expanded rules on access to justice would boost enforcement and responsiveness at a local level. Much thought is also being given to improving national and EU-level inspection regimes, and developing exchange of best practice. This should address concerns about a level-playing field across the EU, and help with trans-boundary difficulties. The wider use of partnerships such as the EU Network for the Implementation and Enforcement of Environment Law (IMPEL) and Forum of Judges for the Environment is also being considered. The same principle could be developed with other stakehold- ers and Member State authorities, and the Commission is exploring the idea of partner- ship implementation agreements in this area. More details on these measures and other initiatives to improve implementation of EU environmental law and policy should be available in the course of 2012.

The project beneficiary built a system for mixing and heating the plastic waste using a technique known as \u2018thermal agglomeration\u2019. This zero-waste system generates high-density plastic granules suitable for re-moulding into new products. Ribawood used the out- put of its new process to create plastic pallets for transporting goods. Because the process leaves the plastic free from structural damage, the pallets can be recycled many times over. The beneficiary produced a total of 1 986 pal- lets over the three years of LIFE Reciplas, recy- cling 28 668 kg of plastic waste in the process (16 881 kg from Ribawood's own activities and 11 816 kg from a car bumper supplier). In addition to the plastic, this also saved an estimated 38 000 trees from being felled to make wooden pallets. Ribawood was able to produce up to 3 200 ton nes of recycled plastic pallets per year working a three-shift system, five days a week. The company calculates that produc- tion could increase to 4 480 tonnes/year if its recycling plant operated seven days a week. Clients see the benefits Being able to produce an eco-product is one thing: finding a market for it is another. Securing a contract for the plastic pallets with drinks manufacturer Heineken \u2013 which was keen to replace its wooden pallets for safety reasons \u2013 was an important economic mile- stone in the success of the Reciplas project. Ribawood continues to manufacture and market its recycled plastic pallets through its packaging division, Tarpack. LIFE Reciplas has particular relevance in the motor industry, where the EU's End-of-Life Vehicles Directive (2000/53/CE) requires that all vehicles must contain the highest possible proportion of recyclable materials. It also shows that by meeting the goals of the EU Waste Directive (91/156/CEE), Europe's busi- nesses can turn unwanted materials into com- petitive advantage. Now that LIFE Reciplas has proved the technical and financial viability of the thermal agglomeration process, it is hoped that other plastics recycling plants will start using this same technology.

Yet the thin layer of \u2018dirt\u2019 that covers much of the Earth\u2019s surface is vital to the environment and invaluable to our socie- ties. After oceans, soil is the planet\u2019s second largest active pool of carbon, but unsustainable land-management practices and changes in use are undermining this invaluable role. With the help of interesting graphics, this highly informative publication sets out the dangers of soil degradation and explains the com- plex links between soil and climate change.

Between 2007 and 2013, planned infrastructure investment in the collection or treatment of waste water will total some EUR 14 billion. Although these costs are con- siderable, the 6th Commission Summary on the Implemen tation of the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive concludes that much progress has been made. In the 15 Member States that were in the Union before 2004, waste water collection systems were in place for 99 % of the total polluting load. The 12 Member States which joined after that date still enjoy transitional periods, so their figure was 65 %, a figure that is clearly improving. Secondary treatment existed for 96 % of the load of the first group and 48 % for the second. The figures for more stringent treatment were 89 % and 27 % respectively. Despite those achievements, the report notes that improvements are still necessary.

The most striking successes have been extension of the Natura 2000 network to cover almost 18 % of the EU\u2019s land area, intro- duction of a comprehensive chemicals policy, and action on climate change. However, greater efforts are needed to implement EU goals and rules to improve biodiversity pro- tection and soil and water quality. The 6th EAP, which runs from 2002 to 2012, identifies seven thematic strategies: air, pesticides, waste prevention and recycling, natural resources, soil, and the marine and urban environment.
