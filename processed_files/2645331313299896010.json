        "FOREWORD If we take stock of these past few years, we can see that equality between women and men has made good progress. Despite this, inequalities remain. Women are employed in greater numbers and more women complete higher education degrees, even overtaking men. However, women are hit by unemployment in greater numbers than men (9.7% vs. 7.8%). European legislation has helped reduce the pay gap between women and men. Still, women earn, on average, 15% less than men and often remain confined to lower paid jobs. Several initiatives have been taken to improve reconciliation of family and working life. Nevertheless, women continue to take on the better part of the respon- sibility of caring for children and other dependents. Women continue to be under\u2013represented in political and economic decision-making. Women and girls continue to be victims of intolerable acts of violence. We cannot accept this in today's democratic society. We must break the glass ceiling once and for all. This is why the Commission adopted, on 1 March 2006, a Roadmap for Equality between Women and Men covering the period 2006-2010. This Roadmap paves the way for new actions in combination with existing successful ones. It reflects the Commission's commitment and determination to pursue its role. It is also a response to the requests of stakeholders at all levels \u2013 European institutions, Member States, social partners and civil society \u2013 to accelerate progress towards real equality. I am convinced that this new Roadmap for Equality between Women and Men will provide the necessary momen- tum to keep gender equality high on the political agenda and inspire us all to tackle this issue. I welcome the strong political signal given by the EU Heads of State and Government by adopting the European Pact for Gender Equality at the European Council in March 2006. The priorities of the Pact perfectly tie in with those of the Commission's Roadmap. I look forward to working in partnership with you all. In the meantime, I invite you to read more about the Roadmap and its priorities for action in the following pages.

        "7 INTRODUCTION This Roadmap outlines six priority areas for EU action on gender equality for the period 2006-2010: equal economic independence for women and men; reconcil- iation of private and professional life; equal represen- tation in decision-making; eradication of all forms of gender-based violence; elimination of gender stereo- types; promotion of gender equality in external and development policies. For each area, it identifies prior- ity objectives and actions. The Commission cannot alone achieve these objectives, as in many areas the centre of gravity for action lies at Member State level. Thus, this Roadmap represents the Commission's com- mitment to driving the gender equality agenda for- ward, reinforcing partnership with Member states, and other actors. This Roadmap builds on the experience of the Framework Strategy for equality between women and men 1 for the period 2001-2005. It combines the launch of new actions and the reinforcement of successful existing activities. It reaffirms the dual approach of gender equality based on gender mainstreaming (the promotion of gender equality in all policy areas and activities) and specific measures. Gender equality is a fundamental right, a common value of the EU, and a necessary condition for the achievement of the EU objectives of growth, employ- ment and social cohesion. The EU has made signifi- cant progress in achieving gender equality, thanks to equal treatment legislation, gender mainstreaming, specific measures for the advancement of women, action programmes, social dialogue and dialogue with civil society. The European Parliament has been an important partner for progress. Many women have attained the highest levels of education, entered the labour market and become important players in pub- lic life. Nevertheless, inequalities remain and may widen, as increased global economic competition requires a more flexible and mobile labour force. This can impact more on women, who are often obliged to choose between having children or a career, due to the lack of flexible working arrangements and care services, the persistence of gender stereotypes, and an unequal share of family responsibilities with men. Progress made by women, including in key areas for the Lisbon Strategy such as education and research, are not fully reflected in women's position on the labour market. This is a waste of human capital that the EU cannot afford. At the same time, low birth rates and a shrinking workforce threaten the EU\u2019s political and economic role. The EU remains an important partner in the global effort to promote gender equality. Turning globalisa- tion into a positive force for all women and men and fighting poverty are major challenges. Communication technologies make crimes such as human trafficking easier and more widespread. If the EU is to meet these challenges, progress towards gender equality must accelerate, and gender main- streaming must be strengthened in all policies and in particular in the areas identified in this Roadmap. 1 COM(2000) 335 T604202int 21/04/06 11:14 Page 7 ",

        "10 A ROADMAP FOR EQUALITY BETWEEN WOMEN AND MEN \u2013 2006-2010 1. Achieving Equal Economic Independence for Women and Men 1.1 Reaching the Lisbon employment targets The Lisbon employment targets call for a 60% employ- ment rate for women by 2010. At present, it is at 55.7% and is much lower (31.7%) for older women (55-64 years old). Women also have a higher unemployment rate than men (9.7% against 7.8%). The gender dimen- sion of the Lisbon strategy for jobs and growth must be strengthened. Compliance with equal treatment legis- lation and an effective use of the new Structural Funds (e.g. training, entrepreneurship measures) can help increase women's employment. The individualisation of rights linked to tax and benefit systems can also ensure that it pays for both women and men to work. 1.2 Eliminating the gender pay gap Despite EU legislation on equal pay, women earn 15% less than men 2 and this gap is decreasing at a much slow- er pace than the gender employment gap. Its persist- ence results from direct discrimination against women and structural inequalities, such as segregation in sec- tors, occupations and work patterns, access to education and training, biased evaluation and pay systems, and stereotypes. Tackling these issues requires a multifaceted approach and the mobilisation of all parties. 1.3 Women entrepreneurs Women constitute, on average, 30% of entrepreneurs in the EU. They often face greater difficulties than men in starting up businesses and in accessing finance and train- ing. The recommendations the EU Entrepreneurship Action Plan makes on increasing women\u2019s start-ups through better access to finance and the development of entrepreneurial networks need to be further imple- mented. 1.4 Gender equality in social protection and the fight against poverty Social protection systems should remove disincentives for women and men to enter and remain on the labour market, allowing them to accumulate individual pension entitlements. However, women are still likely to have shorter or interrupted careers and, therefore, fewer rights than men. This increases the risk of pover- ty, especially for single parents, older women or for women working in family-based businesses, such as agriculture and fisheries. The new European Fisheries Fund (EFF) and Rural Development policies (EAFRD) can improve women's situation in these sectors. It is essen- tial that social protection systems ensure that these women have access to adequate benefits, in particular when they retire. 1.5 Recognising the gender dimension in health Women and men are confronted with specific health risks, diseases, issues and practices impacting their health. These include environmental issues such as chemicals and pesticide use, as they are often transmit- ted during the pregnancy and through breast feeding. Medical research and many safety and health standards relate more to man and male-dominated work areas. Knowledge in this field should be improved and statis- tics and indicators further developed. Social, health and care services should be modernised with a view to improving their accessibility, quality and responsiveness to the new and specific needs of women and men. 1.6 Combating multiple discrimination, in particular against immigrant and ethnic minority women The EU is committed to the elimination of all discrimi- nation and the creation of an inclusive society for all. Women members of disadvantaged groups are often worse off than their male counterparts. The situation of ethnic minority and immigrant women is emblem- atic. They often suffer from double discrimination. This requires the promotion of gender equality in migration and integration policies in order to ensure women's rights and civic participation, to fully use their employ- ment potential and to improve their access to educa- tion and lifelong learning. 2 Unadjusted gap T604202int 21/04/06 11:14 Page 10 ",
        "11 PART I:PRIORITY AREAS OF ACTION FOR GENDER EQUALITY Facts & Figures * Women and men in the economy \u2013 bridging the gap The employment rate of women is still much lower than that of men, and women are more likely to work in less well-paid and less valued professions. For this reason, gen- der equality has been a key element of the European Employment Strategy since its launch in 1997. The Strategy aims at boosting women's employment by promoting the dual approach of gender mainstreaming and specific actions in the employment policy priorities that Member States detail each year in their National Reform Programmes. In 2000, Member States began working with common EU objectives to combat poverty and social exclusion. They are asked to mainstream gender in their national action plans. Gender equality is also an important element in the process that exists at EU level since 2001 for the modernisation of pension systems. Several Member States are progressively adapting their systems in accordance with existing Community law and in the light of the higher labour mar- ket participation of women and aspirations to greater gen- der equality. Gender equality is an overarching objective in the new Open Method of Coordination covering social inclusion, pensions as well as health and long-term care. The European Commission has addressed the question of employment and social inclusion of immigrants through the European Employment Strategy, as well as through the Social Inclusion Process. The Communication on a Common Agenda for Integration adopted by the Commission in 2005 has put forward the framework for the integration of third-country nationals, including the integra- tion of immigrant women into all aspects of society. A key role is played by the Structural Funds, and in particular the European Social Fund which devoted 6% of its global amount for the period 2000-2006 to gender specific actions. Equality between women and men was also within the objectives of the four Community initiatives for 2000-2006: EQUAL, INTERREG, URBAN II and LEADER +. The European Commission has addressed the issue of female entrepreneurship in several instances including by providing financial support through the Structural Funds. With the Entrepreneurship Action Plan adopted in 2004, the Commission works with the Member States to address actions in the areas of finance, entrepreneurial networks and social security of new small business owners, includ- ing co-helping partners. * The information above is taken from the Impact Assessment document SEC (2006) 275. \u00a9 C a r l C o r d o n n i e r / D a i l y l i f e T604202int 21/04/06 11:14 Page 11 ",

        "2. Enhancing Reconciliation of Work, Private and Family Life 2.1 Flexible working arrangements for both women and men Reconciliation policies help create a flexible economy, while improving the quality of women's and men's lives. They help people enter and stay on the labour market, using the full potential of the workforce and must be equally available to women and men. Flexible working arrangements boost productivity, enhance employee satisfaction and employer's reputations. However, the fact that far more women than men make use of such arrangements creates a gender imbalance which has a negative impact on women's position in the workplace and their economic inde- pendence. 2.2 Increasing care services Europe has to face a threefold challenge: a shrinking working age population, low birth rates and a growing population of older people. Better work-life balance arrangements are part of the answer to the demo- graphic decline by offering more affordable and acces- sible childcare facilities, as required by the Barcelona targets 8 , and providing services that meet the care needs of the elderly and of people with disabilities. The quality of these services should be improved and the qualifications of staff, mainly women, developed and better valued. 2.3 Better reconciliation policies for both women and men Services and structures are adapting too slowly to a situation where both women and men work. Few men take parental leave or work part-time (7.4% compared to 32.6% for women); women remain the main carers of children and other dependants. Men should be encouraged to take up family responsibilities, in partic- ular through incentives to take parental and paternity leaves and to share leave entitlements with women. 14 A ROADMAP FOR EQUALITY BETWEEN WOMEN AND MEN \u2013 2006-2010 Key actions The Commission will \u2022 present in 2006 a Communication on Demography 9 addressing the issue of reconciliation of family and work life \u2022 support the achievement of the Barcelona targets on childcare and the development of other care facilities through the Structural Funds and the exchange of good practices \u2022 support research on health and social sectors pro- fessions and work with international organisa- tions towards a better classification of these jobs. 8 The provision of childcare by 2010 to at least 90% of children between 3 years old and the mandatory school age and at least 33% of children under 3 years of age 9 Follow-up of COM(2005)94 T604202int 21/04/06 11:14 Page 14 ",
        "15 PART I:PRIORITY AREAS OF ACTION FOR GENDER EQUALITY Facts & Figures * Both women and men need work-life balance Women are still the main carers of children and other dependants such as the elderly, and the more children women have, the lower their employment rate. Moreover, women spend on average almost four hours per day on domestic work, while men devote a little over two hours. As for parental leave, although it is guaranteed by European legislation to both parents and the majority of men know they have a right to it, they do not take it. Lastly, experi- ence shows that Member States with effective policies enabling both women and men to balance work and family responsibilities have higher fertility rates and a higher employment rate for women. In light of this, reconciliation policies for both women and men are an important feature of the European Employment Strategy. The provision of care facilities for children in the context of the Barcelona targets, as well as for other depen- dants, is essential to a successful work-life balance as are flexible work arrangements. With this in mind, the Commission promotes the exchange of good practices between Member States, and ensures that the Structural Funds finance structures and projects to promote reconcil- iation. The EQUAL initiative, in particular, has been pro- moting innovative approaches in this field. * The information above is taken from the Impact Assessment document SEC (2006) 275. \u00a9 C a r l C o r d o n n i e r / D a i l y l i f e T604202int 21/04/06 11:14 Page 15 ",
        "3. Promoting Equal Participation of Women and Men in Decision-Making 3.1 Women's participation in politics Women's persistent under-representation in political decision-making is a democratic deficit. Women's active citizenship and participation in politics and in senior management public administration at all levels (local, regional, national, European) should be further promoted. The availability of EU-comparable and reli- able data remains a priority. 3.2 Women in economic decision-making A balanced participation of women and men in eco- nomic decision-making can contribute to a more pro- ductive and innovative work environment and culture and better economic performance. Transparency in promotion processes, flexible working arrangements, and availability of care facilities are essential. 3.3 Women in science and technology The participation of women in science and technology can contribute to increasing innovation, quality and competitiveness of scientific and industrial research and needs to be promoted. In order to reach the target 10 of 25% women in leading positions in public sector research, policies should be implemented and progress monitored. Further networking and availability of EU data are essential. 16 A ROADMAP FOR EQUALITY BETWEEN WOMEN AND MEN \u2013 2006-2010 10 Council Conclusions 18-04-05 Key actions The Commission will \u2022 monitor and promote gender mainstreaming in particular in: \u2013 the European research policy and the 7 th Framework Programme, including by ensuring the implementation of Gender Action Plans, developing gender specific research, monitor- ing gender mainstreaming and women's par- ticipation in the announced European Research Council \u2013 the Education and Training 2010 Programme by promoting women\u2019s access to scientific and technical careers in line with the European objective of redressing the gender imbalance in this field; develop in 2007 a European Guide of Best Practices on ICT Gender Issues \u2013 the implementation of the future Citizens for Europe Programme by including gender equality in the field of active citizenship as one of the priority themes, and through mobilisation of existing networks \u2022 establish in 2007 an EU network of women in economic and political decision-making positions \u2022 support awareness-raising activities, the exchange of good practices and research, including on the basis of the European database on women and men in decision-making, particularly in view of the European Parliament elections in 2009.

        "17 PART I:PRIORITY AREAS OF ACTION FOR GENDER EQUALITY Facts & Figures * Fair representation means better decision- making Despite considerable progress over the last few years, women are still under-represented in political and econ- omic decision-making and in leadership positions in most EU countries. While there are major differences among countries, the Commission\u2019s database on women and men in decision-making shows that in 2005 women made up only an average of 22% of senior ministers, 23% of mem- bers of the lower house of parliament and 20% of the upper house. Results are also poor for the private sector, where women represent just 10% of the members of the highest decision-making bodies of the top 50 publicly quoted companies and only 3% of the presidents of these bodies. The promotion of gender equality in science is one of the areas where EU intervention has been most successful with strong political commitment and adequate human resources. In 1999, the Commission adopted an Action Plan on Women in Science, in co-operation with Member States and other key actors. Since the launch of the action plan, the European Commission has sought to promote gender equal- ity in scientific research both through specific policy-orient- ed actions (in the context of the so-called Policy Forum) and through gender mainstreaming measures within the Research Framework Programmes (the Gender Watch System). It has also worked closely with national authorities through the Helsinki Group on Women and Science to structure and coordinate policy debate at European level. * The information above is taken from the Impact Assessment document SEC (2006) 275.

        "4. Eradicating Gender-based Violence and Trafficking 4.1 Eradication of gender-based violence The EU is committed to combating all forms of vio- lence. Women are the main victims of gender-based violence. This is a breach of the fundamental right to life, safety, freedom, dignity and physical and emotion- al integrity. Violation of these rights cannot be tolerat- ed or excused on any ground. Prevention is essential and requires education and knowledge, the develop- ment of networking and partnership, and the exchange of good practices. Urgent action is needed to eliminate customary or traditional harmful attitudes and practices, including female genital mutilation, early and forced marriages, and honour crimes. 4.2 Elimination of trafficking in human beings Human trafficking is a crime against individuals and a violation of their fundamental rights. It is a form of modern slavery to which poverty-stricken women and children, in particular girls, are more vulnerable. Its elimination requires a combination of preventive measures, criminalisation of trafficking through ade- quate legislation, and protection and assistance to vic- tims 11 . Measures to discourage the demand for women and children for sexual exploitation must be further developed. This approach is reflected in the EU Action on trafficking in human beings 12 . The Directive on resi- dence permits for victims of trafficking 13 will provide a new tool for the reintegration of victims through access to the labour market, vocational training and education. Synergies with the ESF should be fully exploited. The EU should develop comparable data to yearly assess trafficking in each country. 18 A ROADMAP FOR EQUALITY BETWEEN WOMEN AND MEN \u2013 2006-2010 Key actions The Commission will \u2022 issue a Communication on the establishment of a system for comparable statistics on crime, victims and criminal justice in 2006 and monitor progress at EU level \u2022 support Member States and NGOs in their efforts to eradicate gender-based violence, including customary or traditional harmful practices, by promoting awareness-raising campaigns, sup- porting networking, exchange of good practices and research, and by implementing programmes for victims as well as perpetrators, encouraging Member States to establish national action plans \u2022 follow up on the Communication and the EU Action Plan on trafficking in human beings and promote the use of all existing instruments, including the ESF, for the reintegration into soci- ety of victims of violence and human trafficking. 11 COM(2005)514 12 OJ C 311, 9/12/05, p.1. 13 Dir. 2004/81/EC T604202int 21/04/06 11:14 Page 18 ",
        "19 PART I:PRIORITY AREAS OF ACTION FOR GENDER EQUALITY Facts & Figures * Women are the primary victims Gender-based violence and trafficking in women are unfor- tunately widespread realities. Many children \u2013 mainly girls \u2013 are exploited every year in the sex industry or are subject to coercive sexual relations or forced marriages, and are infected with HIV. There is a strong link between sexual exploitation and high levels of poverty and these situations almost always involve children and women. The fight against violence forms part of the overall EU objec- tive of providing citizens with a high level of protection from violence and enabling them to lead healthy lives. The European Commission, through the Daphne II Programme, has financed targeted actions to fight violence against women and children and to protect victims and groups at risk. More than half of the 420 projects funded under Daphne since 1997 have implemented actions to prevent violence or to help women who are victims of violence. The fifth and sixth Research Framework Programmes have also supported projects addressing gender-based human rights violations. The European Commission has also taken several initiatives to combat trafficking in human beings and their exploitation. These include mainstreaming EU counter-trafficking policy in employment and social affairs, EU enlargement, external rela- tions and development; establishing the AGIS programme on police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters; providing funding through the Daphne II programme; setting up a con- sultative Expert Group on Trafficking in Human Beings; and adopting in 2005 a Communication on fighting trafficking in human beings that contributed to the Action Plan on Trafficking in Human Beings. The Commission also provides funding through the European Social Fund for initiatives for the reintegration of victims of trafficking. \u00a9 C o r b i s * The information above is taken from the Impact Assessment document SEC (2006) 275.

        "5. Eliminating Gender Stereotypes in Society 5.1 Elimination of gender stereotypes in education, training and culture Education, training and culture continue to transmit gender stereotypes. Women and men often follow tra- ditional education and training paths, which often place women in occupations that are less valued and remunerated. Policy should focus on combating gender stereotypes from an early age, providing awareness training to teachers and students, and encouraging young women and men to explore non-traditional educational paths. The education system should pro- vide young people with adequate qualification. Therefore, it is also important to tackle the phenome- non of early school leaving, which affects more boys than girls. 5.2 Elimination of gender stereotypes in the labour market Women still face both horizontal and vertical segrega- tion. Most of them continue to be employed in sectors traditionally occupied by women, which are typically less recognised and valued. Moreover, they generally occupy lower echelons of the organisational hierarchy. It is as important to facilitate women\u2019s entry into non- traditional sectors as it is to promote men's presence in sectors traditionally occupied by women. Anti-discrimi- natory laws should be enforced, and training and incentives provided. 5.3 Elimination of gender stereotypes in the media The media have a crucial role to play in combating gen- der stereotypes. They can contribute to presenting a realistic picture of the skills and potential of women and men in modern society and avoid portraying them in a degrading and offensive manner. Dialogue with stakeholders and awareness-raising campaigns should be promoted at all levels. 20 A ROADMAP FOR EQUALITY BETWEEN WOMEN AND MEN \u2013 2006-2010 Key actions The Commission will \u2022 support actions to eliminate gender stereotypes in education, culture and on the labour market by promoting gender mainstreaming and specific actions in the ESF, ICT programmes and in EU edu- cation and culture programmes, including EU Lifelong Learning strategy and the future Integrated Lifelong Learning programme \u2022 support awareness-raising campaigns and exchange of good practices in schools and enter- prises on non-stereotyped gender roles and develop dialogue with media to encourage a non-stereotyped portrayal of women and men \u2022 raise awareness on gender equality in dialogue with EU citizens through the Commission's plan for Democracy, Dialogue and Debate 14 . 14 COM(2005)494 T604202int 21/04/06 11:14 Page 20 ",
        "21 PART I:PRIORITY AREAS OF ACTION FOR GENDER EQUALITY Facts & Figures * Stereotypes perpetuate inequalities Women and men still follow gender stereotyped education and training paths \u2013 often leading to a concentration of women in lower wage job sectors and a waste of human resources. In response to this, the European Commission has, over the years, been promoting a number of measures to fight gender stereotypes, including through educational and cultural programmes and sport. It engages in dialogue with stakeholders and the media, supports awareness-rais- ing actions and promotes men's role in reconciliation poli- cies, including by encouraging fathers to take parental leave and assume more responsibility in managing the household. The European Commission also supports actions and proj- ects that aim at improving career guidance for both women and men interested in pursuing non-traditional careers. It also funds initiatives, including through the European Social Fund, to improve women's level of qualifications, particu- larly in the scientific and technical fields and in new tech- nologies, and to prepare women for better access to man- agement posts in the public and private sectors. The pro- motion of gender equality is specifically included in the pri- mary objectives of programmes such as Socrates, Leonardo da Vinci or Youth programme, with the obligation to assess the achieved results. \u00a9 T o n P o o r t v l i e t / H H * The information above is taken from the Impact Assessment document SEC (2006) 275.

        "6. Promoting of Gender Equality Outside the EU 6.1 Enforcement of EU legislation in acceding, candidate and potential candidate countries 15 Countries joining the EU must fully embrace the funda- mental principle of equality between women and men. They must ensure strict enforcement of legislation and put in place adequate administrative and judicial sys- tems. Monitoring the transposition, implementation and enforcement of the EU gender equality legislation will be an EU priority for future enlargement processes. 6.2 Promotion of gender equality in the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), external and development policies Gender equality is a goal in itself, a human right and contributes to reducing poverty. The EU is a key player in international development efforts and adheres to internationally recognised principles such as the Millennium Development Declaration and the Beijing Platform for Action (BPfA). It has reaffirmed gender equality as one of the five key principles of the devel- opment policy in the European Consensus on develop- ment 16 . The new EU Strategy for Africa 17 includes gen- der equality as a key element in all partnerships and national development strategies. The EU is committed to promoting gender equality in external relations, including in the ENP. EU humanitarian interventions take particular account of the specific needs of women. Across the world, the EU will continue to promote edu- cation and a safe environment for girls and women, sexual and reproductive health and rights, the empow- erment of women, which contribute to fighting HIV/AIDS, and the fight against female genital mutila- tion. Women's participation in economic, political life and decision-making, in conflict prevention and resolu- tion, peace building and reconstruction need to be fos- tered by the EU and its Member States. 22 A ROADMAP FOR EQUALITY BETWEEN WOMEN AND MEN \u2013 2006-2010 Key actions The Commission will \u2022 monitor and raise awareness on the transposi- tion, implementation and effective enforcement of the Community acquis on gender equality in the acceding, candidate and potential candidate countries, including in the programming of pre- accession aid and in accession negotiations \u2022 monitor and promote gender mainstreaming and specific measures in the ENP, EU external relations and development policies, at policy dialogue and programming levels (Country Strategic Papers and Poverty Reduction Strategic Papers). At implemen- tation level, particular attention will be devoted to gender mainstreaming in the new aids modalities (budget support and sector programmes) \u2022 present in 2006 a Communication on A European Vision on Gender Equality in Development Cooperation \u2022 promote gender mainstreaming in EC humanitar- ian aid operations by including the gender dimen- sion as a part of thematic and technical reviews (including for capacity building) and evaluations \u2022 strengthen gender equality in the Mediterranean region, including by organising in 2006 a Euromed Ministerial Conference on gender equality, pre- ceded by a civil society consultation, which could lead to the adoption of an action plan \u2022 contribute to the achievements of the BPfA and other relevant international and regional con- ventions by supporting programmes, capacity building and data collection capacity in develop- ing countries \u2022 contribute to the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 (2000) on women and peace and security, including by developing in 2006 guidelines on gender mainstreaming in cri- sis management training activities \u2022 promote women's organisations and networks. 15 Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Montenegro, including Kosovo.

        "23 PART I:PRIORITY AREAS OF ACTION FOR GENDER EQUALITY Facts & Figures * Equality is crucial beyond Europe too In the context of enlargement of the European Union, the European Commission is helping the potential and future member states to introduce European gender equality leg- islation in national law. It supports and monitors the imple- mentation and effective enforcement of national legislation as part of the process of preparing new countries for EU membership. The EU and its Member States are also leading partners in the global effort to reduce gender inequalities and promote women\u2019s rights \u2013 most notably in the framework of the United Nations. And the EU is strongly committed to gender policy in its development cooperation and individual relations with third countries. It promotes the dual approach of gender mainstreaming and specific actions \u2013 and acknowledges that gender equality is closely linked to the overarching development goal of reducing poverty. The Commission also adopted the Programme of Action for the Mainstreaming of Gender Equality in Community Development Co-operation (2001-2006), which establish- es a strategy for integrating gender issues into the priority areas of EU development co-operation. * The information above is taken from the Impact Assessment document SEC (2006) 275.

        "Gender equality can only be achieved with a clear com- mitment at the highest political level. The Commission promotes gender equality within its own ranks 18 and supports a number of structures 19 working on gender issues, which have led to significant progress. However, major progress still has to be achieved in the key areas identified in this Roadmap and this requires better governance at all levels: EU institutions, Member States, parliaments, social partners and civil society. The support of gender equality Ministers is essential: their regular meetings and presidency conferences support- ed by the Commission are important opportunities for dialogue and monitoring. The European Pact for Gender Equality demonstrates the commitment at the highest political level in the Member States to increase efforts to achieve gender equality in partnership with the Commission. The planned European Institute for Gender Equality 20 will provide expertise, improving knowledge and heightening visibility on gender equality. The Structural Funds, financial programmes in different policy areas, and the future PROGRESS programme will support the implementation of this Roadmap. The implementation of gender equality methodologies such as gender impact assessment and gender budgeting (the imple- mentation of a gender perspective in budgetary process) will promote gender equality and provide for greater transparency and enhance accountability. Key actions The Commission will \u2022 reinforce its structures \u2013 take part, in 2007, in the setting up of the European Institute for Gender Equality \u2013 monitor progress in gender equality in the human resources policy in the Commission and present, in 2007, a Communication on the achievement of targets set for its Committees and Expert Groups 21 ; facilitate training on gender equality for its staff, including man- agement and staff working in external and development cooperation fields \u2022 reinforce networking and support social dialogue \u2013 create in 2006 an EU network of Gender Equality Bodies set up in compliance with Directive 2002/73 \u2013 reinforce EU-level cooperation with NGOs, including dialogue with women's organisations and with other civil society organisations \u2013 encourage and support the work of Social Partners on gender equality at both cross- industry and sectoral levels \u2022 support gender impact assessment and gender budgeting \u2013 reinforce the implementation of a gender per- spective in the impact assessment 22 of Community policies and legislation and explore the possibilities of developing gender budgeting at EU level, particularly in the Structural Funds within the possibilities of the shared management \u2013 encourage gender budgeting at local, regional and national level, including through exchange of best practices \u2022 reinforce the effectiveness of legislation \u2013 review the existing EU gender equality legisla- tion not included in the 2005 recast exercise 23 with a view to updating, modernising and recasting where necessary \u2013 monitor implementation and enforcement of EU gender equality legislation \u2013 inform EU citizens on their gender equality rights through the \"Your Europe\" 24 portal and the Citizens' Signpost Service 25 . 26 A ROADMAP FOR EQUALITY BETWEEN WOMEN AND MEN \u2013 2006-2010 18 Annex III 19 Annex II 20 COM(2005) 81 21 2000/407/EC 22 SEC(2005) 791 23 COM(2004)279 24 http://europa.eu.int/youreurope/nav/fr/citizens/home.html 25 http://europa.eu.int/citizensrights/signpost/front_end/index_fr.htm T604202int 21/04/06 11:14 Page 26 ",

They have been selected for their relevance to describe the sit- uation of gender equality in the different areas, also tak- ing into account the availability of EU-comparable data. The majority of these indicators exist already and are used to monitor progress in EU processes, in particular in the Strategy for growth and jobs. They are also used in the annual Report on equality between women and men that the Commission presents to the Spring European Summit. In some areas, work is in progress either to develop indicators or to develop comparable data at EU level. This work is being done in cooperation with Member States and Eurostat. Moreover, Member States, in cooperation with the Commission, have developed indicators for the fol- low-up of the 12 critical areas of concern of the Beijing Platform for Action. In 2005, the 10 th anniver- sary of the Platform, Member States committed them- selves to continue to develop indicators in the missing areas. The 12 critical areas of concern of the Beijing Platform for Action are: Women and Poverty; Education and Training of Women; Women and Health; Violence against Women; Women and Armed Conflict; Women and the Economy; Women in Power and Decision Making; Institutional Mechanisms for the Advancement of Women; Human Rights of Women; Women and the Media; Women and Environment; The Girl Child. 1.

        "The Group of Commissioners on Fundamental Rights, Non-Discrimination and Equal Opportunities was creat- ed on the initiative of the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, in 2005. It succeeds the Group of Commissioners on equal opportunities which was active since 1996. Its mandate is to drive policy and ensure the coherence of Commission action in the areas of funda- mental rights, anti-discrimination, equal opportunities and the social integration of minority groups, and to ensure that gender equality is taken into account in Community policies and actions, in accordance with Article 3\u00a72 of the Treaty. The group is chaired by the President of the Commission. Other members of the group are Commissioners for Justice, Freedom and Security; for Institutional Relations and Communication Strategy; for Administration, Audit and Anti-fraud; for Information Society and Media; for Education, Training, Culture and Multilingualism; for Enlargement; for Development and Humanitarian Aid; for External Relations and European Neighbourhood Policy; for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities. It meets 3-4 times per year and it holds an extraordinary meeting with a focus on gender equality, normally on the 8 th of March, on the occasion of the International Women's Day. This extraordinary meeting is enlarged to external participants, such as members of the EU Parliament, the Economic and social committee, the Committee of the regions, the Presidency of the EU and representatives of women's organisations. The Inter-service Group on gender equality was creat- ed in 1996. It brings together representatives of all Commission services responsible for gender equality in all Directorates Generals. It is chaired by DG Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities who convenes regular meetings. Its main task is to develop a gender mainstreaming approach in all EC policies and programmes and to contribute to and co- ordinate activities in the framework of the annual work programme on gender equality prepared by the Commission services. The Advisory Committee on equal opportunities for women and men was created in 1981 by a Commission Decision then amended in 1995. (Commission Decision of 19 July 1995 amending Decision 82/43/EEC of 9 December 1981) . The Committee assists the Commission in formulating and implementing the Community's activities aimed at promoting equal opportunities for women and men, and fosters ongoing exchanges of relevant experience, poli- cies and practices between the Member States and the various parties involved. It is formed by one representa- tive per Member State from ministries or government departments responsible for promoting equal opportuni- ties; one representative per Member State from national committees or bodies having specific responsibility for equal opportunities between women and men; five members representing employers' organisations at Community level; five members representing workers' organisations at Community level. Two representatives of the European Women's Lobby shall attend meetings of the Committee as observers. Representatives of interna- tional and professional organisations and other associa- tions making duly substantiated requests to the Commission may be given observer status. The Committee meets normally twice per year. The High Level Group on gender mainstreaming is an informal group created in 2001 following a commitment made by the Commission in its 5 th Framework strategy on gender equality (COM(2000) 335 final) and the polit- ical support of EU gender equality ministers. This is an informal group made by high level representatives responsible for gender mainstreaming at national level. It is chaired by the Commission who convenes regular meetings twice per year, in close collaboration with the Presidency. Among its main tasks, the Group supports presidencies in identifying policy areas and topics rele- vant to address during presidencies in order to achieve gender equality. The Group is also the main forum for planning the strategic follow-up of the Beijing Platform for action, including the development of indicators. Since 2003 the Group also assists the Commission in the preparation of the Report on Equality between women and men to the European Council. The High Level Group on gender mainstreaming in the Structural Funds is an informal group created in 2004 made by high level representatives responsible for Structural Funds at national level in the Member States. Candidate countries are given the status of observers. It is chaired by the Commission who convenes at least one meeting per year. The mandate of this group expires end of 2006 but Commission and Member States can decide to continue its works after this date. The HLG acts as a network to give input on gender mainstreaming to the authorities managing Structural Funds implementation. It is also a forum to exchange best practice and experience of implementing gender mainstreaming in the structural funds at national level. 34 A ROADMAP FOR EQUALITY BETWEEN WOMEN AND MEN \u2013 2006-2010 T604202int 21/04/06 11:14 Page 34 ",

The Advisory Committee on women and rural areas was created in 1998. It is made up of representatives of socio- economic organisations (agricultural producers, trade, consumers, the European Women Lobby and workers). The Commission convenes meetings once or twice per year. Its aim is to provide for exchange of views and advice between the European Commission and the European socio-economic sectors on the rural develop- ment policy and specifically on its gender aspects. The informal Group of Experts on Gender Equality in development cooperation met for the first time in 1999. It is formed by Member States' gender experts and chaired by the Commission that convenes meetings annually. Its aim is to discuss policy developments in relation to gender and development in the context of EU and international major events. The Helsinki Group on Women and Science was esta- blished in 1999. It consists of national representatives from all the EU Member States, Bulgaria, Romania, Iceland, Israel, Norway, Switzerland and Turkey. The Group aims to promote the participation and equality of women in the sciences on a Europe-wide basis. It provides an important forum for dialogue about national policies. Recognising the value of net- working and mutual support among women scientists, the group also helps explore the ways in which the potential, skills and expertise of women could best be secured, and for sharing and comparing experiences. The Helsinki Group also helps the Commission build a clear picture of the situation on the ground at the national level. It has, in particular, appointed national statistical correspondents to help the Commission gath- er and compile sex-disaggregated statistics and build gender-sensitive indicators. The European Network to Promote Women\u2019s Entrepreneurschip (WES) (see: http://europa.eu.int/ comm/entreprise/entrepreneurship/craft/craft-women/ wes.htm) was created in 2000. It is composed of repre- sentatives from the national governments and institu- tions responsible for the promotion of female entre- preneurship in 27 countries from the EU, EEA and can- didate countries. The Commission convenes meetings with WES twice a year which are aimed at exchanging information and good practices in the promotion of female entrepreneurship. Some members of the net- work have also participated in common European projects. The Expert Group on Trafficking in Human Beings is a consultative group that was set up in 2003 and consists of 20 persons appointed as independent expert. The Commission consults the expert group on any matter relating to trafficking in human beings. The Expert Group shall issue opinions or reports to the Commission at the latter's request or on its own initiative, taking into due consideration the recommendations set out in the Brussels Declaration. The informal Network of gender focal points is formed by representatives of Directorates General of the Commission dealing with external relations and deve- lopment co-operation as well as representatives of EC delegations. The Network of focal points on equal opportunities was set up in 2004 and is formed by representatives of all Directorates General of the Commission in charge of human resources. It aims at ensuring a proper imple- mentation of the Fourth Action Programme for Equal Opportunities for Women and Men at the European Commission, therefore contributing to the respect of gender equality in the human resources policy of the Commission.

        "Achievements, challenges and existing obstacles to incorporating equality between men and women into the human resource management policies of the Commission The policy of equal opportunities between female and male staff has been in place in the Commission since 1988. The Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Communities have, since 1 May 2004, prohib- ited discrimination on the basis of the sex, as well as for other reasons, and specifically provide for measures and actions to promote equal opportunities between men and women (Article 1d). This legal framework makes it possible to take actions to incorporate gender equality into various aspects of the management of human resources. Since 1995, the Commission had been setting annual objectives for the recruitment and appointment of women to the Category A posts, with the objective of reaching parity in the long term. The objectives laid down for 2005 were 20% for senior management, 30% for middle management and 50% for non-manage- ment administrator posts. In addition, the 4 th Action Programme for Equal Opportunities between women and men in the European Commission was adopted on 28 th April 2004 (SEC (2004) 447/5). It covers the period 2004-2008 and schedules, in particular, measures aimed at improving the male/female balance among the staff, awareness- raising campaigns and measures to improve the recon- ciliation of professional/private life. The implementa- tion of this Programme was mainly decentralised to the Directorates-General but was also the subject of a fol- low-up and a political guidance by the Directorate- General for Personnel and Administration. The first implementation report, relating to 2004, was adopted by the Commission on 23 rd November 2005 (SEC (2005) 1492/3). Among other things, it showed that \u2013 despite the clear improvements achieved during the last ten years \u2013 women continued to be under-rep- resented in 2004 in the category of the Administrators (31.8%), and particularly in middle management (18.3%) and senior management (12.8%) and that the recruitment targets were not achieved. However, the concrete measures included in the 4 th Action Programme have started to bear fruit, as the next implementation report for 2005 will show (presenta- tion envisaged in September 2006). Principal policy initiatives and deadlines for the period concerned (2007 \u2013 2010) \u2022 Adoption of the Annual Implementation Reports of the 4 th Action Programme and development of mon- itoring and evaluation indicators in this context (2005 to 2008) \u2022 External evaluation of the 4 th Action Programme in 2008 and formulation of recommendations for the future \u2022 Adoption of a 5 th Action Programme for the period 2009 \u2013 2013 \u2022 Adoption of annual targets for the recruitment and appointment of women to management posts and other posts at A*/AD level in the Commission \u2022 Continuation and improvement of awareness- raising campaigns and training, in particular within the framework of management training. 38 A ROADMAP FOR EQUALITY BETWEEN WOMEN AND MEN \u2013 2006-2010 T604202int 21/04/06 11:14 Page 38 ",
