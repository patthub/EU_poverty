        "2013 is a milestone marking 50 years of the European Investment Bank\u2019s engagement in Africa, the Caribbean and Pacific under successive mandates. Last year\u2019s notable achievements reflect the diverse benefits of many years of fruitful cooperation with ACP states, responsible authorities, business and political partners and other lending institutions. In the coming months my colleagues and I will not only be highlighting some of the important projects we have been involved with in the last half century, but also seeing how our current engagement directly benefits millions of people. 4 Annual Report on EIB activity in Africa, the Caribbean and Pacific, and the overseas territories 2012 regional neighbours. For many years the EIB has helped colleagues in the West African Power Pool overcome technical challenges and now the scale of benefits can start to be seen for the first time. Meanwhile, in East Africa concerted and comple- mentary efforts to support a range of local finan- cial partners are helping to improve standards and the availability of finance essential for small businesses to invest in future growth and create jobs. I trust that this year\u2019s annual overview will help inspire a better understanding of the European Investment Bank\u2019s commitment to ensuring sus- tainable long-term growth in Africa, the Carib- bean and Pacific. And may the 50-year anniversa- ry allow reflection on what can be done together in the years ahead. D uring 2012 the European Investment Bank reinforced its commitment to supporting private sector growth, the provision of key energy infrastructure and the financing of small businesses in Africa, the Caribbean and Pacific. At a time when economic challenges and civil unrest are hindering long-term investment elsewhere, key public and private projects that will benefit future generations are progressing well across the ACP region. The balance of EIB lending ensured both overall support for the financial sector and benefits for small businesses in East Africa and Nigeria. This reflects the Bank\u2019s commitment to strengthening the private sector business climate, shared with the European Commission under the Agenda for Change. The EIB\u2019s engagement in Africa during 2012 shows the overall benefits of how the Bank can stimulate growth and improve lives.

Financing under these agreements is provided from the European Development Fund (EDF), EU Member States\u2019 budgets, and EIB own resources, which the Bank borrows on the international capital markets. The Bank is entrusted with the management of the Investment Facil- ity, a revolving fund which meets the financing needs of investment projects in the regions with a broad range of flexible risk-bearing instruments. To support the preparation and implementation of the projects it finances, the EIB is also able to provide grants in the form of interest rate subsidies and technical assistance to its borrowers and final beneficiaries.

While the economic performance of ACP countries has so far held up well due to high commodities prices and strong FDI inflows, import demand in most major economies is set to remain depressed in the near future, meaning that the prospects for sustained strong growth in many ACP economies will depend on their ability to boost domestic demand.

With the notable exception of the newly divided Sudan and some countries in west- ern Africa affected by civil conflict and drought, most countries benefited from a solid expansion in economic output in 2012. High prices and great- er production capacity supported growth in oil exporting countries. Mineral and metal exporting countries also performed well, due to strong FDI inflows and high commodity prices. African ACP countries further benefited from improved policy frameworks in response to adverse shocks. By contrast, the Caribbean countries are only slow- ly recovering from a protracted recession and growth rates remain below pre-financial crisis lev- els. Economic activity remains constrained by high debt levels and weak tourism and remittance flows. High energy prices also act as a drag on pri- vate demand. Resource-rich economies, such as Guyana and Suriname, are generally doing better than their tourism-dependent neighbours. How- ever, growing competition from shale gas poses a significant risk to the outlook of Trinidad and To- bago, the region\u2019s second-largest economy. Strong linkages to advanced economies mean that risks are mainly on the downside. Growth prospects vary significantly across Pacific countries. The overall strong performance is due to expanding economic activity in mineral-rich coun- tries such as Papua New Guinea and Timor-Leste. Aggregate growth for the region as a whole is ex- pected to slow to 4.5% in 2013, mainly due to slow- er growth in Papua New Guinea.

Nearly one quarter of the signed projects included climate action com- ponents, accounting for 22% of total lending. In line with the continued emphasis placed on the central role of the private sector in stimulating eco- nomic growth in developing countries, the Bank increased its lending under the ACP Investment Facility (IF), its risk-bearing revolving facility for pri- vate sector lending. The volume of signatures un- der the IF nearly doubled compared to the previ- ous year, from EUR 193m in 2011 to EUR 355m in 2012. Disbursements under the IF exceeded EUR 300m for a second consecutive year for the first time, bringing total disbursements in the ACP regions since 2003 over the EUR 3bn mark with EUR 2 022m from the IF and EUR 1 020m from own resources. For the IF, this record achievement should help to ensure that future reflows from disbursed loans are adequate to sustain the long-term self-financing aspect of the Investment Facility 6 . 6 See Reflows ",

This goes hand in hand with the EIB\u2019s lending for basic infrastructure investments, largely from its own resources, as a prerequisite for private sector de- velopment. The IF enables the EIB to support the growth of local enterprises and foreign direct in- vestment, especially by increasing SMEs\u2019 access to risk sharing instruments and term finance. ",

        "Blending loans and grants to leverage additional financing The use of innovative financing instruments by lev- eraging additional finance is crucial to ensuring the funding of projects in developing countries. The In- vestment Facility constitutes a unique blending in- strument in itself, which, through its risk-bearing nature, acts as a catalyst for funding from other in- vestors for projects in ACP countries. Since 2003, total IF investment of EUR 3.4bn in the regions has been made in projects costing a total of EUR 18bn. The Facility further benefits from a grant envelope through which it provides interest rate subsidies and technical assistance. The subsidies can ensure the economic and financial soundness of projects with substantial environmental or social impacts as well as infrastructure projects, particularly in the poorer or less developed countries or in countries where basic infrastructure has been damaged by conflict or natural disaster. For infrastructure projects with a regional dimen- sion in sub-Saharan Africa, the EIB also blends its loan finance with grant funding from the EU-Afri- ca Infrastructure Trust Fund (ITF) 7 . The ITF, whose Secretariat is housed by the EIB, is an instrument of the wider EU-Africa Infrastructure Partnership. The Trust Fund aims to increase investment in region- al infrastructure in Africa by blending long-term loan financing with grant resources from the Euro- pean Commission and EU Member States. Techni- cal and lending capacity is provided by the EIB and EU development finance institutions, as well as the African Development Bank, on the basis of African ownership. Technical assistance is provided throughout the project cycle, funding pre-feasibility studies, pro- ject preparation and implementation, capacity building for financial intermediaries and benefi- ciaries, and staff training, the latter to help raise en- vironmental, social and governance standards. For the ITF alone, each euro in approved grant operations is expected to generate about twelve euros in total investments. In 2012, interest rate subsidies under Cotonou totalling EUR 37.2m were provided for two projects the EIB promoted in the ACPs, and EUR 3.9m went to eight technical as- sistance operations. Since 2004, EUR 529m chan- nelled through blending instruments has lever- aged a lending volume of EUR 2.2bn, of which the ITF contributed EUR 191m for interest rate subsi- dies and technical assistance. The European Investment Bank is also closely as- sociated with the new EU platform for blending in external cooperation, which aims to review and improve existing EU blending mechanisms to in- crease their impact. 7 www.eu-africa-infrastructure-tf.net 2004 17 430 349 409 343 253 89 181 121 4.25 3.27 4.21 6.80 4.44 4.29 4.60 3.87 3.67 0 100 200 300 400 500 2008 2006 2010 2005 2009 2007 2011 2012 Leverage effect under Cotonou (all funds*): 2004-2012 Blending Instrument Loans (OR & IF) * Cotonou subsidy envelope and Infrastructure Trust Fund 4 37 43 13 57 80 89 111 95 14 Annual Report on EIB activity in Africa, the Caribbean and Pacific, and the overseas territories 2012 ",
        "8 European Development Finance Institutions: www.edfi.be Close cooperation with partners The EIB works closely with other multilateral lend- ers, national development finance organisations and private bodies to act as a catalyst for public- private partnerships and private investment. Co- operation with the European Commission and the European External Action Service, and EU mem- ber state bilateral development finance agencies promotes broader European engagement in ACP states and provides significant opportunities for European companies to operate in the regions. The EIB is working to maximise synergies, collabora- tion and efficiency through partnerships with co- financiers such as the European Financing Partners mechanism with the EDFIs 8 , the Mutual Reliance Initiative with AFD and KfW (see box), the EIB-IFC Collaboration Agreement and the African Financ- ing Partnership with AfDB, IFC and several EDFIs. In 2012, nearly 60% of the projects signed were co-financed with other lenders, bringing the total number of projects co-financed under the Invest- ment Facility since 2003 to 119, costing a total of EUR 3 847m. 15 2012 Annual Report on EIB activity in Africa, the Caribbean and Pacific, and the overseas territories EIB funding in the ACPs/OCTs more than a loan ",
        "The Mutual Reliance Initiative \u2013 combining the respective strengths of three European development finance institutions to help improve water supply services around Lake Victoria The EIB also works closely with the French development agency, Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD), and the German public bank, Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (KfW) under the Mutual Reliance Initiative (MRI) in which one of the participating institutions takes the lead on assess- ment for each co-financed project. This streamlines administrative pro- cedures for the project promoter and reduces transaction costs. The pilot phase was successfully completed in 2012 with 14 co-financed projects in sub-Saharan Africa and in the Middle East/North Africa and operational guidelines were signed at the beginning of 2013. The MRI enhances the effectiveness of financing in support of EU policies and creates more visibility for EU investment. The Lake Victoria Water and Sanitation (Kampala Water) project 9 is one of the earliest examples of the MRI, with KfW and its local implementation team in the lead financier role. KfW has a long-standing presence in the water sector in Uganda, especially in its relations with the beneficiary, the National Water and Sewerage Corporation (NWSC). AFD and the EIB brought in-depth knowledge of water quality issues and lengthy experience in water and sanitation projects in the region, gained by supporting the rehabilitation of the water intakes of the main cities on the shores of Lake Victoria, along with other partners such as UN Habitat. This regional dimension formed the basis for the MRI partners\u2019 successful request for a grant contribution of EUR 8m from the EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund (EU-Africa ITF) to the financing of NWSC\u2019s investments in Kampala. The works have started and are expected to last for the next five years. Most water consumers in Kampala (2.5 million inhabitants) will benefit in some way from improved water treatment capacity and drinking water distribution overall. Furthermore, 20 selected informal settlements where up to 50% of the 400 000 population live below the absolute poverty line will gain access to clean and safe drinking water at affordable costs. The MRI partners will continue their close collaboration in progressively making funds available as the project is implemented. The two co-financiers will continue to rely on the lead financier to play its agreed role during project supervision, while providing advice and bringing value to the project whenever needed. 16 Annual Report on EIB activity in Africa, the Caribbean and Pacific, and the overseas territories 2012 9 See 2011 Annual Report on EIB activity in Africa, the Caribbean and Pacific, and the overseas territories, p.28 ",

This has set in place a baseline of expected results for the 25 projects approved in the ACP regions during the year. Their outputs and outcomes will be measured at specific maturity milestones fol- lowing signature, usually at project completion and three years thereafter. The REM framework will ensure increased selectivity in targeting projects where the Bank\u2019s involvement adds the greatest value, and is most closely aligned with achieving its mandate objectives. A full report on the aggregated data of the expect- ed results of the projects approved outside the EU in 2012 will be available as of May 2013. It includes detailed breakdowns of the cumulative combined outputs and outcomes of projects by sector, a thor- ough analysis of the projects\u2019 expected contribu- The EIB seeks to ensure that, for each of the projects that it finances, its involvement provides added value by offering loan conditions and tenors not available otherwise on the market, and enabling significant contributions to improved social, environmental and governance standards in the implementation of the project.

It offers a broad range of financing instruments designed to address the specific needs of these intermediaries and beneficiaries in the regions, helping to promote local financial markets and stimulate private sector growth, in particular SMEs, across a range of sectors.

        "20 Annual Report on EIB activity in Africa, the Caribbean and Pacific, and the overseas territories 2012 Micro and small enterprises (MSEs) face a critical shortage of access to long-term finance in ACP countries. Through the Investment Facility, the EIB channels its finance via selected local intermediary banks, using their knowledge to ensure that the investments are tailored to the specific needs of the targeted country and sector. Expanding access to long-term finance I n November 2012, two new products were added to the range of financial instruments at the Bank\u2019s disposal outside the European Un- ion: a \u2018loan for SMEs\u2019 and a \u2018mid-cap\u2019 11 loan, already widely used for its operations within the EU. These increase the flexibility of the Bank\u2019s lending (in- cluding with regard to allocation amounts and beneficiaries), and reduce processing time and transaction costs for borrowers. The EIB also uses grants to finance technical assis- tance to banks, microfinance institutions and SMEs to strengthen their future lending. In 2012, three financial sector operations benefited from techni- cal assistance to support their implementation, in Uganda, Djibouti and Haiti (see Annex 6). Also in 2012, an innovative SME Guarantee Facility was designed together with other IFIs, offering risk sharing to banks willing to expand their SME port- folio. It will become operational during 2013. Since 2010, the Bank has supported nearly 160 SMEs in the ACP regions, for a total amount of over EUR 530m . 11 See www.eib.org/products ",
        "21 2012 Annual Report on EIB activity in Africa, the Caribbean and Pacific, and the overseas territories Building a sustainable financial sector Working with experienced local intermediaries The EIB has provided nearly EUR 1.5bn for credit lines since 2003, representing 24% of total lending. C redit lines are an essential component of the Bank\u2019s support for SMEs in a range of sec- tors. They allow the Bank to reach smaller scale projects such as those promoting the use of renewable energy and supporting climate action. The EIB engages with intermediary local institu- tions that have proven financial robustness as well as good management and governance, which it can further reinforce through technical assistance when necessary. The intermediaries carry out the appraisal, monitoring and evaluation of the sub- projects they finance, to the standards required for all projects financed by the EIB. Furthermore, they are obliged to report regularly to the Bank on the allocation of the funds made available. This way, the EIB\u2019s credit lines help to strengthen domes- tic financial markets and raise standards and skills across the sector. The EIB signed six credit lines in 2012 for a total of over EUR 200m. Building up Uganda\u2019s SME growth and financial sector development The Private Enterprise Finance Facility II (PEFF II) benefited from a EUR 40m EIB loan in 2010. It pro- vided long-term funds in euros, US dollars and Ugandan shillings to six selected intermediary banks in Uganda for investment projects aimed at developing private enterprises, in particular small and me- dium-size enterprises (SMEs). Targeted sectors were manufacturing, agro-processing, transport and tourism, as well as education and health, which are important to strengthen the country\u2019s social infra- structure, whilst creating jobs and promoting economic growth. One of the beneficiaries, the Housing Finance Bank (HFB) received a long-term loan of EUR 4m. This allowed HFB to make higher risk loans for SMEs, as well as for projects such as schools and student housing, which it would otherwise not be able to consider. Altogether, it provided a total of 54 loans to SMEs with an average loan size of EUR 73 500, creating 750 jobs. Seventy per cent of the beneficiar- ies were first-time borrowers, 13% were women, and 33% were in rural areas. Some 24% of the loans also incorporated energy efficient construction methods and equipment, contributing to the reduc- tion of the country\u2019s carbon dioxide emissions. The facility included a EUR 420 000 grant for training HFB\u2019s staff and clients in the planning and management of their business, ensuring their long-term success and the broader sustainability of the financial sector.

Kampala Academy The Kampala Academy is a private elementa- ry school serving children not only from the city of Kampala, but also from other countries \u2013 Kenya, Rwanda, Sudan and Tanzania. The school was started by three families in 1996 with forty pupils in three classes. It now has 620 pupils. Under the EIB facility, the Housing Finance Bank (HFB) was able to provide the Academy with a loan of 420m Ugandan shillings (ap- proximately EUR 120 000) with a ten-year maturity. This enabled it to build a new four- storey classroom building within ten months, rather than the estimated ten years that it would have taken to provide equivalent space without the HFB\u2019s financing. With the new building the Academy will be able to reduce the size of its classes, thereby providing better learning conditions for its pu- pils. The Academy can thus maintain its high educational standards -- its pupils have a re- cord of excellent results in the national exam- inations, with more than 90% achieving high level marks in the exam.

This lending framework is aimed at banks and other financial intermediaries that provide loans and services to micro-entrepreneurs and small enterprises (MSEs) in both the rural and urban areas of the region. Through this facility, the EIB provides longer-term local currency loans that increase the capacity of financial intermediaries to address the financing needs of MSEs. By on-lending to MSEs, the financial intermediaries serve a market niche where demand is high, which has become a focus area for EIB microfinance operations. Under the first facility, around 10 000 micro and small entrepreneurs in EAC countries benefited from loans of an average size of EUR 5 000 for MSEs and micro-enterprises. Sectors ranged from trade, retail, agro-industries, fishing, food processing, manufacturing, industry and construction to transport, tourism, and services related to these sectors. The government of Luxembourg provided EUR 150 000 of technical assistance in training for the financial intermediaries and beneficiaries. A further 30 000 beneficiaries are expected to be reached under the second facility. One such beneficiary was the Faulu Kenya Deposit Taking Micro-Finance Company, which received a loan of EUR 4m. Faulu Kenya provides banking services to those parts of the population which previously had no access to them, through a variety of savings, credit, micro insurance and mobile banking solutions. It has over 90 service outlets which include 27 banking branches in seven of the eight provinces in Kenya. Some 15 000 long-term loans totalling EUR 8m were provided to Kenyan MSEs, of which nearly half were to women, creating 30 000 jobs. DOLLAR AUTO SPARES Peter Kuria is the owner of Dollar Auto Spares in Nairobi and has been a member of Faulu since 2000. The loans from Faulu have enabled him to enlarge his automobile supplies inventory and expand his retail business so as to run it more profitably. The most recent loan was for EUR 2 600, with a term of two years, but he repaid it more quickly. With the money he bor- rowed he was able to travel to suppliers in Dubai and China and purchase parts from them directly, at a better price than from suppliers in Kenya. He was also able to move his shop to a larger and more secure location, and hire two full-time employees, young entrants to the labour market engaging in their first formal employment. Mr Kuria uses his growing profits to put his children through school and help support his extended family. ",

The fund targets small businesses with an average of 10-50 employees, the \u201cmissing middle\u201d for which financing is scarce as they are too large for microfi- nance institutions, too small for equity funds, and too risky for banks. These SMEs have a very high potential development impact but also a high risk of failure. To counterbalance this high risk factor, GroFin\u2019s in- vestment funding is paired with hands-on business support, from advice at the business planning and financial modelling stage to support through imple- mentation. This helps its entrepreneurs and business owners meet their agreed business goals. To support the fund\u2019s focus on finding the balance between maximum development impact and good market return, GroFin requires that its investee companies adhere to sound corporate governance standards and sustainable business principles. In addition to provid- ing advice to improve the management, administra- tion and reporting capacities of its borrowers, it also verifies that they uphold high standards of business integrity and operate in accordance with lo- cal and international laws, including in the area of money laundering and other financial crime. GAF supports investee companies in developing their environmental, social and governance (ESG) policy, by providing them with information on local environmental and social laws and regulations, as well as with a guide and framework for the development of an ESG policy and system.

Helping African countries to develop the infrastructure to unlock poten- tial power from its own renewable resources requires large-scale investment and strong collaboration between governments, private developers, commercial banks and development finance institutions. The EIB plays a key role in facilitating public-private partnerships in energy projects and in improv- ing the institutional capacity to implement them. It puts continual effort into developing innovative financing mechanisms to encourage further investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency initiatives across the continent, driving economic growth. In August 2012, the 250 MW Bujagali hydropower plant began commercial operations, meeting nearly half of Uganda\u2019s energy needs. The plant not only increases the country\u2019s supply of reliable electricity and lowers its cost, it also reduces CO 2 emissions by replacing fossil fuel-fired generation with power from indigenous renewable resources. It also provides social, community and business services such as microfinance, agricultural facilities, water supply, education and health facilities for local inhabitants. The project was established through a public-private partnership between the Ugandan government, a consortium of the Aga Khan Fund for Economic Development and Sithe Global (a US Blackstone affiliate), with financing provided by the EIB, IFC, African Development Bank, a group of European bilateral finance institutions comprising Proparco, AfD, FMO, DEG and KfW and two commercial banks \u2013 Absa Bank and Standard Chartered Bank (covered by a World Bank guarantee). The EIB provided a EUR 92m loan. This PPP model combines the strengths of the private sector in financing, building and operating an asset of this nature and size, with the government\u2019s commitment to address certain adverse factors such as variations in demand or water available for production. Bujagali won Euromoney Project Finance Magazine\u2019s \u201cAfrican Power Deal of the Year\u201d award in 2007 and the World Finance PPP \u201cBest Green Project, Middle East & Africa\u201d award in 2013. tion and tackle the power supply\u2019s susceptibility to seasonal variability.

This will constitute one of the major elements of the country\u2019s reconstruction and development. Since its first project in support of the develop- ment of the Zambian power network over 15 years ago, the EIB has significantly contributed to im- proving access to cleaner and more affordable electricity throughout the country and across the broader Southern African Power Pool (SAPP) re- gion. The Caprivi Interconnector project opened up the hydropower resources of the northern part of the region for transmission to the southern part, previously largely dependent on coal-based gener- ation. The reinforced connection between Zambia, Namibia and South Africa provides a reliable route for trading electricity, encourages the develop- ment of a competitive regional power market and improves the security of supply to the region, in- cluding its rural areas for the first time. In 2012, the Bank helped to boost the production and distri- bution of green energy across the SAPP with over EUR 70m of funding for the Itezhi-Tezhi hydropow- er plant, and for two long distance transmission lines \u2212 one connecting the plant to the national grid, and one between Kafue and Livingstone, the only major connection in the south-west of the country. These projects support the Zambian gov- ernment\u2019s efforts to ensure that a reliable supply of energy keeps pace with the country\u2019s economic growth. Sustainable Energy for All Launched by the United Nations in 2012, the Sus- tainable Energy for All (SE4All) initiative aims to provide universal access to modern energy servic- es and to double both the overall rate of improve- ment in energy efficiency and the share of renew- able energy in the global energy mix by 2030. The Bank and other institutions have developed a num- ber of new instruments to finance renewable ener- gy and energy efficiency especially in sub-Saharan Africa to the tune of more than EUR 1bn. These are expected to be operational in the course of 2013. The EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund has been equipped with a specific funding window dedicat- ed to activities that contribute towards the SE4All objectives, such as increased support for national energy projects and intermediated lending, and to develop a set of innovative financing instruments tailored for smaller renewable energy and energy efficiency projects. These include technical assis- tance and risk mitigation measures (Africa Sustain- able Energy Facility), performance-based credits and credit enhancement (Renewable Energy Per- formance Platform) and insurance and guarantees (Africa Energy Guarantee Fund). The EIB will also continue its advisory role to the Global Energy Ef- ficiency and Renewable Energy Fund (GEEREF 13 ), which has established a proven track record in lev- eraging private equity investment in small energy efficiency and renewable energy projects in devel- oping countries and economies in transition. In October 2012, the EIB launched a public consul- tation as part of the review of its energy sector lending policy. Key stakeholders, en- ergy sector experts and the public were invited to con- tribute to help the Bank to align its target areas in energy lending with the EU\u2019s prior- ity objectives, particularly of the European Commission\u2019s Green Paper on Energy.

Many are exposed to extreme water scarcity and land degradation, while small island states are affected by rising sea levels. Mainstreaming climate action adaptation and mitigation measures I n addition to actively promoting energy effi- ciency and renewable energy opportunities, during the appraisal of each project, the EIB sys- tematically identifies the need and possibility to incorporate climate change resilience and adap- tation measures into its financing package. In ad- dition, the Bank combines its financing with grant funds in order to provide technical assistance to help improve the design or management of a pro- ject to enhance its climate action components, and interest rate subsidies to support the higher costs of adaptation measures. In 2012, the EIB provided nearly EUR 160m to five projects with climate action components, repre- senting 22% of lending for the year. All were in the energy sector, four of them large-scale power pro- jects aiming to replace fossil fuel generation with renewable hydropower.

        "50 Annual Report on EIB activity in Africa, the Caribbean and Pacific, and the overseas territories 2012 Financial Statements (see Annex 8) Income statement \u2022 For the year 2012, the IF shows a net profit of EUR 19.0m compared to a net profit of EUR 61.3m in 2011. \u2022 Impairments on the debt lending portfolio net of reversals significantly decreased from EUR 27.4m to EUR 0.6m. In 2012, EUR -1.1m was recorded as an additional impairment while EUR 1.7m of past impairment has been reversed due to the im- provement of the situation of the underlying pro- jects. Impairments on the equity lending portfolio increased from EUR -6.9m to EUR -8.9m. \u2022 The current level of provisioning on lending oper- ations (debt and equity) is equivalent to some 4% of the outstanding portfolio (5% in 2011). \u2022 The net foreign exchange result significantly de- creased from a net profit of EUR 8.4m to a net loss of EUR -10.6m. \u2022 Net realised gains on available-for-sale financial assets significantly decreased from EUR 17.2m to EUR 1.0m mainly due to only one profit-making sale of an operation during the reporting peri- od (EUR +0.07m) compared to two profit-making sales the year before (EUR 16.2m). \u2022 The interest income on lending operations in- creased from EUR 50.8m to EUR 64.1m. \u2022 The fair value change of derivative financial in- struments representing swap contracts signifi- cantly increased from a net loss of EUR -7.5m to a net gain of EUR 5.3m. \u2022 Net administrative expenses stood at EUR 36.2m, decreasing by 5% compared to 2011. \u2022 The fee and commission income decreased from EUR 2.1m to EUR 1.9m. Performance of the IF portfolio (as a revolving fund) ",
        "51 2012 Annual Report on EIB activity in Africa, the Caribbean and Pacific, and the overseas territories Performance of the IF portfolio (as a revolving fund) Balance sheet \u2022 Total equity increased from EUR 1 448.8m in 2011 to EUR 1 774.4m in 2012. Therein, the Member States\u2019 contributions increased by EUR 280m to EUR 1 561.3m, and retained earnings stood at EUR 144.7m compared to EUR 125.7m the year before. The fair value reserve shows a year-end balance of EUR 68.4m compared to a balance of EUR 41.8m in 2011. \u2022 In line with the expanding financial activity, out- standing loans increased by EUR 113.1m to EUR 1 146.3m, representing a growth rate of 11% and constituting, with 54%, the largest asset item. \u2022 Equity investments rose by 32% from EUR 251.7m to EUR 333.0m. The three largest investments in the portfolio are the AIC Caribbean Fund, CAPE III and the Microfinance Enhancement Facility. \u2022 On the liabilities side, the \u201camounts owed to third parties\u201d of EUR 312.1m (2011: EUR 329.7m) is the largest item. It includes EUR 267.0m (2011: EUR 291.5m) for interest subsidies and technical assistance received from Member States and not yet disbursed and payables to the EIB amount- ing to EUR 45.1m (2011: EUR 38.2m), composed of EIB management fees amounting to EUR 36.2m (2011: EUR 38.0m) and cash receipts on behalf of the EIB amounting to EUR 8.9m (2011: EUR 0.2m). Risk profile The Bank ensures the quality of the overall IF port- folio through selective, early-stage project screen- ing, regular and reinforced monitoring of its operations and ex-post evaluations. In order to ap- propriately address the credit risk inherent in some new operations, or the effects of adverse circum- stances on existing counterparties, the Bank keeps a regularly updated watch list of potentially risky operations. It provides a risk report twice a year to its Member State stakeholders. As of 31 December 2012, 17 operations were on the watch list, stable compared to 30 June 2012 and down from 19 as of 31 December 2011. The opera- tions on the watch list amount to EUR 167.1m ac- counting for 8% of total signed exposure, relatively stable compared to December 2011 (7.8%). Reflows At the end of 2012, capital contributions into the ACP Investment Facility from EU Member States amounted to EUR 1 845m, out of the total Coto- nou endowment of EUR 3 185m. Under its unique revolving mechanism, additional cash, stemming from principal repayments on loans, interest in- come, sales of shares and dividend income, is re- injected into the facility. At the end of 2012, these reflows amounted to some EUR 790m. In this way, additional approvals for financing projects for amounts exceeding the total endowment are pos- sible, based on forward-looking projections of ex- pected cash reflows. Reflows have been the fund- ing source for all new approvals since early 2012. Total cumulative approvals under the ACP Invest- ment Facility since 2003 amount to over EUR 4bn. Projections indicate a continuing yearly increase in lending to a total at end-2020 of three times the amount of the original endowment. ",
