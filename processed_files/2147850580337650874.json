        "European Added Value of EU measures on the application of the principle of Equal Pay ANNEX II European added value of applying the principle of Equal Pay for men and women for equal work or work of equal value Research paper by Usman Khan (Modus Europe) Andrea Broughton, Stefanie Ledermaier, Catherine Rickard & Stefan Speckesser (Institute for Employment Studies) Jacque Mallender (Matrix Insight) Abstract This Study examines the Gender Pay Gap (GPG) in Europe and assesses the potential impact of the report adopted by the European Parliament in May 2012 (The Bauer Report). The Study finds that the greatest potential would be with the streamlining of EU regulation and policy, greater transparency of pay data and broader and more systematic use of work evaluation and job classification. Each of these measures could result in an overall reduction in the GPG of a minimum of 1% point, which in turn has the potential to increase GDP by 0.1%. PE 504.469 EAVA 4/2013 ",

        "European Added Value of applying the principle of equal pay 1. Policy findings and recommendations This Study has focused on the following two objectives. \uf0b7 To understand the extent and impact of the Gender Pay Gap (GPG) in Europe. \uf0b7 To assess how proposals adopted by the European Parliament in May 2012 (The Bauer Report) could impact on reducing the GPG and economic growth. 1.1 Policy findings The main policy findings of the Study are as follows: \uf0b7 At a level of 16.4% the GPG across the EU remains large, with wide variation evident by country, sector and industry. \uf0b7 Whilst the gap is lower in the public than the private sector, it is the private sector that has seen greater reductions over recent years. \uf0b7 Evidence suggests that interventions to address the GPG can have a positive impact on economic growth. \uf0b7 An estimate for this Study estimates that each 1% reduction in the GPG would result in an increase in GDP of 0.1%. \uf0b7 Bauer Report recommendations all have the potential to positively impact on reducing the GPG. \uf0b7 Large variation in terms of Member States which have partially, fully, or not implemented policies aligned to the Bauer Recommendations. \uf0b7 Secondary assessment suggests the Bauer Recommendations that have greatest potential to impact on the GPG are: 1. Streamlining of EU regulation and policy with a particular focus on part time work. 2. Improved situational analysis and transparency of results in relation to pay data. 3. Work Evaluation and Job Classification at Member State level underpinned by high levels of transparency. It is estimated that the impact of introducing any one of the five Bauer Recommendations considered in this Study could lead to a reduction in the GPG of between 1% and 3%. 1.2 Recommendations The main recommendations that can be drawn from the Study are as follows: \uf0b7 The European Parliament\u2019s should continue to prioritise actions focused on reducing the GPG.

        "European Added Value of applying the principle of equal pay 2. Executive summary The European Parliament has urged the European Commission to improve existing EU legislation to close the GPG, including stricter sanctions on employers. The request for a legislative proposal points out that the GPG still averages 16.4% in the EU, and in some Member States is growing. The principle of equal treatment of women and men is set out in the Treaty of Rome (1957). In 1975, the Council adopted Directive 75/117/EEC - the Equal Pay Directive . Additional Directives include Directive 76/207/EE (Equal Treatment Directive) and Directive 97/80/EC (Burden of Proof Directive). A total of seven Directives in the context of equal treatment between women and men were combined in 2006 in a single Directive to offer more distinctness to Community law and to support the field of equal treatment between women and men. The Commission also produced a \u201cRoadmap for equality between women and men 2006-2010\u201d. With the adoption by the European Parliament of the Bauer Report in May 2012 they have called on the Commission to propose new measures to reduce inequality in pay between the sexes through all relevant EU policies and national programmes. They also ask national governments to step up cooperation and develop new ideas to tackle the GPG. 2.1 Study objectives This Study looks at the European Added Value of applying the principle of equal pay. There are four broad research questions. To assess: \uf0b7 The extent of the GPG; \uf0b7 The impact of the GPG on economic performance; \uf0b7 The prevalence and effectiveness of measures similar to those in the Bauer Report that are currently implemented within Member States; \uf0b7 The potential for the policy recommendations set out in the Bauer Report to further impact on reducing the GPG and increasing economic growth. The aim of the Study is to provide a level of quantification to the recommendations contained in the Bauer Report that was debated and accepted by the European Parliament in May 2012. 2.2 Methods & approach The Research Team undertook an Internet-based literature review alongside an assessment of the limited available data on the impact of policy on reducing the GPG. This was then used to provide a high-level estimate of the minimum and maximum level of impact that legislative action based upon the Bauer Recommendations could have on reducing the GPG and increasing GDP. PE 504.469 EAVA 4/2013 II-7 ",
        "Research paper on economic aspects 2.3 Scale of the GPG There exists a consistent picture across the EU regarding the existence of the GPG, although its level varies. This gap is widest in Estonia, Austria, Germany, the Czech Republic and Slovakia and narrowest in Slovenia, Poland, and Italy (Eurostat, 2011 figures). Whilst almost all Member States have introduced specific gender equality regulations, the monitoring practices and the enforcement mechanisms vary substantially across Member States. The most recent available unadjusted GPG data (% difference between average gross hourly earnings of male and female employees, as % of male gross earnings) shows the GPG ranges from 2.3 % in Slovenia to 27.3 % in Estonia (Eurostat, 2011 data). The data from 2011 shows that on average, women earned 16.2 1 % less on gross hourly earnings than men in the EU-27 (Eurostat, 2011 data). Despite significant equal pay initiatives in local government and the health sector, there has been little progress in recent years in closing the GPG in the public sector , which currently stands at 14.6% (based on mean full-time hourly earnings) up from 13.9% in 2008. While the public sector GPG is significantly lower than the full-time private sector GPG (21.6%) , the private sector gap has fallen five percentage points since 1997. 2.4 Benefit of reducing the GPG There is mixed evidence on the impact of reducing the GPG on economic growth . Whilst some studies are able to point to significant increases in GDP resulting from reductions in the GPG, others demonstrate small negative impacts. The Study finding the largest aggregate impact of a reduction in the GPG on GDP came from Australia. This Study also assessed the potential for any reduction to impact on economic growth. Drawing upon secondary evidence it has been possible to establish that reducing the GPG can have a positive impact on economic growth. The economic assessment made for this Study suggests that a decrease in the gender wage gap by one percentage point would increase economic growth by 0.1 % . 2.5 Impact of the GPG The secondary evidence search and review found limited quantitative evidence of the costs to employers in terms of loss of productivity, and no quantitative evidence of the costs of low staff morale and loss of reputation as a result of failure to provide equal pay. Evidence on cost to employers was largely indicative. The Study identified evidence suggesting a link between the GPG and reduced productivity with one Study finding gender discrimination accounting for 29 % of the pay and productivity gap, which as a result impacts GDP and economic growth. 1 Provisional data as at March 2013 PE 504.469 EAVA 4/2013 II-8 ",
        "European Added Value of applying the principle of equal pay However, the Study did not quantify this impact. Smith & Bettio (2010) cite a Study by Elmeskov and Scarpetta (2000) which calculated that a \u201clower utilisation of labour contributes more than 20 percentage points to the gap in GDP per capita. 2.6 Bauer Report recommendations In May 2012, the European Parliament adopted a legislative initiative report on Equal pay (Bauer Report), calling on the European Commission and other related bodies to review Directive 2006/54/EC on the implementation of the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment of men and women in matters of employment and occupation, before February 2013. The terms of reference for the Study required us to focus on five of the eleven recommendations and to assess their potential to positively impact upon the GPG. Our assessment established that each of the five measures that were considered could each positively impact on reducing the GPG. Factors that would determine their level of impact were identified as being: \uf0b7 evidence of the effectiveness of the particular measure; \uf0b7 size of the GPG within a particular Member State; and \uf0b7 the degree to which the measure has already been implemented partially or substantively within a Member State. In Table 1 we set out the Research Team\u2019s summary assessment of the five sub-options within the Bauer Report that were subject to review. Table 1: Overview of Bauer Recommendations Option Assessment Improved situational analysis and transparency of results Impact Assessment Overview Indirect impact through greater transparency of pay data.

Introduction The European Parliament has urged the European Commission to improve existing EU legislation to close the GPG, including stricter sanctions on employers. The request for a legislative proposal points out that the GPG still averages 16.4% in the EU, and in some member states is increasing. MEPs have called on the Commission to propose new measures to reduce inequality in pay between the sexes through all relevant EU policies and national programmes. They also ask national governments to step up cooperation and develop new ideas to tackle the GPG. 3.1 Study Objectives The aim of the Study is to provide a level of quantification as well as a qualitative assessment to the recommendations contained in the Bauer Report. Within the scope of the Study this will only be possible at an indicative level and further work would be required to establish precise estimations. The overall study objective is to set out the current situation regarding the GPG across the 27 Member States of the European Union and to assess the costs of this at the level of the individual, industry and the wider society. The terms of reference set this out in terms of the following four objectives: 1. Provide an overview of the situation with respect to equal pay for men and women; 2. Examine the financial and economic costs of the GPG; 3. Outline the economic impact of the persisting GPG; and 4. Consider the costs to employers, deriving from the failure to provide equal pay The fifth objective then focuses on assessing the potential impact of implementing the recommendation of the Bauer report, setting the precise objective to be: 5. Assess the economic added value of the measures proposed in the Bauer report compared to the existing legal framework. 3.2 Methods & Approach As a rapid review we have utilised a limited range of research tools and a focused research design. The design has been focused on being able to produce a robust high- level indication of impact. The research tools employed were as follows: \uf0b7 Secondary Evidence \u2013 collated relevant materials provided by the client and have in addition undertaken an Internet based evidence review; \uf0b7 Data Review \u2013 We have accessed a range of relevant data from secondary sources at both a Member State and EU wide level including Eurostat. \uf0b7 Client Engagement \u2013 We have held a number of meetings with colleagues at the European Parliament to aid the development of the options and to validate research findings; PE 504.469 EAVA 4/2013 II-13 ",
        "Research paper on economic aspects \uf0b7 Economic Assessment \u2013 structured economic modelling is not feasible within the scope and timeframes for this Study, but we have developed an evidenced, robust and transparent means to consider each of the options to address the GPG; \uf0b7 Reporting \u2013 in line with the agreed terms of reference. The Research Team undertook an Internet-based secondary evidence review in order to collate relevant documents and data to examine the extent of the GPG and its impact and to identify the extent to which each of the 27 Member States have introduced policies relating to the five recommendations from the Bauer report set out in the terms of reference for this Study. For the latter task we have created country profiles (Annex 1.) based on the secondary evidence, which present a high level Study of the policies already implemented and indicate through colour coding where the Member State has translated policy into mandatory, legislative requirements (significant development, coded green); where there has been partial development in the policy area, including focused efforts by the social partners (partial development, coded yellow); and where no references have been found on policy actions in the area linked to the Bauer recommendations (no development, coded red). This assessment will be used to help inform and establish the potential impact of measures relating to each of the five Bauer recommendations set out in the terms of reference at a pan-European level. Given the high-level nature of this Study, we have not examined uptake or compliance in the Member State, nor do we present an evaluation of the effectiveness of the enforcement of these policies. The country profiles included in the Annex represent the findings from our evidence review to date. In order to gather evidence for this Study, we have reviewed European-level documents, such as those produced by Eurofound, the European Commission and the OECD, in addition to national-level documents and research studies. Data on the extent of the GPG in the EU Member States was obtained through Eurostat. The GPG as measured by Eurostat in unadjusted form represents \u201cthe difference between average gross hourly earnings of male paid employees and of female paid employees as a percentage of average gross hourly earnings of male paid employees\u201d (Eurostat, 2012). The unadjusted indicator is \u201cnot adjusted according to individual characteristics that may explain part of the earnings difference\u201d (ibid). The sources to inform the secondary evidence review are included in the references. The report is structured as follows: Section 4 provides an overview of the GPG within the European Union, examining evidence concerning impacts, existing data on costs and presents country-level analysis. Section 5 focuses on the Bauer Report and the recommendations set out within it. It looks at examples within Member States that align to these recommendations, concluding with a section assessing the potential impact that each measure may have within Member States. Section 6 estimates the economic impact of a reduction in the GPG. Section 7 outlines the main Study conclusions and implications for future research in the area. PE 504.469 EAVA 4/2013 II-14 ",
        "European Added Value of applying the principle of equal pay 4. Assessing the GPG This section provides a summary overview of the GPG in the European Union. In addition to an EU wide assessment, rates and trends in Member States are also considered. The chapter then presents a high level assessment of the economic impact of the GPG including particular consideration of costs to business. 4.1 The GPG in the European Union The most recent available unadjusted GPG data (% difference between average gross hourly earnings of male and female employees, as % of male gross earnings) shows the GPG ranges from 2.3 % in Slovenia to 27.3 % in Estonia (Eurostat, 2011 data) (see Figure 1 below). The data from 2011 shows that on average, women earned 16.2 2 % less on gross hourly earnings than men in the EU-27 (Eurostat, 2011 data). The GPG for full-time employees is largest in Austria at 22 % and lowest in Italy at -1 % (based on 2010 figures) (Eurostat, 2010 data). A negative GPG (-1%) indicates that on average, women earn more than men. This does not necessarily mean that the labour market is more favourable for women, with the following factors being found to either positively or negatively influence the GPG: \uf0b7 Female participation in the labour market \uf0b7 Human capital \uf0b7 Occupational segregation \uf0b7 Part-time work and caring responsibilities \uf0b7 Valuation of women\u2019s work \uf0b7 Discrimination \uf0b7 Structural and institutional factors (all cited by EWG, 2011) The GPG for part-time workers also ranges from -17 % in Ireland (based on 2010 figures) to 35 % in Spain (Eurostat, 2013). Whilst almost all Member States have implemented specific gender equality regulations, the actual enforcement mechanisms vary considerably between countries. In May 2012, European Parliament adopted the Bauer Report on the GPG, which calls on the European Commission to revise and amend the Recast Directive 2006/54/EC in order to close the GPG. The report contains recommendations for the Commission on equal pay. 2 Provisional data as at March 2013 PE 504.469 EAVA 4/2013 II-15 ",
        "Research paper on economic aspects Figure 1: The unadjusted GPG, 2011, Eurostat 4.2 EU legislative framework The European Union has addressed the issue of equal pay in a number of distinct ways. The fundamental principle of equal treatment of women and men is set out in the Treaty of Rome (1957). Within the Treaty Article 157 of the TFEU calls on Member States to ensure the application of the principle of equal pay for equal work or work of equal value for both men and women. The Article states that within its bounds individual Member States are able to take particular actions to address the issue within their own country. The issue of gender pay was addressed directly in 1975 with the Equal Pay Directive 75/117/EEC. This Directive provided a newly defined principle of equal pay including that of remuneration for the same work or work of equal value. Significant case law relating both to Article 157 and the Directive 75/117/EEC has been developed by the Court of Justice subsequent to the introduction of the Directive. Two other Directives of relevance to the GPG are as follows: \uf0b7 Directive 76/207/EEC , implementing the principle of equal treatment for men and women in the area of employment, vocational training, promotion, and working conditions (Equal Treatment Directive) \uf0b7 Directive 97/80/EC on the burden of proof, making the respondent responsible for proving that there has been no breach of principle of equal treatment if facts suggesting so are presented (Burden of Prof Directive). In 2006 a single Directive sought to bring together a number of legislative streams. Seven Directives in the context of equal treatment between women and men were combined and by 2009 approximately 200 European Court of Justice (ECJ) decisions had been made with respect to the issue of gender pay. PE 504.469 EAVA 4/2013 II-16 ",
        "European Added Value of applying the principle of equal pay In 2007 the Commission issued the Communication \u201c Tackling the pay gap between women and men \" 3, setting out the following four priorities: \uf0b7 Exploring ways to improve the legislative framework and its implementation. \uf0b7 Exploiting to the full the European Strategy for Growth and Jobs. \uf0b7 Encouraging employers to respect equal pay. \uf0b7 Supporting the exchange of good practice at EU level. In 2011 the European Commission published its \u201cRoadmap for equality between women and men 2006-2010\u201d. The document sets out six priorities in the field of gender equality including the accomplishment of equal economic independence for women and men, with the elimination of the GPG set as one of the main objectives. 4.3 Assessment of the GPG In Table 3, the unadjusted GPG for the 27 Member States.

This fact is especially interesting, considering that throughout the EU the proportion of women employed in the public sector is significantly higher than in the private sector. However, it can also be the case that in a country with low female labour market participation, the proportion of women working in the public sector is considerably higher compared to the overall female labour market participation. Nevertheless, not only the level of pay divergence tends to differ, moreover different dynamics in closing the GPG in the public and private sector can be identified. A literature review of the GPG in the UK for example describes the following: \u2018Despite significant equal pay initiatives in local government and the health sector, there has been little progress in recent years in closing the GPG in the public sector, which currently stands at 14.6% (based on mean full-time hourly earnings) up from 13.9% in 2008. While the gap is significantly lower than the full-time private sector GPG (21.6%), the private sector gap has fallen five percentage points since 1997. Part of the lack of progress in the GPG in the public sector is explained by the lack of representation of females in senior management roles in the sector. Women represent 53% of all employees in the civil service, but occupy only 33% of senior management roles.\u2019 (EWG, 2011:3) In addition the GPG may be at risk of widening up in some countries due to public sector job cuts, which depending on the proportion of women employed in the sector bears the risk of disproportionally affecting women. Generally speaking, public sector employees are typically protected by collective pay agreements, which may be one of the reasons why there is a tendency for a lower GPG in the public sector. Other reasons for the persistence of wage gaps between public and private sector are, for example, the type of job carried out or the level of employees\u2019 qualifications, as the UK Office for National Statistics indicates: \u2018Female employees in the public sector earn considerably more, on average, than female employees in the private sector. This is due to the different jobs that are PE 504.469 EAVA 4/2013 II-18 ",
        "European Added Value of applying the principle of equal pay typically carried out by women in the public and private sectors. In the private sector women carry out a significant proportion of low paid jobs, such as cleaning and catering. In the public sector, while women still perform lower paid jobs, such as caring and clerical work, there are also a high proportion of women employed in professional, higher paid occupations, such as nursing or teaching. (\u2026) overall, the public sector consists of a higher qualified workforce than the private sector. A higher qualified workforce would, on average, receive higher pay than a less qualified workforce. Therefore, it would be expected that, on average, the higher level of qualifications in the public sector would translate into higher average earnings in the public sector compared with the private sector.\u2019 (ONS, 2012: p.13) While statistics show that the majority of EU Member States have a higher GPG in the private sector, this is not the case for countries such as Bulgaria, Latvia, Hungary, Romania, and Finland (see Eurostat, 2013). Foubert (2010) states that in Hungary, a higher GPG in the public sector could be attributed to the \u201climited opportunity in the public sector to resort to non-reported labour and non-reported payments\u201d (Foubert, 2010:5); which is reported to be widely used in the private sector in Hungary. 4.5 Impact of Gender Gap Secondary evidence was found to be limited in terms of relevant evidence on the economic and financial impact of the GPG across the EU, suggesting this to be an area which has not been examined in particular depth and could be an area for more detailed research in future. The limited available literature on this subject, however, suggests that the impact of reducing the GPG would result in a positive economic impact, in terms of an increase in GDP within Member States. The extent of the impact, however, varies considerably across the literature (and also varies significantly by country). One should also note that measuring economic performance using GDP overall undervalues women\u2019s total economic contribution as women\u2019s unpaid domestic activities do not appear in national accounts (Klasen, 1999; 2002, cited in Cassells et al, 2009). The table below summaries the quantitative evidence in the existing literature of the economic impact of decreasing or increasing the GPG (or gender pap). This evidence suggests that decreasing the gender gap results in an increase in economic performance (GDP), whilst a widening of the gap results in a decrease in income/GDP.

        "European Added Value of applying the principle of equal pay 4.6 Discussion of the economic impact on GDP A macroeconomic approach to gender equality indicates that increasing women\u2019s participation in the labour market has accounted for a quarter of annual economic growth in Europe since 1995 (OECD, 2008). This \u201cpositive development has contributed to greater recognition of the \u2018economic case\u2019 for gender equality\u2019\u201d (EC, 2011). Further research has shown that by narrowing the gender employment gap, the economic results are positively impacted and \u201ccould play a role in addressing the problems posed by an ageing population and the burden of pensions\u201d (ibid.). For example, the Corporate Gender Gap Report 2010, World Economic Forum, quotes a possible increase of 13% in Euro-area GDP (Davy, 2007). Davy (2007) stated that the narrowing of the gender employment rates across the Eurozone had accounted for half of the growth in the Eurozone total employment rate and 0.4 percentage points of the 2.1% trend growth achieved since 1995 (Davy, 2007). Davy also concludes that if female employment were to rise to the level of male employment (all else being equal), GDP would increase by 21% in Italy; 19% in Spain; 9% in Germany and France; 8% in the UK; 5% in Denmark and 3% in Sweden (Davy, 2007). Davy (2007) states that: \u201cEmpirical estimates suggest that raising the employment rate by 1 percentage point has, on average, an offsetting drag on output per person of 0.3pp-0.4pp (i.e., leaving a net overall impact on GDP of 0.6 pp-0.7pp). But the offsetting drag on productivity may be less than 0.3pp-0.4pp when the rise in employment is due to a narrowing of the male-female employment gap rather than, for instance, a generalised reduction in unemployment. Moreover, even accounting for these offsetting effects, the potential boost to income from raising female employment would still be substantial.\u201d (Davy, 2007) Walby and Olsen (2002, cited in Cassells et al, 2009) also assess the impact of the GPG on productivity. They use wages as a proxy measure of productivity in order to estimate the impact of gender discrimination on the pay gap. They found that gender discrimination accounted for 29 % of the pay and productivity gap, which as a result impacts GDP and economic growth (however, they did not quantify this impact) (cited in Cassells et al, 2009). Cassells et al (2009) also found evidence in studies from Cavalcanti and Tavares (2007) and Caro (2008) that suggests \u201ca higher gender wage gap (measured as female to male earning ratios) leads to lower output per capita indirectly\u201d through female labour force participation. Through female labour force participation, they suggest that as \u201cthe gender wage gap decreases, women work more, due to the added wage incentive, and thus GDP per capita increases\u201d (cited in Cassell et al, 2009). However, Cassells et al (2009) also state that \u201cdifferences in labour market structures\u201d are an important consideration, citing a Study by Sequino (2000) who found that the GPG was a \u201cstimulus (rather than a hindrance) to GDP growth in export-oriented economies, in her Study of semi-industrialised countries. However, this finding may only be relevant for semi-industrialised or developing countries that rely on manufacturing exports as a significant component of output.\u201d (cited in Cassells et al, 2009).

        "Research paper on economic aspects (2007) and Caro (2008) (cited in Cassells et al, 2009) found that as the GPG is reduced, the \u201copportunity cost of having children increased\u201d, which reduces the fertility rate, which in turn increases women\u2019s working hours and as a consequence GDP per capita is increased (cited in Cassells et al, 2009). Cavalcanti and Tavares (2007) used a cross-country analysis of both developed and developing countries and found that a \u201c50 % increase in the GPG caused a decrease in income per capita of a quarter of the original income per capita and an increase in hours worked at home by 65 %\u201d (cited in Cassells et al, 2009). Similarly, Caro (2008) found in a Study of Spain that eradication of the GPG would result in an increase in women\u2019s working hours of 20 % and an increase in GDP per capita of 17.6 % (cited in Cassells et al, 2009). A Study by L\u00f6fstr\u00f6m (2008) calculated the potential increase in GDP in the EU Member States following transition to full gender equality in the labour market \u2013 described as female activity becoming equal to that of men; women\u2019s part-time work declining to the level of that for men; and women\u2019s productivity becoming equal to that of men. The report suggests that each of these transitions would result in a positive GDP effect, with GDP increases ranging from 14 % in Slovenia to more than 40 % in Malta, Greece, and the Netherlands. \u201cThese estimates give an indication of the magnitude of the economic gains to be had from gender equality\u201d (L\u00f6fstr\u00f6m, 2008:26). An Australian Study cited by Cassells et al (2009) also provides an account of the impact of the gender wage gap on economic growth and is of interest as it provides some guidance on the scale of the impact and also in terms of the assumptions and limitations underpinning the micro and macroeconomic models used to calculate the impact of the GPG. Using macroeconomic modelling techniques, the Study finds that the GPG impacts substantially on Australian economic performance, measured in terms of GDP per capita. The paper estimates that a decrease in the gender wage gap of 1 percentage point would equate to an increase of 0.5 % of total GDP and eradicating the GPG completely would be worth about 8.5 % of GDP or a growth in GDP of around $93 billion (Cassels et al, 2009). Cassells et al also model the impact of various factors to provide evidence on the negative effects of the pay gap on growth. They find that if the gender wage gap increased by one percentage point, average hours of work would decrease, and GDP per capita would fall by 0.318 %. This finding is explainable in the sense that if there was an increased GPG, this is likely to act as a disincentive to women to work longer hour and reduced working hours lowers economic growth (Cassells et al, 2009). Alternatively, a decrease the GPG has been \u201csignificantly associated\u201d with an increase in women\u2019s hours of work\u201d (Cassells et al, 2009; 23), however, Cassells et al note that the ability of women to increase their hours of work is affected by factors including unemployment rates; availability and affordability of childcare and access to flexible working arrangements. Other factors in the Cassells et al model, whilst not having statistically significant effects, show that (with the exception of labour market participation) if the gender wage gap increased by one percentage point, the effect on economic growth based on the impact of the various factors is negative (see Table 5).

        "Research paper on economic aspects In a recent report, the OECD also explored the economic case for gender equality. The report focuses on the effects of convergence between male and simulation methodology developed by Olsen and Walby. It presents three scenarios: a no-change scenario where the gap between male and female labour force participation rates remain the same as those observed in 2010; a scenario whereby gender gaps reduce by 50 % by 2030; and a scenario whereby there is convergence in participation rates and the gender gap in labour force participation levels is eradicated by 2030 (OECD, 2012). The report shows that on average across the OECD, a 50 % decrease in the gender gap in labour force participation rates would lead to an increase in the GDP per capita annual growth rate of 0.3 percentage points. If there was total convergence of participation rates by 2030, the increase would equate to 0.6 percentage points, which it states is equivalent to an overall increase of 12 % in GDP over 20 years. The largest increases, at more than 0.5 %, from total convergence, were forecast for Italy, the Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Luxembourg, Poland and the Slovak Republic (see Table 7 below) (OECD, 2012).

Similarly, the Economist in the UK reported in November 2011 that Goldman Sachs had calculated that eliminating the remaining GPG between male and female employment rates could increase GDP in America by a total of 9 % and in the Euro Zone by 13 % (Economist, 2011 Closing the gap, 26 November 2011). Studies from the UK, also suggest that reducing the GPG would have a positive impact on economic performance. The Women and Work Commission (2009) estimated that factors such as gendered job segregation, the lack of part-time roles in senior positions and pay discrimination contributes to the loss of between \u00a315 and \u00a323 billion or 1.3 to 2 % of GDP every year (Women and Work Commission, 2009). The Trade Union Congress (TUC) in the UK similarly used data from The Gender and Employment in Local Labour Markets project4 which found that 54 % of UK women employed part-time were \u2018employed below their potential\u2019, amounting to 2.8 million women (using figures from 2006), to suggest that if part-time jobs that paid \u00a34 an hour more (the gap between hourly wages in full-time and part-time work) were available and women worked an average of 20 hours a week and 2.8 million women benefitted, the total increase in GDP would be \u00a311.2 billion (TUC, 2008). An attempt to provide empirical evidence from South America, based on a Study by Costa and Silva (2008) states that\u201c gender inequalities act as barriers to pro-poor growth \u201c, using examples from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, El Salvador and Mexico. Using a simulated model where gender wage discrimination is eliminated in these countries, they 4 Reported in Yeandle, S (2006) \u2018 Local Labour Markets and the GPG\u2019 , Paper to the European Sociological Association Interim Conference, Lisbon, 6 -8 September 2006 PE 504.469 EAVA 4/2013 II-25 ",
        "Research paper on economic aspects demonstrate that as a result women\u2019s pay would increase and in Argentina, Brazil and Mexico female earnings would even be higher than those of men because, on average, women in these countries are better qualified than men. This elimination of gender wage discrimination would contribute to greater economic growth and the conclusion is reached that \u201creducing gender inequalities implies benefits not only for women but also for men, children and the elderly, and for the poor as well as the rich.\u201d(Costa & Silva 2008:8). 4.7 Groups affected by the GPG and the consequences of the pay gap Family situation and marital status are found to have a significant impact on the GPG (Belgian Presidency, 2010). The GPG is found to be larger for married women and increases further for married women with children, particularly in Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Ireland, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Poland, Sweden, Slovenia, Slovakia and the United Kingdom (Belgian Presidency, 2010). This observation is however \u201cless true of the new Member States where the widest gaps are often found among unmarried couples with a child/children\u201d (Belgian Presidency, 2010: 76). The GPG is lower in one-person households in Belgium, Denmark, Spain, Finland, France, Lithuania, Latvia and Sweden or unmarried couples without a child/children in Austria, the Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and the United Kingdom (Belgian Presidency, 2010). The pay gap is in favour of single women in Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Poland, and Slovenia. It is in favour of married women without any children in Ireland and unmarried women in a relationship without children in Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal and Slovenia. The pay gap is also in favour of unmarried women in a relationship with a child/children in Austria, Spain, Italy and Portugal and women who are in single- parent family situations in Austria, Cyprus, Greece, the Netherlands, Poland and Portugal. It favours women in other household situations in Hungary and Slovenia (\u201calthough some of the results should be interpreted with caution because the number of observations is low\u201d) (all examples cited by Belgian Presidency, 2010). Cassells et al (2009) cite evidence from the United States, conducted by Jones et al (2003) who state that the working hours of married women increase when the GPG is reduced. Jones et al (2003, cited in Cassells et al, 2009) found that married women were \u201cmore sensitive to changes in the gender wage gap than single women\u201d, finding that changes in the pay gap did not have a large effect on single women, but for married women \u201ca small reduction in the gender wage gap generated a large labour supply response\u201d, resulting in a move from unpaid work in the home to paid employment\u201d (ibid.). Cassells et al, 2009, however, also cite evidence from Fitzpatrick and Lester 2009 which showed the opposite impact for \u201cpartnered women\u201d, where an increase in earnings led to a decreased supply in labour (Fitzpatrick and Lester 2009, cited in Cassells et al, 2009). PE 504.469 EAVA 4/2013 II-26 ",
        "European Added Value of applying the principle of equal pay In countries such as the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Sweden and the United Kingdom) the pay gap is widest among the highest qualified (Belgian Presidency, 2010). This can be attributed to school choices; career paths; the individual pay negotiations of women and men; more women taking career breaks and occupational segregation (Belgian Presidency, 2010). However, in Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania, the opposite is found, with the pay gap narrower among the highest educated (ibid.). The GPG also has significant consequences \u201cin a market-orientated\u201d economy. Lower incomes for women put them at risk of poverty and female poverty is closely linked to child poverty. \u201cWomen\u2019s earnings may therefore be critical in preventing child poverty, primarily in single, but also in dual earning families\u201d (OFMDFM, 2010:17). Other consequences of the pay gap include the development of a pension gap, as pension contributions are commensurate with pay levels and labour market participation. The pay gap also creates a greater reliance on social support and welfare payments, with female poverty increasing women\u2019s\u2019 need for social assistance and other subsidised services such as healthcare, housing and child care (Moncton, 1996). There are also particular correlations between low incomes and poor health (ibid.): \u201cThe most important result of pay equity would be the full integration of women into the economy. Under the current system, women are faced with discrimination in employment, low purchasing power, financial dependence on governments for income support, and the stresses of a life in which they are not given equal credibility with men. Society pays a high price for maintaining the current system of compensating women on a lower pay scale than men, a price that will only rise in the future as poverty claims more women through single parenthood and old age\u201d (Canadian Advisory Council on the Status of Women and Canadian Human Rights Commission, cited in Moncton, 1996). 4.8 Costs to employers Limited evidence was found in the secondary evidence review about the financial costs to employers derived from failure to provide equal pay. In the UK, the Government Equalities Office (2011) found that the cost to an employer of an equal pay case (based on prices in 2010) is \u00a35,283.

Some discussion of these issues was identified however, for example, in the UK, the EHRC (2011) highlight the potential high loss in business productivity linked to defending equal pay claims. This defence is \u201ctime consuming as HR and line managers have to gather evidence, communicate with legal representatives and attend tribunal hearings\u201d (EHRC, 2011:4), which impacts on productivity levels. Low staff morale can also lead to further loss in business productivity if employees perceive that there is pay discrimination within the organisation, as a result of equal pay claims in their workplace (EHRC, 2011). A report by the Employer\u2019s and Manufacturer\u2019s Association in New Zealand also observed that addressing the gender wage gap is strongly associated with higher morale and job satisfaction (EMA, 2012). Equal pay claims in the workplace can also have a \u201cnegative impact on the business reputation, which could adversely affect the businesses ability to attract and retain the best employees\u201d (EHRC, 2011). Loss of reputation can also impact customer attitudes and \u201cultimately the company\u2019s commercial success\u201d.

        "European Added Value of applying the principle of equal pay 5. The Bauer Report In May 2012, the European Parliament adopted a legislative initiative report on Equal pay ( Bauer report) 5 , calling on the Commission, among others, to review Directive 2006/54/EC on the implementation of the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment of men and women in matters of employment and occupation, before February 2013. In its official response to this report, the Commission has indicated that it does not intend to review the Directive to address the specificity of the causes for the current GPG within this deadline, but will instead draw up a report to be presented in the first half of 2013, reviewing the practical implementation of this Directive at national level. The Bauer Report expressed concern relating to the European Commission\u2019s lack of response to Parliament\u2019s resolution of 18 November 2008, or to its resolution of 10 February 2010 and matters reflected in the Council Conclusions on the European Pact for gender equality for the period 2011 \u2013 2020. The report expressed further concern that in the past decade progress has only been achieved very slowly, that the wage differential between men and women has remained persistently high in recent years and that, despite the legally binding principle of equal pay for work of equal value, women\u2019s hourly earnings in the EU-27 were on average 17.5 % less than men\u2019s for the same work in 2009 (up to 30% less in the private sector, equal merit and qualifications). The report goes on to highlight what it believes to be the nature and extent of the problem and sets out a series of challenges to the European Commission and Member States which in combination represents what it believes to be a coherent and structured set of policies to help reduce the GPG. In view of this response, the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality requested an EAV assessment to be prepared as a follow-up and a strong additional justification to the legislative initiative report . In the following section the Research Team set out the recommendations of the Bauer Report that were set out in the Study terms of reference. Each recommendation is set out in terms of detail and a high level assessment is made based on available secondary evidence as to the potential that it has to positively impact on the GPG 5.1 Recommendations of the Bauer Report The Bauer Report sets out the following nine policy recommendations: \uf0b7 Recommendation 1: Definitions \uf0b7 Recommendation 2: Analysis of the Situation and Transparency of Results \uf0b7 Recommendation 3: Work Evaluation and Job Classification 5 Resolution with recommendations to the Commission on application of the principle of equal pay for male and female workers for equal work or work of equal value 2011/2285(INI) PE 504.469 EAVA 4/2013 II-29 ",

In the following section we provide a pr\u00e9cis of each option. Recommendation 2 (Option 1): Better analysis of the situation and transparency of results The Bauer Report stated that there is indication that regular pay audits and transparency have a series of positive effects as they improve talent development, the company's reputation and contribute to proper job evaluation- both internally and with relation to market forces. The lack of information and awareness among employers and employees about existing of possible pay gaps within their company as well as their ignorance weakens the implementation of the principle enshrined in the Treaty and in existing legislation. Acknowledging the lack of accurate, comparable and coherent statistical data, including on the part-time GPG and the gender pensions gap, and the existing lower pay rates for women especially across professions traditionally dominated by women, Member States should take full account of the GPG in their social policies and treat it as a serious problem. On this basis the option suggests regular pay audits, as well as the publication of their results, bearing in mind the personal data protection, are made compulsory within companies. The same requirement can also apply to information on remuneration in addition to pay. This information should be accessible to employees, trade unions and adequate authorities. Employers should provide employees and their representatives with results in the form of wage statistics, broken down by gender. This data should be compiled at sectoral and national level in each Member State. In addition the measures suggest that there should be a requirement on employers to adopt transparency policy in relation to wage composition and structures, including extra pay, bonuses and other advantages forming part of remuneration. Equally where wage statistics show group or individual differences in pay on grounds of sex, employers are obliged to analyse these differences further and react to eliminate them. Recommendation 3 (Option 2): Work evaluation and job classification The Bauer Report suggest that the concept of the value of work must be based on qualifications, interpersonal skills and responsibility emphasising quality of work, with the aim of promoting equal opportunities between women and men. This concept should not be marked by a stereotyped approach unfavourable to women, for example putting the emphasis on physical strength rather than on interpersonal skills and has to ensure PE 504.469 EAVA 4/2013 II-30 ",
        "European Added Value of applying the principle of equal pay that work that involves responsibility for human beings is not considered of lower value than those with responsibility for material or financial resources. The proposal suggests that women must therefore be provided with information, assistance and/or training in wage negotiations, job classification and pay-scaling. It must be possible for sectors and companies to be asked to examine whether their job classification systems reflect the gender dimension in the required manner, and to make the necessary corrections. The Report states that a European Commission initiative should encourage Member States to introduce job classification complying with the principle of equality between women and men, enabling both employers and workers to identify possible pay discrimination based on a biased pay- scale definition. Respecting national laws and traditions concerning industrial relations systems remain important. Work evaluation and classification should also be transparent and be made available to all stakeholders and to labour inspectorates and equality bodies. At the level of Member States the report recommends that each Member State should carry out a thorough assessment centred on professions dominated by women. A gender- neutral job evaluation should be based on new systems for classifying and organising staff and organising work and on professional experience and productivity assessed above all in qualitative terms, such as education and other qualifications, mental and physical requirements, responsibility for human and material resources, for use as a source of data and assessment grids for determining pay, with due regard to the principle of comparability. Recommendation 4 (Option 3): Equality bodies and legal remedies This option is focussed on enhancing the mandate of equality bodies, namely by reinforcing their legal powers to initiate investigations and impose sanctions, contribute to providing women with more efficient (i.e. more accessible and ideally at a lower cost) legal remedies. The recommendation is based on the principle that equality promotion and monitoring bodies should play a greater role in diminishing GPG. The report asserts that bodies should be empowered to monitor, report, and, where possible, enforce gender equality legislation more effectively and more independently while they should be adequately funded. Article 20 of Directive 2006/54/EC should be revised so as to enhance the bodies\u2019 mandate by: \uf0b7 supporting and advising victims of pay discrimination; - providing independent surveys concerning the pay gap; \uf0b7 publishing independent reports and making recommendations on any issue relating to pay discrimination; \uf0b7 legal powers to initiate their own investigation; \uf0b7 legal powers to impose sanctions in cases of breaching the principle of equal pay for equal work and/or to bring wage discrimination cases to court; and \uf0b7 providing special training for the social partners and for lawyers, judges and PE 504.469 EAVA 4/2013 II-31 ",

Recommendation 8 (Option 4): Sanctions Under Directive 2006/54/EC, Member States are already obliged to introduce measures providing compensation or reparation (art. 18), as well as penalties (art 25) for failure to implement equal pay. The Study examines in what way (to what extent and using which modalities) has this requirement been implemented in Member States' national legal systems. The Bauer Report stated that it is important that Member States take the necessary measures to ensure that infringement of the principle of equal pay for work of equal value is subject to appropriate sanctions according to the legal provisions in force. The Report goes on to state that in spite of the existing legislation, inspections and punitive action are often woefully inadequate where the principle of equal pay is concerned. The Report asserts that these matters need to be treated as a priority, and the agencies and bodies responsible for them must be provided with the necessary technical and financial resources. The Report contends that provisions included in Directive 2006/54/EC on compensation and on penalties are not sufficient to avoid infringement of the equal pay principle. The Report concludes by suggesting consideration of: \uf0b7 penalties, which must include the payment of compensation to the victim; \uf0b7 administrative fines (for example in the event of failure of notification or of compulsory communication or unavailability of analysis and evaluation of wage statistics disaggregated by gender (according to Recommendation 2)) requested by labour inspectorates or the competent equality bodies; \uf0b7 disqualification from public benefits, subsidies (including EU funding managed by Member States) and public procurement procedures, as already provided for by Directives 2004/17/EC1 and 2004/18/EC2 concerning the procurement procedure; and \uf0b7 identification of offenders, which should be made public. Recommendation 9 (Option 5): Streamlining of EU regulation and EU policy A wage penalty appears to be linked to working part-time. The paper will examine the scale and the economic implications of this phenomenon for women. The Bauer Report stated this to be an area for urgent action given that a wage penalty appears to be linked to working part-time. The Report suggests both an evaluation and possible revision of Council Directive 97/81/EC of 15 December 1997 concerning the PE 504.469 EAVA 4/2013 II-32 ",

Within the scope of the Study it is not possible to do this is a quantified form and Table 8 below indicates the countries that have implemented particular policies linked to the individual Bauer recommendations, based on the reviewed secondary evidence. The scope of the policies, however, differs significantly from one country to another. The colours in the table indicate the following: \uf0b7 Green: The Member State has made significant development in this area and translated policy linked to the indicated Bauer recommendation into mandatory, legislative requirements \uf0b7 Yellow: There has been partial development in the Member State in the indicated policy area, perhaps including some focused effort by the social partners. \uf0b7 Red : In the reviewed secondary evidence no references were found to policy actions in the area linked to the Bauer recommendation. The coding is based on the evidence identified from the list of sources set out in Annex 1. It is important to note that where evidence of significant or partial development in a policy area linked to the Bauer recommendation is identified within a Member State, it does not interpret whether the policy is effectively implemented or whether compliance is achieved.

Austria, which has also made significant development across four of the five Bauer policy areas, conversely has the second highest GPG in Europe at 23.7% (behind Estonia at 27.3%).

Belgium Narrowing the GPG is one of the priorities of the Belgian government in the equality field. Companies are required by law to produce an annual report on gender equality, which must be presented to the works council or trade union representatives. In March 2012, the Belgian parliament passed new legislation that obliges companies to report on rates of pay for men and women. Specifically, companies with more than 50 employees are now required to: \uf0b7 report the wages of male and female employees in the \u2018social balance sheet\u2019 that all Belgian companies are required to include in their annual accounts \uf0b7 draw up an analysis of their pay structure every two years. This analysis must be submitted to the company\u2019s works council and include wages, social benefits, supplementary insurances and other fringe benefits, measured as full-time equivalents, broken down by gender, blue/white-collar status, job level, seniority and level of qualification \uf0b7 appoint a mediator (such as a union representative) within the company, who can independently search for a solution if any employee thinks they are a victim of wage discrimination. In the case of companies with fewer than 50 employees, sectoral joint committees will be required to develop measures such as gender-neutral job function classifications. These will be submitted to the Federal Public Service for Employment, Labour and Social Dialogue which will assess them against the existing checklist for gender neutrality in job evaluation and classification, developed by the Institute for the Equality of Women and Men, which is a Federal Public Institute created to guarantee and promote the equality of women and men. Source: European Industrial Relations Observatory 2012 Countries such as Austria and Denmark have implemented particular requirements on employers to deliver gender specific data, at regular intervals to national authorities (Foubert, 2010). For example, in Austria employers must produce income reports every two years, showing average/median pay by occupational category and gender and PE 504.469 EAVA 4/2013 II-35 ",
        "Research paper on economic aspects failure to do so can result in the company being publically named on the website of the Ministry for Women\u2019s Affairs. Legislation in Denmark also requires employers with more than 35 staff to report wage statistics broken down by gender to the Statistical Bureau. Similarly, in Belgium and France organisations with over 50 employees must legally conduct a comparative analysis of the wages of men and women. In Italy, similar obligations fall on organisations employing more than 100 staff, with a requirement to conduct the analysis every two years. In Sweden, legislation requires employers with 25 or more staff to conduct a pay survey every three years and employers with ten or more staff to prepare an annual equal opportunities plan which contains a wage survey of gender pay differences and measures to remedy any inequalities. In Finland, employers with 30 or more employees must also produce an equality plan including an analysis of pay differentials between men and women\u2019s jobs. Foubert et al (2010) stated that the mandatory reporting requirements that exist in Austria, Finland, France, Italy and Sweden could \u201cserve as good practices\u201d to other Member States. Mandatory equal pay plans required by employers in Finland, Sweden and Spain are also viewed as good practices (Foubert et al, 2010). The Foubert et al (2010) Study found there to be a \u201crecurring call for legislation obliging employers to publish detailed information regarding wages paid and other advantages given to employees within the company\u201d (Foubert et al, 2010). Sweden In Sweden, all organisations with 25 or more employees must by law carry out a wage mapping exercise every three years. The aim of this exercise is to detect whether any part of wage differentials is based on gender. It consists of mapping, analysis and the formulation of an action plan. If the mapping exercise shows that there are wage differentials based on gender, and the analysis shows that part of these is related to gender, the employer must take action to reduce the wage gap. In addition, the employer must make an action plan to prevent future gender-related wage differentials. This report or document must also be delivered to the relevant authorities as it will be used for follow-up studies in the future. So far, the results are that knowledge about wage structures in all enterprises in Sweden is much better today than it used to be. However, employer response to this obligation is below 100%, and this is probably due to a lack of direct sanctions. In addition, as yet the gender wage gap in Sweden is unchanged, remaining at approximately 15 percentage points.

In Belgium, a national agreement established that by 2016 all job classifications should be gender neutral to reduce the GPG and sector joint committees have been ensuring job classifications comply with the principle of gender equality through use of the EVA (Evaluation Analytique/analytische EVAluatie). In Belgium, Austria and the Netherlands, the social partners also appear to have made significant efforts in the area of gender neutral job classification in order to address income differences between men and women. Belgium Belgian national collective agreement number 25 on equal pay between men and women (last modified in 2008), which has binding legal status, encourages the social partners to integrate a gender-neutral approach to job classification. It states that job evaluation systems must by 2016 ensure equal treatment between men and women in terms of the criteria they use, the weighting of these criteria and the way in which they are implemented into remuneration. Those sectors and companies that have not yet evaluated their job evaluation and pay systems in terms of gender neutrality should do so and make any necessary adjustments (Article 3). The national collective agreement notes that some sectoral agreements in Belgium are indeed in need of revision in this area, while others do not have any provision for gender-neutral work evaluation and job classification. It also notes that all pay systems need to be transparent if they are to ensure gender neutrality.

The company hopes that this agreement, which has been characterised as groundbreaking, will make a significant contribution to ensuring equal pay for work of equal value for men and women at every level of the company. The agreement was concluded between GDF Suez management and representatives of the European trade unions industrial, the European Federation of Public Service Unions (EPSU), and CEC European Managers (CEC). The overall aim of the agreement is to achieve equal opportunities and pay equality between women and men, and a better work-life balance for all. It sets out a range of specific measures and actions, principally aimed at: \uf0b7 changing thinking and behaviour, notably through social dialogue; \uf0b7 providing information for employees, managers, employee representatives and trade union organisations; \uf0b7 guaranteeing equal opportunities in recruitment, equality in career progression and equal access to vocational training; \uf0b7 encouraging women\u2019s networking and mentoring, and better representation of women among employee and union representatives; \uf0b7 identifying and rectifying gender pay inequalities, and ensuring pay equality; \uf0b7 improving work\u2013life balance for all employees; \uf0b7 preventing sexual harassment. The agreement\u2019s concrete objectives include ensuring that, by 2016, women make up at least: \uf0b7 30% of employees recruited on open-ended contracts (women currently make up 19% of the GDF Suez workforce); \uf0b7 25% of all executives with open-ended contracts. The agreement also requires the introduction of equality action plans at the level of individual GDF Suez group companies with more than 150 employees, and it says union and employee representatives must be consulted on these. The plans will cover the issues and objectives set out in the European agreement and must be jointly reviewed each year on the basis of a set of indicators contained in the agreement. A European-level commission, made up of the signatories, will review application of the agreement annually on the basis of an agreed set of equality indicators.

The sanctions in place differ and explicit sanctions for failure to implement equal pay were found to be evident in Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Finland, France, Hungary, Italy, Lithuania, Portugal and Sweden (coded green). France Pressure to close the GPG has been increasing in France over the past decade. In 2001, legislation obliged companies to negotiate on the question of workplace gender equality. In 2006, this obligation was extended in order to eradicate the wage gap between men and women, but without any sanctions being imposed. Most recently, the law of 9 November 2010, reforming the pension system, included a penalty of up to 1% of the payroll costs for companies with at least 50 employees that had not met their responsibilities to reduce the pay gap by 1 January 2012. Further, companies with at least 50 employees must by law negotiate a collective agreement or draw up a unilateral action plan in consultation with employee representatives. Failure to comply will result in sanctions. The legislation not only stipulates the agenda for negotiations, but also compels the negotiators or company management to identify progress targets and the means of achieving them, and to put in place ways of measuring whether targets for narrowing the pay gap have been met. To support negotiations or the drawing up of an action plan, companies must compile an annual report on the comparative status of overall employment and training conditions for women and men.

Lithuania The Office of Equal Opportunities Ombudsman in Lithuania, which has been functioning since 1999, is an independent state institution answerable to the Parliament, and one of the key institutions within the gender equality machinery. It takes overall responsibility for the supervision and implementation of the Law on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men in Lithuania. The Ombudsman investigates individual complaints on gender discrimination and sexual harassment; submits recommendations and proposals to the Parliament, governmental institutions on the priorities of gender equality policy, including recommendations on amendments to relevant legislation. In cooperation with other offices the Ombudsman supervises mass media so that it does not place discriminatory advertisements and does not treat one gender as in any way superior or better in regard to the other. Additionally, the Ombudsman may participate at the interviews for a job and admission tests at educational institutions as an observer. The Office is actively working to raise public awareness on gender equality issues. The decisions of the Ombudsman in cases of discrimination on grounds of sex include the right to refer the material of the complaints to the pre-trial investigation bodies, and to address the institutions with a recommendation to discontinue the violations of the Law on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men. The Ombudsman has a right to investigate administrative cases and impose administrative sanctions for violations of the Law on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men, which is one of the most important and effective tools of the Lithuanian gender equality policy. Section 6, p. 1, of the Equal Opportunities Act of Women and Men states that violation of equal rights for women and men is sanctioned \u201caccording to the rules of administrative law\u201d: the Administrative Penalties Act 408 imposes administrative fines of approximately EUR 35 to EUR 1100.

Policies which include specific gender considerations in part-time working legislation, as shown by the literature, were evident in Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and the UK. Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain and the UK also make legislative statements about payment for overtime for part-time workers (therefore these Member States have been coded green). United Kingdom The Part-Time Workers (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations 2000 (amended in 2002) gave part-time workers a statutory right to be treated no less favourably than their comparable full-time colleagues. This meant that, in comparison with full-timers, part-time workers are entitled to: \uf0b7 the same hourly rate of pay, \uf0b7 the same access to company pension schemes, \uf0b7 the same entitlements to annual leave and maternity/parental leave on a pro rata basis, \uf0b7 the same entitlement to contractual sick pay, and \uf0b7 no less favourable treatment in access to training. The UK government states that less favourable treatment of part-time workers is not widespread in the UK. Nevertheless, where it does occur, it can affect a variety of terms and conditions, including pay, pensions, holidays and training, which was the reason behind the EU part-time work Directive, which is implemented in the UK by means of these Regulations. In the area of pay, the Regulations state that part-time workers must receive the same basic rate of pay as comparable full-time workers. They must not be given a lower hourly rate, unless justified by objective grounds. One example where a different hourly rate might be objectively justified would be a performance-related pay scheme. If workers are shown to have a different level of performance measured by a fair and consistent appraisal system this could justifiably result in different rates of pay. In general, the same principle applies to enhanced rates of pay. In special circumstances, special rates of pay apply. These may include bonus pay, shift allowances, unsocial hours payments or weekend payments. In these cases, part-time workers are entitled to the same hourly rate as a comparable full-time worker.

        "Research paper on economic aspects In Austria, part-time workers have a legal claim to premium rates of pay of an additional 25% for overtime work. Foubert et al (2010) states that in Belgium, employers organisations have campaigned for the Federal Government to allow for more \u201cflexible and cheaper overtime arrangements\u201d; viewing the current legislation as \u201cinflexible and expensive\u201d. Foubert et al state that the Government has reduced taxes on overtime pay to address these pressures, however Foubert et al note that \u201cmaking overtime easier and cheaper for employers entails the risk of negatively impacting those workers \u2013 mostly women \u2013 for whom the performance of overtime work clashes with e.g. family duties. Their pay will not be increased with overtime pay and, as a consequence, the GPG will rise\u201d (Foubert et al 2010). Foubert et al (2010) also note that payment for women\u2019s overtime work in Bulgaria is typically low in the sectors in which women dominate and recognise that when women receive additional pay for overtime worked, \u201cthis is usually part of the grey economy and thus not counted for social security purposes\u201d (Foubert et al, 2010). Smith & Bettio (2010) comment that there is a clear negative economic impact and loss of productivity as a result of shorter working hours caused by higher levels of part-time work. Smith states that \u201cshorter full-time working hours and higher levels of part-time work lead to lower recorded levels of GDP per capita in Europe compared to that in the United States\u201d. Smith, however, also states that in Nordic countries where there is higher female labour market participation, this helps address this impact. For example, Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden have some of the highest levels of female labour market participation but these also have among the highest part-time rates (European Commission, 2011). Smith & Bettio (2010) cite a Study by Elmeskov and Scarpetta (2000) which calculated that a \u201clower utilisation of labour contributes more than 20 percentage points to the gap in GDP per capita in the European Union compared to that of the United States\u201c (cited in Smith & Bettio, 2010). Ireland Under the Irish legislation, the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001 , there is provision for pro-rata entitlements with full-time employees. The Act states that if a condition of work is dependent on the number of hours worked by an employee, the extent to which that condition is provided to a part-time employee is related to the proportion that the normal hours of work of the part-time employee bears to the normal hours of the full-time employee. The conditions covered include remuneration, pensions, voluntary health contributions and access to sick pay. Further, the Irish Industrial Relations Act 1990 (Code of Practice on Access to Part-Time Working) Declaration Order 2006 states that access to part-time work should, as far as possible, be available across different levels in the organisation. In addition, employers should, as far as possible, give consideration to requests by employees to transfer from full-time to part-time work, and to requests by employees to transfer from part-time to full-time work or to increase their working time, should the opportunity arise.

It first outlines the evidence concerning impacts at national level associated with measures corresponding to the recommendations investigated as part of this Study, combines them with information concerning costs, and presents a simple cost-effectiveness analysis. The impact evidence is then combined with information concerning the baseline situation (presented in the previous sections) and information concerning compliance, to provide an assessment of the aggregate impact at country level . The estimation of potential impact has been made by ascribing a high, medium or low grading to each country based upon a combined assessment of the following: \uf0b7 Assessment on the potential of the measure to reduce the GPG; Options 1, 2 and 5 rated \u2018high\u2019 options 4 \u2018medium\u2019 and option 3 \u2018low\u2019 \uf0b7 Level of the existing GPG within the Member State with higher levels suggesting higher scope to achieve a reduction assessed as under 10% rated \u2018low\u2019 10-20% rated \u2018medium\u2019 and over 20% rated \u2018high\u2019; and \uf0b7 Current level of implementation of the initiative within the Member State where non-implementation provides higher scope to achieve a reduction. No evidence of implementation rates as \u2018high\u2019, some evidence \u2018medium\u2019 and strong evidence of having implemented a scheme equating to a \u2018low\u2019 potential for the particular Bauer recommendation to make additional benefit. In relation to Table 10 the grading has been made on the following basis: \uf0b7 Average score 3 \u2018High\u2019 (Light Green) \uf0b7 Average score 2.5 to 3 \u2018high to medium\u2019 (Green) \uf0b7 Average score 2 to 2.5 \u2018medium to high\u2019 (Dark Green) \uf0b7 Average score 2 \u2018medium\u2019 (Orange) \uf0b7 Average score 1.5 to 2 \u2018medium to low\u2019 (Dark Orange) \uf0b7 Average score 1 to 1.5 \u2018low to medium\u2019 (Light Red) \uf0b7 Average score 1 low (Red) For example in the case of Austria it has a high GPG (over 20%), there is evidence that it has made significant progress with options 1, 2, 4 and 5 and some progress with 3. This is set against the underlying potential of the options such that a \u2018high\u2019 GPG plus a \u2018low\u2019 already evidence of policy having been implemented and a high underlying potential for the measure to impact positively on the GPG producing an overall rating of 2.3 (Dark Green).

In this regard, it is worthwhile looking at provisions on enforcement. It needs to be stressed that the remit of the Study did not extend to an examination of levels of compliance within and across Member States and as such there is the potential for over or under estimation of potential impact within Table 10 above.

        "European Added Value of applying the principle of equal pay 6. Economic Impact Assessment Following standard microeconomic theory, levels of wages of workers should correspond to their productivity. Different pay levels would be related to differences in workers' productivity, which are caused, among other things by differences in skill levels. Once all differences in human capital are controlled for, for example by adjusting for different levels of education of men and women and differences in work experience (caused by differences in labour market participation), the GPG should disappear or at least narrow. However, as we know from much of the evidence, a persistent GPG is still found once for such factors have been accounted for. This GPG suggests that discrimination on the basis of personal characteristics exists. Social science research has identified multiple mechanisms that may cause the GPG, such as occupational segregation, dysfunctional social policy (which, for example, fails to offer adequate childcare) or further discrimination through differences in unionisation or job-role traditions. Since Becker's original work (1957), we know that wage discrimination, which is unrelated to productivity differences caused by the heterogeneity of labour, reduces economic efficiency in the longer term because firms that do not discriminate tend to achieve a higher marginal product of labour and are more productive. This microeconomic mechanism allows us to derive clear long-term costs relating to discrimination, in particular due to the fact that a persistent GPG reduces output in the economy because of suboptimal allocation of labour in production. In addition, there are further mechanisms that additionally reduce economic output in the longer term: reduced investment in firms because they have lower productivity compared to a counterfactual world without discrimination, adverse effects on skills acquisition, labour force participation and working times for women, lower fertility rates, etc. All these mechanisms suggest that long-term economic performance is higher in economies that set up mechanisms to achieve a narrower GPG/eradicate it. Welfare measures (such as GDP per capita) should be growing at consistently higher rates in countries with a low GPG compared to those with a large one when further characteristics such as the development of factors of production (capital stock/labour input at various skills/work experience levels) and general technical progress are controlled for. In the first main part of this chapter, we present a ceteris paribus (i.e. all other things being controlled for simultaneously) estimate of the effects of the GPG on GDP per capita growth using macroeconomic data for a panel of EU Member States (from Conference Board, OECD and Eurostat data), for which data on the GPG is available for a medium-term period. In the second part, the estimated impact of the GPG on economic growth is monetised using real 2012 $s adjusted for purchasing power parities based on the method by \u00c9ltet \u0151 , K\u00f6ves and Szulc (EKS PPP) in order to provide an estimate of the costs of the GPG to GDP. We then contextualise this effect size in the light of available estimates of the impact of various policy options to reduce the GPG by certain percentage points, for PE 504.469 EAVA 4/2013 II-49 ",
        "Research paper on economic aspects which a body of evidence exists from qualitative research (including the Matrix report). For example, impact estimates of how much the GPG could be reduced if better transparency of wages existed could then be translated into related output effects and show how the relative options would make an impact on GDP per capita. We hope that our discussion of these findings helps to assess the differential output effects, which could be achieved in the EU if specific policies, for example those summarised under the Bauer recommendations, were consistently implemented across the EU. 6.1 Our approach In our approach, we followed the Study by Cassells et al. (2009) on the quantitative impact of wage discrimination on GDP per capita growth in Australia, estimated on the basis of time series data, which was subsequently valued at market prices to show the costs of a persistent GPG in terms of foregone output. Implicitly, such estimates show how much higher social wealth would be if the GPG declined. Similar to Cassells et al. (2009), we estimate a human-capital augmented growth model to obtain a ceteris paribus effect on how much a persistent gender wage gap reduces economic growth in the EU. We use data from the Conference Board, the OECD and the European Labour Force Survey countries in order to construct a macroeconomic panel data set of (most) EU countries over the past 10 years, with monetary values adjusted to constant prices and purchasing power parity. The empirical design benefits from the variation of the GPG and economic growth across countries and over time. Using regression models, we explain how: \uf0b7 Dependent variables (GDP per capita or GDP per person employed as differences in logs) are explained by a set of \uf0b7 Independent variables (investment, population growth, employment, total hours worked in the economy, human capital stock in logs as required for the estimation empirical growth models and a level measure for the country's GPG). Assuming that a persistent gender wage gap results in economic inefficiency, a linear estimation of the effect of the GPG on differences in logged dependent variables provides an empirical estimate of the impact of the gender wage gap on the economic growth rate (similar to Seguino 2000). We are aware that our dependent variable represents an imperfect indicator for the economic outcomes of reducing the GPG. GDP per capita only includes activities that can be valued at market prices and are observed consistently across time and countries. In contrast, economic activity taking place in households, for example looking after the children or some kind of home production, is not valued in national accounts. However, these activities are likely to be reduced as female labour supply increases because of a smaller/eradicated GPG. With less time for home production available to women, households would resource more consumption from markets instead of home PE 504.469 EAVA 4/2013 II-50 ",
        "European Added Value of applying the principle of equal pay production. Therefore, some of the observed increase in output would only represent substitution in household consumption patterns, but not a true gain in household wealth as such activities were just excluded from the formal economic system. The output increase would partially represent a substitution and not a genuine increase in economic activity. The estimated ceteris paribus effect of reducing the GPG would therefore overstate the true economic impact. In the context of this Study, we will not be able to control for such effects. 6.2 Outline Economic Model We estimate an augmented Solow growth model using a dynamic panel data model for a total number of n countries and t time periods observed. The basic specification of the Solow growth model we use here is similar to that presented in Bond et al. (2001) although most empirical estimates we know of have a similar or identical form. Following Bond et al. (ibid.), we model our growth equation as: \uf028 \uf029 it i it t i t it x y y \uf075 \uf068 \uf062 \uf061 \uf067 \uf02b \uf02b \uf02b \uf02d \uf02b \uf03d \uf044 \uf02d ' 1 1 , for i= 1 ,\u2026N and t= 2 ,\u2026,T (1) where is the log difference in per capita GDP over a five year period, 1 , \uf02d t i is the logarithm of per capita GDP at the start of this period and is a vector of characteristics measured during the period. it y \uf044 y it x ' The specific form of the Solow model requires inclusion of the logarithm of the investment rate ( ), which we model on the basis of reported savings rates from the World Bank, and the logarithm of the growth rate of the population ( \uf068 i ) plus 0.05, where 0.05 represented the sum of exogenous technical change ( g ) and a depreciation rates ( \uf064 ). The augmented model as proposed in the original contribution by Mankiw et al. (1992) additionally includes a measure for the human capital stock in the economy, which in their Study was expressed as the logarithm of the secondary-school enrolment rate ( enr it ). In our estimates, we specify human capital stock as the percentage share of people in the working-age population who achieved at least level four according to the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED4). This is a measure for people in the working age population with either a full vocational or academic education following the end of mandatory secondary schooling. it s In addition, the specification as a panel data model further implies that unobserved country-specific effects ( \uf068 i ), which capture differences in the initial level of efficiency and period-specific intercepts t \uf067 , which capture productivity changes that are common to all countries. 6.3 Impact of the gender wage gap on growth We extend this basic model by further specifying that economic efficiency varies across countries by specific level parameters \uf068 i and the specific impact of a country's gender wage gap on economic efficiency, which enters the form in an additive-separable way as PE 504.469 EAVA 4/2013 II-51 ",

As is the standard in this literature, median earnings are related to wages and salaries in full- time work for dependent employment, i.e. avoiding differences, which could be caused by differences in working times and the larger share of women working in part-time employment compared to men. This should at least mitigate some of the differences between working-times of men and women, although the OECD acknowledges that men tend to work on average longer hours than women even when restricting the gap to full- time employees. 6 We are aware of the problem that the unadjusted gender wage gap does not account for the specific characteristics of the employment structure in the different countries and that the gender wage gap is usually wider for people at lower formal education levels than for people with post-secondary education, at least for younger cohorts in the labour market. 7 However, we do not know of consistent time-series data on the adjusted gender wage gap available for a larger sample of OECD or EU Member States and therefore rely on this sub-optimal measure. We do however believe that our model can at least address part of this weakness by including the percentage shares of people at least qualified to ISCED4 levels, which enter the form as the stock measure for human capital. 6.4 Empirical specification In addition to the gender wage gap and differential levels in human capital, we further include variables to account for differences in growth caused by country-specific labour market participation patterns. This is especially relevant in the context of Europe, where employment and working time differs markedly, with higher working time in the formerly communist Central and Eastern EU Member States and lower working time in the continental economies of the west (in particular the Netherlands, Germany and France). As was discussed in Cassells et al. (2009), this extension is necessary to separate the impact of general population growth on GDP per capita growth from the impact of changes in labour participation and changes in working times. 6 http://www.oecd.org/std/37964069.pdf 7 See also: Table LMF1.5.A: Average annual earnings of females as a percentage of males by level of educational attainment and age-cohort, 2008 or latest year available. http://www.oecd.org/social/family/LMF1.5%20Gender%20pay%20gaps%20for%20full%20time %20workers%20-%20updated%20081212.pdf PE 504.469 EAVA 4/2013 II-52 ",

As can be seen from these descriptives, the specification finally estimated is restricted to countries of the European Economic Area (EEA) as information on the human capital stock (ISCED4 as percent of total working-age population) was obtained from micro data of the European Labour Force Survey (ELFS) is only available for these countries and for the period 2002- 2011. Our country panel is further reduced by the GPG variable, which is currently only available for a subset of EEA countries, representing primarily the pre-2004 EU (EU15), the non-EU Member States of the EEA and Poland, the Czech and Slovak republics. In addition, the nature of the time series information is \"unbalanced\", which implies that some of the time series (for example for the Netherlands) do not cover the full time- period as for example data for the UK, which is available for the full range between 2002 and 2010 used for this analysis. Since the form is estimated for t= 2 ,\u2026,T as the initial level effect at the beginning of the period estimated enters the equation as a regressor, the unbalanced panel is estimated for a maximum of eight years per country (like in the UK), but in some countries for fewer years. 6.5 Estimation We estimate the model represented in (2) in two different estimates, specifying the vector of covariates x it as either a) annual average values for each period of five years (Caselli et al. 1996) or b) as levels related to the specific year (Mankiw et al. 1992, Bond et al. 2001). We also estimate the models for two different dependent variables, either a) the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in purchasing power parities based on the method by \u00c9ltet \u0151 , K\u00f6ves and Szulc (EKS PPP) 8 in real values as of 2012 or b) the GDP in 2012 EKS PPP per person employed, which was obtained by multiplying the GDP per capita measure with the ration of population to employment (as in Canarella and Pollard 2003). The GDP per person employed represents a measure closer to productivity than GDP per capita and can to some extent control for the variation in labour market participation and demography across the sample. 8 http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=5525 PE 504.469 EAVA 4/2013 II-53 ",
        "Research paper on economic aspects As suggested by the final specification, we estimate the growth model using the dynamic panel data model method, i.e. with lagged levels of the dependent variable included as a right-hand side regressor. While such a modelling can capture country-specific dynamics better than static panel data models, such as fixed or random effects models, there are econometric problems of estimating models with lagged dependent variables as generally with models including sources of endogeneity. We address this by estimating the dynamic panel data model using the estimator initially put forward by Arellano and Bond (1991), which has several advantages compared to static estimates of panel data: \uf0b7 First, the form represented in (2) is estimated in first differences, which implies that time-invariant country-specific level effects represented by i \uf068 cancel out similarly to a fixed effects model. \uf0b7 Second, by taking the first differences and allowing the levels of the x it to be correlated with unobserved country-specific fixed effects, the lagged first differences of x it and y it can be used as instruments in the level equations (see Bond et al. 2001). This property is specifically useful to the estimation of dynamic panel data models, which include a lagged dependent variable as a right hand side regressor (i.e. an \"endogenous variable\") as specified in (2). As a result of this, estimates obtained in OLS or Fixed/Random effects models would result in biased parameter estimates due to the correlation between one of the independent variables included in the model and the error term (cid:31) it9 . The Arellano/Bond estimator benefits of the availability of lagged levels of dependent and independent variables, which can be used as instruments for the differences of right-hand side regressors included, exploiting the fact that they are not correlated with the error term of the model in first differences. Both lagged levels of the dependent variable y it-2 until the earliest available point in time as well as levels of other covariates x it for all periods before t- 1 are used as instruments. 6.6 Results We show the results of both specifications in Table 11 and Table 12 below. These estimates are qualitatively similar to what would be suggested by the standard empirical literature on Solow models: \uf0b7 The coefficient of the lagged output is negative and strongly significant in all models. \uf0b7 The sign of the savings rate is positive, albeit not significant. The sign of population growth is negative in two models, which is consistent the Solow model, but only significant in the final estimate specifying x it as in-period levels. \uf0b7 Consistent with Mankiw et al. (1992) and further augmented Solow models, human capital stock has a positive and significant effect on growth in all models. \uf0b7 Consistent with the modelling of the dependent variables as either GDP per capita or GDP per person employed, labour force participation growth either significantly increases or decreases growth, while growth in working times per person employed have generally positive impact. 9 Note that this affects only typical panel where N is (relatively) large, but the number of periods T is small. A long time series would not suffer the same source of bias. PE 504.469 EAVA 4/2013 II-54 ",

        "Research paper on economic aspects 6.7 Main finding Our preferred specification two also includes two estimates of the impact of the gender wage gap, which is negative. This is consistent with expectations as a persistent gender wage gap reduces economic efficiency. The only significant estimate found was related to the specification of growth of GDP per person employed. The size of the impact (-0.0014) suggests that a decrease in the gender wage gap by one percentage point would increase economic growth by 0.1 percent. This finding will be used in the following to illustrate the economic costs of the gender wage gap. More specifically, we will derive output increase, which could be achieved in the EU if measures causing specific reductions in the gender wage gap were introduced consistently across the EU. Our finding compares low relative to the impact of the gender wage gap on economic growth for Australia (Cassels et al 2009), which is about 0.25 percent of a reduction of the GPG by 1 percentage point. However, since our data only represent the early 2000s, a longer-term impact as for Australia is unlikely to show in our data. We also believe that underlying growth dynamics differ markedly between Australia and Europe, with generally lower economic growth in Europe, which would be a plausible explanation for the impact of reducing the GPG in Australia perhaps being higher. 6.7.1 The economic impact of policies reducing the GPG Building on the above empirical estimation of the impact of the GPG on growth in the EU, the following section sets out to contextualise the above findings by providing some possible results stemming from the introduction of different policy options aimed at reducing the GPG. 6.7.2 The potential economic impact of a reduction of the gender wage gap Although the issue of the GPG and its potentially negative economic impact have been widely discussed both among academics and policy makers, as yet, only very little material actually quantifies the effects of different policy options to reduce the GPG. A recent report conducted for the European Commission, however, has estimated the reduction of the GPG within the European Union resulting from a range of potential policy options, such as sanctions or streamlining of existing EU regulations (Matrix, 2011). Based on the estimates that have emerged from this chapter (see table 12, Model 2), together with a quantification of effects of different policy options, the following tables will illustrate the economic costs in terms of loss of output associated with the gender wage gap in Europe and an illustrative number of individual European Member States. Leaving aside any policy options implying voluntary steps taken by employers such as regular reporting on GPG issues or more generally introducing more transparency in wage setting and progression criteria \u2013 both measures frequently referred to in the literature \u2013 the following section focus on five specific policy recommendations based on the Bauer report.

        "European Added Value of applying the principle of equal pay PE 504.469 EAVA 4/2013 II-57 6.7.3 The potential economic impact of selected Bauer recommendations Where introduced consistently across the EU, the five Bauer recommendations discussed in this paper, are likely to have a significant impact on economic output in the European Union. This is particularly the case for transparency of wages, reporting on the GPG and company level, and changes in the part-time work Directive (for each of these options, the GPG is estimated to be reduced by between two and three percentage points). Based on the estimated size of the impact (-0.0014) which suggests that a decrease in the gender wage gap by one percentage point would increase economic growth by 0.1 percent, Table 13 shows the potential impact of selected Bauer recommendations. According to the policy impact indicated in Table 13, the Bauer recommendations would lead to a reduction of the gender wage gap of between one and three percentage points across the European Union. Having set out the potential impact of a reduction in the GPG on economic output in the EU, using aggregated numbers for growth in total GDP as well as in GDP per capita help to contextualise the potential output effect a reduction in the GPG might have. The minimum and maximum impact scenarios set out in table 13 show that a decrease of the GPG of 2 percentage points will result in an increase in total GDP of US$ 43,902,370,000, which in turn will result in a GDP per capita increase of US$ 87.49 across the EU. Although this provides a more tangible indication of the economic impact of a reduction of the gender pay, in order to improve these estimates, further research on the actual effect of different policy options on closing the GPG will be needed to further specify which policy options are most beneficial in terms of benefits (in addition to further elaborating the costs of the implementation of different policies, see for example Matrix, 2011: pp.66). Moreover, given the heterogeneous situation across EU Member States in terms of the GPG, where countries have already partly implemented some of the policies summarised under the Bauer recommendations (see Annex 1 for an overview of different initiatives at Member State level), a more differentiated analysis may further add to the policy discussion. 6.7.4 The potential economic impact on individual EU Member States As described in the introductory section of this chapter, the GPG currently varies substantially among European Member States (see Chapter 4). Some countries, such as Austria and the Czech Republic, have the widest GPG, exceeding 20 percentage points. At the other end of the scale, in Slovenia and Poland, only very modest differences in the remuneration between men and women can be found. These disparities mean that some countries have scope for greater reductions in the gender wage gap, and have the potential to reap part of the economic benefits resulting from a more equalitarian pay structure which other countries already enjoy to a certain extent.

        "European Added Value of applying the principle of equal pay In order to see how reductions of different size in the GPG would translate in economic benefits of diverse magnitude, Table 15 presents estimated increases in real GDP per capita in each of the EU Member States under four possible scenarios. The departure point to obtain these estimates is the total growth rate or percent change in real GDP per capital that each Member State experimented in the period 2005-2010. What would have happened if the GPG had been reduced by 1 percentage point during this period? The econometric analysis presented above suggests that this would have led to a total growth rate 0.14 percentage points higher over the entire period 2005-2010. The difference between the level of real GDP per capita that would have been obtained as a result of faster growth and the actual level of real GDP per capita provides an estimation of the economic gains produced by a more balanced pay structure. Other possible scenarios show what would be the economic gains if the GPG were reduced by 5, 10 and 20 percentage points over this period. A reduction of 5 percentage points in the pay gap over the period 2005-2010, for instance, would have led to a total growth rate 0.7 percentage points larger (0.14 times 5). Countries whose current GPGs are still over 10 or 20 could have experimented growth rates 1.4 and 2.8 percentage points larger over the 2005-2010 period, had they reduced these gaps in 10 and 20 points, respectively. The size of the economic gain, therefore, depends on the initial level of GDP per capita, the actual rate of growth over the period and the size of the reduction in the gender wage gap. 6.8 Concluding Comments on the Economic Assessment This section has shown that there is a clear positive effect of closing the GPG on economic growth: a reduction of the gender wage gap of one percentage point might lead to an increase in economic growth of 0.14 of a percentage point, compared to a scenario in which the GPG remains stable, which in turn would increase total output as well as per capita output across the European Union. As shown in Table 15 above, this 0.14 increase in economic growth could potentially increase per capita GDP, depending on how far the GPG is narrowed. As for example shown by the example of Austria, a reduction of 10 percentage points in the GPG would increase per capita GDP by US$ 578.09. A further reduction of 10 percentage points on a current GPG of around 23 %, would result in a total GDP p.c. increase of US$ 1,156.18. As this table shows, a reduction beyond the above suggested 2-3 % impact resulting from the implementation of policy options such as sanctions or increased transparency in wage formation, a substantial reduction of the GPG will have a clear positive impact on economic output in the EU.

Conclusions This Study has used the Bauer Report as a basis to consider the question as to the current scale, nature and dynamics of the GPG across the EU and to assess the consequential economic impact. Focussing on five of the nine recommendations set out in the Bauer Report, the Study has gone on to consider the potential impact of a EU wide legislative package of measures on the GPG. The above sections provide a snapshot of the potential impacts associated with the recommendations in the Bauer Report. Given the nature and scope of this Study, the research is largely limited to a subset of measures presented in the report and covers only a selection of impacts. In addition, the secondary data used in the Study has its limitations, in particular due to the lack of \u201ccounterfactual\u201d cases, which could help isolate the magnitude of the impact generated. The Study helps to inform the current discussion concerning the potential added value of the measures in the Bauer Report. The research design and the causal relationships identified can be used to develop a more detailed methodology and a larger research programme including primary research to support secondary data collection. Potential aspects of the recommendations in the Draft Report which could not be analysed as part of this Study, but which could add valuable insights include: \uf0b7 Distribution of impacts across Member States, industry sectors, and employer groups; \uf0b7 Interaction between national and EU framework; \uf0b7 Detailed modelling of impact with expected company compliance levels; \uf0b7 Comprehensive costing of the individual recommendations, including costs to public authorities; and \uf0b7 Isolation of impact and comparison against counterfactual. Given the limited insight into the impacts of measures proposed in the Bauer Report in existing literature, such analysis is likely to enhance the state of knowledge in the field and to support EU policy-making in the area. This report constitutes the first step in this process. The Study has also been able to identify a number of research areas that would warrant further attention. Whilst it is apparent that there is a significant amount of research being undertaken on initiatives that are seeking to reduce the GPG there is still insufficient quantification of impact. Understanding the links between the GPG and economic growth is also an area which warrants further attention. This not withstanding the Study has confirmed that the GPG is an issue that warrants attention at a European level. The five of the nine recommendations within the Bauer PE 504.469 EAVA 4/2013 II-61 ",
        "Research paper on economic aspects Report that were considered for this Study each have the potential to positively impact on reducing the GPG. The impact each one percent reduction in the GPG has on economic growth is a further motivation to focus collective efforts. Given that the Study also found significant variations across Member States in terms of the manner and extent to which they are addressing the issue of the GPG it would see evident that European legislation can continue to help focus efforts on initiatives which may have the greatest impact on reducing the GPG and to do so in a manner which will bring a degree of uniformity across the EU. Recognising that there are a number of ways to measure the GPG, the European Parliament could consider the role it can play in improving the consistency and reporting of data so as to have an improved sense of where progress is being made as where it is not being made as well as the drivers for change. In this way European Institutions can focus on providing European added value by providing a legislative base, improved monitoring and reporting and clear policy goals and in doing so support Member States to make significant improvements in reducing the GPG and in doing so facilitate economic growth.

Improved situational analysis and transparency of results (recom.2) \u25a0 The National Action Plan \u2013 \u2018Gender Equality in the Labour Market\u2019, by Minister of Women and Civil Service (2008\u20132013) aimed to reduce gender differences in employment. There was social partner agreement in May 2010 on 16 measures including an online pay calculator; guidelines for works councils and HR professionals for the analysis of pay gaps and job evaluation; and pay transparency in job announcements and income transparency reports. \u25a0 From 2010 onwards, employers have been legally required to produce income reports according to company size 12 . These reports must contain the number of men and women employed including the collective agreement category attached to it, the company assignment category, the average median income and adjusted working time for men and women (BKA, 2010:.67). Income transparency reports are anonymous and conducted every two years. They show average/median pay by occupational category by gender and are available to the works council/employees (EF, 2012b). \u25a0 In October 2011, the unions in the metal, mining, gas and heating sectors, GPA-djp und PRO-GE, concluded a major new collective agreement for about 165,000 workers. This included a minimum guaranteed increase of EUR 80 a month for the lowest paid and an extension of parental leave time from 10 months to 16 months \u2013seen as important to narrow the GPG as female workers get fewer promotions because of time away from employment, through maternity or parental leave (ITUC, 2012). The GPA-DJP stated in 2011 that special negotiations could occur three times over a 10-year period, where employers and trade unions discuss sectoral pay figures and develop measures to reduce pay inequality between men and women (ITUC, 2012). \u25a0 The Minister of Women and Civil Service established an online Salary Calculator to compare average salaries for women and men 13 (EC, 2011). This calculator was set up to provide easily accessible and current information on pay schemes in particular occupations/sectors (BAK, 2010). \u25a0 Employers who do not fulfil the requirement to produce the required data can be publically named on the website of the Federal Ministry for Women\u2019s Affairs. However, \u201cthis sanction is reportedly not very deterrent\u201d (Foubert et al, 2010) Policies relating to Bauer report 2. Work evaluation and job classification (recom. 3) \u25a0 Job classification systems (plant level and in sector collective agreements) must take into account the principle of equal pay for equal and equivalent work (Foubert et al, 2010). \u25a0 The high GPG is attributed to gender specific labour market y segregation. Research has been undertaken; put on agenda b 10 Data on GPG in EU Member States sourced from Eurostat (unadjusted GPG, 2011, unless stated) 11 Data on public and private GPG sourced from Eurostat (unadjusted GPB by economic control, 5, 2011, unless stated) 12 Companies with more than 1000 employees from 2011 for the year 2010, more than 500 from 2012 for 2011, more than 250 from 2013 for 2012, more than 150 from 2014 for 2013). 13 Link to tool: http://www.gehaltsrechner.gv.at/ PE 504.469 EAVA 4/2013 II-68 ",
        "European Added Value of applying the principle of equal pay Trade Unions and as a result a guideline for the application of non-discriminatory analytical work evaluation was developed in 2004 (EC, 2006). \u25a0 Nationwide collective agreement signed in social and health services (where the vast majority of employees are women) in 2003 covering 35,000 employees in the private sector. This agreement established a pay scheme for nine different pay levels according to skills and experience and replaced more than 200 different pay schemes in individual company regulations (EC, 2006). \u25a0 A manual on the analysis of income differences and job evaluation was prepared for works councils, HR specialists and employees in 2011 by the Austrian Minister of Women and Civil Service involving the social partners as cooperation partners. 3. Equality bodies and legal remedies (recom.4) \u25a0 All public sector authorities at federal level are obliged to take action to eliminate gender inequality (EIRO, 2004). Labour Constitution Act obliges employers to consult with work councils on positive action for women at company level (Eurofound, 2002). \u25a0 If the Equal Treatment Commission suspects discriminatory practices, it can oblige the employer to submit a report of male and female comparisons regarding \u201cconditions of work\u201d. If a violation is detected, the Commission can request this report \u201cfor one for more subsequent years\u201d (Foubert et al, 2010). \u25a0 \u201cThe Equality Bodies (Ombudsperson or Equality Affairs) have always played an important role, not only by counselling and supporting individuals, but also by conducting surveys and studies, by inventing and installing instruments as well as by information supply and capacity building of all stakeholders\u201d (ibid.) 4. Sanctions (recom.8) \u25a0 Since 2011 there has been a company obligation to indicate the minimum wage and, where appropriate, the possibility of over payment in job announcements in their income report. Violating these regulations results in a first warning fine of up to EUR 360 (EC, 2012a). 5. Streamlining of EU regulations and EU policy (recom.9) \u25a0 Alongside labour market segregation, the high GPG is attributed to the high proportion of part-time work performed by women (EIRO, 2009). 14 The EC (2012) states: \u2018Steps have been taken to improve the situation of women in the labour market by extending care services as well as by introducing measures to raise awareness of the substantial GPG in Austria. However, the measures are not commensurate with the existing challenges.\u2019 (2012:26) \u25a0 From August 2007 a legal claim to premium rates of pay of an additional 25% for overtime work was introduced for part- time workers; aimed to improve the incomes of women engaged in part-time work (EF, 2010a). 14 However, as noted in the National Action Plan on the equal treatment of women and men in the labour market in Austria highlights, also when only analysing wage differentials among persons working full time year-round, there is still a GPG of 22 percent (BKA, 2010).

Improved situational analysis and transparency of results (recom.2) \u25a0 Companies are obliged to produce an annual report on gender equality, which must be presented to the works council or trade union representatives (EIRO, 2004). \u25a0 Every two years organisations with over 50 workers must conduct a comparative analysis of the wage structure of female and male employees. If this analysis shows that women earn less than men the organisation is obliged to produce an action plan (EC, 2013). \u25a0 Since 2001, a set of indicators have been used to evaluate gender pay differences in the country\u2019s annual report on the GPG. These indicators have been regularly adapted (EC, 2010). Since 2007 the Belgian government has published yearly the report \u201cThe gender wage gap in Belgium\u201d (EC, 2013) \u25a0 In the context of the Europe 2020 strategy, Belgium has identified an objective of reducing the GPG from 9 % in 2009 to 5 % in 2020 (see NRP 2011). \u25a0 In April 2012 a law was passed on reducing the GPG, stating that differences in pay and labour costs between men and women should be outlined in companies\u2019 annual audit (\u201cbilan social\u201d) (EC, 2013) Policies relating to Bauer report 2. Work evaluation and job classification (recom.3) \u25a0 Federal government has encouraged modernisation of job classifications; legislation allows government to formulate conditions that JE systems must fulfil (organisations which use job classification systems must ensure they are gender neutral) (Foubert et al, 2010). There was a national agreement in 2010 to ensure that by 2016 all job classifications are gender neutral in order to reduce the GPG (EC, 2011c; EC, 2010). \u25a0 Through inter-industry agreements the social partners are encouraged to adopt a \u201cgender neutral approach to job classification\u201d (EC, 2013) \u25a0 A guidebook on job classification is available for employers and trade unions to avoid and eliminate gender bias in pay systems (2006; EC, 2007): \u25a0 Sector joint committees have been ensuring that wage and analytical job classifications in collective agreements are free from gender bias (EF, 2010a; EF, 2008a) through the EVA ((Evaluation Analytique/analytische EVAluatie)) project (Foubert et al, 2010). This project has three key objectives: revision of training programmes, organisation of new training courses and \u201csensitisation of the social partners; analysis of the gender effect of the development and the introduction of analytical methods on wages; and the design of a universal analytical gender-neutral job classification method to analyse all job types\u201d (EC, 2006:49). \u25a0 Legislation obliges emplo ers to assess and where ",
        "European Added Value of applying the principle of equal pay \u25a0 Article 37 of the Gender Act however allows the Federal Government to take steps to guarantee that job classifications comply with the principle of gender equality (Foubert et al, 2010) 3. Equality bodies and legal remedies (recom.4) \u25a0 In 2006 Federal government implemented an annual report for companies, monitoring progress in reducing the GPG (EC, 2007; EIRO, 2004). \u25a0 The Institute for the Equality of Women and Men was established to change job classification through the EVA project, with the aim of reducing pay differences between women and men (EF, 2010a) and the Institute produced an equal pay report which brought transparency to official data (EHRC, 2010). \u25a0 The Institute for Equality between Women and Men is entitled to initiate judicial proceedings in the case of unsuccessful negotiations (Milieu, 2011). 4. Sanctions (recom.8) \u25a0 The Labour Inspectorate can apply sanctions to organisations that violate the compulsory requirements of the Collective Agreements Act (1968); however Foubert et al, state there is no known occurrence of such intervention (Foubert et al, 2010) 5.

Streamlining of EU regulations and EU policy (recom.9) \u25a0 The Government introduced a measure supporting part-time employment for up to three months by paying those moving to part-time employment 120 BGN (EUR 60) in addition to their lowered wages. The aim of this measure was to protect income levels of people moving to part-time employment caused by the recession (Smith, 2009). \u25a0 National legislation on overtime for part-time workers also exists and states the terms for overtime pay, however Foubert, 2011 states that remuneration for overtime work is very low.

Improved situational analysis and transparency of results (recom.2) \u25a0 In 2008, the Ministry of Labour and Social Insurance put forward measures aimed at reducing the GPG, including voluntary equality schemes for organisations (focused on larger organisations) and increased awareness of the inspection system (EIRO, 2009). \u25a0 Foubert et al state that Article 6(2) of Law No. 177(I)/2002 provides that trade unions will inform employees to ensure the application of equal pay through written announcements posted on boards in the workplace (Foubert et al, 2010). Foubert et al state that Article 6(A)(2) encourages employers to promote equal treatment for men and women in a systematic way in the workplace and provide employees (and their representatives, upon request) at appropriate intervals, with information on equal pay for men and women in the organisation. This information can \u201cinclude an overview of the proportions of men and women at different levels of the organisation, their pay and pay differentials and possible measures to improve the situation in cooperation with employees\u2019 representatives\u201d (ibid.) \u25a0 Awareness raising campaigns, publication of guidelines and codes of practice have also been documented; with some of these measures co-funded by ESF (EP, 2012) 2.

Streamlining of EU regulations and EU policy (recom.9) \u25a0 Article 6(1) of Law No. 76(I)/2002 provides that a part-time employee shall not be treated less favourably than a comparable full-time employee unless different treatment is justified on objective grounds.

Work evaluation and job classification (recom.3) \u25a0 Job evaluation seen as means to achieve gender equity in the Netherlands. In 2001 the social partners developed a check list to prevent unequal pay for use when implementing and evaluating pay systems (EF, 2002; EF, 2010a). The Equal Pay Checklist, (\u2018Je verdiende loon\u2019; \u2018The wage you deserve\u2019) prepared by the national representatives of the social partners (Stichting van de Arbeid, STAR) with the support of the Ministry of Social Affairs can be applied by employers, works councils, union representatives and individual employees (Foubert et al, 2010: 188). \u25a0 The Dutch Equal Treatment Commission conducted a job evaluation for 18 hospitals involving over 600 employees (EHRC, 2010). \u25a0 Foubert et al (2010) state that \u201c\u00a72 (Articles 7-12) of the ETA gives special rules on the definition of pay, on how to compare jobs, on job evaluation, on other elements of pay (not just pecuniary) and on how to compare jobs/pay in case of part-time work \u201c(Foubert et al, 2010:186). \u25a0 Foubert et al (2010) also reported that a guide on sex-neutral job evaluation which provides guidance on how to evaluate whether a job evaluation system is free from gender bias was sent to the 12 owners of the most frequently used job evaluation systems in the Netherlands. (ibid.: 188) 3. Equality bodies and legal remedies (recom.4) \u25a0 In December 2008, the Labour Inspectorate ( Arbeidsinspectie ) was given responsibility for enforcing the obligation on employers to scrutinise pay inequalities in their organisation (EF, 2010a). \u25a0 The National Working Group on Equal Pay brings together organisations relevant to equal pay \u2013 employees and employers\u2019 organisations, the Equal Treatment Commission, the Dutch Human Resources Policy Association and the Dutch Association for Employee Participation and has responsibility for awareness raising and promoting the implementation of equal pay (EC, 2006; EC, 2007; EF, 2010a). \u25a0 The Government stated [in 2008 ] that it had instructed the Labour Inspectorate to investigate claims of probable unequal pay given by the Trade Unions, the ETC or NGOs and to request employers to investigate and to report on these. The Labour Inspectorate can force the employer to do more analysis and discuss results with the Workers Council (Ondernemingsraad). \u201cThe Labour Inspectorate, at this point, has no mandate to sanction the employer.\u201d (Foubert et al, 2010: 186) 4.
