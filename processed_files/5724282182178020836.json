        "FOREWORD There is a need to evaluate land resources to assess the potential for degradation to manage the resilience characteristics of the systems and select technological options in the framework of the resilience properties. A comprehensive new agenda is needed to protect the sustainability of the ecosystem and prevention of land degradation. In the preparation of the new agenda, all sectors including stakeholder and non-governmental organizations support systems should work together. Great pragmatism is required from national decision makers to subscribe to a new land ethic, to safeguard ecological sustainability and biological diversity together with the economic productivity potentials of the nations. This should be followed by the establishment of a sustainable land management institution, to carry out the above mentioned tasks. The new agenda should include a science based approach, to understand land quality and its changes by management alternatives. Assessment, monitoring, and the use of reliable cost-effective indicators are now becoming available. Thus, the appropriate technologies provide some answers for food security, environmental balance, and land degradation. These issues are strongly linked with one another and each must be addressed separately by their impacts. The mitigation technologies comprise; indicators for early warning of land degradation and determination of land quality, such as the removal of nutrients from soils, with acidification, salinisation, deterioration of soil structure and loss of organic matter under stressed environments. In the past, the attention was focused on the rehabilitation of degraded land. Agenda 21 (Ch. 12 - UNCED, 1992) emphasizes desertification with activities setup for preventive actions. As mentioned above, other aspects of land degradation received little attention in Agenda 21, which are considered briefly in Chapter 10 as \"Integrated Approach to the Planning and Management of Land Resources\". It is believed, although land degradation is more important than environmental protection, because it includes the environment together with many other aspects that are considered with the concept of environmental protection, it has not received the global attention in Agenda 21 that it deserves in spite of the mention on \"to strengthen regional and global systematic observation networks linked to the development of national systems for the observation of land degradation and desertification caused both by climate fluctuations and by human impact, and to identify priority areas for action\". We have yet to mobilize the multiconceptual scientific community to develop a proactive program for land degradation. The challenges we face today are to: 1. Mobilise the scientific community to mount an integrated program for methods, standards, data collection and research networks for assessment and monitoring of soil an land degradation, 2. Develop land use models that incorporate both natural and human-induced factors that contribute to land degradation and that could be used for land use planning and management, 3. Develop information systems that link environmental monitoring, accounting and impact assessment to land degradation, 4. Help develop policies that encourage sustainable land use and management and assist in the greater use of land resource information for sustainable agriculture, 5. Develop economic instruments in the assessment of land degradation to encourage the suitable use of land resources, 6. Establish an international institute to cope with the land degradation problem at a global level with sample areas for assessment, monitoring and development of mitigation technologies ",
        "A Task Force -now the International Working Group on Land Degradation and Desertification, a formal body of the IUSS, member of the ICSU- was formed to catalyze efforts to enhance the understanding and better utilization of world land resources together with the development of guidelines to address problems of land degradation and desertification. The Working Group is undertaking the opportunity to proceed with the publication of the biannual newsletter on land degradation and desertification together with the Institute of Environment and Sustainability (IES) of the Joint Research Centre in Ispra, Italy, seeking to amalgamate the present efforts undertaken throughout the world on combating Land Degradation and Desertification, and luckily reach the ultimate goal mentioned above -the establishment of an international initiative on Land Degradation and Desertification.

        "LETTER FROM THE EDITOR Land resources and conflicts In February, there was a seminar by the staff of the International Peace Institute of Oslo at the Woodrow Wilson Center, Washington DC. The title, \"To Cultivate Peace: Agriculture in a World of Conflict\", attracted me as I share the belief of others that when land resources are stressed people will fight. The basic thesis of the speakers was that the post-Cold War World follows a different pattern involving a vicious cycle of poverty, deprivation, and poor governance. This is the 'zone of turmoil' and characterizes the developing world while the 'zone of peace' is a virtuous cycle of prosperity, democracy, and peace. They analyzed 103-armed conflicts during the period 1989-1997 and found that 42 exceeded the level of 1,000 deaths per year (which qualifies the conflict to be called a war). Their study also indicated that these conflicts do not follow the model of the Cold War era when ideological considerations and superpower rivalry sparked most of the hostilities. Most of the conflicts are concentrated in countries heavily dependent on agriculture. The foreknowledge of imminent hardship, especially severe food shortfalls, provokes violence when one group seizes the limited supplies of others. This may take place along ethnic, religion, or language lines. It has been shown that economic growth and development is aided by good productivity in agriculture. Countries with modern agricultural technology create conditions to peace and prosperity and thereby lower the incidence of violent conflict. Some of the issues that directly or indirectly relate to land resources include: Land ownership is a major issue. Conflicts in Senegal and Mauritania, the Chiapas rebellion in Mexico, and the Naxalite rebellion in India are examples. The settlement of tribal lands as in Bangladesh, India, Philippines, and Sri Lanka, has fueled rebellion. Environmental change: Here the issue is desertification as is evident in the Sahel region of Africa where it has disrupted the traditional livelihoods and caused conflict in Mali, Niger, and Chad. Water scarcity is an issue that we will be hearing more about. Disputes in the Middle East in Israel, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan are largely linked to water supply. In South India, decreasing water supply in the Cauvary River is creating problems between the southern states. Declining land productivity as a consequence of land degradation results in high food prices and trigger riots as in Indonesia and Lesotho. And you thought that land degradation and desertification was unimportant. !!!!!!! The previous are real life examples. Perhaps there may not be a direct link between land degradation and desertification but there is strong probability that land degradation is a precursor to many of the social ailments. This is an area that we must keep track of, as it is a powerful incentive for politicians to address desertification. ",
        "2 nd Land degradation Conference After two years of preparation, the Conference was held in Thailand during the last week of Thailand. We were surprised at the response with more than 300 participants. We were also fortunate to receive the financial support of many international donors. Our Thai colleagues did a wonderful job, as usual, of organizing it. A detailed report is presented later but here are some observations: Terminology is still a real problem. An example is the word 'resilience', which was used with totally opposite meanings. Somehow, we need standardization. Methodology still remains a ubiquitous headache. As methods differ, and there are no accepted quality control procedures, data becomes difficult to use. Our efforts to develop national and global databases will be constrained if we do not come to acceptable methods. The almost total lack of monitoring of land resource conditions in most countries of the world is unacceptable. The adhoc assessments of land conditions become a meaningless exercise if the information is not placed in a temporal context. There is an urgent need to define and adopt a set of indicators of land degradation. As is the situation now, persons refer to degradation but do not know the rate, extent, or even the kind. Worse still, economists use this information and relate it to productivity changes and conclude that degradation is not an issue with respect to food supply decline. In this issue we have an interesting paper from Dr. Thomas Enters (Malaysia) who has worked on land degradation and soil conservation for several years. We have included some abstracts of papers submitted at the 2 nd International Conference on Land Degradation and Desertification. The Working Group is also initiating a email Forum. Finally, a word or two on what you, as an individual, can do to help this cause: Contribute to the Newsletter Play an active role in your countries for protecting the soil resource base; Try to get your colleagues to generate reliable data on soil degradation; Get your soil survey organisation to start monitoring soil quality; Get your politicians involved. RECOMMENDATIONS of the 2 ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON LAND DEGRADATION The degradation of the land resource base is rapidly emerging as an agricultural and environmental concern of major proportions. Its importance transcends the deterioration of the land per se, particularly as it impacts several critical issues of our time: food security, diminishing quality and quantity of water resources, loss of biodiversity, and global climate change. The decline in the land resource base, in important areas of developing countries, will ",
        "significantly increase the challenge to feed a growing population from a diminishing land area of declining quality, resulting in food insecurity, reduced agricultural income, and slower economic growth. The use of fragile ecosystems by resource poor farmers, the continuing conversion of forests to agriculture, the systematic loss of water storage capacity of soils and in reservoirs through siltation, the systematic loss of biodiversity require monitoring and attention. Further, problems associated with the increasing urbanization including the conversion of quality agricultural lands are issues to be dealt with in the debate on sustainable land management. It is imperative, therefore, that concerted action at the local, national and global level is taken in partnership with farmers and land users to maintain and enhance land quality. Investments in land quality are an essential component to meet a wide range of environmental, economic and welfare goals as we move into the 21 st Century. Recommendations In this context, the participants of the 2 nd International Conference on Land Degradation deliberating on the theme of \"Meeting the Challenges of Land Degradation in the 21 st Century\" recommend that: 1. The Working Group on Land Degradation and Desertification of the International Union of Soil Sciences (IUSS) should pursue the following actions: Initiate and coordinate the development of a database of research activities (evaluation, remedial action, rehabilitation) on land degradation and desertification, including a state-of-the- art bibliography on the subject; Interact with other appropriate Sub-Commissions and Working Groups of the IUSS; Develop a set of guidelines for survey, assessment and monitoring of land degradation, including early warning indicators of pressure, state, and response that can be used for local, national and global reporting on the state of the land resources; Establish a dedicated web-site on internet to serve as a clearing house on information on land degradation and mitigation technologies related activities to service the scientific community; Continue to publish the Newsletter on Land Degradation and Desertification; Provide the international inputs in the organization of the 3 rd Conference on Land Degradation and Desertification to be held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 2001. 2. The Convention to Combat Desertification (CCD) should: Expand the geographic area of its activities to include all global land resources; Involve a wider range of land resource scientists and land users in its deliberations; and Support financially and otherwise the Working Group on Land Degradation and Desertification of the IUSS. 3. In order to assist countries in developing pertinent policies and legal instruments to combat land degradation, should lend support to the \"Tutzing Group\" in their efforts to develop a \"Soil Convention\" designed to Provide fundamental principles to guide nations on sustainable land management, ",
        "Facilitate international linkages between environmental and other related treaties and conventions, Initiate a common basis for future legislation and policy making efforts, Coordinate a legal and policy framework for addressing land resource issues, Consolidate the variety of 'soft laws' associated with soil and water conservation, and Identify and promote other policy instruments to support farmers and other land users in their efforts to improve land. 4. International institutions such as the Food and Agriculture Organization, United Nations Environment Program, and the Global Environmental Facility of the World Bank, the International Agricultural Research Centers such as International Rice Research Institute, and International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics, others such as the International Board for Soil Research and Management and the International Soil Research and Information Center, the regional institutes such as the Asian Institute of Technology, and appropriate Non-Governmental Organizations: Incorporate land degradation and desertification as an integral part of their research and developmental efforts in sustainable agriculture, Develop a program, which integrates land quality improvement with productivity enhancement technologies, in the context of the needs and aspirations of the affected populations and the qualities of the resource base, and Recognize that declining land productivity is real in developing countries and as they play an important role in agricultural supplies, economic development and the welfare of the poor, it must be emphasized more to alleviate food insecurity ",
        "9 LEAD PAPER THE ECONOMICS OF FOREST CONVERSION IN NORTHERN THAILAND: CHALLENGING ASSUMPTIONS 2 Thomas Enters, Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR), Bogor, Indonesia INTRODUCTION This paper provides insights into the valuation of natural resources for assessing land use options. It focuses on tropical forests because it is widely believed that failure to fully account for the economic costs of deforestation is a major factor behind inappropriate policies which lead to tropical forest loss 3 . In response, valuation methodologies have been developed or conventional cost-benefit analyses extended to quantify the forest ecosystem values. While the number of valuation studies has mushroomed, the debate on the need to value the goods and services of forests has simultaneously intensified. Concerned economists have begun to \"rethink the economic analysis of forests\" (Tacconi, 1995) and posed the question on whether there are environmental limits to cost-benefit analysis (Hanley, 1992). Using Northern Thailand and sedimentation as examples, the following discussion pursues these issues and attempts to answer Diamond and Hausman's (1994) question on whether some number is better than no number. Reproduced from: Enters, T., 1999. The Economics of Forest Conversion in Northern Thailand: Challenging assumptions. In: The Living Forest: Non-Market Benefits of Forestry, eds.

",
        "IO RETHINKING VALUATION AS A DECISION MAKING AID A review of the \"valuation\" literature indicates the rift in thinking between those in pursuit of refining valuation methodologies and the critics of a system that views the monetarization of the environment as an imperative for efficient resource allocation. Sagoff (1988) voices philosophical objections of using monetary values to represent environmental attributes. S\u00f6derbaum (1994a, p. 200) finds the commodification of the environment \"rather strange\" and questions the ability to trade impacts against one another in monetary terms (S\u00f6derbaum, 1996). There are cultural barriers to monetary valuation (Peterson and Driver, 1995), and the various stakeholders view the value of forest benefits differently (Panayotou and Ashton, 1992). While its objectivity (Tacconi, 1995) and value-neutrality (S\u00f6derbaum, 1994b) are questioned \"economists insist that if society wishes to make 'efficient' environmental choices, there is no substitute for hypothetical valuation studies\" (Vatn and Bromley, 1994, p. 131). A mirror image to the critics' concerns is presented by advocates, who consider valuation as a necessary condition for rational policy making (Adger ef al., 1995) and for whom \"proper forest valuation is essential to the appraisal of forestry projects and of other projects that affect forests\" (Kramer ef al., 1992, p. 238). Gregersen et al. (1995) emphasize that valuation is quite distinct from actual decision-making and that \"doing it right can provide much useful information for decision making\" (p. 40). Particularly cost-benefit analysis is not a means to an end but rather a coherent method for organizing and presenting information (Angelsen and Sumaila, 1995). Extending cost-benefit analysis for environmental assessments is described as a success story (Hundloe, 1995; Cocklin, 1995) because the use of monetary values allows for direct comparison among options (Kramer ef al., 1992). Doing it wrong can be worse for decision making than not doing it at all (Gregersen ef a/., 1995). A key problem for critics and advocates alike is the lack of knowledge about the true nature of economy-environment interactions. The interactions are so complex that \"obviously, much empirical work is needed in this area\" (Lutz and Munasinghe, 1994, p. 39). It does not appear to be that obvious because only very few researchers are investigating the sort of information requirements for economic analysis. One reason for this is that the main purpose of valuing the environment is not \"to provide fine-tuned numbers, but to indicate orders of magnitude\" (Lutz and Munasinghe, 1994, p. 44). How misleading it is to talk nonchalantly about \"orders of magnitudes\" and whether some number is better than no number is discussed below. FOREST CONVERSION AND RESOURCE CONSERVATION IN THAILAND In Thailand, rapid economic development and expansion of agriculture have meant that the total forest area today stands at perhaps as little as 15 percent, down from 61 percent in 1953. Deforestation (Flaherty ef al., 1993) and soil erosion (McKinnon, 1989) are believed to be two ",
        "11 of the country's most pressing problems 4 . In recent years, a great deal of controversy exists in scientific circles and political debates on the relationship between forests, soil erosion and sedimentation control (Tangtham, 1994). Soil erosion has both onsite and offsite effects. The immediate onsite effect is declining soil productivity. Common offsite effects are sedimentation, eutrophication and enhanced productivity of downstream land. The following discussion restricts itself to the impact of forest conversion on downstream sedimentation. The presence of forests, or more accurately, sufficient ground cover limits soil erosion and thus sedimentation (Hamilton, 1986; Cassells ef al., 1986). Numerous publications deal with the offsite costs of accelerated erosion (Veloz et al. 1985; Briones, 1986; Cruz et al., 1988; Southgate and Macke, 1989). In summary, they conclude that upstream human activities lead to enormous downstream costs, justifying immediate remedial measures, i.e. investments in forest and soil conservation. Attaviroj (1986) and Hundloe (1994) have both applied economic techniques for comparing the costs and benefits of forest conversion with soil conservation. Attaviroj showed that due to forest encroachment, diminished irrigation, diminished hydropower and maintenance of the drainage system, the present costs of exploitive monocropping (calculated for a 15 year period and a 10 percent discount rate) were in the order of US $849.21 million. The implementation of a land development project was estimated to reduce the overall costs to US $34.26 million. To capture the indirect use value of regulatory functions of the forests of Northern Thailand he estimated production increases and costs avoided by effective forest conservation and the adoption of soil conserving farming practices. FROM FINE-TUNED NUMBERS TO ORDERS OF MAGNITUDES The description of the world as a complicated place (Proops, 1989) highlights the problem of identifying and quantifying the costs and benefits of forest conversion, and conservation as its mitigative measure. In extending cost-benefit analysis to its limits, interestingly economists rarely feel constrained by this complexity. For example, Ruitenbeek's study of the Korup Forest Conservation Project in Cameroon has been described as pioneering (Richards, 1994), and valiant and pathbreaking (Aylward and Barbier, 1992). The same can be said of Attaviroj's study. Aylward and Barbier however also criticized the obscurity of ecological assumptions used by Ruitenbeek, which Richards (1994, p. 313) called \"arbitrary and questionable\". \"Never mind, we are only interested in orders of magnitude\", appears to be the acceptable response. Well I do mind, because plausible adjustments of commonly accepted assumptions have quite unexpected and significant effects on the results of the analysis. 4 \"Discussing deforestation and shifting cultivation in 'hforthern Thailand as well as Laos and vietnam, lAorrison (1995) uses quotation maris for the term 'problem' to indicate that current assessments andreactions to the 'problem' are beset with policy presumptions. ",
        "12 Enters (1992) discussed seven critical aspects of evaluating the effects of upland changes on sediment loads, four of which are discussed below. The first is perhaps of greatest importance. It addresses the following question by Proops (1989, p. 71): \"Are things getting worse?\" In other words, do the rivers in Northern Thailand carry heavier sediment loads? The other three questions address the potential sediment sources, the spatial displacement of soil and the time dimension of increased sediment rates. In summary, Attaviroj (1986) assumed that all the sediments originated from shifting cultivation, that all the soil would find its way to the basin outlets, and that mitigative efforts would be immediately effective. Sediment sources Quantitative analysis of contributions of various sediment sources to total sediment loads for large catchments are rare. Kraayenhagen (1981) concluded for a small catchment that more than eighty percent originated from riverine and road erosion. According to Chunkao (1986), 31 percent of all sediment yields are caused by mining activities. Henderson and Witthawatchutikul (cited in O'Loughlin, 1985) showed how road construction significantly increased sediment loads. Field studies in Northern Thailand point particularly at unpaved roads as primary sediment sources in recently deforested catchments (Ziegler and Giambelluca, 1995). It is difficult to determine the exact contributions of various sediment sources but it seems plausible to assume that no more than fifty percent of the loads originate from farmers' fields, i.e. exploitive monocropping. How this affects the social benefits of the land development project is shown in Table 1 (see scenario 1). Spatial displacement and sediment delivery Only a fraction of the sediment eroded within a drainage basin finds its way directly to the basin outlet and thus is represented in the sediment yield. Temporary or permanent storage of soil particles may occur at various locations downslope from where they were originally detached. The relative magnitude of this loss tends to increase with basin size (Walling, 1983). But even in small basins, up to 90 percent of eroded material can be trapped (Cooper ef al. 1987, cited it Walling, 1988). Scenario 2 in Table 1 assumes that only fifty percent of the eroded material turn into an externality 5 . Benefits decrease even further. Timing of sedimentation and deposition The time dimension is of particular importance when assessing at what point downstream benefits from upland watershed management activities are likely to become relevant. As Hamilton (1987) notes, only very small changes may be expected in the amount of sediment carried by major rivers for centuries. Trimble (1981) reports that even after fifty years of 5 Tor the purpose of this discussion 1 assume that externalities are identical with social costs. \"Enters (1992) documents that even this assumption is incorrect in \"Northern Thailand. ",
        "13 effective soil conservation, sediment yields in a 360 square kilometre drainage basin in Wsconsin changed only marginally. The reason for this phenomenon is the enormous amount of stored sediment in the system which forms a long-term supply. Referring to the Pantabangan reservoir in the Philippines, Dixon ef al. (1989, p. 195) note that \"even if all on-farm erosion ended tomorrow, sedimentation of the reservoir would continue for many years\". A plausible assumption would be that for the first ten years conservation activities in the uplands will not significantly affect downstream sedimentation rates. Scenario 3 in Table 1 reveals that the social benefits of the land development project are negligible. For the first time, one may ask whether it is, from a social point of view, worthwhile to implement the project. Table 1: Present value of social costs and benefits (Million US$) Diminished irrigation Diminished hydropower Social costs due to exploitive monocropping 8.41 5.46 Social benefits of land development project 6.56 4.26 Land development Project Scenario 1 3.28 2.13 Land development project Scenario 2 1.64 1.07 Land development project Scenario 3 0.15 0.12 The lag time not only complicates the valuation of ecological service functions, but also indicates that some effects of forest conversion may not have become apparent yet (Blaikie and Brookfield, 1987). This may be one reason why sediment loads in the Ping River do not, as yet, show an increasing trend. They may be more noticeable in the future when the downstream benefits of conservation projects are expected to produce lower sediment yields. An economist would, in these rather paradoxical circumstances, have to quantify a theoretical decrease while available data indicate the opposite (Enters, 1995). The problems of sediment source identification, temporary storage and time lags are compounded by other factors (Enters, 1992). More important, however, is to demonstrate if sedimentation rates have changed over time due to forest conversion. FROM CHANGE TO NO CHANGE In most tropical countries, long term measurements of sediment rates are very difficult to obtain. For most rivers in Northern Thailand they do not exist. The longest time series exist for the Ping River. An analysis of the 1958-86 period indicates an increase in sedimentation up to about 1975. Since then, however, sedimentation rates have decreased even though deforestation has continued apace (Enters, 1995). There is a close correlation between discharge and sediment load. This relationship implies a sediment source within the stream channel (Leopold ef al., 1964, cited in Alford, 1992), rather than sheet erosion contributing sediment to the Ping River. A recent CIFOR project addressed the aspect of qualitative changes for the Mae Taeng River, a tributary to the Ping River. A multiple regression analysis was adopted for examining changes in sediment loads. The measured sediment load was treated as the dependent variable, and its ",
        "14 variation explained on the basis of several independent variables (trend for each month, rainfall and temperature, and runoff). A detailed explanation of the independent variables used and the regression results is outside the scope of this paper. For now, it is sufficient to note that the equation had a regression coefficient of 0.68, indicating a reasonable degree of explanatory power. A plot of the residuals against lagged values of runoff indicated a possible problem of heteroskedasticity. After correcting for heteroskedasticity, the explanatory power of the regression rose slightly to 0.70. However, none of the trend variables were statistically significant. The most important explanatory variables were the rainfall variables for May, June, July, September, October and November, the temperature variable for September, and the lagged runoff. It appeared reasonable to conclude that the data did not support claims that sediment rates significantly increased, at least over the period being analyzed (1972-1991). However, if White's correction for heteroskedasticity is used instead of the Goldfeld-Quandt correction, then the coefficients for several of the trend variables become statistically significant. Specifically, the trend variables for the (wet) months of May, July and November are statistically significant, as well as for the (dry) months of December, February, March and April. On the basis of this analysis, the conclusion would be quite different from the previous one - that there has been an increasing trend of sedimentation. What is the \"correct\" conclusion? Since the results depend upon the type of heteroskedasticity correction used, the question is which of the two approaches is more appropriate? The Goldfeld-Quandt test is more specific and statistically powerful, and would therefore be the preferred. On the other hand, the White test is more general one with some merits but also some limitations (Greene, 1993). To conclude, there is no clear cut and objective criterion which enables us to choose one over the other. It is clearly up to the discretion of data analysts, and the choice may well be guided by their preconceptions or misconceptions (compare with Enters, 1994). Hence, even in a situation where long time series of high quality data and a reasonable model of sedimentation exist, Proops' central question cannot be answered unambiguously. CONCLUSIONS According to Edwards (1991; p. 16) cost-benefit analysis is \"best viewed as a framework for investigating systematically the pluses and minuses of projects\". Viewed in this rather restricted sense it is useful and can be credited for highlighting the multiple forest goods and services besides timber. However, while lip service is often paid to the uncertainties and complexities that applied valuation is hampered by, in reality valuation exercises frequently turn into fine cost-accounting. Close correlation between forest conversion and its downstream effects is assumed. In fact, the environment-economy interactions are far less straightforward and compounded by the analysts' discretion to tilt a trend one way or the other. ",
        "15 For argument's sake let's assume that things have become worse, that sedimentation rates in the rivers of Northern Thailand have increased. Can we confidently to forecast that sedimentation rates will decrease in the future due to conservation activities? Can we quantify our assumptions for the future, let alone put a value on it? It appears, as countless economic analyses indicate, that we can. However, plausible adjustments to the underlying assumptions indicate that it is not just a matter of getting it approximately right. The cumulative effect of such adjustments results instead in getting it exactly wrong. It is obvious that we have reached the environmental limits to cost-benefit analysis, and this before embarking on more contentious philosophical issues, or the question on how to assign ex ante values to properties and products that have not yet been identified (Gregersen ef al., 1995). Is one number better than no number? Not only is it not better but rather harmful because it draws attention away from the real issues. It underestimates the importance of political- economic factors by pretending that watershed development and resource conservation are simply technological and economic challenges. Randall (1987, p. 42, cited in Tacconi, 1995) observed that cost-benefits analysis \"permits collective action that imposes harm on individuals\". For the visiting economists, experiencing little contact with the people most affected by their analyses, it may be difficult to comprehend the meaning of such observation. Under the cloud of value neutrality and objectivity, they only translate available information into monetary terms and evaluation criteria. In Northern Thailand, the farmers in the upland areas have been very much affected by \"objectively calculated numbers\". Outside pressures on their farming practices have increased, and their daily lives are more affected by the environmental limits to cost-benefit analysis as most economists would dare to believe. The policy and management consequences of what appear to be inappropriate preference assumptions are likely to be substantial, yet conventional economic prctices continue to exhibit a curious immunity to the evidence and persist with no reckoning of the contrary behaviourial findings (Knetsch, 1993, p. 251). Economic analyses can provide some useful insights and guidance in the design and implementation of development and environmental policies. However, the use of empirically incorrect assumptions can severly compromise these contributions and lead to inefficient, inequitable, and ineffective policies (Knetsch, 1993, p. 257).

The two authors of this article were not only impressed by the spectacular setting and architecture but also the erosion control technology that was already implemented. Some 60% of the ancient construction effort went into the site preparation, foundations, underground drainage, and terracing so as to resist the ever-present and subtle forces of gravity that otherwise would have caused it to settle and perhaps even slide down the mountainside. The authors report that the secret to the timeless stability of the agricultrural terraces lies in erosion control planning, infiltration of rainfall, and good subsurface drainage and surface flow routes. The INCA planner's message was for us to serve as good stewards of the soil and land. The INCA Empire left a legacy of erosion control and good stewardship of the soil, land, and water. It's not too late to learn from them (Please consult the original articles for the details.)

        "26 NATIONAL AND REGIONAL REPORTS ASSESSMENT OF LAND DEGRADATION IN THE PHILIPPINES: A CASE STUDY IN ISABELA PROVINCE Perfecto P. Evangelista, Cleotilde M. Nicolas, Toshiaki Ohkura Bureau of Soils and Water Management, Department of Agriculture Quezon City 1100, The Philippines. In the Philippines where 60% of the country is classified into agricultural land, the soil degradation provoke a fatal situation to agricultural production by which it deals with the food demand, which increases along with the population growth. Agricultural techniques need to be introduced to enable sustainable production for the attainment of food self-sufficiency. An excessive inputting of agricultural chemicals, soil amendment materials, and fertilizers would provoke environmental disruptions and waste natural resources. The effect could exist up to the 22 nd century or more. Soil productivity classification system (SPCC) was developed which can be used to compliment the existing soil classification system to evaluate soil degradation and develop appropriate soil management guidelines. The system uses the soil resources accounting based on natural fertility by numeric conversion. It is thought that it could materialize a precise soil management, and thus sustain improvement of agricultural land and proper introduction of technologies for increasing productivity. Isabela Province in Cagayan Valley, Region II, was selected as study area for valuing soils for lowland rice and upland crop productions. The prototype of the SPCC system was applied to obtain a suitability map, which was generated by existing soil map, topographical map, climatic zone map, land use map, etc. It provides the basic information of soil quality and forecasts the possible changes in soil quality in the future, after the introduction of the relevant soil management techniques. SEDIMENT YIELD FROM UPLAND AREAS IN RELATION TO SURFACE MICROTOPOGRAPHY M.J.M. R\u00f6mkens, K. Helming and S.N. Prasad Upland Erosion Processes Research Unit, University of Mississippi Oxford, MS 38655, USA Micro-topography is an important surface characteristic and condition of upland areas that substantially affects soil erosion processes of detachment, transport, infiltration, and runoff. Yet, little quantitative information is available about the relationship between surface micro-topography and sediment yield. In this article the results of a laboratory study are reported in which changes in surface micro-topography of four different erosion susceptible soils are related to sediment yield during a series of identical rainstorms of 0.75 h duration and 66 mm.-1 intensity. The rainstorms were applied on successive workdays. The soils chosen differ substantially in their genetic origin and consisted of the: Ap-materials of a Grenada silt loam, an Atwood silt loam and a Forestdale silty clay, and the parent material of a Ruston silt loam. Before all and after each rainstorm, the surface micro- topography was determined using a laser micro-relief meter measuring elevations at each point of a 3 ",
        "27 mm by 3 mm grid. Micro-topography is presented in a color-coded digital elevation maps (DEM). Also, the local topographic gradient for each grid cell is calculated and presented in color-coded maps. The runoff data show an initially rapid increase in the sediment concentration that reached quickly a maximum value and then gradually decreased to a near constant value at the end of the storm series. Sediment yield followed closely the sediment concentration trend due to a near-constant runoff rate. Surface micro-topography changed rapidly during the first rainstorm but then decreased more slowly during the rest of the storm sequence. The glauconitic sediment was the most stable soil with the lowest runoff rate, highest percolation/infiltration rate and lowest sediment concentration in runoff. The least stable soil was the Grenada soil, which had the highest runoff rate and sediment concentration in runoff. The Atwood and Forestdale soils appeared to be appreciably less stable than the Glauconitic sediment but more stable than the Grenada soil as determined by the measured sediment yield rate. In all four soils, three distinct phases in the sediment yield/micro-topography relationship were observed: (1) a pre-ponding phase with no sediment yield, (2) a post-ponding phase with increasing sediment yield, and (3) a post-ponding phase with decreasing sediment yield. These three phases reflect the changing surface condition of the soils during the series of rainstorms, which is related to changes in the surface roughness and degree of surface sealing. SOIL DEGRADATION UNDER DIFFERENT LAND USE SYSTEMS IN A LATERITE LANDSCAPE OF PENINSULAR INDIA G. Byju and Thomas Varghese Department of Soil Science and Agricultural Chemistry Kerala Agricultural University, Vellayani-695 522, Trivandrum, Kerala, India The global extent of soil degradation is estimated at about 1.96 \u03c7 10^ ha of which about 47 per cent is in the tropics. Anthropogenic factors related to mismanagement of soil resources are the primary factors of soil degradation. The rate of tropical deforestation is estimated at about 16m ha annually, with 3.6m ha in Asia, 4.5 m ha in Africa and 8.3 m ha in Latin America. These lands are supposedly cleared for food crops, pastures and tree crops without due consideration to assessment of land use capability. Laterisation is one of the major soil forming processes in the tropics. It can be defined as the leaching out and elimination of silica, alkali and alkaline earths under alkaline hydrolysis and the accumulation of hydrated oxides of iron and aluminium, the latter being partly combined with silica. This process is considered to be one of the major obstacles to the development of many under developed countries and as a result of it, vast areas of the earth's soil have been converted into deposits of bauxite and into haematite and limonite ores of iron. Taking into consideration all these aspects, it became imperative to assess the extent of soil degradation under different land use systems in Kerala state, India which is considered as the 'type ",
        "28 locality' of latente since the time of Buchanan (1807). The study aimed at assessing the variations in profile morphology, status of major nutrients, organic matter status, CEC and base saturation and other major chemical indicators of soil degradation due to laterisation. A detailed morphological description of the soil profiles was made. Profile morphology itself clearly shows that the organic matter status of soils under cassava and eucalyptus is comparatively lower with respect to natural forest or rubber plantation. In rubber plantation presence of cover crops also might have added organic matter to the soils. The total \u039d, \u03a1 and \u039a contents in soils under natural forest were significantly higher compared to three other land use systems. The least value of \u039d for surface horizon could be observed in soils under rubber (0.185 per cent). Organic carbon is very important indicator of soil degradation. While the surface horizon of soils under natural forest had 3.53 per cent organic carbon, it was only 2.45, 1.90 and 1.90 per cent respectively in soils under eucalyptus, cassava and rubber. The organic matter depletion due to deforestation and alternate land use could be well understood if we estimate the total amount of organic matter in 1 irr to a depth of 1 m soil. When soils under natural forest contained 25.67 kg organic matter in 1 rrr to a depth of 1 m soil, soils under rubber recorded the lowest value of 21.5 kg. Cation exchange capacity (CEC) and base saturation per cent also indicate the alarming rate of laterisation due to deforestation and alternate land uses (Table 1). The CEC of soil under natural forest is significantly higher compared to that of soils under rubber, cassava or eucalyptus plantation. Base saturation per cent also showed a decreasing trend in mono-culture plantations. These changes could well be attributed mainly to the organic matter level. Other major indicators of laterisation studied are bulk density, silt/clay ratio, Fe 2 03, AI2O3 and Fe 0 /Fe,-j ratio. All these results show that the process of laterisation proceeds faster in soils under mono-culture compared to adjacent natural forest. The present study shows that laterite is more an intra zonal formation and in the 'type locality' itself, extreme variations in morphology, physico- chemical characteristics and fertility status have been encountered depending on vegetation and land use. The inhibitory effect of forest vegetation and organic matter content of the profiles in reducing the extent of laterisation underlines the significance of conserving forested highlands of humid tropics and also maintaining a soil cover and organic matter in the surface horizons of already laterised areas. ECOLOGICAL PROBLEM AND ITS TREND DIAGNOSIS OF LAND UTILIZATION IN GUANGDONG PROVINCE Peng Zhiliang, Xu Lianfeng South China Institute of Environmental Sciences, SEPA, Guangzhou 510655, China Zhang Chao and Li SuiHuai Science and Technology Advisory Committee, Guangdong Province People's Government, Guangzhou 510033, China Since China's reform and open policy, and as a consequence of rapid economic growth and population pressure rising, Guangdong, a province with special privilege in economic policy offered by central government, sharply decreases its cultivated land. Furthermore, irrational land utilization ",
        "29 triggers series of ecological and environmental problems. Based on the vast collection of statistics information and relevant scientific material (Compile committee of agricultural statistical yearbook of Guangdong, 1997),this paper copes with the problems of land utilization, which has been under the situation of high economics growth in Guangdong. The paper provides the trend diagnosis of cultivated land, and raises the countermeasures in order to gain sustainability of land utilization. The approaches will be helpful to policy maker in dealing with rational utilization, scientific management, and policy-decision in land resources. Guangdong, a province with a land composition of about 70% of mountain, 20% of water area, and 10% of paddy field, has a total area of 17.79 km 2 . The total population is 68.968 millions with an average density of 388 persons per square kilometers. The mean possession of land per capita drops by 26.3% in comparison with that in 1983. The information analysis shows that the ecological and environmental problems due to the irrational development of land resources include: The cultivated land sharply drops to a low level, which worsens the land-population crisis, deteriorates situation of food supply and dampens sustainable development of economics and society; Increasing water and soil erosion caused by development of land resources leads to the loss of surface soil, silting of rivers, reservoir and water pollution; Destruction of vegetation cover, unreasonable composition of forest land, industrialization and urbanization severely damage the original ecosystems; Deprived agricultural utilization aiming at short-term commercial income, more-output and less-input land cultivation policy, and soil fertility decreasing worsens the land situation; Rural environmental pollution becomes more and more serious as a result of give-off of \"three wastes\"; The irrational land utilization results in contamination of chemicals and pesticides, and lowers quality of agricultural products; and Lack of planning in land utilization, to a certain extent, impacts the land efficiency and accounts for part of environment pollution. The trend diagnosis of cultivated land in Guangdong province is implemented by a predictive gray model. The estimated dynamics of land area for year 1998, 2000, 2005 and 2010 are listed in table 1.

SOCIOECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OF LAND DEGRADATION IN THE SOUTH AMERICAN GRAN CHACO Paul C. Huszar Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics, Colorado State University Ft. Collins, CO 80525, USA The vast plain known as the Gran Chaco is a natural region of about one million square kilometers extending over parts of Argentina, Bolivia, and Paraguay. The Chaco is the second largest natural biome in South America, with only the Amazon region being larger. The primitive landscape of the region was a parkland with patches of hardwoods intermingled with grasslands. This mosaic of vegetation was kept stable by periodic fires caused by lightning or by Indians. After colonization by Europeans, fire intensity and frequency decreased (particularly in the dry western Chaco) due to the withdrawal of Indians and overgrazing of domestic cattle, which eliminated fuel for fires. Consequently, the grassland patches were rapidly invaded by woody, thorn infested vegetation over all of the western Chaco. A second stage in the process of land degradation started in the 1880's, when railways expanded into the Chaco. This expansion allowed intensive forest cutting and facilitated the expansion of \"puesteros\" or small-scale cattle and goat ranchers into the region. The expansion of the \"puesteros\" into the Gran Chaco, with associated year-around grazing, resulted in a marked increase in overgrazing, which further deteriorated the productivity of the land. Overgrazing is not only associated with decreased livestock production, but also with decreased forest regeneration as young seedlings are eaten and trampled by livestock searching for food. In recent years, this process of land degradation has been accelerating. As a result, nearly all of the Argentinean western Chaco has gone through a process of short-lived prosperity followed by constant impoverishment resulting from a dramatic fall in cattle and timber productivity. The northern Chaco of Argentina, Bolivia and Paraguay are now facing this same threat. Poverty and a lack of opportunities stimulate a steady flow of young emigrants to the country's main cities., causing yet new problems of slums, unemployment and urban crime. The situation is worsened by the expansion of Chagas disease, an incurable and fatal disease closely related to African sleeping sickness. Blood-sucking insects transmit the disease and there is a clear association between the disease and poor housing that result from rural poverty. The typical mud brick huts of poor puesteros, with their associated goat corral, provide an ideal habitat for one species of these blood-sucking insects (Triatoma infestans) which carries Chagas disease. This insect is virtually never found in other habitats. Recently, range and forest scientists working in the Argentine Chaco have proposed plans for the sustainable and profitable management of the Chaco. However, there are severe economic ",
        "31 constraints to the widespread adoption of this model by Chaco puesteros. The new managed system requires a relatively large initial investment and the increased land productivity gains from this investment are not immediate. Furthermore, the relatively short time horizon of puesteros, the lack of rural credit markets, insecure land tenure and high discount rates serve to make the new management system uneconomical. Social policy is likely necessary to overcome the rational resistance of puesteros to the management system. SOIL DEGRADATION IN SLOVAKIA Jaroslava Sobocka Soil Science and Conservation Research Institute Gagarinova 10, 827 13 Bratislava, Slovakia Soil degradation is a process that describes human-induced phenomena that lower the current and/or future capacity of the soil to support human life. Soil degradation could be described as the deterioration of soil quality, in other words: the partial or entire loss of one or more functions of the soil. The quality of Europe's environment has decreased as a result of pollution, notably in former centralized economies of Central and Eastern Europe. In contrast with the earlier concern for the atmosphere and hydrosphere, the need to protect the soil has been appreciated only more recently. Soil pollution can severely affect food production, the quality of surface and groundwater's a ultimately biodiversity and human healthy. The capacity of a soil to be harmed in its ecological functions - its vulnerability - varies with climate, soil type, land use, the chemical involved and degree of loading with these contaminants. Once degraded for example by water erosion, heavy metals or acid deposition, the ecological functions of soils will return only slowly. Slovakia is situated in the center of Europe with extent of 49 000 km 2 . Most of territory is occupied by mountains (the top 2655 m msl.) prevailingly forested (45% of Slovakia). In the southern part of Slovakia about 25 % of total extent belongs to lowlands. Following types of soil degradation processes have been recognized in Slovakia: Soil acidification, soil pollution by heavy metals and solid emission, soil pollution by pesticides and other organic contaminants, eutrophication by nitrates and phosphorus, salinization/alkalization, water and wind erosion, soil compaction, urban and land conversion. Soil acidification results from wide range of human activities of industrial-urbanized regions. Pollution affect soil via different pathways prevailingly from local sources or from diffuse sources over land, namely through the air. There are recognized 12 regions of Slovakia affected by anthropic acidification. The main sources of acidification are depositions of SO x and NO x emanate from by chemical industry, power generation, oil refinery, aluminum industry, heavy and metallurgy industry, and road/city traffic, too. Generally, the lack of separation technology and techniques are the reason of land deterioration in many cases. Magnezite plants effect soil via magnezite emission fallout. Soils covered by MgC0 3 crust are the unique example in Europe. By the way, new regeneration techniques are tested in this area. Also cement dust emission from cement plants sources is included to this degradation type. Soil pollution with heavy metals, e.g. cadmium, lead, chromium or copper emanate from various sources as ",
        "32 chemical industry (e.g. aluminum plant), power generation (incineration of fossil fuels), road traffic, agriculture and mining activities. Most heavy metals tend to accumulate in soils of higher pH, where are less mobile. Consequently, lowering the pH may trigger a mobilization of accumulated heavy metals, a phenomenon referred to as \"chemical time bomb\". In Slovakia there are some soil areas affected by heavy metals pollution characterized by lost of their basic function - support healthy plant production. Soil pollution by pesticides is localized in some irregular sites of Slovakian lowlands. Biocides have direct negative impact on soil flora and fauna and reduce the organic matter in the soil. One example of organic-sulfur pollution is recognized at wood-pulp production. Salinization/alkalization has been recognized at monitoring of hydrowork Gabcikovo area. Construction of the dam caused increasing of mineralized groundwater table mainly in the southeastern part of the Danubian lowland and consequently increases of the salt content of the topsoil leading to a productivity decline. Eutrophization by nitrates and phosphorus is remarked first of all in lowlands of Slovakia. Excessive nutrients are leached from the soil, eroded or simply washed off the land into groundwater. The major source of nitrates and phosphorus is agriculture, through application of manure and fertilizers. Water and wind erosion is one of the most enormous degradation impacts on soil in Slovakia, the assessment of eroded soils is about 55 % of agricultural land. This phenomenon is dominant in slightly undulated hills of Slovakian lowlands. This causes loss of topsoil due to removal of soil material by runoff water and wind action. Inappropriate land management, especially in agriculture and insufficient protection by vegetation in wind erosion areas contributes to unfavourable state of eroded land. Soil compaction is described as deterioration of soil structure by trampling or the weight and/or frequent use of heavy machinery. Also overgrazing and overstocking contribute to soil compaction in Slovakia.. This soil degradation type is recognized almost in all agricultural soils, mainly with higher clay content. They occupy lowlands and inter-mountains basins. Urban/industrial land conversion causes urbanization industry, infrastructure, mining, quarrying and other anthropic activities. Our biggest settlement agglomerations - Bratislava, Kojce, Zilina, Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica, etc., represent this land, which is being taken out of production for non-bio-productive activities. Our country has established a very good monitoring system to predict degradation influences and protect land in the framework of sustainable land use planning. FUTURE RISKS AND CONSEQUENCES OF SOIL DEGRADATION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES Sara J. Scherr Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics University of Maryland, MD 20742, USA This paper reviews recently available literature on the economic impacts of soil degradation in developing countries, and predicts future soil degradation concerns in the context of expected changes in population and agricultural economies. This literature includes 26 global or regional studies ",
        "33 and 54 national or sub-national studies for 26 countries, most addressing impacts of soil erosion, nutrient depletion and salinization. The analysis concludes that soil degradation is not likely to be a serious threat to international food trade between now and 2020, due to the global capacity for substitution, and the dominance of temperate producers. But it could have significant effects on national agricultural supply (14-17% reduction by some estimates) in many countries, and on global, and particularly national prices (17- 30%) increases by some estimates). The greatest impact of soil degradation will be the dampened economic growth effects of lower farm incomes in the irrigated, high quality rainfed and densely- populated marginal lands, due to lost soil productivity. The major economic threat will be in those countries and sub-regions which depend upon agriculture as the \"engine of economic growth.\" The greatest threats to nutrition and food consumption by poor farmers in 2020 will be in the densely- populated marginal lands of sub-Saharan Africa, and to a lesser extent South and Southeast Asia. Total agricultural land loss predicted by 2020 does not pose a major threat to global wealth in soil assets, however for countries with a limited land base, conserving farmland quality is a strategic long- term food security issue. The greatest problems of soil degradation for food security in developing countries in 2020 will be found in the densely-populated marginal lands, which require mobilization of long-term investment and new technology development. Second in importance will be degradation of irrigated lands through salinization and water-logging. In high quality rainfed lands, farmers are likely to respond actively to degradation with improved land management, assuming general support for agricultural development. Agricultural land quality and preservation in urban and peri-urban areas will be much more problematic. Soil degradation in lightly-populated marginal lands is unlikely to pose major economic (as distinct from environmental) costs beyond producers themselves. BOOK REVIEWS WHY INVEST MORE IN THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF LESS-FAVORED LANDS [International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) Report Volume 20, Number 2 July 1998 (Excerpted. To obtain more information, ifpri@cgnet.com)] Agricultural development strategies have traditionally emphasized irrigated agriculture and \"high- potential\" rain-fed lands in an attempt to increase food production and stimulate economic growth. This strategy has been spectacularly successful in many countries and was responsible for the Green Revolution. At the same time, however, large areas of less-favored lands have been neglected. Agricultural potential is generally low on these lands, often because of poor soils and low and uncertain rainfall, but also because neglect has left them with limited infrastructure and poor access to markets. Despite some out-migration, population size continues to grow in many less-favored areas, but crop yields grow little or not at all. The result is worsening poverty, food insecurity, and widespread degradation of natural resources (including mining of soil fertility, soil erosion, deforestation, and loss ",
        "34 of biodiversity). About 500 million people now live in less-favored lands, mostly in Asia and Sub- Saharan Africa; they comprise more than one-third of the rural poor. If current trends persist, by 2020 more than 800 million people are expected to live in less-favored lands. It is becoming increasingly clear that, on poverty and environmental grounds alone, more attention will have to be given to less-favored lands in setting priorities for policy and public investments. Already, some governments and donors are spending more resources on crisis relief than on development of less-favored lands. This leads to two key policy questions. First, what level of investment can be justified in less-favored lands, including expenditure on Agricultural research? Second, how should the resources be allocated to promote development that is beneficial to the poor and environmentally sustainable? The amount of investment that can be justified in less-favored lands depends on the returns that are realized in productivity growth, poverty reduction, and the containment of environmental degradation. Conventional wisdom suggests that the productivity returns are highest from irrigated and high- potential rain-fed lands; hence, adequate poverty reduction and environmental benefits must offset the losses in efficiency associated with investing in less-favored lands. But this view is being challenged by increasing evidence of stagnating levels of productivity growth in many Green Revolution areas, and by emerging evidence that the right kinds of investments can increase productivity to much higher levels than previously thought in some types of less-favored lands. For example, IFPRI's research in India shows that additional investments in many low-potential rain-fed lands could be a win-win strategy, leading to more agricultural growth and greater reduction of rural poverty. In fact, because of the high levels of investment already made in irrigated and high-potential rain-fed areas in India, the marginal returns from some investments (particularly roads, irrigation, education, and agricultural research) are now more attractive in many less-favored lands. Similar quantitative research of this kind is needed in other countries in order to resolve the debate over investment priorities for less-favored lands. Many past attempts to develop less-favored lands (for example, integrated rural development projects) were not very successful, including some of the research CGIAR centers have undertaken. To achieve success, higher levels of investment in less-favored lands have to be based on new or improved paradigms for sustainable development. In some areas, agricultural development may not be an economically viable alternative, and solutions will need to be sought through development of the non- farm economy and through accelerated migration. In other areas, agricultural intensification will be a key component of the development strategy, but because of poor infrastructure, low-to-moderate yield potential, and high climate risk, the strategy will typically be different from the Green Revolution approach. Agricultural researchers and farmers must take a holistic approach to improving farming systems and land management practices: soil and water management, plant nutrient generation and recycling, and exploitation of favorable niches in a landscape for production of high-value crops and trees will be especially important. Improved research will also have to be matched by increased investments in rural infrastructure, health, and education, and by appropriate institutional strengthening (such as secure property rights to natural resources for the people who use them and effective local institutions for organizing and managing common properties and collective action).

        "43 LETTER FROM THE EDITOR Vanishing Knowledge A colleague recently showed me an essay by Prof. David Ehrenfield of Rutgers University (Published in Harper's Magazine, March 1996, 15-17) which seemed to reflect some of observations in the last few years. Let me first excerpt his sentiments. \"I think our concept of progress prevents us from realising that skills and knowledge can simply vanish from the world There is no store of learning in greater danger or disappearing than our long-accumulated knowledge of the natural world. We are on the verge of losing our ability to tell one plant or animal from another and of forgetting how species interact with one another and with their environment. In our universities, certain subjects no longer have anyone to teach them, or people teach them on a piecemeal basis from the periphery of the University or outside altogether. ...Make no mistake, I am not talking about the preservation of trivia but the safe transmission of existing knowledge. A worrisome example: Agriculture depends on soil. Soil fertility depends on earthworms and different species play different roles -. In North America, European and Asian species are displacing native species. However, there is no one working on this. There are no graduate students on earthworm taxonomy in US or Canada I fear for us when there is no one left in our places of learning who can tell one month from another. ...And no one even to know that this knowledge is needed and gone\". The situation is probably more serious in the agriculture field and specifically in soils. A major culprit is 'down-sizing' of universities, aging of staff, peer-pressure forcing teaching and research to be on the cutting edge with few possibilities for developing the fundamentals and dealing with the mundane. I met a student recently working on 'fluxes of polar liquids in soils' who neither had the information nor the knowledge about the soils he was working on -it could have been glass beads. In the last issue of this Newsletter, I lamented about distinguished scientists, who knew all the theory of soil degradation, but were totally unable to make a decision in the field. In one of the widely used soil - crop - climate simulation models, an algorithm based on measured clay is used to estimate available water - totally oblivious to the role of mineral-chemical composition of soils. In our field of work, decisions on land degradation are made with no information on rates, kinds, and locations of degradation. The are many 'false prophets' who generally have all the answers on generalities; but confront them with a piece of real estate on this earth and the truth will emerge. The Desertification Convention and the donors who fund it would rather invest funds to implement programs that are geo-politically appealing rather than some basic data gathering and knowledge development. It is time to get our decision-makers to become proactive and return to fundamentals. Providing the next generation of scientists a broad-based education in soils is as important as trying to address land degradation today. 1998 on Planet Earth ",
        "44 Last November, I was flying in to Kuala Lumpur and as usual I was in my window seat. I gazed out of the window as the plane was on its final approach to land and all I saw was the haze. As I drove into the city, the world's tallest twin-towers were shrouded in haze and the outline of the city had a mystical appearance. My mother said that they were rationing water. The newspaper headlines blared about the smoke from the uncontrolled forest fires on the coastal swamps of Sumatra, Indonesia. At the end of May, a similar event sent smoke from the forest fires of Chiapas, Mexico almost to Washington DC. During the same period, the Indian sub-continent was dominating the news with their tests on nuclear bombs; the Southeast Asian countries were being hit by financial crises and Indonesia erupted in civilian strife. In the US, there was an unusual surge of tornado and storm activities resulting in a few hundred million dollars worth of damage. The winter in North America was warm and the spring wet and this was blamed on El Ni\u00f1o. Tourists visiting the Glacier National Park in Montana were disappointed that there were none to see. Scientists, working in the Arctic report that much of the large ice-flows were thinner and smaller. What has any of this got to do with land degradation? It may be difficult to establish cause and effect relationships that stand the test of scientific scrutiny. But it does point to fact that human interactions with the land have created dis-equilibriums in the global ecosystem. One does not have to search far to determine that many lands are stressed. Our large mono-clonal farms, the network of roads and concrete buildings which seal the soil surface, the large-scale irrigation systems that alter the hydrology of the catchment, the drainage of swamps, and the emission of green house gases by industries and their products, have cumulatively made this a different world. A healthy, functioning society requires all of these; the difference is that human society has proceeded recklessly and without an understanding of environmental impacts. Even today, a decade after the Brundland Commission Report, few countries really implement what was agreed at the UNCED Conference in Rio. The United Nations and countries have spent millions of dollars to agree to the various Conventions -Biodiversity, Desertification, Global Climate\u2014but in the countries where it matters, there is no iota of change. My friend and I once wrote, \"Unsustainable crop yields, unacceptably high rates of soil erosion, deforestation, loss of germplasm diversity, and bewildered farmers who do not know what to do next to eke out a reasonable standard of living still remain the facts of life in the semi-arid and arid regions of Asia\". I can generalise this for the developing countries of the world and the statement is still true. Land degradation is at the root all biophysical and socioeconomic problems of countries and the sooner countries accept this and attend to it, the better it will be for the world as a whole Water Quality Though our function is to discuss land degradation, we should not forget the water, which is so intrinsically linked to land. In fact some water quality indicators may be more sensitive and reliable than many land quality indicators due to the fact that hey integrate the results of land based processes spatially and temporally.

The Task Force The University of \u00c7ukurova and friends of this Task Force, such as the British Council, have invested in this Newsletter. We are hoping that the organisations dealing with global land degradation problems, such as the World Bank, UNEP, FAO, USAID, and other international donors will support us in the future. UNEP recently published its Second Edition of \"World Atlas of Desertification\". Although it is based on expert opinion and with no ground truth, it is a good effort and gives an estimate of the magnitude of the problem. Julian Morris (see Book Review section), partly disillusioned by the claims of UNEP, refers to the \"Desertification Myth\" stemming from \"dubious statistics\". One of the reasons for creating the International Task Force on Land Degradation by the International Society of Soil Science is to rally the scientific community to develop Guidelines for Land Degradation Assessment and Monitoring. In the absence of funding support, such an international effort may be futile. In this issue we have an interesting paper from Dr. Harold Dregne who has worked on land degradation and desertification for several decades. He concludes by stating that, \"The International Task Force on Land Degradation has a great opportunity to assess the severity and cost of land degradation worldwide and to simulate cooperation among scientists in understanding and solving the degradation problem\". We will do our best to live up to this and other expectations. There is also an interesting short article -on Asia's ecological crises- from the International Board for Soil Research and Management (Thailand), stressing the short- and long term- impact of land degradation in south east Asia. Finally, a word or two on what you, as an individual, can do to help this cause: \u2022 Contribute to the Newsletter \u2022 Play an active role in your countries for protecting the soil resource base; \u2022 Try to get your colleagues to generate reliable data on soil degradation; \u2022 Get your soil survey organisation to start monitoring soil quality; \u2022 Get your politicians involved. Lead Paper Land Degradation: Assessment and Monitoring Harold Dregne Land Degradation is an old and long-recognised problem. Terracing to control water erosion is an example of a land management practice that has been used for thousands of years in societies as far removed from one another as the Incas in South America and the farmers of Afghanistan in Asia. Lowdermilk's classic report on the association of land degradation with the decline of several civilisations chronicled the damage done over thousands of years (Lowdermilk, 1953) . Water erosion ",
        "46 is, by far, the land degradation process that attracts most attention although Lowdermilk also referred top overgrazing, tree cutting, and wind erosion. Eckholm authored an excellent book on global land degradation that is both well written and factual (Eckholm, 1976). This article will 1) give a brief definition of land degradation and note the principal degradation processes, 2) comment on several aspects of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, 3) discuss country and global assessments of land degradation, and 4) describe monitoring methods. Definitions and Processes Land Degradation is something that everybody agrees is bad. Producing a generally acceptable definition of the term is another matter. Just as there seem to be endless definitions of \"desertification\" and \"sustainability\", there probably are many ideas of the details of the land degradation process and what it means to humanity. As used here, land degradation consists of deterioration of the biological potential of the land due to human activities. The word \"land\" refers to all the components of the landscape. That includes vegetative cover, soils, slope, geomorphic surfaces, hydrologicai systems, and animal life. The principal global land degradation processes are vegetation degradation, water erosion, wind erosion, salinisation, soil fertility loss, and soil compaction and crusting. More localised, but no less important, processes include soil acidification, heavy metal contamination , water-logging, and organic chemical pollution. One of the most important considerations in understanding the significance of land degradation is the reversibility of the process. There is a concise statement on reversibility in the Land Degradation Page of World Soil Resources home page on the Internet (http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/worldsoils). Of the major land degradation processes, vegetation degradation, salinisation of irrigated land, soil nutrient loss, and compaction and crusting are reversible, in the main. However, reversibility of vegetation degradation is highly dependent on the climate in the degraded area. Vegetation recovery to its pre-human intervention status may never be able to occur in hyper-arid and arid climatic zones and may require decades in the semiarid climatic zone. Conversely, recovery may be very rapid in the humid tropics on good soils. Water and wind erosion are, in principal, irreversible because soil development virtually always is slower than accelerated erosion. To all intents and purposes, though, water erosion may cause little or no reduction in soil productivity if the soils are deep and fairly uniform. That is true, most extensively, on the Loess Plateau of China. Wind erosion, similarly, may cause no measurable on-site damage on deep sandy soils of the Sahel region of Africa. Ultimately, of course, unchecked erosion will produce a shallow soil that will affect plant growth. An exception to the irreversibility of water erosion damage to soil productivity is described by Langdale et al. (1992) for an Ultisol in the state of Georgia in the United States. A particular system of conservation tillage appeared to restore and sustain yields on that soil. Convention to Combat Desertification ",
        "47 In 1977, a United Nations Conference on Desertification was convened in Nairobi, Kenya. The impetus for convening that conference was a severe drought in sub-Saharan Africa. This was probably the first global conference on land degradation that had ever been held anywhere. Although it was called a conference on desertification, for political reasons, land degradation and its control was the sole subject. In 1990, at a meeting in Nairobi called by the United Nations Environment Program, desertification was formally defined as land degradation in the dry-lands. At the 1992 United Nations Conference on the Environment and Development, participating governments approved a resolution to establish an international agreement to combat desertification. The title of the formal agreement is the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly Africa. The short title of the ratified agreement is the Convention to Combat Desertification (CCD). A United Nations convention is a legal document under international law. Other UN conventions include those related to biological diversity and climate change. The secretariat for the CCD will be in Bonn, Germany. It has been depressing to see the low interest displayed by government representatives who prepared the CCD in assessment of the status and trend of land degradation in their countries. Logic would seem to demand that before endorsing an International program to spend large amounts of money to control land degradation, governments would want to know how serious the problem is in their countries. Amazingly, no country representatives appear to have even brought up the subject. There is absolutely no reference in the CCD document (CCD, 1995) to the availability of information on the extent and severity of land degradation in any of the 100 countries that participated in planning the convention. There is also no indication that any government cared about the omission. The high proportion of dry areas, poverty, number of countries involved, weak governmental infrastructure, and difficult socioeconomic conditions justify the special position of Africa in the convention, not by the severity of land degradation. In the entire CCD document (71 pages), there is just one statement on land degradation assessment. Under a paragraph dealing with a global information network, a subsection advises governments to \"use and disseminate modern technology for data collection, transmission and assessment of land degradation\" on page 18. Obviously, continued ignorance of the magnitude and costs of land degradation is of little importance. The observations by Mermut and Eswaran (1997) in their reprinted article in the Land Degradation Newsletter about reductions in research funds for science certainly apply to land degradation. The rationale for financial support will have to be made by soil scientists, range scientists, ecologists, and others if there is to be a change. Land Degradation Assessment The narrow funding base for assessing global and regional land and soil degradation is demonstrated by two global studies. The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) financed both the soil degradation assessment by Oldeman et al. (1990) and the land degradation assessment in dry-lands by Dregne and Chou (1992). The product of the soil degradation exercise called GLASOD was a map of the entire world, whereas the land degradation evaluation was a country-by-country assessment of ",
        "48 the world's dryland (arid, semiarid, and dry subhumid climatic zones). Both analyses depended upon the informed of opinion knowledgeable scientists. That method had to be used because there is an abysmal scarcity of good data on land or soil degradation. For both studies, again, the evaluation of degradation was the loss in potential productivity due to human activities (Table 1). Unfortunately, the results of the two studies are not comparable. First and foremost, one evaluated worldwide soil degradation while the other assessed land (soil and vegetation) degradation in dry lands. Second, one was a map, the other was a country-by-country listing of the total affected areas. Third, potential biological productivity was measured differently. Qualitative criteria of productivity were used in the GLASOD project; quantitative criteria were employed in the land degradation. Fourth, the GLASOD maps show four kinds of soil degradation: water erosion, wind erosion, chemical deterioration, and physical deterioration. In the Dregne and Chou assessment, only the sum of the impact of the various land degradation processes is shown (light, moderate, severe, and very severe). For the latter assessment, evaluations of water erosion, wind erosion, vegetation degradation, and salinisation were made for each country and each land use, but only the summation is given. That was a mistake. The GLASOD method was better because it is more informative to know the severity of the individual processes than of the total impact of all processes. Structured Informed Opinion The only way to conduct a rapid assessment of the global status of a natural resource, distribution of diseases, size of oil reserves, and other matters of broad concern is to have knowledgeable people review whatever they can find and then use their personal experiences to make numerical estimates. The basis for the decisions is informed opinion. And the way to obtain the best results is to structure the informed opinion analysis so that all participants follow the same path for reaching conclusions. The method should combine the expert system approach with group assessments dynamics to assure that the \"experts\" insofar as possible, interpret the criteria similarly. The principal justification for using the structured informed opinion method of qualitative analysis is that it represents the best way we know to get answers (how bad is land degradation in my country?) to a problem that requires immediate attention. Whether the method does or does not work depends upon how well questions are structured and the experience of the people involved. It is worse than useless to accept guesses by uninformed persons. ",

Unfortunately, reliable data on the extent and severity of land degradation and its impact on biological productivity are nearly non-existent for much of the world. Stocking (1985) found that here had been only about 200 controlled experiments conducted anywhere in the world on the effect of water erosion on soil productivity. Many more have been run in recent years but the number is still small and concentrated in a few countries. Lai (1994) deplored the meagerness of data on the productivity, economic, and environmental consequences of water and wind erosion and, even, on the dimensions (extent, magnitude, rate) of the problem. Poor though the situation is on the water erosion-productivity relation, it is even worse when it comes to finding field experiments on how wind erosion, brush invasion, soil salinity, and soil compaction affect productivity. About the only type of land degradation for which there is a lot of data is nutrient deficiencies. Water erosion data are widely available but its relation to potential land productivity is rarely measured. There is little information on wind erosion damage and virtually nothing on the extent of soil compaction although it undoubtedly is widespread. A mathematical model of the erosion-productivity relation has been developed in the United States to meet the need for information on the costs of soil erosion (Williams et al., 1983). The model is called EPIC and is being used in the five year assessment in the US of the status of soil, water, and related resources. Other models have been constructed (Piece et al., 1984). But their development is constrained by the small number of erosion-productivity experiments reported in the literature. Much remains to be done in modelling the effect of erosion (and other land degradation processes) on potential land productivity. ",
        "50 A consultant report to the World Bank (Christoffersen, 1994) on information needs on land degradation in Africa placed the highest priority on a more solid information base. The consultant recommended that African leaders could establish a continental information base on land degradation that could lead to an international effort. He noted the need for a cooperative effort to avoid collecting data that are not comparable across national borders. Without a cooperative approach, a lot of numbers will be collected that are difficult or impossible for people from other countries to understand and interpret. Christoffersen believed that both the dry-lands and the humid regions need that kind of information. He also believe in starting small to test assessment and monitoring methods before wholesale adoption throughout the continent. Monitoring Land Degradation Assessment of the status of the land degradation should proceed before monitoring begins, in order to provide a base condition against which to compare later changes and to establish trends. The major question in monitoring is what to monitor and the time interval for the monitoring. Salinisation monitoring probably should be done every year or two if there is reason to believe that a salt problem can or does exist. Five years may be frequent enough to determine changes in sheet erosion but monitoring active gully formation will require a greater frequency. What to monitor and how to do it is more difficult to decide. Monitoring land degradation over large areas using the informed opinion technique is almost certainly unacceptable. There is too much difference of opinion to have confidence that five-year evaluations based on opinions would be sufficiently accurate to identify small changes in land conditions and their effect on productivity. Effective monitoring probably would have to be confined to repeated field measurements on test areas. Gully changes in a representative area could be measured using ground methods or low-level aerial photographs or a combination. The same would be possible for wind erosion. Soil salinity would have to be based on field or laboratory testing. Vegetation degradation \"again on test area\" can be monitored using well known transect or quadrant methods. Some time in the future, satellite imagery should be improved to the point where large-area monitoring is possible. At present, it cannot be done for any of the major land degradation processes. Ground-truth collection is simply too expensive to make global satellite monitoring feasible. The key to land degradation monitoring is to identify indicators that are quantitative, sensitive to small changes, easy to measure, small in number, and reasonably unambiguous. Crop yield variation from place to place and year to year are not acceptable indicators unless there is good control of test conditions. Yields can vary too much due to conditions that have nothing to do with land degradation. Pest attacks, delayed planting, hail, a wet or dry spring, locust invasions and other conditions complicate interpretations of cause-and-effect relations. Selecting and using land degradation indicators is not a simple task. Physical and biological indicators of land degradation are relatively simple to identify compared to socioeconomic indicators. Various attempts to select socioeconomic indicators have been made, beginning with a workshop that was held at the 1977 United Nations Conference on Desertification ",
        "51 (Reining, 1978). The problem with socioeconomic indicators is that few, if any, can be related unambiguously to land degradation. Poverty, for example, can be caused by many things including poor, but not necessarily degraded, soils, as well as unfavourable climates, antagonistic government policies, insect and disease infestations, small plots of land etc. Even high population density, which commonly is given as the reason for land degradation, may be beneficial, not destructive (Mortimore et al.. 1993). Coming up with useful socioeconomic indicators will be difficult. Discussion If there is to be effective international cooperation on controlling land degradation in the future, establishment of a network to exchange information and to establish cooperative efforts is essential. The International Task Force on Land Degradation offers the best opportunity to bring together like- minded soil scientists, ecologists, action agencies, and others to attack a problem that is crucial to human well-being. The original GLASOD project and the recently completed Southeast Asia project are a momentous beginning. UNEP is to be applauded for having the foresight to fund these activities. The pending European project will, through the European Union, provide those countries with practical information on soil quality and how to achieve sustainable use of soils. The GLASOD procedures could easily be adapted to collecting information on vegetation health as well as soil health. My preference is a country-by-country assessment of land degradation by country professionals, with results presented in maps (to show where the problem areas are) and numerical tables of estimates of land area, by land use, in various land degradation classes. Degradation area numbers should be estimated directly, not taken from measurements of areas in different mapping units. Errors can be very high if maps are the sources of numbers, and the smaller the map scale, the greater is the potential error. Country numbers can be aggregated to produce regional and global figures. If a country assessment approach is taken, debates about the accuracy of the estimations can begin among experienced professionals. With repeated small improvements in the data base estimates, a consensus may be reached that truly reflects the best information available. Such an approach is impossible with global numbers because no individuals understand what the degradation condition is everywhere. Debating global numbers, only, is fruitless. Conclusions Interest in assessment and monitoring of soil degradation is increasing in several countries and one international body, the United Nations Environment Program. The European Union has had projects underway on land degradation (Medallus I, II and III) for several years. The first effort to assess part of that problem will begin when the International Soil Reference and Information Center (ISRIC) undertakes a GLASOD-like soil degradation study for a part of Europe. The state of New South Wales in Australia has already produced an excellent publication on land degradation there. The biggest disappointment is the failure of the newly ratified Convention to Combat Desertification to put a high priority on finding out the extent and magnitude of land degradation in member countries.

As a result Attica had become deforested, the soils depleted, and there are remaining only the bones of the wasted body -all the richer and softer parts of the soil having fallen away. \u2022 David Livingstone (1857): suggested that desert-like conditions he observed in East Africa might be the result of a gradual drying-up, a 1 progressive desiccation'. \u2022 Earl of Athlone (1938), President of the Royal African Society: That this council views with the gravest concern the widespread destruction of the African soil by erosion consequent on wasteful methods of husbandry which strike at the basis of rural economy and native welfare. We are of the opinion that immediate steps should be taken for the adoption of a common policy and energetic measures throughout British Africa in order to put an effective check upon this growing menace to the true fertility of the land and to the health of the inhabitants. In a Lighter Vein Return to Earth Captain's log: Earthdate 2025. IUSSS Starship \"PEDOPRISE\" returns to earth after a 30-year journey in outer space. In command is Captain Hah. As they approach earth Captain Hah barks to navigator Selim \"Put it on the screen and zoom in. Science Officer Ahmet, what do you make of this. Stop dreaming about Adana kebab and Ayran. There seems to be less cloud cover, there are fewer green areas and those present are in wrong places, it appears desolate.\" Ahmet, \"well sir, this is the culmination of a number of human induced activities. Population pressures, ignoring the land, contaminating the waters with persistent organic pesticides, polluting the atmosphere with gas emissions, conversion of good agricultural lands to concrete urban jungle and degrading the remaining land with urban waste, ....You name it, we did it\". Navigator Selim, who moonlights in archaeology, indicates, \"humans never learnt from past experiences. The limits of the land were known by Roman, Greek, Indian, Arab, and other civilisations and religion and social laws enabled them to manage their resources in a sustainable manner. However, towards the end of the last Century, due to spectacular advances in science and technology, these indigenous knowledge-bases were ignored and even ridiculed and we the consequences\". Captain Hah turns round to Doc Chayasit behind him, \"What do you make of it? I thought that in the nineties, the nations of the world signed a whole bunch of conventions to protect the environment -biodiversity, desertification, global climate, oceans etc. What happened? \" Doc Chayasit, hoping to return home and feast on Thorn Yam Goong and Larb Kai, looked at the Captain with a sad face and said, \"These Conventions did play a role, but too insignificant to have any global or long-lasting effect. Few countries perceived this as a common threat and so no one really wanted to invest the money. On the Inter-galactic Net there was a report on how major fresh water sources were contaminated with endocrine suppressants and other organic and inorganic chemicals. The 'teeny-weeny' syndrome in alligators was already known 30 years ago. ",

The Captain sat silently and gazed forlornly at the screen. His mind, like those of his crew, was on the good things of life that they had experienced when growing up - re-engineering, budget cuts, affirmative action programs, paradigm shifts in science, financial scams, political fiascos, Viagra etc. Suddenly he looked up and noticed everybody staring at him, as though asking. \"What do we do now?\" Captain Hari, with all his wisdom looked straight into their eager faces and said, \"Let's get the hell out of this place.

Task Force On Land Degradation of the International Society of Soil Science AGENDA 21 of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development emphasizes the need and proposes a wide range of activities to address land degradation in general and desertification in particular. As a response to this challenge, more than 100 countries have signed the Convention to Combat Desertification (CCD) in 1997. A key point of the CCD deals with scientific and technical cooperation on investigation, collection, evaluation of the processes and factors involved in land degradation leading to desertification. At the conclusion of the Conference on Land Degradation at Adana, an International Task Force on Land Degradation, to be formed under the auspices of the International Society of Soil Science (ISSS), was proposed and unanimously adopted. The Soil Science Department of the University of \u00c7ukurova, Adana, has agreed to provide an interim Secretariat.

        "56 Secretary's Report The Task Force on Land Degradation has been struggling to identify the conceptual approach for the preparation of the \"Guidelines for LD\". Several persons have been contacted to seek advice. Most recently, we were fortunate to have visit in Adana, of Dr. Peter Bullock (sponsored by the British Council) from Silsoe College, Univ. of Cranfield, UK. A draft outline was prepared and is now being reviewed by several persons. Dr. Bullock, former director of the Soil Survey of England, Scotland, and Wales, is eminently qualified to lead this effort. Once we have first draft we would like your assistance to review it to proceed to the next stage. Those interested, please contact Dr. Kapur, Secretary of the Task Force. Dr. Kapur participated in the \"Carbon sequestration\" meeting held in Tunis at 13-17 October 1997 presenting an invited paper on the \"CARBONATE POOLS IN SOILS OF THE MEDITERRANEAN: A CASE STUDY FROM ANATOLIA\" with special reference to identifying and designating carbonate rich surfaces. Similar Quaternary surfaces (calcretes) were observed in Tunisia, occupying an appreciable part of the country, at a very fruitful excursion to the Eastern Erg of the Sahara. Though the meeting was on soil carbon, it was evident that one of the processes contributing to carbon losses is erosion. The rates and magnitude of such losses in the Mediterranean areas is still not established. Monitoring of carbon may provide a default index for land degradation. The work on carbon should also include similar works conducted in large irrigation areas related to potential C02 productions as well as carbon contents in coastal - continental shelf areas in relation to transported materials from the land. The post-meeting excursions' of the \"M. Yesilsoy International Symposium on Arid Region Soils (YISARS) to Central and Western Anatolia are to be held in September 21-24, 1998. In November 1997, a transect of the tour route was made by Drs. Senol, Kapur, and Eswaran. The tour route and sites were selected to show land use, land degradation (including impacts of past civilisations), and current problems associated with productivity. The historical aspects of land management and hence land degradation is an integral part of the state of the soil resources of the country and cannot be ignored in any assessment. One of the purposes of the Post-Symposium tour is to demonstrate this. In May, Dr. H. Eswaran visited Thailand to meet with the organisers of the 2nd International Conference on Land Degradation. Mr. Chaiyasit and his colleagues have made all preparations for this meeting. Keynote and Session Lead Speakers were selected and a draft program was developed. We encourage as many as persons as possible to attend.

        "58 National and Regional Reports Asia's ecological crisis Eric Craswell, Hans Dieter Bechstedt, and Rod Lefroy. International Board for Soil Research and Management (IBSRAM), Bangkok In Thailand and Indonesia, 2 million and 8 million people, respectively, are expected to lose their jobs by the middle of this year. As a result, a wave of unskilled factory or construction workers and service sector employees are expected to migrate from cities to rural areas. Furthermore, many students will be unable to afford to live and study in the cities, so they will return to the countryside. Many will return to remote marginal and impoverished rural areas that they originally left because of declining yields and land degradation. The economic crisis will be a serious setback to efforts to alleviate poverty in Asia. Estimates before the crisis indicated that two-thirds of the world's 1.2 billion poor - with a per capita income less than US$1 a day - reside in the Asian region. In Thailand as many as 11 million people live on degraded forest land without ownership title, and 600.000 people are estimated to live in national parks, wildlife sanctuaries and class A1 watersheds, even though no settlement is allowed there to assist preservation. In South-East Asia, 263 million rural poor live in marginal steep-land areas with acid infertile soils. The scope of the problem globally and the link between poverty and marginal lands is illustrated by estimates from the International Food Policy Research Institute that the steep-land population in the tropics represents 36% of the rural poor and is predicted to grow from 500 to 800 million by 2020. The economic crisis has dried up off-farm income sources for many subsistence farmers in Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines. El Nino has affected even Indonesia's intensive rice production systems, with an estimated 400.000 ha of paddy rice seriously affected by drought. In addition, the rising cost of living and soaring prices for agricultural inputs will influence farmers to extend their cultivation onto more marginal lands or forest reserves instead of investing in intensification of their agricultural systems. Adoption of conservation farming practices to prevent erosion requires a longer-term perspective and is even less attractive. Cutbacks in government spending reduce opportunities for extension support and incentives to introduce soil conservation measures. Land Degradation Estimates of rates of land degradation and the economic impacts are difficult and often controversial. In many Asian countries more than 60% of the land surface is classified as hilly or mountainous. Yet food production growth has been derived largely from irrigated lowlands, where paddy rice yields grew significantly over the past 25 years. Concomitantly, the hilly areas were deforested at alarming rates in countries such as the Philippines and Thailand. Population pressure and scarce land and water resources in the region have led to cultivation of lands with slopes as steep as 60%. In Thailand, the annual average soil erosion rate is 34 tonnes per hectare per year, with more than 30% of the country affected by moderate to severe erosion (Asian Development Bank 1998). ",
        "5.9 Approximately 45% of the land in the Philippines is moderately to severely eroded. About 41% of the area cultivated is on land with slopes greater than 18%. In Indonesia, one-third of the 57 million hectares of upland soils (excluding forest areas) is classified as being in a critical condition because of land degradation. Some 9200 million tons of sediment wash into the region's oceans every year, represents 70% of global sediment outflows. Large river systems deposit sediment in flood plains, and increasingly in reservoirs, so much of the outflow to the oceans comes from small mountainous rivers (Milliman & Syvidski, 1992). The outflows of sediment constitute a major loss of nutrients and a high economic cost. The recent El Nino phenomenon has exacerbated the land degradation problems because, apart from the reduced agricultural productivity, drought intensifies fires set to clear land. Loss of biodiversity and global carbon impacts must be added to the list of serious environmental impacts. The impacts of such fires in Indonesia have been widely publicised, but fires in Thailand at the end of the dry season have also caused localised haze affecting air traffic and health. The steep-land and cleared by fire and cultivated is exposed to erosion by the first heavy monsoon rains. The nexus between poverty, food insecurity and environmental problems is complex and dynamic. We need more research to develop sufficient understanding to help the countries affected to respond to perturbations such as the current economic crisis. Scientific Research The ultimate clients for research on these problems are policy-makers and land managers. Policy makers need to know the scope of the problems and the social, economic, and environmental impacts of their policy decisions (or indecisions). Policy-makers also need to know the potential benefits from investment in by-passed areas, where the marginal rate of return can be significantly greater than in high potential areas of the lowlands. Poor small-holders on marginal lands need advice about land management practices that are productive, economically viable, socially acceptable and risk-averse, while protecting the land and water resources. Since many farmers are women, the gender implications of land management must also be addressed. Research to help these people requires a participatory approach that utilises both indigenous and scientific knowledge. An International Board for Soil Research and Management (IBSRAM) research network on sustainable management of sloping lands in Asian countries has already contributed significantly to the scientific knowledge base (Craswell et al. 1998). Effective research on these complex issues requires interdisciplinary teams of scientists from the countries concerned. A landscape approach is needed so that both on- and off-site impacts are studied, and all affected communities are involved. Additional support is being marshalled by international centers like IBSRAM through a consortium that draws expertise from advanced institutions in Europe, North America and Australasia. The Australian Center for International Agricultural Research is playing a key role as a donor and broker of research partnerships. Key areas of research include: ",
        "6\u03bf \u2022 sustainability assessment based on the framework for Evaluating Sustainable Land Management. A prototype Decision Support System has been developed for sloping lands in Asia (Rais et al. 1997) \u2022 impact assessment focused initially on the multifarious on- and off-site impacts of soil erosion (Enters 1998); \u2022 resource management domains analysis on which to base priority setting and technology transfer; and \u2022 research paradigm development that refines the participatory and interdisciplinary approaches through model catchment studies. Australasian science has much to offer, including; \u2022 direct experience with the management of land in the tropics; \u2022 models such as the Landscape approach for institutionalising rural community interactions with scientists; and \u2022 a raft of scientific expertise in the fields of hydrology, information systems, soil science, rural sociology, integrated catchment management, and multiple objective decision-making. The scope of the problems in Asia is daunting, but the potential social and environmental benefits from sustainable land management of marginal land are enormous. The short-term setback from the recent economic crisis should be a signal that even greater investments are needed to address these long- term intractable problems. The cost of inaction to the security of the region in the 21st Century is too high a price to pay. References Asian Development Bank 1998. Emerging Asia: Changes and Challenges. ADB.

        "61 The amount of C02 produced during the process of mineralisation of the organic matter versus time depends on the C content and type of the organic matter, the C/N ratio, soil properties -texture, aeration, pH, salinity, and climatic factors -temperature and moisture- (Ottow, 1997). Correlation analyses were conducted on potential C02 (field capacity, 30oC) (Isermeyer, 1952) and organic matter contents (Schlichting and Blume, 1966) of surface horizons of the selected soil series (Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1995) of the GAP region (Figure 1). Moderately, low and very low amounts of C02 productions (20-30mg C02 100g-1.24h-1) were determined in the Yavuzeli, Araban, Suru\u00e7, Birecik, Keysun, Kayadk, Hilvan, Harran, and Ceylanplnar plains respectively (Figure 2). Organic matter contents were determined to be low (1-2%) in the major part of the GAP area except in the Harran and Ceylanplnar soils (_2.0 %) with low C02 productions in spite of the higher amounts of organic matter contents than the Yavuzeli and Araban plains with high C02 productions. The correlation between the organic matter contents of the soils and the C02 productions were found insignificant. This is most probably due to the slight differences in the ecologies of the plains and the variations in the structural properties (especially C contents and C/N ratios) of the organic matter of the soil series together with the accumulations of high amounts of decomposition resistant lignin (due to monoculture of wheat). The recently introduced rotational practices in the area with irrigation providing highly mineralisable organic matter to the soils will most probably increase the low C02-productions, thus, increasing the contribution of the soil to the 'C- cycle'. The C02 production obtained on the present rainfed conditions of the area will serve as valuable results to be compared with changes to occur following irrigation and its associated cultural practices in the future.

Recent Carbon Deposition Along the Anatolian Shelves V. Ediger Middle East Technical University, Institute of Marine Sciences, Erdemli, Turkey Inorganic and organic carbon were determined in the surface grab sediments along the Anatolian shelf areas. Total organic carbon was calculated from the carbonate contents of the sediments. The Anatolian coastal areas are surrounded by four different types of depositional environments with the Black sea being a unique marine environment ie a land-locked basin. Its waters are in a state of ",
        "62 almost complete isolation from the world ocean, as a result of the restricted exchange with the Mediterranean Sea through the Anatolian straight system. Thus, the basin is almost anoxic, containing oxygen in the upper 150m depth and hydrogen sulphide in the deep waters. The depositional environment of the Sea of Marmara is a transitional link between the Black Sea - the Aegean and the Eastern Mediterranean. The two narrow straits of Dardanelles and Bosphorous provided connections between the two adjacent environments. The Aegean Sea is largely affected by the northerly inflow of the Black Sea waters and southerly inflow of the Mediterranean, the former being cooler and brackish and the latter warmer and saline. The waters of the Eastern Mediterranean Sea have a restricted exchange with the Atlantic Ocean through the strait of Gibraltar. Therefore, this silled basin is almost oxic. The depositional environment of the Eastern Mediterranean Sea is largely effected by the currents of Asia Minor meandering along the Anatolian coast. There is roughly a reverse relation between the amount of the total inorganic carbon (TIC) and total organic carbon (TOC) from the eastern Black Sea to the eastern Mediterranean Sea along the Anatolian coastal zone. The maximum TIC and minimum TOC deposition were detected along the shelf of the carbonate-rocky (Anamur) (5.64%) and deltaic (Tasucu) (5.76%) coastal zones of the less productive Mediterranean Sea. The amount of the TOC deposition is greater than the TIC deposition in the polluted Golden Horn and the highly productive eastern Black Sea basins. The other areas have dominant TIC levels. There are no similarities between the percentage distribution of the TIC and TOC along the highly energetic shallow (0-50 m) depositional areas of the Anatolian Seas. The highest TOC content in the second part (50-100m) of the highly productive Black Sea shelf area is decreasing in the Sea of Marmara, Mediterranean and Aegean Seas respectively. There is a reverse abundance between the TIC and TOC along this order of the seas. The highest percentages of the TOC contents are nearly the same in the shelf areas lying between the 100 m and 200 m depth of the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara. This amount is decreased in the Mediterranean and Aegean Seas respectively. The abundance of the TIC between the 100-200 m depth of the shelf areas is the reverse. The highest TOC and TIC contents in the deepest part of the highly productive Black Sea is decreased in the Sea of Marmara, Aegean and the Mediterranean respectively. This expected order also depends on the order of the productivity level of the Anatolian Seas. The level of pollution, coastal type lithology, the level of the primary production, sea bottom depth morphology, coastal current systems and coastal inputs are the amount of the carbon deposition along the Anatolian shelves.

Reiskirchen. 1997. 422 pp. The properties and spatial distribution of soils and their mineral constituents are especially useful indicators of both present and past environmental conditions. Through a series of case studies, the authors show that linkages can be made between measurable soil and mineral properties and the processes that shape the weathering environment. The papers emphasise that spatial and temporal variability are inherent attributes of soils and landscapes that must be quantified and properly managed if ecological and environmental harmony are to be attained.

The authors believe that though there is evidence for some gains in the goal towards sustainable development, the balance of evidence suggests that the earth's environmental and resource degradation trends still persists. They describe the contracting base of cropland and the global climate change threats to disrupt the ecological foundations of the global economy. They point to land degradation and its lack of control as root cause. They conclude that if this goes unchecked , global food security will be threatened. ",

Published by the Institute of Economic Affairs, London, 107 pp. Drawing on diverse literature, the report presents a critical assessment of the theory underpinning the United Nations Convention on Desertification. The report is divided into two parts. Part one begins with a brief history of the ideologies and interventions that have led to the Convention on Desertification. This is followed by a discussion of the evidence for and against a number of competing theories, which seek to explain the evolution of deserts and the causes of desertification. Part two begins with a very brief overview of the political economy of Africa. This is followed by an explanation of the root causes of land degradation and some tentative proposals for resolving the related problems of poverty, hunger, and land degradation in the developing world. An appendix discusses the problem of land degradation in the United States. Letter to the Editor It is with some interest that I heard of an international effort to develop standard indicators of soil quality and methods to measure and analyse the effects of variations in soil quality. This interest arose on account of a paper on land degradation and the Australian agricultural industry, which I co- authored. From an analytical point of view, one of the main concerns expressed in the Australian land degradation paper was the scarcity of uniformly classified land degradation information and lack of integrated environmental and economic information upon which to base environmental-economic assessments of the implications of land degradation. My co-author and myself worked very hard with data from several agencies to complete our project. A project at an international level to guide improvements in the quality and comprehensiveness of environmental-economic information in the field of agricultural soil quality would seem to be most worthwhile in the light of our experience. In terms of government involvement in land management issues, the case for improving analysis appears strong. I wish to draw your attention to a couple of concepts and definitions in our paper that you might find of use and to make a comment about the coverage of an undertaking to improve analytical and policy making capabilities. First, we define land degradation as \"...the decline in the biological productivity or usefulness of land resources for their current predominant intended use caused through the use of the land by humans\" (p.27). It seemed to us that land can have many uses and to provide an anchor, degradation needs to be defined in respect of some use. This concept is implicit in scales of \"soil condition\" which should form the basis of any internationally accepted set of soil quality indicators. Second, after studying quite a few analyses and published statements of the economic effects of land degradation in Australia, we distinguished between the: ",
        "7\u00a1 1) Production equivalent of degradation, that is, the production revenue measured in a currency unit of degradation. The production equivalent can be represented as a \"cost\" of degradation. Such measures seem to be most popular in reports on the extent of degradation that focus on the purely negative side of degradation; and 2) The costs and benefits of amelioration of degradation. Such measures may be positive or negative. This possibility will be recognised, as a standard finding in the economics of renewable resources which is applicable to many, but not all, forms of land degradation (p.44). The key point of the analysis is that land degradation is something that can be controlled by the land manager who is making optimising decisions about the costs and benefits of higher or lower levels of degradation. This kind of analysis may not be acceptable to those who emphasise the need for preserving land in a certain physical condition. Perhaps the framework ultimately developed will help policy makers navigate around alternative approaches to assessing the importance of differing land conditions. A major problem is that different values may apply to different uses and that the value for any one use will differ with the circumstances of land use. In some circumstances, it may be optimal to mine the land (eg just before subdivision for urban use), in other circumstances it may be optimal to maintain some steady state level of degradation, and so on. I therefore see a need to develop a program for reporting the condition of land in particular regions and allow environmental-economic analysis to trace out the effects of that condition on activity levels. For example, in our paper, we provided an empirical study of the effects of land degradation in the Australian State of New South Wales. There is also a need to focus on institutional issues such as: impediments to farmers making optimal decisions in farming, the evaluation of the externalities of intensive land use in agriculture, and the evaluation of the amenity value of land resources including its value as sink for environmental waste. In my view, standard indicators of soil quality and methods to measure and analyse the effects of variations in soil should take into account the institutional issues important to effective land management. I hope that these few comments make some contribution to the development of international standard relating to soil quality and agricultural land management.

ISCO is an independent organisation that promotes international exchange on the science, technology, policy, and application of land and water conservation. Soil and water are critical natural resources that sustain human life and the lives of all other creatures on our planet. The careful husbandry of these natural resources is essential to world food security and environmental protection. When used in sustainable ways, soil and water produce the food, forestry, and fiber products that we all depend upon, and they will do so indefinitely. Sustainable use of these resources also is essential to socially, economically, and ecologically viable communities. It is imperative, therefore, that we invest adequately in research, the development of new technologies and the effective transfer of those technologies. These are the roots of sound science on which the sustainable use of soil and water resources is based. Sound science also supports sound conservation policy, which is the basis for local action. It is the local action, either at the community, farm or ranch level, that yields land stewardship that will sustain our \"global farm\". Thus, the theme of the 10th ISCO is \"SUSTAINING THE GLOBAL FARM: Local Action for Land Stewardship\". The Meting Focus The defining characteristics of ISCO is its \"inclusiveness.\" Thus, the scope of the conference may encompass, but is not limited to, the following: \u2022 Science and technology for conservation \u00b7 Soil survey and natural resource assessment for planning and assessment; environmental protection; \u2022 Socioeconomic elements of land and water \u00b7 Conservation policy: a basis for action; conservation \u25a0 Conservation action: sustaining our land and water; There will be oral and poster presentations. One page abstracts are required by September 1, 1998. Guidelines for preparing the abstracts and papers will sent to those who express their interest in participation. ",

AGENDA 21 of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED 1992) emphasized the need for and proposes a wide range of activities to address land degradation in general and desertification in particular. Although much has been said and written about land degradation, there is still much conjecture on the subject as few countries have developed the techniques to measure degradation and subsequently develop spatial or other databases which enable the quantification of the process. Some of the immediate needs include: \u2022 improved procedures to assess degradation at different scales- global, national, and local; \u2022 evaluation of resilience capacities of land and methods to implement the concept; \u2022 development of indicators of land degradation for use at all planning levels; \u2022 development of mitigating technologies, and \u2022 assisting development and implementation of appropriate national policies. The First International Conference organized in Adana, Turkey (June 10-14, 1996), expressed the need to evaluate the science of land degradation. This was in response to the very high amounts of donor funds allocated to address land degradation without adequate information of the kinds, degree, and extent of the degradation problem prevailing in the country. In some instances, as the causes of degradation are not well appreciated, corrective measures through such bi-lateral projects have minimal impact. Land Degradation science is the domain of soil scientists. However, the processes are human induced and consequently social sciences and the understanding of socioeconomic factors causing the degradation is an important factor in developing mitigating technologies. There are also examples of situations where poor national land use policies have accelerated erosion and decline in quality of the soil. Land degradation science is thus an excellent example of the need to integrate, not only the sub-disciplines of soil science but also other disciplines including the policy arena. The 2nd International Conference is organized to address some or all of these issues. The purpose of the conference stems from the fact that: ",
        "74 \u2022 sustainable development requires an active national program of natural resource conservation and management; \u2022 sustainable land management, of which soil, water, and nutrient management are the most critical components, contributes to food security and income generation; \u2022 a partial solution to the problem of addressing land degradation includes providing information to decision makers which enables them to make assessments on locations and rates of degradation and target appropriate technology; \u2022 through the collection of vital quantitative data on all aspects of degradation and their use in information technology, a powerful tool becomes available for decision making; \u2022 the larger goal of making agriculture friendly to the environment, is only attained by appropriate land management. The conference will be organized around technical presentations, poster sessions, and working group discussions on the following topics: \u2022 Tools for identification, assessment, and monitoring \u00b7 Mitigating technologies - conservation tillage - identification - ecosystem based management - processes, resilience characteristics of land systems - water quantity and quality \u2022 use of information technologies Food security, biodiversity, and \u2022 application of system models environmental impacts \u25a0 Land cover and land use - quality of life - deforestation, shifting cultivation - environmental friendly agriculture - urban and peri-urban linkages \u00b7 Effects of global climate change - soil pollution - soil conditions -mismatch between agricultural systems and ecosystems conditions \u2022 Land management and land use policies \u00b7 Research and development issues -economics of land degradation - early warning indicators - societal role - monitoring networks -indigenous knowledge -policy framework To obtain subsequent circular letters and further information on the conference, contact Mr. Charoen Charoenchamratcheep Department of Land Development Phaholyothin Road, Chatuchak, Bangkok, 10900, THAILAND Fax: + 662-579 2902, email: VEARASIL@mozart.inet.co.th ",

        "77 LETTER FROM THE EDITOR A recent article in Nature 111 attempts to estimate the annual value of the services that Earth's ecosystems provide. Though the words economics and ecology share a common root, yet for many years their practitioners had little to do with each other. This is perhaps the basic problem of us, the earth scientists, who have feared to quantitatively and monetarily evaluate soil resources. Costanza et al. argue rightly that the services of ecological systems and the natural capital stocks that produce them are critical to the functioning of the Earth's life-support system. They have been brave enough to estimate this value and indicate that the current economic value of 17 ecosystem services of 16 biomes is in the range of US$ 16-54 trillion per year. The value of the global gross national product is around US$ 18 trillion per year. The numbers are mind boggling but I suspect that the magnitudes are real. If we accept this, then are we killing the goose (land resources) that has been laying the golden eggs (land based services) through mismanaging the land. We must start to talk about land degradation in these economic terms and develop good databases to support our cause. We have been Pedologists too long and perhaps it is time to reorient our actions towards implementation. Soil scientists define Soil Quality as the ability of the soil to perform certain functions such as manage water and nutrients etc. This is a good definition but it is good only for soil scientists, o be useful, we should define Soil Quality as the ability of soils to provide goods and services. This attaches an economic value to soils by which we can compare one soil to another, we can use it to determine the changes that may take place with time, and we can determine the best use of the soil given the different options that are available. The value of the soil is one component required to determine the value of the ecosystem. If sustainable agriculture is preserving, protecting and/or enhancing the quality of the resource base, then we need a value factor to measure sustainability. Have we ever valued soil? Some of us may have relative measures but generally in capitalistic societies, market forces determine or at least place a nominal value for a soil. I never paid serious attention to the question until recently, when I was in Bulgaria and was asked this question. In a centrally controlled economy, as was Bulgaria, value for land was perhaps not necessary as land belonged to the State. However, with privatization, the question becomes critical. With no market economy yet to have a handle on relative values, is their another basis for making this value judgment? How can soil maps and soil surveys provide assistance? Is soil quality a basis for this kind of assessment and if so, is there sufficient information on soil quality to enable these countries to make the assessments? These are real questions which we soil scientists must wake up to and help provide answers. What does all these got to do with land degradation? A whole lot!. If we do not know how to value the land, we do not know if it is degrading or aggrading or sitting still. If we do not know how to differentiate between lands we cannot provide an estimate of the relative rates of degradation and we will have a lesser appreciation of their resilience. Regretfully, this is the status quo today. Soil science literature is saturated with papers on land degradation and there are also estimates of human-induced land degradation. How real are these numbers? They are perhaps real because the United Nations ",
        "78 Environment Program (UNEP) and the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) frequently cite these numbers to obtain more funds to address these problems. Over the last year or so, I conducted a totally unscientific poll on knowledge of land degradation. Whenever I was in the field, with persons of long experience and experts on soils, I posed the question, \"is this soil degraded?\" This was foliowed-up with, is it natural or human induced degradation and also at what rate is the soil degrading. The experience is usually exasperating. One quickly finds that there is usually no basis or weak justification for the observations, there are no investigations and so no data, and that the state of the knowledge is theoretical what is written by established gurus of soil science. It is time to be more down-to-earth. This is indeed a sad situation. The society has finally become aware of the environment. Politicians are willing to address this issue. The international community is willing to invest in some of these activities. But the soil scientists are not meeting the challenge. Or, are we? Write to us and give us your opinion. We are interested to hear from you on: Can you or your institute confidently make a soil degradation map of your country? Do you have estimates of rates of degradation? Do you know the resilience capacity of your soils - at what rate and to what extent will they revert to their initial levels of production? What is the value of the land in your country? Is it important to know this? Does the value change with degradation and how do you establish this? How do you assess soil quality? Is there a need for an internationally accepted unified system of soil quality assessment? Are these areas where training will help? What specific aspects of land degradation will a training course contribute to? While we are worrying about soils on earth, the intelligent rover of Pathfinder was looking at soils on the Red Planet Mars. Watching the images from Mars reminded me of my many treks on the deserts of the world. NASA scientists suggest that there may have been water on Mars and the landscape which Pathfinder recorded was developed by torrential flow. What happened to the water? Was there desertification on Mars and what triggered that? The International Task Force on Land Degradation of the ISSS (i.e., us) has been working slowly due to the fact that we have been hampered by our inability to obtain any funds to support our work. The international organisations such as FAO, UNDP, UNEP etc., do not even acknowledge our letters. They are all involved in global problems such as desertification and sustainable development and perhaps in their view, what we are doing is trivial and unimportant. We are indeed very grateful to many of the Turkish institutions (specifically \u00c7ukurova University) and the British Council who funded this Newsletter. We will keep prodding and we need your support. One way you can support us is to contribute to this Newsletter by submitting articles. The reader will note that the 1 st and this Newsletter is heavy with articles by Task Force Committee Members. We want to change this by having contributions from you. The Task Force has a temporary Web site, now housed at the web site of USDA NRCS. You can access us at, \"http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/worldsoils/\". Once you have accessed us, you ",
        "79 can save it in your bookmark so that you can reach us any time. The plans for the 2 nd Workshop are well under way and the Thais are doing a great job in making the preparations. The Task Force is working with them to develop the program. They have produced a first brochure (write to them to get a copy; see their announcement in this issue). We are also making some progress in obtaining funds to develop the monograph, \"Guidelines for land degradation assessment\". The British Council has indicated that it will provide some assistance. Once, this activity comes on line, we will need your assistance. In this second issue of the Newsletter, we have decided to include a Lead Paper. The paper is of general interest and of course related to the functions of the Task Force. In future issues, we would like to continue with this approach and we welcome your published papers to be considered for inclusion here. If you send us a paper, please include a floppy disc with the text using Microsoft Word or Word Perfect. Finally, if you have something to say on land degradation or related subjects and want it said in this Newsletter, send it to us by the end of January 1998. Keep visiting the web site for more information. Soon we hope to set up a dedicated web site for the Task Force. We like to leave you with the following anecdote and hope it will help you to work with us. Many years ago, a shoe company sent two of their salespersons to a country to look for opportunities for the business. Some time later, they cabled back their boss. One said, \"No business here . Natives don't wear shoes\". The other said, \"Great opportunity here . Natives don't wear shoes\". LEAD PAPER OPPORTUNITIES FOR SOIL SCIENCE IN A MILIEU OF REDUCED FUNDS 12 ' In the last two decades a dramatic change has taken place in our thinking about research and development for agriculture in general and utilisation of the natural resources in particular. Slowly but certainly, even in the poorer third world countries, there is an increasing awareness for ecosystem health, maintaining the quality of the environment, and rates of resource consumption. In many countries, most dramatically in the affluent countries of the world, national priorities for environmental management are in place and donor countries that provided assistance to the developing world are requiring that this is sine que non for development assistance. The rationale for this is that environmental transcends national boundaries coupled to the less convincing but valid argument that environment and quality of life are inter-linked. The concept of sustainable development initiated by the Bruntlandt Commission (WCED, 1987) and amplified by agenda 21 promulgated by the United Nations Conference for Environment and Development (UNCED, 1992) have been the driving force in the new attitudes. Research funds in virtually all science disciplines are now scarce, and becoming scarcer. Koshland (1990) eloquently described that cries of alarm will not translate into an increase in funding without concerted action on the part of scientists. In his view, Koshland indicated that the world needs major expansion of investigator-initiated science, as in the past, to open new frontiers. First, we need to find out how science can contribute to make the world a better place, and then organize the scientific efforts to carry out the task. We need to build our research strategies toward solving problems, and persuade the decision-making bodies, or the public at large, to invest money in research. We must ",
        "8\u03bf provide the rationale, and not allow the funding agencies to dictate research topics from top to bottom (Hillel 1993). Some observers believe that all or most applied research should be funded by industry. Cerf (1996) suggests that this cannot be in the context of Wall Street thirst for quarterly profit. Support for applied and basic research is one of the most highly leveraged investments that any government can make. The fact that all developed countries are not only self sufficient in agriculture but have also surpluses for export and further, in addition to significant increases in productivity there has also been a similar enhancement in the quality of the produce, testifies to the role and impact of well funded and coordinated research. Soil science is one of the basic sciences that provide the above mentioned enviable progress in food security. The accomplishments of plant breeders and bio-technologists have been lauded in contributing to the impressive increases in crop performance. The role of soil scientists, on the other hand, is frequently not recognized, despite the fact that they have had a small but significant contribution to the achievements. Part of the reason is due to the fact that the role of soil management technology is not obvious and perhaps also due to the fact that soil scientists have not been successful in glorifying their contributions. Wth the greater awareness to address the environment and the notions of sustainable agriculture, there is a thrust to make agriculture more environmentally friendly. Soil scientists who take up this challenge and make the paradigm shift in research and development are beginning to see the rewards of their approach. However, traditional approaches are well ingrained and changes in mind-set and research approaches have not taken place to the desired extend to respond to the new needs. In a few cases, this has resulted in frustration and disillusionment. In this article, some of the more significant problems in soil science are reviewed, as part of the process of meeting the current challenges and inviting readers to respond. Three recent publications address some of these issues and explore opportunities : 1) A special issue published by the journal, Soil Science (1991), 2) Opportunities in basic soil science research (Sposito and Reginato, 1992), and 3) The role of Soil Science in interdisciplinary research (Wagenet et al. 1995). As indicated by Rose (1981) we should not selectively ignore vital aspects and concentrate on only one or a few simple features in science, as if those were the whole. This is a formula for failure. Role of Soil Science Soils are among the most significant group of natural resources on earth. As early as 1862 Friedrich Albert Fallon wrote (Sparks 1988) that \"there is nothing in the whole nature which is more important or deserves much attention as the soil. Truly it is the soil which makes the world a friendly environment for mankind. It is the soil which nourishes and provides for the whole of nature, the whole of creation depends on the soil which is the ultimate foundation of our existence\". In a similar vein, Professor J. H. Ellis, in a report entitled \"The Soils of Manitoba\", wrote that \"the soil, formed by life, continues as the supporter of life\" (Ellis, 1938). Despite the fact that soils are an important component of the environment, the attention given to soils from the viewpoint of research and development funds, does not match its significance. There is an apparent perception that much is already known about soils and that generalisations made for one site ",
        "Si are applicable everywhere. There is also a failure to recognize that agriculture is one of the major 'stressors\" of environment and if this attitude prevails, we will have major catastrophes in the near future. Hunger and malnutrition and the deterioration of the environment are the two important international problems that mankind faces today (Brady, 1990). Several proposals were made during the 15th World Congress of Soil Science, in Acapulco, Mexico, July 1994 (Bouma, 1994a), clearly reminding us that soil science has a crucial role in developing sustainable land management systems for food production. The current focus on agricultural production needs to be broadened to include research on food security (including a clean and healthy food), ecosystems (to understand the role of soils in ecological processes), soil quality in relation to water quality, land use and soil degradation ( Moss, 1959; Miller, 1993). As guardians of the soil, soil scientists are uniquely placed to participate in environmental programs and specifically those that deal with land degradation. One commendable international effort is that under the International Geosphere Biosphere Program (Roots, 1994) of the International Council of Scientific Unions. Integrating the Science The tendency to become highly specialized with sub-disciplines, such as soil biology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, pedology and so on (Wild, 1989) is tempting and is a necessary process in the development of the science. However, integrating the different components and synthesizing the information for consumption by users, particularly decision makers, is equally important and is also a science. Explaining a process or phenomenon is frequently considered as the endpoint of most sciences. As our science is ultimately linked to use and management of the soil resource, the end point of soil science research is attained when the research findings are translated into policy options. This requirement demands different skills, most important of which is the ability to integrate information and communicate this in a non-technical manner to end-users. In most university curricula there is insufficient or few opportunities to be trained in this area. We should all be holistic at heart and in perspective, even though developments in science require some degree of specialization. Gardner, (1991) suggests that we are not effectively weaving the different sub-disciplines together, and that more attention must be given to this integration. There is a strong need to promote such interdisciplinary efforts commencing with a better grounding on the fundamentals (chemistry, physics, biology, geology, and mathematics), as suggested by Warkentin (1992) and Gardner (1993). The training should emphasize the ecological context of soils, not only the landscape approach to soil genesis and evolution but also the ecosystem approach to soil use and management. A major paradigm shift will be to change the emphasis from the farm and farmer to the ecosystem or a unit of the ecosystem (water-shed) in technical assistance and technology transfer activities. This does not imply that the farmer and his farm are no more important, but recognizes the fact that the farm is an integral part of the ecosystem and the farmer and society is better served if agriculture is viewed in the context of the system. The same notion may be extended to regional and eventually the global ",
        "82 context as environment has no national borders. To be effective, it requires many disciplines talking to each other (Barinaga, 1994); to have a successful agricultural program requires full participation of the stakeholders. Issues and Challenges Development of new agricultural technologies and a better appreciation of the existing but underutilized knowledge of resource management will be crucial in meeting the ecological needs and in achieving the anticipated food demands of the growing population in the future. The greatest challenge for the coming decades lies in the fact that the production environment is unstable and degrading and the balance between intensive and extensive agriculture is precarious. Experience over the past 20 years has shown that mismatch between crop production methods and resource characteristics has led to decline in soil fertility, increased soil losses, disturbed hydrologicai balance, and a buildup of pests and diseases. The sustainability of agriculture in developing countries and particularly under-stressed semi-arid environments is thus under a serious threat. The issues of sustainability are well enunciated in the countless publications and meetings held globally and, thus, there is a general understanding (and some misunderstanding) of the challenges. The generic causes of unsustainability and the difficulties of implementing programs to institute sustainability are also well debated. There is, however, a significant knowledge gap in rates and magnitudes of degradation resulting in the stresses and consequently early warning indicators for mitigating the stresses so as to prevent their onset, are hampered. Sustainability requires a holistic approach to agriculture: one that consider both temporal and spatial variations. This then demands information and knowledge of rates and magnitudes of degradation processes, along with indicators and threshold values for not only impending collapse of system but also for diagnosis of system impairment; the response of the system to ameliorating measures; and the resource specific technologies required to halt or reverse the unsustainability trends. The following is an elaboration of the areas where soil science has and should play an important role in meeting these challenges. Land Degradation The FAO/UNESCO/UNEP 'Global Assessment of Soil Degradation' provides data, albeit somewhat subjective, to quantify the current magnitude of soil degradation problem and there are other analyses on these and other aspects of environmental degradation. Although the underlying causes of land/water degradation are socio-economic, changes to these factors will not automatically restore productivity of the biophysical resource base, if it is not maintained. Thus, critical importance attaches to soil and water management to ensure that production of food, fuel and fiber can be sustained and the environment protected. Efforts to restore productivity to these lands must be coupled with efforts to recognize productive capacity of all soil resources and the ability to flag all stresses before productivity is significantly impaired. ",
        "S3 Causes for stressed systems are numerous and include removal of nutrients, development of acidity, salinization, alkalinization, destruction of soil structure, accelerated wind and water erosion, and loss of organic matter. In some regions of the world, the combination of some or all of these, results in such degradation that the term desertification is popularly used to describe these regions. Finally, it must be appreciated that there is an important interaction of the causes of degradation. Erosion, for example, may be flagged as the major problem, whereas chemical degradation of the soil prevents establishment of vegetation and hence the ability of the soil to stabilize against erosion. In this example, lack of appropriate vegetation becomes an early warning indicator. Very few studies have been conducted on this linkage between factors, and there is an urgent need to look into this. Land degradation, either natural or induced by humans, is an important concern affecting the wealth of nations, food security, and is impacting the livelihood of almost every person on this earth (Eswaran and Beinroth, 1996). AGENDA 21 of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED, 1992) emphasizes the need to and proposes a wide range of activities to address land degradation in general and desertification in particular. Although much has been said and written about land degradation there is still much conjecture about the information due to the fact that few countries have really developed the techniques to measure degradation and subsequently develop spatial or other databases which enables the quantification of the process. Some of the immediate needs include: Improved procedures to address degradation at different scales-global, national, and local, evaluation of resilience capacities of land and methods to implement the concept, and development of indicators of land degradation for use at all planning levels. From an agricultural standpoint of view, land use is a major cause of declining soil quality. Many countries around the world, due to population pressure, are stressing their limited land resources. It should be emphasized that, land degradation is not only merely an agricultural problem but has ramifications in all aspects of society. Food security is directly related to the ability of land to support the population. A recent International Conference organized in Adana, Turkey (June 10-14' 1996), expressed the need to evaluate the science of land degradation. This was in response to the very high amounts of donor funds allocated to address desertification without adequate information of the kinds, degree, and extent of the degradation problem prevailing in the country. In some instances, as the causes of degradation are not well appreciated, corrective measures through such bi-lateral projects have minimal impact. Land degradation science is the domain of soil scientists. However, the processes are human induced and consequently social sciences and the understanding of socioeconomic factors causing the degradation is an important factor in developing mitigating technologies. There are also examples of situations where poor land use policies have accelerated erosion and decline in quality of the soil. Land degradation science is, thus, an excellent example of the need to integrate, not only sub- disciplines of soil science but also other disciplines including the policy arena. However, to enable land users and policy makers to pay more attention to land degradation, it is necessary to make assessments on the monetary value of degradation (Eswaran and Dumanski, 1994). Soil scientists have traditionally shunned away from the economics of their technology and this has to change. ",
        "84 Soil Quality and Sustainable Agriculture Soil quality has been difficult to define and quantify (Doran et al. 1994). Soil quality may be considered to be the enduring capability of a soil to function effectively within an ecosystem, by accepting, storing and recycling water, energy, and nutrients. Functions of a soil include not only those related to crop productions, but others such as partitioning of precipitation into runoff, stored moisture, and ground water, and acting as environmental buffer (Warkentin, 1994). Concepts such as these may help to bridge the gap separating the more practical, production related concepts of soil health (Acton and Gregorich, 1995) and more broadly based concepts of ecosystem health. A recent publication, entitled the Health of our Soils, is a comprehensive treatment of the current state of Canada's soil and related resources, and illustrates the work of long-term monitoring, comprehensive assessments and simulation models in that endeavour (Acton and Gregorich, 1995). Pedology has made and will continue to make significant contribution to sustainable land management (Bouma, 1994b; Dumanski et al. 1992). Agronomy News (1996) has published answers to 57 questions asked by the USA Congressional Agricultural Committee. The article indicates that \"the USA Federal Government has the responsibility in managing the nation's natural resources, ensuring an adequate food supply and maintaining the general health and safety of its citizenry\". This means clearly that soil scientists now have new opportunities to develop strategies. This is a declaration of society's role as steward of the natural resources and the commitment of society to fund this role. The participation of soil scientists in this challenge is evident and the two major areas in which soil science provides the leadership are: 1. The generation, mobilization and integration of environmental data and process knowledge for scientific land-use planning that takes full advantage of the latest advances in information science, indigenous knowledge, and digital information technology; 2. A shift in research imperatives to future-oriented issues, such as the identification of indices of sustainable land management, and the long term on-site and off-site consequences of agricultural practices. Environmental Pollution The majority of pollutants (heavy metals and persistent organic pesticides-POPs) that are added to air, water and land ultimately reaches the soil; some may reach the oceans. Therefore, all environmental studies need fundamental understanding of soil system, from atomic to global levels. The soil science community has made major inroads in this area of research, particularly in collaboration with organic chemists (Sawhney and Brown, 1989). The increasing environmental consciousness and the willingness of society to reduce such pollution and/or fund clean-up activities suggests important funding for research and development activities. The ability of soils to retain, alter, and transmit such pollutants needs quantification and with the variety of pollutants coming on line, there will considerable work to be conducted in this area. ",
        "85 Trace elements, some of which are toxic above the threshold levels, may be added to the soil, inadvertently in chemicals such as fertilizers, or intentionally in the case of land application of sewage sludge. The ultimate fate of these pollutants, and the interactions with the food chains are not well known (Mermut et al. 1996). The current levels of pollutant trace metals have become stressful to a large number of sensitive flora and fauna (Nriagu, 1990). The safety levels are not applicable universally and most of them are valid only for specific sites. It should be realized that soils are dynamic and changes are rapid. We should look more closely to the development of methods to alter the soil colloidal-behaviour to neutralize the organic pollutants entering the soil system (Boyd and Janes, 1994). The fate of organic wastes, namely degradation, movement to aquatic systems, and their influence on plant health and quality need to be closely studied. We need to develop methods regarding toxic cleanup. Bioremediation appears to be one of the interesting research directions to clean organic and metal pollutants from the soil (Moffat, 1995; Skipper and Turco, 1995). A large number of methodologies have been made available with respect to treatment of contaminated soils (Noyes Data Corporation, 1991). Success of these technologies depends on how much is known about the soil system and interaction of soil colloids with specific pollutants. The United States budget highlights, as published in the March 22 issue of Science 1996 (p. 1658), show big increases for the Environmental Protection Agency. This may be a good news for soil scientists interested in environmental research. Carbon - agronomic and environmental significance Carbon is a basic component of life and has very important functions in the soil. Management of soil organic matter and interaction with minerals and living components of soils are not only important for agriculture, but also for quality of the environment. Though farmers value it, society in general has not been willing to pay for its conservation. We need to determine the monetary value of a unit quantity of soil organic carbon. This will aid considerably not only the development of appropriate sequestration policies but also create the necessary awareness among policy makers regarding the benefits of funding such research. In the last decade, increasing realization of the C0 2 build-up in the atmosphere and the threat of global warming has instigated society to find means to reduce the atmospheric C0 2 content. One way to overcome this problem is the sequestration of carbon in soils and funds are being released for research with this objective. Mitigation technologies to sequester carbon in soils has beneficial effect in both agronomic and environmental aspects. There is an urgent need to enhance research to increase below-ground biomass and this is an example of a research area with multiple benefits. As a consequence, research on crop residue management is now considered a legitimate research area under the framework of global climate change studies. The importance of soil carbon in the earth's carbon cycle has involved soil scientists in several climate change reports and discussions. It is important that soil scientists assume their rightful place in research of this kind, working closely with others representing the atmospheric, earth, and biological ",
        "8 b\" sciences. If soil scientists do not participate in such work and contribute the soil's component to solve the puzzle, someone else will. There have been attempts to estimate global organic carbon and its cycle (Buringh, 1984). More accurate estimation of global carbon pools need to be established (Eswaran et al. 1993) to control atmospheric C0 2 . It has been recently established that, in addition to other factors, the nature of soil minerals play a significant role in oxidizing soil organic matter. The equilibrium of carbon on earth, with respect to food production and the greenhouse effect, requires management of organic matter in soils. A better understanding of terrestrial carbon reservoirs has benefits in areas other than in soil conservation and fertility alone. Studies of carbon should include the role of microbial processes and basic research on microbial populations. The use of new technologies such as stable isotopes, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), high- resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), pyrolysis mass spectrometry, Fourier-transform infrared spectrometry, gas-liquid chromatography, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and others provide tremendous opportunity to study and widen our understanding on organic matter. Under the umbrella of global climate change research, soil scientists have an opportunity to use these and other tools to better understand the carbon cycle. Pedology Daniels (1988) has written that \"until the field relations are known, a soil sample is just a bag of dirt\". Pedology, that branch of soil science which deals with soil in its natural setting and as a product of its environment over the ages, must contribute to this knowledge of soils. As mentioned above, pedology is essential to define quality and sustainable land management system. Pedologists, however, must draw upon the experience and expertise of other earth scientists, contributing to that complete knowledge so essential to understanding the complex and interconnected system of which soils are an integral part. Restriction of our study to one or two meter soil profile will isolate soil science from other associated sciences. To understand the complex soil system, soil scientists must go beyond this self-imposed limit to better understand the vertical and horizontal processes taking place on the landscape. Salinization is an example that shows how geology and hydrology influence the formation of saline and sodic soils. Soil scientists should be proactive in their research work yielding unique and valuable information to interdisciplinary initiatives. Soil scientists, in cooperation with others, should look to deep ocean floors to establish the pattern of sediment transport from terrestrial land with time. We should remember that we are not only agricultural scientists, but we are also earth scientists (Nielsen, 1987; Wild 1989). Soil resource assessment and monitoring is entering a new era, due to changing needs of users information, costs, and especially quality of information. The soil science community has now an unique opportunity to respond to these changing demands (Eswaran and Dumanski, 1994). Arnold (1966) believes that a major role of resource assessment will be to minimize the risk for persons using soil survey information and that this becomes the undertaking of new joint ventures in a search for ",
        "&7 relevancy. Arnold suggests that estimates of accuracy and precision with indication of levels of confidence be included, as additional information in resource assessments to minimize consumer risks and improve acceptance of information. Weiss et al. (1993) provide a very good example how information on soil stratigraphy can assist to reconstruct the paleoenvironment of human civilization and land use systems. Many articles demonstrate how paleosols can be interpreted in the context of environmental change (Arnold et al. 1990). This once again supports the view that we need to give more attention to interdisciplinary research to accomplish our task as soil scientists. Plant Nutrients A large body of information is now available on plant nutrients in soils. However, we need to continue to understand nutrient cycles, including micronuthents, at global levels. For example, the lack of Ca and PO4 in many leached tropical soils has, in addition to the nutrient limiting effects on crop growth, also implications on water use efficiency. The scarcity of large mammals in tropical America is attributed to the lack of these two nutrients (Sanchez and Buoi, 1975) and biotic composition of the soils is controlled by the presence or absence of certain nutrients. While there are large resources of N and K on earth, however, the amount of \u03a1 in nature is very restricted and many soils are naturally deficient. Nutrients are becoming recognized as capital and the World Bank is embarking on a new program to \"Re-capitalize soil fertility\" in Africa. This belated recognition that makes it good economic sense to finance fertilizers for the poor farmers of Africa is a recognition of the message of soil fertility experts for more than two decades. Processes of diffusion and mass flow of the nutrients in the rhizosphere are well established (Barber, 1984). However, it is now established that each plant has its own influence on the immediate root environment, suggesting further research for understanding of root rhizosphere. Physiological factors of plants related various environmental stress conditions, such as nutrient deficiency and toxicity, drought, salinity, and high light and temperature, are not well established and deserve further research. There is still a lot of room for development of methodology. Recent developments to measure ion supply rate, using \u00a1on exchange resin membrane is interesting (Qian and Schoenau, 1995). This approach represents a unique and promising tool for use in soil fertility and soil quality- related research. In spite of the successes of the \"green revolution\" a major gap still exist between the genetic potential of crops and yield levels (although a major effort has been made, and is continuing to increase the genetic potential of crops for both favourable and less favourable environments) there is little evidence that the gap is closing. Frequently the yields are below the potential of traditional varieties and certainly below those of improved varieties. Poor soil, water, and nutrient management (SWNM) is frequently the cause of this (Greenland et al, 1994). The problems of SWNM are not only the most general limitations to food production, they are also the most serious source of environmental degradation. The report on the expansion of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research states (TAC 1993, p.11), \"the past neglect of research on conservation and management of ",
        "88 natural resources must be addressed and higher priority given to both technical and socioeconomic aspects of sustainability.\" It is evident that manipulating the plant should go hand-in-hand with manipulating the soil for enhanced performance. Soil fertility research is an integral part of the quest for sustainable agriculture, but the classical \"rate and date\" research must be supplemented by innovative work complementing soil-weather-crop simulation models. Sustainablity also calls for stability of production and like many aspects of agricultural research, long term experiments where all factors are monitored and analyzed is central to future research. Designing such experiments and convincing decision makers to commit funds for extended periods are challenges and obstacles to be overcome. Conclusion The current funding constraints to agriculture in general and soil science in particular, is expected to continue into the new millennia even though there were valid reasons for the kinds of research conducted in soil science during the last few decades. Such research has also contributed to food surpluses in many countries, which in turn enabled these countries to transfer their efforts to building up industries and all of which has cumulatively contributed to a general better quality of life. However, much of this was also achieved at significant environmental costs which has forced society to move away from productivity to the more rational goal of sustainability. This paradigm shift was given the political impetus by the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED, 1992) and resulting document, AGENDA 21. Within the short span of five years since UNCED, a quite revolution propelled by funding restrictions is focusing research institutions and scientists to re-evaluate their research priorities and frame them under new vision and mission statements. Those who made the efforts have benefited from the re-invention/re-engineering efforts that have taken place in particularly all countries. In this paper an attempt is made to highlight some issues and show where soil scientists can exploit the situation and make positive contributions. The explosion of information technology has provided additional tools for soil scientists to use and benefit from. Soil scientists are uniquely placed to use Geographic Information Systems and simulation models (Wang et al. 1990), if they will make an effort to become conversant with these technologies. The soil scientists of the world, in response to urgent questions of environmental sustainability, ecosystem health, and global change, have embarked on an exciting period of integrated science to which soil is central. Soil scientists must take their rightful place in contributing to that integrated science, tapping into the funding opportunities that are becoming available. To benefit from these opportunities, soil science must also better package their outputs so that the customers appreciate the value of the goods and services being provided. As the world will eventually have to feed 10 billion people, much of the as yet underutilized land in the tropics (where much of the population increases will take place) and a few other parts of the world will have to be brought under cultivation. Can there be sustainable agriculture on these lands? The four basic causes of land degradation - overgrazing on rangeland, over-cultivation of cropland, water- ",
        "8 9 logging and salinization of irrigated land, and deforestation- all result from poor management of the land and can, therefore, at least in principle, be controlled. The record to date, however, is quite poor. The alternative to sustainable agriculture is degradation of the resource base, loss of biodiversity, environmental pollution, reduction of the population supporting capacity for man or beast, and a general decrease in the quality of life for all living things on this planet. The choice is apparent; we have an obligation to be innovative and proactive. In conclusion, we believe that the future of soil science is stronger than before and the demand for soil scientists will be grater than before. However, for this to happen, soil science must make some fundamental changes in its approach and emphasis. This can be achieved without compromising the science and the credibility of the scientist.

Elizabeth Shelton State Department, Washington DC MEETINGS, WORKSHOPS ETC. Development of Guidelines for the Selection of indicators for Sustainable Land Management: Summary of the International Workshop^ Wilhelm-Kempf-Haus, Naurod, Germany May 13-151997 BACKGROUND Sustainable land management (SLM) is a key element of AGENDA 21's goal of sustainable development. The promotion of SLM has, therefore, become a prime task of development co operation and figures amongst the set of objectives of most agricultural and resource management projects. The claim for SLM calls for appropriate indicators and monitoring & evaluation instruments. Without operational definitions and indicators of project impact SLM is not more than an attractive but empty phrase. The problem which project managers are facing is not the lack of indicators, but the difficulty to select an appropriate set of indicators reflecting changes in land quality without complicated, expensive and time consuming monitoring and evaluation procedures. Data generated should assist in decision making, i.e., provide information required by project managers or government officials. For this purpose guidelines for the selection of appropriate indicators and monitoring methods manageable with the available human and financial resources could be helpful. Wherever possible, land users should participate in the process, bringing in their local knowledge. The impact of project activities or land management methods on land quality becomes manifest, often, only after the phasing out of the project. That is why monitoring needs to be continued by the partner organizations or the land users. This is, however, only possible, if relatively simple and cost-efficient monitoring methods are applied. ",
        "93 World-wide, development agencies are working on topics related to SLM. The idea to gather a critical mass of SLM experts came out of the inter-institutional link between GTZ and CDE. Both partners are, together with Swiss NGOs and GOs, involved in a working group for the elaboration of tools for the assessment of impacts of project activities on SLM. Apparently this is an issues of interest for many development agencies, as quite a number of agencies and consultants were prepared to participate in a common workshop. ORGANIZATION AND OBJECTIVES The workshop was organized by GTZ and the Swiss Development Co-operation (SDC) through the Sustainable Soil Management Pilot-project and the Center for Development and Environment, respectively. The organizers aimed at opening a joint GTZ and SDC initiative for other interested institutions. The overall objective of this initiative is to provide the management of development projects with guidelines on how to monitor and evaluate both short and long-term impacts of development activities an the livelihood of local people and their environment. Objectives of this first workshop were to elaborate a framework for the guidelines and to plan the follow-up process of editing and testing the guidelines. It was not intended to define new indicators, but to make use of the existing knowledge and experience of indicators and appropriate monitoring methods. WORKSHOP PARTICIPANTS Roland Bunch (COSECHA, Honduras); Ingo Binnewerg (GTZ, Germany); An\u00f4r Fiorini de Carvalho (Fed. Univ. of Vi\u00e7osa, Departamento de Solos, BRAZIL), Malcolm Douglas (Consultant, ENGLAND), Julian Dumanski (The World Bank, USA), Hari Eswaran (World Soil Resources, USDA - Natural Resources Conservation Service, USA), Eckehard Fleischhauer (Federal Ministry for Environment, GERMANY), Anna Haering (Institute of Agricultural Economics, University of Hohenheim, GERMANY), Olivier Heiniger (Institute of Geography, University of Bern, SWITZERLAND), Karl Herweg (Centre for Development and Environment, University of Bern, SWITZERLAND), Thea Hilhorst (Royal Tropical Institute, THE NETHERLANDS), Rod Lefroy (International Board for Soil Research and Management, THAILAND), Constance Neely (SANREM CRSP, USA), Cordula Ott (Centre for Development and Environment, University of Bern, SWITZERLAND), Joep Slaats (Centre for Development and Environment, University of Bern, SWITZERLAND), Charles Sloger (USAID, USA), Kurt Steiner (Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit - GTZ- Sustainable Soil Management, GERMANY), Steffen Weidner (Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit - GTZ- Sustainable Soil Management; GERMANY), Anneke Trux (OSS, FRANCE). WORKSHOP OUTPUTS The workshop proceeded in three phases. The first phase aimed at finding a common understanding of impact assessment and impact indicators, simple and cost-efficient\" monitoring methods and users of the planned guidelines and monitoring methods. The second phase concentrated on the ",
        "94 development of a framework for the guidelines and the third phase on the planning of the process of editing and testing the guidelines. Based on an intensive exchange of experience, the participants produced three main outputs: 1. Clarification of key issues and elaboration of a conceptual frame of the guidelines Emphasis was given to discuss and define key principles for the elaboration and final use of the guidelines. The workshop participants agreed on a number of key principles. Main users of the guidelines are project and task managers and levels of application range from the farm plot to household and community up to the district. Partner organizations should continue the monitoring process after the phasing out of the project, therefore, monitoring methods should be simple and cost- efficient, and generic indicators must always be combined with local indicators to encourage local stakeholders to engage in monitoring as early as possible. 2. Development of the structure; The participants discussed and elaborated a detailed structure for the guidelines on the basis of a proposal by the organizers. Main chapters are: Setting the stage; including an introduction why to carry out monitoring, how to use the guidelines, concepts and principles, how to find hypotheses, etc.; Process of monitoring; describing who is involved, what to monitor, how to select generic and local indicators, how to select corresponding monitoring methods; Outputs; defining the clientele for the information, trends and changes, impacts, assistance to interpret the results, lessons learned, post-project activities, and a general assessment if land management has moved to a higher or lower degree of sustainability: Storage and dissemination of information; suggesting how to screen, store and share the data. An inventory of simple and cost-efficient monitoring methods will be attached as annex. 3. Planning of the follow-up activities for a concerted development of the guidelines A core group of experts, coordinated by the Center for Development and Environment, was assigned to develop a first draft of the guidelines until October 31, 1997. A substantial number of participants agreed to provide relevant literature and materials for this task within the coming weeks. The draft will be reviewed by an editorial board (extended core group)* and, if required by other international experts, underrepresented in the workshop. A second and revised version will be ready by end of February, 1998. The elaboration of the two versions will be largely financed by GTZ and SDC. Other institutions reserve time for contributions and the revision of the draft. The workshop participants recommended the preparation of a second phase. Main activities should be training of experts in the use of the guidelines (including the elaboration of training materials), field testing, and edition of a final version of the guidelines. * Extended core group: Steiner, Herweg, Ott, Slaats, Sloger, Eswaran, Dumanski, Lefroy (or Bechstein), Neely (or SANREM staff), Holden (to be invited). Concluding remarks: The workshop was considered a success by the participants, as a common agenda was developed within the three days. Representatives of development agencies consider the guidelines an important tool for the quality control of development activities. It is worthwhile to stress, that the Land Quality ",
        "95 Indicator Initiative, co-ordinated by the Worldbank, is joining and thus strengthening the process, initiated by the workshop. INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF SOIL SCIENCE AGENDA 21 of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development emphasizes the need and proposes a wide range of activities to address land degradation in general and desertification in particular. As a response to this challenge, more than 100 countries have signed the Convention to Combat Desertification (CCD) in 1997. A key point of the CCD deals with scientific and technical cooperation on investigation, collection, evaluation of the processes and factors involved in land degradation leading to desertification. At the conclusion of the Conference on Land Degradation at Adana, an International Task Force on Land Degradation, to be formed under the auspices of the International Society of Soil Science (ISSS), was proposed and unanimously adopted. The Soil Science Department of the University of \u00c7ukurova, Adana, has agreed to provide an interim Secretariat. An interim Committee to coordinate the work of the Task Force was formed with the following members: Dr. Hari Eswaran Chairman USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service Washington DC, USA Dr. Selim Kapur Secretary \u00c7ukurova University, Adana, Turkey Dr. Ahmet R.

The 1 st issue of the bi-annual Newsletter was published in FEB 1997 with the financial and logistic supports from the British Council Office at Ankara, Chamber of Agricultural Engineers at Adana and University of \u00c7ukurova Faculty of Agriculture. The Newsletter reached more than a 1000 addresses throughout the world. The Newsletter is now temporarily on the website of the World Soil Resources of USDA NRCS (http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/worldsoils/). We intend to develop a dedicated website for the Task Force. Members of the ITFLD met twice in Adana, Turkey in January and May '97. The first meeting was devoted to the initial preparations of the Newsletter. We have received few but complimentary letters from our readers. We thank those who wrote in as this is the only indication of the utility of the ",
        "97 Newsletter. The second meeting was again held at Adana, Turkey on May 18 to 23. The meeting comprised of three days of discussions and a field trip from Adana to Plovdiv, Bulgaria. The meeting was attended by the Task Force Committee (Hari Eswaran, Selim Kapur. Ahmet Mermut, Erhan Ak\u00e7a) and several observers Russell Almaraz (USDA NRCS), Dr. Naci \u00f6zt\u00fcrk, Prof. Ural Dine, and Prof. Suat_enol (\u00c7ukarova University). Dr. Kapur briefed the Committee on the progress being made with respect to developing the monograph, \"Guidelines for assessing and monitoring land degradation\". He indicated that the British Council was interested to support the effort. Dr. Peter Bullock from Silsoe, England was unable to join the meeting and so discussions on the subject was postponed to a later date. The next item on the agenda was the 2 nd Newsletter. Both Drs. Kapur and Eswaran reported on the complimentary letters on the 1 st . Newsletter that were being received. There is good indication of keen interest from the scientific community. A major concern was that there were insufficient articles or contributions being submitted. This is the frustration of many newsletter editors and particularly for the first few newsletters. It was agreed that the Committee use their judgement to include as many relevant material as possible until the time that the readership responds. Mr. Ak\u00e7a suggested that the Task Force would be served well by a Website. Currently the information of the Task Force was included on the USDA NRCS website and there was unanimous agreement that a dedicated website be established at \u00c7ukurova University. Initial discussions were held with the local Webmaster and plans were developed. Mr. Allmaraz agreed to help develop the website. Drs. Eswaran and Mermut reported on the efforts to obtain supporting funds for the Task Force. There was no indication of success and few possibilities were available. One hope was the Desertification Convention, when it is ratified by member countries of the United Nations. It is clear that without some kind of political support, the Land Degradation Task Force will be subject to desertification and fade away into oblivion. The Secretary, Dr. Kapur, promised not to let this happen. As an initial effort, the Committee Members have agreed to put in their own money to keep the effort alive. Dr. Selim Kapur has opened a bank account for this purpose. A bank account: 6010 52236 ITFLD/Selim KAPUR at the Is Bankasi, University of \u00c7ukurova Branch is opened for donations to the ITFLD. Readers who wish to contribute can send a check in US dollars to Dr. Kapur. The money will be used to mail the Newsletter to persons in developing countries and if sufficient funds become available, will be used to off-set the cost of printing. Dr. Saiffudin, from Kerala Agricultural University, Kerala, India, had inquired about developing a land degradation map of his State. The Task Force agreed that this is an area for international cooperation to have an agreed-to legend, procedures, and quality assurance mechanisms. One whole day was used to discuss this and the discussions were continued during the field trip to Central and Nortwestern Anatolia as well as Southeastern Bulgaria. Interesting profiles with genetic and paleoenvironmental significance were studied together with profiles at sample sites of erosion, land stripping for raw materials and urbanisation. The most striking features of LD were observed in K\u00fctahya with a total amount of land completely stripped and deforested by the ceramic and porcelain industries which have been functioning since the Byzantine & Ottoman periods. The human as well as geologically induced erosion surfaces in Cappodocia, in spite of the natural beauties, was the ",
        "98 messenger for the future the desertification of parts of Central Anatolia. However, Andisols developed on andesitic ashes seemed to be the refuge of vineyards of historical tradition together with apricot orchards. The surface of an ancient Hellenistic grave between K\u00fctahya and Afyon towns revealed the development of a mollic epipedon with similar morphology to adjacent undisturbed surfaces. The urbanization of the past productive soils of Bursa town proved to be an excellent example for the Los Angeles syndrome. State farms of G\u00f6zl\u00fc (Central Anatolia) and T\u00fcrkgeldi (Thrace) were also visited for the study of Mollisols, Alfisols with calcretes and Vertisols developed on marine Miocene sediments respectively. The tree-curtains planted for the conservation of the soil to withstand the well-known Anatolian winds together with the follow-wheat rotation system of the former and the highly wheat producing black Vertisols (app. 8-10 tonnes/ha) of the latter highlighted the essence of the Turkish State Farm system. However, the mismanagement and degradation of the pastures throughout the state farms was striking in spite of the large number of small and large ruminant breeding programs undertaken by the Ministry of Agriculture. Members of the ITFLD suggested gradual conversion programs of some of the large pasture parcels (parcel sizes are to be determined accordingly to the size, climate, soils & income levels of the State Farms) to areas devoted to biodiversity as previously done at some other International Research Centers. Thus, recovery of the endemic plants together with the innumerable natural forage crops characteristic for the area would be apt to breeding and selection for scientists to work on the improvement of the degraded pastures. This suggestion is planned to be offered to the General Directorate of State Farms of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs to be undertaken in the whole of 36 State Farms scattered all over the 7 agro-ecological regions of Turkey. The 4 th Red Mediterranean Soils Meeting in Plovdiv, Bulgaria (27 May -01 June 1997, attended by the ITFLD members following the field trip) dealt with problems of land-use and degradation of the soils of the region with some studies dealing with genesis and classification. The Chairman and the Secretary of the ITFLD presented plenary papers at the meeting titled \"IMPACTS OF LAND DEGRADATION IN THE MEDITERRANEAN REGION\" and \"PRESERVING OUR HERITAGE: A CASE STUDY FROM SOUTHERN TURKEY\" respectively. The former paper summoned messages on the drastic processes of desertification, such as \"endoreisation\" which create present and future problems for all large scale irrigation projects throughout the world, and especially in the Mediterranean region and the Middle East. The latter concentrated on a biocultural sustainability concept involving an interdisciplinary approach of archaeometry, archaeology, geology, geomorphology, biology, agriculture and soil science. A similar approach to archaeological site studies related to the construction of paleo- environmental models is followed by Dr. Marie-Agnes Courty (CNRS-Paris, France). In conclusion, during the short span of less than one year of the formation of the Task Force, much has been accomplished. Dr. Mermut recommended that the Task Force request ISSS to upgrade it to a Working Group. Dr. Eswaran thought that it was a bit premature but concurred that the Society could be approached in the near future. The Committee recorded its indebtedness to Dr. Selim Kapur and Mr. Erhan Akca for the effort they put to ensure the publication and distribution of the Newsletter. The Committee also requested Dr. Kapur to formally thank all the institutions and persons who provided funds (directly or indirectly) for the Newsletter. ",
        "99 SURFING THE WEB >Now that you have your own computer and have access to World Wide Web and your boss is giving you a hard time or you are getting bored, it is time to surf the web. There is an increasing number of websites on soils; a few have information on land degradation. Surfing can become tedious. Many of the sites are for self glorification. These particularly apply to sites of institutions which tell you who the director and his/her secretary is, sometimes they include their pictures (which was taken ten years before). At some sites, you have to dig deep to find out what they have and if there is anything useful to you. I usually save the useful ones on my 'bookmark'. If you have good search engines, use keywords such as \"desertification, degradation, soil science, etc.\" and this will give you a few interesting hits. At this time, do not expect too much as most of them are information poor. In this and future issues, we will try to list a few websites. If you have one, let us know and we will include it. One of the better sites is that called \"SCIENCES of SOILS SOIL SCIENCE ON THE WEB http://www.hintze-online/sos/soil-online.html\". This gives a lot of information on soil science journals, electronic discussion groups, and even an electronic journal. Visit it. The next best one, is of course, that of the Task Force on Land Degradation http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/worldsoils/. GLOBAL SLIDE SET ON SOILS The World Soil Resources of USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service is compiling a slide set to illustrate the soil resources of the world. They expect to assemble between 3,000 to 5,000 slides on CD ROM and on the Website. The hope is to be able to depict the major soils of each country of the world. Slides of soils, landscape, land use, land degradation, and land management are requested. Please include your name and country on the slide (in the event that we have to return it to you). On a separate paper, provide additional information about the slide. We are also interested in slides of famous soil scientists. We will acknowledge your support when the set is complete. If you can send some slides to Dr. Hah Eswaran, it will be included in the set if found suitable. REQUEST FOR PUBLISHED PAPERS Sara J. Scherr of the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) is preparing a discussion paper on land degradation for the series \"A 2020 Vision for Food, Agriculture and the Environment\". The paper will include a review of data from recent empirical research linking land degradation or improvement with changes in agricultural productivity, production and/or income, for different types of farming systems and environments in the tropics and sub-tropics. The audience for the paper will be policymakers, rather than technical experts. The objective is to alert them to the scale of potential economic losses from degradation and gains from land quality improvement, in different situations. ",

Population pressures and scarcity of good soils have forced agriculture to expand into marginal lands and wildlife habitats in Ethiopia. Inappropriate land use together with poor soil management practices have resulted in land degradation in many areas. The Rift Valley in Ethiopia is one such region where land management problems are particularly acute. There is a need to monitor and improve the resource base for sustainable food production in Ethiopia, which would reduce pressure on land and match the capability of land to appropriate agricultural use. Knowledge and well trained scientists are critical to long term solutions to land degradation and the development of sustainable land use is a key to ensure food security for the nation. The goal of this project is to enhance the capacity of Ethiopians to contribute to sustainable land use in South-central Ethiopia by upgrading human resources, to address land degradation problems in search for innovative and sustainable technologies which are compatible with local conditions in order to increase food production on drylands.

LATE QUATERNARY SEDIMENTS OF THE MARMARA SEA AND THEIR PALEOENVIRONMENTAL SIGNIFICANCE This is a one year project supported by the Turkish Scientific and Technical Council (T\u00dcB_TAK). The study involves the collection of deep sea cores and surface sediments of the Marmara Sea by an interdisciplinary approach of Soil Scientists (S. Kapur, E. Ak\u00e7a, Univ. of \u00c7ukurova, Dept. of Soil Science, Adana, Turkey and A. R. Mermut, Saskatchewan Univ., Dept. of Soil Science, Saskatoon, Canada), Sedimentologists (G. Kelling OBE, Univ. of Keele, Dept. of Earth Sciences, Staffordshire UK; M. Ergin, \u0392. Varoi, Univ. of Ankara, Dept. of Geology, Ankara, Turkey), Chemists & Meteorologists (C. Saydam, METU, Inst, of Marine Sciences, Erdemli, Turkey; F. Y. Eryjmaz, the Hydrography and Oceanography Dept. of the Turkish Navy). ",
        "101 The deep sea sediments collected from transects as well as present and probable paleoriver mouthes will be analysed for minerals (clay & primary minerals by XRD & thin sections; determination of weathering indices by XRD peak intensities and sharpness vs Thermoluminescence efficiencies), minor elements and isotopes. The results obtained from laboratory analyses of the sea floor will be compared with terrestrial samples of soils and rocks collected by the use of Soil and Geological maps as well as satellite images of the land. Analogies for paleoenvironmental interpretations (especially erosion potentials) will be produced together with data to be utilised by Marine Scientists working on the sustainable exploitation of the fish populations of the Marmara Sea. BASALTIC TEPHRA: A NEW SOURCE MATERIAL FOR INDUSTRIAL USE The project foresees the use of basaltic tephra in ceramic bodies as well as the purification of the industrial wastes. Determination of the appropriate basaltic tephra source for use in the fields mentioned above will be accomplished by an interdisciplinary group of Volcanologists (F. Isler, Univ. of \u00c7ukurova, Dept. of Geology, Adana, Turkey), Sedimentalogists (G. Kelling OBE, Univ. of Keele, Dept. of Erath Sciences, Staffordshire UK), Chemists (O. Erbatur, Univ. of \u00c7ukurova, Dept. of Chemistry, Adana, Turkey), Soil Scientists (S. Kapur and his team, Univ. of \u00c7ukurova, Dept. of Soil Science, Adana, Turkey; A. R. Mermut, , Saskatchewan Univ., Dept. of Soil Science, Saskatoon, Canada), Environmentalists & Ceramicists (N. Sakarya, Univ. of \u00c7ukurova, Dept. of Ceramics, Osmaniye, Turkey). Soil Scientists have a major role in the application part of the project for the environmental friendly exploitation of the tephra deposits as well as the physical properties suitable for each field of use to be determined in laboratory analysesl together with tests and microscopy of different levels. On the other hand the stratigraphy of the consecutive paleosols developed on different tephra layers together with C0 3 accumulation zones observed in preliminary field studies is most probably expected to yield valuable hints for Plio-Pleistocene climatic fluctuations and especially addition of wind-blown materials from probable remote sources such as the Sahara. A PROGRAM TO DEVELOP LAND QUALITY INDICATORS AT SUB-NATIONAL, NATIONAL AND GLOBAL SCALES PROGRAM GOAL: DEVELOPMENT OF LAND QUALITY INDICATORS (LQIs) FOR THE EVALUATION AND MONITORING OF LAND USE PRESSURES, CHANGES OF THE STATE OF LAND RESOURCES AND RESPONSES OF SOCIETY. BACKGROUND: The LQI program is being developed to better harmonize the combined objectives of production and environmental management, and to ensure more sustainable use of land, water and biological resources. It is one of several important responses to the major challenges put forward by UNCED in Agenda 21. Although the program is being initiated through a coalition of international agencies including the World Bank, FAO, UNDP and UNEP, the task is too important for any one agency or group. Additional partners are actively being solicited for the program. ",
        "102 LQIs are needed to address major land-related issues of national and global significance, such as land use pressures, land degradation, and soil and water conservation, as well as policy related questions on sustainable land management. Once developed and harmonized through international scientific protocols, LQIs will be used for policy and program formulation for district, national and global assessment, environmental impact monitoring, and to promote technologies, policies and programs to ensure better use of natural resources and sustainable land management. The LQI initiative is similar in concept to previous programs, sponsored by national and international agencies, on indicators of economic and social performance, and on indicators of state-of-the- environment reporting. These programs were initiated by groups of interested parties working together, using an iterative process of indicator development, testing, refinement, and standardisation. This ultimately resulted in the standard economic, social, and some environmental indicators that are now used routinely for monitoring national economic performance, mostly with respect to air and water quality, and for planning. Something similar is planned in the LQI program for development of indicators for land quality. In this context, land refers not just to soil, but to the combined resources of soil, water, vegetation and terrain that provide the basis for land use. Land quality is the condition or health of the land relative to its capacity for sustainable land use and environmental management. Although the LQI program is still very new (preliminary activities to develop the program started in 1994), much has already been accomplished. OBJECTIVES: The program will initially focus on LQIs for developing countries, although some experimental work will be done in other regions. The objectives of the program are: 1. To develop a set of harmonised LQIs for managed ecosystems (agriculture and forestry) in the major Agro-Ecological Zones (AEZs) of tropical, sub-tropical and temperate environments. 2. To identify sources of data and information and develop common methods for analyses, aggregation, and application of the results. 3. To validate and disseminate the findings among the major institutions responsible for collection of LQI data, and to reinforce the institutional capacity needed for setting and implementing land and natural resources priorities, policies and technologies at sub-national and national levels. OUTPUTS: The outputs of the program will be: 1. A set of harmonised LQIs to be used by decision-makers and appropriate to major policy related questions on land management in tropical, sub-tropical and temperate regions. LQI Source Tables will be prepared for each country and locally updated. 2. A set of appropriate targets and thresholds for the state LQIs to provide guidance towards more sustainable land management for the different eco-regions. 3. A metadata information system on land related information set up on the World Wide Web, and to be available as stand-alone systems as well. Such a metadata system will provide documentation on what data are stored with which agencies, the quality and reliability of the data, and how the data can be accessed. Emphasis will be on land suitable for cultivation and forestry, biological production ",
        "103 potentials, current land management technologies, and other related information necessary to monitor changes in land quality. 4. Assessments of trends in land quality for various AEZs for use at sub-national and national level, leading to global assessment of the condition of land as a function of its use. PROGRAM ACTIVITIES: The major activities in the LQI program are the following: 1. Information management and development of a metadata information system on land related data. This will involve i) development of a catalogue on land related data currently being stored by various international and national agencies, ii) analyses of data quality, compatibility, voids in information, and what additional data are needed, iii) use of the data to develop some national level LQIs, and iv) development of the meta-data base, including documentation and set up on the World Wide Web, as well as on stand-alone systems such as the prototype for the GRID/UNEP catalogue. 2. Development of sub-national and national level LQIs through case studies in representative AEZs. Tentatively about six AEZ case studies are being planned with varying data quality. The studies will be developed according to the matrix AEZ \u03c7 land use intensity \u03c7 data availability, as presented in the Discussion Paper. The case studies will follow common guidelines, and take place over a two year period. They will involve collation and analyses of available data for the AEZ, but also some field work to test and validate the LQIs. Each case study will culminate with a workshop involving other scientists, technologists and administrators, to discuss the methodologies and results and to effect the transfer of LQI technology to national agencies. 3. National capacity building: This activity will take place through incorporation of LQI initiatives into ongoing capacity building activities being conducted by agencies such as UNDP, UNEP, FAO, the CG centres and others. Major activities will be training on geo-referenced data acquisition, training on PC based data management, and training on the use of local farmer knowledge and the development of quantitative indicators from farmer knowledge. POLICY APPLICATIONS OF LQI: The results of this program will be used as follows: 1. To assist policy-makers, planners and project managers to incorporate land quality considerations in their national and sub-national development programmes; 2. To strengthen human and institutional capacity to monitor, evaluate and manage land quality (i.e. condition of soil, water, forest and biological resources) based upon organised sets of data and information collected at national and sub-national levels (community and district); 3. To develop and test decision-support tools at sub-national and national level that promote cost- effective allocation of human and financial resources based on conditions of land quality and its vital role in sustainable agriculture and rural development; 4. To contribute to global assessment of land quality as a function of major land cover and land use systems , and farmer practices. Farmers and land managers are the ultimate land use decision makers. Although the practices of any one individual may appear to be insignifiant, the practices are repeated many times on the landscape and ultimatlty may have global impact. ",

(Fax: 1- 202-522 3306; email: jdumanski@worldbank.org) CONSERVATION AND BIODIVERSITY IN BRITAIN Dr. Julian Edwards First Secretary for Science and Technology, The British Council and Cultural Affairs, Ankara, Turkey. The United Kingdom (UK) is made up of a group of temperate islands off the coast of continental Europe. The position of these islands, in the north-east Atlantic Ocean, mean that they are bathed by the waters of the Gulf Stream, ensuring mild climatic conditions in comparison with mainland Europe. The oceanic climate, also, brings a high average rainfall to the western coastal regions. The main UK habitats can be described as woodlands, heathlands, lower grasslands, coastal areas (cliffs, estuaries, saltmarshes, sand dunes and shingle shorelines), marine, freshwater habitats (lakes and ponds, rivers and streams, canals and grazing marsh ditches), peatlands, uplands, farmland and urban areas. The two principal features that characterise this assemblage of habitats are the kaleidoscope of change over relatively small geographic areas, and the all-encompassing influence of man's activities on biodiversity. In relation to the latter, perhaps the only habitat type not radically changed by man, in Britain, is the littoral ecotype. Before looking at how one conserves this biodiversity and, indeed, how one approaches this problem in such a man-influenced environment it is worthwhile to look briefly at the development of the conservation movement in Britain. Its origins can be found in the long tradition of natural history observation and study, often carried forward by gifted amateurs -Gilbert White's \"The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne\" is a fine example of this genre. To these early naturalists Britain was a beautiful pastoral island rich in wildlife and habitats which was perceived as being substantially unchanging. The jolt to the system was, of course, the industrial Revolution. The British economy was the first to be industrialised, and the effects were rapid and in many cases ecologically catastrophic. The population more than tripled, huge urban centres developed, containing a high proportion of the total population, and heavy and uncontrolled environmental degradation and pollution became a commonplace of life. The reaction to this 'down-side' to increased wealth and affluence was the introduction of legislation and the establishment of 'pressure groups' (we could now call them non-governmental organisations - NGOs) to alleviate some of the problems. Early legislation had at first centred directly on people's quality of life (e.g. clean air and water), but rapidly moved towards a realisation that preservation of biodiversity and conservation of natural resources was not just a luxury. It was an economic necessity. Also, a political necessity, as the electorate (who determined government) demanded a more 'environmental friendly' approach to development. The UK now has some of the largest and most vociferous environmental NGOs in the world, and conservation and sustainable development is high on the political agenda. This should really be no surprise when one considers that Britain is one of the most urbanised societies in the world and has the third largest global population density. It is salutary ",
        "ios to note that in the present British Government, the environment portfolio is held by the Deputy Prime Minister. Given that so much of the habitat structure of Britain is determined by man's activities, and can be even be described as 'artificial' how does one develop a logical conservation policy especially given the rapid pace of change in modern society? In Michael Usher's pioneering book \"Biological Management and Conservation\" he gives a definition of the word 'conservation' as: \"Biological conservation is essentially concerned with the interaction between man and the environment. Fulfilment of conservation objectives, for a biological resource requires the resource's management in perpetuity on the basis of a sustained production of the resource or biotic component of the environment and a sustained demand on the resource or environment by man\". Over much of the UK forest habitats would predominate if human influence had not intervened. At the present date, however, 77% of the UK is farmed and agricultural practises will continue to have a significant effect on the landscape and on biodiversity. The principle of conservation, in Britain, is therefore, to preserve examples of characteristic native habitat and landscape (respectively the network of natural reserves and national parks) and to manage the 'man-made' environments so as to preserve examples of characteristic native habitat and landscape (respectively the network of national nature reserves and national parks) and to manage the 'man-made' environments so as to preserve and enhance biodiversity indices. The latter can include the rehabilitation of land and natural resources (e.g. reclamation of mine waste-tips or the cleaning up of the River Thames) to the encouragement of practices which promote biodiversity (e.g. sheep grazing on southern downland produces sward containing over 50 species per square metre). A key element of this policy of conservation and biodiversity enhancement is not only to produce a legislative system which is realistic and, crucially, is enforced, but to integrate environmentally-sound policies in to all aspects of economic development. On a small island no construction project or proposed land-use change should be envisaged without through environmental impact assessment procedures being followed and recommendations implemented. The economic costs and deleterious effects of a motorway driven through an area of outstanding natural beauty or a factory discharging toxic waste in to a river (to give but two examples) are incalculable. In summary, I would like to end on a positive note. The world is, indeed, becoming smaller as the process of 'globalisation' continues and peoples, countries and economies become more interdependent and reliant on each other. Major international events, such as the Rio Earth Conference, complemented by a ground-swell of public opinion has pushed concern for the environment to the forefront of the political agenda. Human pressures will still increase (both in Britain and other countries) and more and more of the world will come under the direct influence of man's activities. However, the crucial difference from, say 100 years ago, is that the concept of the dependency of human civilisation on planetary life-support systems is firmly embedded in mainstream political and popular thought.

        "io6 DETERMINANTS OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE IN THE SOUTHERN COASTAL PLAINS OF ALBANIA 111 Pandi Zdruli and Hari Eswaran International Fertilizer Development Center, Muscle Shoals, Alabama, and USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service, Washington DC The Southern Coastal Plains consist of flat to undulating land bordered on the eastern side by low hills. On the seaward side, depressions with swamps and marshes which have been drained and reclaimed in the past, are present. This is the major agricultural area of the country endowed with good soils and climate and with a tradition of good land use. Since the beginning of this decade, the centrally controlled system of agriculture has been transformed to private ownership of land. Economics of production now govern land use and quality of management rests solely on the land manager. The premise of this study is that sustainable agriculture depends on a good match between land quality and land use, with socioeconomic and political factors of the region and the country largely determining the latter. Degradation and unsustainability results when there is a mismatch. This major land resource area is examined in the context of this paradigm and some of the major determinants of sustainable agriculture are examined. A pressure-state-response matrix is used in this evaluation. The socioeconomic and biophysical pressures are the major determinants which affect the state of the agricultural system. The society responds to these pressures and the elasticity of the response is a measure of the progress towards equity and sustainability. The basic conclusion of the study is that from a biophysical point of view, productivity can be doubled in the region. However, current socioeconomic and political forces play a negative role retarding the change. In conclusion, the over riding determinant of unsustainability of the agricultural sector in the country is the political and economic stability. IMPACTS OF LAND DEGRADATION IN THE MEDITERRANEAN REGION 151 Hari Eswaran and Paul Reich USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service, Washington DC Of the 131 million km 2 of global land resources, soils with xeric soil moisture regimes occupy about 3% of the land mass, with the greatest extent around the Mediterranean. The subdued climate has always attracted human populations and so many civilizations have flourished. The ability of the land to feed and clothe the people is increasingly being stressed due to population pressure and the demands of this burgeoning population. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the factors of land degradation and to make some initial assessment of impact. Having been the hub of civilization during the last two millennia, the human impact on land resources has been intense and continuous. Beginning with the Phoenicians and continuing to modern times, mountain slopes were deforested to provide timber for ships, construction and melting ores. More than 1,500 years of poor irrigation practices on the lower valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates has resulted in salinization and water-logging. Erosion by wind and water, exacerbated by reduced land cover, silts ",
        "107 irrigation conduits and water reservoirs. The nations in the region have paid a tremendous price for the on-site and off-site damages resulting from land degradation. More recently, to meet the demands of increased human and animal populations, larger and more ambitious irrigation projects are being implemented. The GAP project of Eastern Turkey is an example. Other countries are damming rivers to use the maximum amount of water. One of the consequences of these activities is a significant reduction of net flow of water (carrying sediments and nutrients) to the delta and sea. Aquatic biodiversity is threatened desertification of the sea? On the land, the intensive irrigation with little or no drainage results in a process called, \"endoreisation\", by which all the leached salts of the land are concentrated at shallow depths in the soil. This anthropic process is one of the principal causes of desertification in the Mediterranean region. Costs of land degradation and desertification in the regions have yet to be assessed. Costs attributed to reduction in productivity of the land and other on-site damages is probably of the order of tens of billions of dollars (this does not include loss of biodiversity and other environmental damages). Off-site costs, such as siltation of irrigation canals and reduction in the economic life of dams and other water storage facilities, are usually about 100 to 500 times more. The off-site costs also do not include damage to deltas and the sea. Land degradation must be taken more seriously by earth scientists working in the region. The quality of human life hinges on it. SOME ASPECTS OF LAND DEGRADATION IN THE CENTRAL ZAGROS REGION, IRAN M.K. Eghbal\" and M.H. Farpour b Isfahan University of Technology, College of Agriculture, Isfahan, Iran Vali-Asr University, College of Agriculture, Rafsanjan, Iran Land degradation in the Zagros Mountains of Iran has been expanding rapidly. Detailed studies are needed to understand factors involved in land degradation in this area. An attempt is made to study some factors influencing the land degradation in Central Zagros Mountains. Uplifting, due to the collision of the Arabian and Iranian plates, together with the existence of highly erodable materials in the region have created high potential for natural erosion and massmovement. Increase in human activities such as deforestation, over grazing, cultivation, mining and road building have accelerated the land degradation and destruction. Landslides are found in all geomorphic provinces in the region, especially in the last few decades. A thick marl series interbedded between massive sedimentary rocks, created ideal conditions for large-scale landslides. Cultivation on steep slopes, especially when plowed parallel to the slope direction, has caused very severe soil erosion. In the Imam Gheis region, erosion due to cultivation for crop production has influenced soils occurring on different positions on hillslopes. Comparison of soil characteristics on natural and eroded sites shows as much as 1 m of soil loss in some areas. Erosion from the higher surface and deposition on the lower parts has created young and less developed soils (Xerochrepts and Calcixererts). Overall, clay and organic matter increases toward the downslope. In this paper, in addition to soil quality changes, comparing soils data on a hillslope sequence will be presented. Because the area is sensitive to erosion, cultivation on steep slopes is not recommended. In areas ",
        "io8 with moderate slope, plowing vertical to the slope direction should be employed. Socio-economic factors influencing the land degradation were found very serious, but considered outside the scope of this work. However, as important contributing factors to land degradation, they require special attention. MONITORING OF SOIL FERTILITY AS A PROTECTIVE MEASURE AGAINST DEGRADATION M. Yousry and F.B. Labib Soil and Water Use Department, National Research Centre, Cairo, Egypt The agricultural land is considered one of the important natural and renewable resources. In the last decades, attention has been paid, all over the World to soil conservation against improper human activities that use partial of complicate degradation of the soil and consequently decrease its fertility and capability for crop production. Towards this objective about 250 profiles were studies from seven governorates, which cover an area of over approximately 2.000.000 acres. These profiles represent the main agricultural rotations followed in Egypt, namely: cotton, rice and sugar cane. The soil samples were reanalyzed, following the same techniques and methods of the previous analyses, to determine the main soil parameters to assess the productivity order. The intervals between the two analyses ranged between 25-30 years. The obtained results showed positive and negative changes with regard to soil fertility and consequently their productivity order. Many cases of soil degradation has been recorded in various sites. The negative change happened mainly in the first soil productivity order, while the positive one mainly occurred in the third and fourth soil productivity order. The main parameters associated negative changes are the increase in soil salinity, exchangeable sodium percentage and pH values. Excess of irrigation water table are imperfect drainage conditions led to fluctuation of ground water table are main factors in soil deterioration. On the other hand, the proper management and adequate fertilization are the main reasons for optimization of soil fertility. Regular monitoring of the measures of soil fertility, at reasonable intervals is recommended for suitable conservation of the agricultural land. LAND DEGRADATION PROBLEMS IN THE INDIAN ARID ZONE AND STRATEGIES FOR THEIR AMELIORATION J. P. Gupta and R. K. Goyal Central Arid Zone Research Institute, Jodhour, India Land degradation is one of the major environmental problems faced by the Indian arid zone which constitutes about 13% of the India's total geographical area. Accelerated soil erosion by wind and water, loss of vegetative cover, use of saline and industrial effluent water, cultivation on sand dune and their movement, degradation of pasture lands by over grazing and deforestation, tractorization, rocky stony waste lands and depletion of surface and ground water resources are some of the major factors responsible for the degradation and desertification of arid lands. Though the problem of land ",
        "109 degradation is triggered and even exacerbated by low (100-300 mm) and erratic (CV>50%) rainfall, high \u00e9vapotranspiration (1840 mm), but the real cause of land degradation is exploitative use and mismanagement of natural resources often dictated by a high biotic pressure and inadequate concern to the long term productivity of the resources. To meet the ever increasing demand for food and fodder it has become essential not only to manage the degraded land but also to use the land according to its capability for sustained and improved productivity. The results of the studies conducted over two decades show that enhanced and sustained productivity is directly proportionate to resource base upgradiation maintenance, it is therefore imperative that the root cause of resource degradation should be treated at the resource itself. Based on resource availability of the technologies like watershed management, pasture development, alternate land use systems, sand dune stabilization, afforestation, water harvesting and its efficient recycling and judicious use of saline water etc. developed by this department is envisaged to improve the productivity and impart sustainability in the production system even in this fragile eco-system. LAND DEGRADATION IN AGRI BASIN - SOUTHERN ITALY M. Pisante, F. Basso and B. Basso Dipartimento di Produzione Vegetale, Universita degli Studi della Basilicata, Potenza, Italy The Agri hydrographie basin, from a physical-environmental point of view is partially or totally delimited by the 29 municipalities and can be divided into three large areas: Upper Val d'Agri, Middle Val d'Agri, Lower Val d'Agri. The three areas are characterized by climatic, pedologie and consequently different agronomic and social conditions that have determined a different sensibility to degradation. In particular, the evolution of agricultural land on slope started in the past with the occupation of state land in the middle Val d'Agri and continued with deforestation that took place in the middle of the century, which pushed horsebean for seed ploughing cultivation higher up on the mountains, on forest land and on soils whose natural destination was grazing. The effects of hydrological disorder as well as the insufficient protection of the soil is considerably and permanently felt by agricultural land and production. Often the disasters caused by flooding, landslides and superficial runoff erosion represent the principle disintegrating factor of the hilly and mountainous area economy and favours rural population exodus. Therefore, a stable soil order is a priority to any innovative culture intervention and makes up one of the fundamental means to preserve the environment and for the physical and economical equilibrium of the mountainous, hilly and plain areas. Agronomic interventions that limit the erosion action of rainfall reduce the loss of fertile soil and increase slope stability. These interventions are: soil water control, adequate cultivation techniques (soil tillage, manuring, weed control, irrigation) and most of all a more rational agronomic use of sloping soil. Seasonal trend of vegetation cover on three 10 km long transects orthogonal to the Sauro river (Agri sub-basin), in 30 permanent sample areas have been individualized where surveys and samples have been taken. The following work plan has been followed: ",
        "110 Areas assigned to agriculture have been sampled on plot scale, areas surface of 1 ha each. The following parameters have been assessed: Type of soil: physical and chemical characteristics; Type of culture in progress; Phenological stage of the culture; Biomass. Furthermore, areas assigned to set-aside and those subject to fires have been individualized inside the transects. AMELIORATIVE MEASURES FOR SALT-EFFECTED DEGRADED SOILS OF PAKISTAN M. Qadir, N. Ahmad and A. Ghafoor Department of Soil Science, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistan Land degradation resulting from soil salinity, sodicity or combination of these is a major impediment to the optimal utilization of land resources of the world including Pakistan. The world as a whole is loosing about 3 hectares of arable land every minute due to an increase in soil salination/sodication resulting from unscientific land and water management practises, particularly under arid and semiarid climates. Pakistan having a similar climate contains 6.3 million hectares of salt effected soils with a majority having a saline-sodic nature problem. The ameliorative procedure for saline-sodic (gypsum, calcium chloride, etc. to supply soluble Ca +2 to replace exchangeable Na + ) soils by chemical means has become cost intensive. Many saline-sodic soils contain lime (CaC0 3 ) having negligible solubility. Cultivation of plants tolerant to salinity and sodicity may mobilize the native CaC0 3 through their root action to supply soluble Ca +2 , i. e. biological amelioration. A number of salt-tolerant plant species including millet rice (Echinochloa colona), sesbania (Sesbania aculeata), finger millet (Eleusine coracana), kallar grass (Leptochloa fusca) and a hybrid, sordan (Sorghum bicolor \u03c7 Sorghum sudanese) were planted on calcareous saline-sodic fields. Ameliorative effectiveness of these species was compared with the traditional gypsum application method. The biological amelioration was comparable to the chemical approach. Among the plant species tested, sesbania and kallar grass were found as the most suitable biotic material for cultivation on salt-effected soils to produce good quality and quantity forage, and to reduce soil salinization and sodication processes. Biomass production by the plant species was found to be directly proportional to their ameliorative effectiveness. MISUSE OF THE MEDITERRANEAN COASTAL AREAS IN TURKEY O. Eroi Istanbul, Turkey There is a law controlling the management activities on the coastline of Turkey. In spite of this, the coastal problems are increasing because of misuse. Some of these problems are: building big ",
        "Ili apartments and hotels on active or even stabilized coastal dunes and sandy beaches: thus blocking the approach of the people to the coastline by a thick wall of these hotels, houses etc.; intensive sand and gravel extraction from the dune, beach and even underwater sandbars at along the coastline; destroying the vegetation cover or beach-rocks which are protecting the dunes and sandy beaches against the wind or wave erosion along this belt. In addition to these, due to the extraction of sand and gravel from the inland river beds, irrigation projects or great dams on the river beds are causing decrease of the amount of sediments which are transported by the rivers into the coastal strip and distributed by the longshore currents along the beaches, and blown by the sea breezes on coastal dunes in order to establish the natural coastal balance of rivers, beaches, dune, vegetation and wildlife interactions. The recently growing intensive cover of touristic and private buildings, walls and jetties etc. are now gradually blocking the natural evolution of the coastline. As an obvious result of these negative influences, there is an increasing coastal erosion and water pollution at along the sandy beaches since about the last 5-10 years, and this may cause also land degradation in the deltaic coastal plains at along the Mediterranean shorelines of Turkey. Some examples from Dat\u00e7a, Kerner, Belek beaches, G\u00f6ksu and the Orantes delta coastal will be explained in the main text. FARMER-USER PARTICIPATION IN SOIL CONSERVATION: THE PHILIPPINE EXPERIENCE E.B. Cruz Watershed Management Specialist, Pulangi IV HE Plant, Maramag, Bukidnon, Philippines The Upper Catchment of the Pulangi River Basin is about 4,000.00 sq. km. It is located in the province of Bukidnon, Mindanao Islands of the Philippines. Sixty percent of the basin is largely cultivated. The 80 km Pulangi River System drains into the Pulangi IV reservoir which supports the generation of 255- MW power. The system contributes twenty five percent power requirement of Mindanao Grid. The downstream of the river is the site for 388 - MW hydroplant to be constructed very soon. The Pulangi river basin, being basically sloping, is prevalently devoted to upland farming for corn and rice. Rolling hills are tractored for sugar cane plantation. These farming systems result in serious erosion and sediments drain into the Pulangi IV reservoir, where siltation is estimated to be 20 million cubic meters. In view of the magnitude of the problem, the National Power Corporation, user of water for energy generation develop a soil and water conservation program involving farmers. Field activities include soil conservation education / awareness campaign, cross-farm visit, farmers' training, personalized technical assistance on the establishment of hedgerow farm system using legumes, Desmodium renzonii, Flemengia macrophylla, Leucena leucocepala, soil binding grasses and v\u00e9tiver grass. Agroforestry, rockwalling/stonewalling and utilization of available materials to construct silt traps were also introduced to address the growing threat of the erosion problem. Results indicate farmers' acceptance of the program as the economics of soil conservation were realized. Hundreds of farmers are involved as the technologies were adopted. ",

Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana The United States, in cooperation with other North American partners, is pleased to offer land and water conservation professionals throughout the world an invitation to participate in the 10 th International Soil Conservation Organization (ISCO) Conference, May 23-28, 1999, at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. ISCO is an independent organization that promotes international exchange on the science, technology, policy, and application of land and water conservation. Soil and water are critical natural resources that sustain human life and the lives of all other creatures on our planet. The careful husbandry of these natural resources is essential to world food security and environmental protection. When used in sustainable ways, soil and water produce the food, forestry, and fiber products that we all depend upon, and they will do so indefinitely. Sustainable use of these resources also is essential to socially, economically, and ecologically viable communities. It is imperative, therefore, that we invest adequately in research, the development of new technologies, and the effective transfer of those technologies. These are the roots of sound science on which the sustainable use of soil and water resources is based. Sound science also supports sound conservation policy, which is the basis for local action. It is the local action, either at the community, farm or ranch level, that yields land stewardship that will sustain our \"global farm\". Thus, the theme of the 10 th ISCO is \"SUSTAINING THE GLOBAL FARM: Local Action for Land Stewardship\". The Meeting Focus The defining characteristic of ISCO is its \"inclusiveness.\" Thus, the scope of the Conference may encompass, but is not limited to, the following: \u2022 Science and technology for conservation planning and assessment; \u2022 Soil survey and natural resource assessment for environmental protection; \u2022 Socioeconomic elements of land and water conservation; ",
        "115 \u2022 Conservation policy: a basis for action; \u2022 Conservation action: sustaining our land and water; There will be oral and poster presentations. One page abstracts are required by September 1, 1998. Guidelines for preparing the abstracts and papers will be sent to those who express their interest in participation. Several tours are being planned and details will be made available to those who register.

AGENDA 21 of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED 1992) emphasized the need for and proposes a wide range of activities to address land degradation in general and desertification in particular. Although much has been said and written about land degradation, there is still much conjecture on the subject as few countries have developed the techniques to measure degradation and subsequently develop spatial or other databases which enable the quantification of the process. Some of the immediate needs include: \u2022 improved procedures to assess degradation at different scales- global, national, and local; \u2022 evaluation of resilience capacities of land and methods to implement the concept; \u2022 development of indicators of land degradation for use at all planning levels; \u2022 development of mitigating technologies, and \u2022 assisting development and implementation of appropriate national policies. The First International Conference organized in Adana, Turkey (June 10-14, 1996), expressed the need to evaluate the science of land degradation. This was in response to the very high amounts of donor funds allocated to address land degradation without adequate information of the kinds, degree, and extent of the degradation problem prevailing in the country. In some instances, as the causes of degradation are not well appreciated, corrective measures through such bi-lateral projects have minimal impact. Land Degradation science is the domain of soil scientists. However, the processes are human induced and consequently social sciences and the understanding of socioeconomic factors causing the degradation is an important factor in developing mitigating technologies. There are also examples of situations where poor national land use policies have accelerated erosion and decline in quality of the soil. Land degradation science is thus an excellent example of the need to integrate, not only the sub-disciplines of soil science but also other disciplines including the policy arena. The 2nd International Conference is organized to address some or all of these issues. ",
        "i i6 The purpose of the conference stems from the fact that: Sustainable development requires an active national program of natural resource conservation and management; Sustainable land management, of which soil, water, and nutrient management are the most critical components, contributes to food security and income generation; A partial solution to the problem of addressing land degradation includes providing information to decision makers which enables them to make assessments on locations and rates of degradation and target appropriate technology; Through the collection of vital quantitative data on all aspects of degradation and their use in information technology, a powerful tool becomes available for decision making; The larger goal of making agriculture friendly to the environment, is only attained by appropriate land management. The conference will be organized around technical presentations, poster sessions, and working group discussions on the following topics: Tools for identification, assessment, and monitoring \u2022 identification \u2022 processes, resilience characteristics of land systems \u2022 use of information technologies - application of system models Land cover and land use \u2022 deforestation, shifting cultivation \u2022 urban and peri-urban linkages \u2022 soil pollution \u2022 mismatch between agricultural systems and ecosystems conditions Land management and land use policies \u2022 economics of land degradation \u2022 societal role \u2022 indigenous knowledge Mitigating technologies - conservation tillage \u2022 ecosystem based management \u2022 water quantity and quality Food security, biodiversity, and environmental impacts \u2022 quality of life \u2022 environmentally friendly agriculture Effects of global climate change \u2022 soil conditions Research and development issues \u2022 early warning indicators \u2022 monitoring networks To obtain subsequent circular letters and further information on the conference, contact Mr. Charoen Charoenchamratcheep Department of Land Development Phaholyothin Road, Chatuchak, Bangkok, 10900, THAILAND Fax: + 662-579 2902, email: VEARASIL@mozart.inet.co.th ",

ANNOUNCEMENT SECOND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON LAND DEGRADATION: MEETING THE CHALLENGES OF LAND DEGRADATION IN THE 21ST CENTURY ",
        "ug LETTER FROM THE EDITORS This is the inaugural letter of the International Task Force on Land Degradation under the auspices of the International Society of Soil Science.The importance of land degradation to the quality of the environment and food security in general has been recognized by earth scientists. With the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in 1992 at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and with the release of AGENDA 21, it has taken a special significance. This has resulted in political recognition of the process as being a potentially devastating one and for which a concerted effort was necessary. However, the United Nations preferred to address one form of degradation only - desertification. The Convention to Combat Desertification is urged to enlarge their portfolio to include land degradation as a whole as it will be an unique opportunity to address this. With the recognition of land degradation as an important problem, the First Conference was organized in Adana. Turkey was the ideal venue for the conference, due to the historical significance of the country, with respect to the rise and fall of civilizations in the Eastern Mediterranean and particularly the Mesopotamia. About 8.000 to 10.000 BP, the Neolithic civilization on the lower Mesopotamian Plain changed from nomadic to settled farming systems. The Sumerians were perhaps the first to establish settlements and an agriculture with irrigation systems. They were known as the first men of dykes and irrigation canals, who also introduced cereals from the wild species grown in upper Mesopotamia. Sumerians lost power around 5000 BP to Semitic speaking Akkadians. With time, the center of power shifted slowly northwards to Babylonia and eventually the Assyrians in the upper Mesopotamia. The Assyrians lived in Southeast Anatolia, Northern Syria, and Iraq. They developed a sophisticated form of agriculture which served the people of the time but which in the process was one of the major causes of decline in soil quality. Gradual shift of power together with population northwards, has been linked to the declining productivity resulting from land degradation. Excessive salinity through irrigation, loss of soil quality and fertility, and wind and water erosion are among the important factors that caused soil degradation and consequently the downfall of civilization in Mesopotamia. Land Degradation is a universal problem and not necessarily one for the developing countries. It is not merely an agricultural problem but has ramifications in all aspects of society. Land degradation either natural or induced by humans is a continuing process. It has become, however, an important concern affecting the wealth of nations, food security, and is impacting the livelihood of every person on earth. Food security is directly related to the ability of the land to support the population. Due to declining quality of the land, urban migration is on the rise in almost every country in the world. Biodiversity is directly impacted as landless farmers move to steep lands or swamps to eke out a living. ",
        "120 There are a number of questions concerning land degradation that need to be addressed and include: 1. Is land degradation inevitable? 2. Are there adequate early warning symptoms and indicators of land degradation? 3. The absence of land tenure and the resulting lack of stewardship is a major issue in some countries that detracts from adequate care for the land; how can this be resolved? 4. Social unrest is triggered by declining soil quality resulting largely from human induced degradation; what is the societal responsibility of soil scientists? 5. How can soil scientists better participate in developing public policy? 6. Local actions have global impact; what are the areas of international collaboration? 7. Who pays, who wins in the economics of land degradation? 8. Degradation results on loss of intergenerational equality and bequeath value. How do we quantify and create awareness? 9. Is there a link between land degradation and health of humans and animals? 10. Declining soil quality leads to diminishing economic growth in countries where wealth is agrarian based. How can the rates of resource consumption be quantified? 11. Land degradation often destroys or reduces natural beauty of landscapes. How might the aesthetic value of land be quantified? 12. How to create a greater awareness of the perils of land degradation in society and the political leadership? Soil scientists have made tremendous contributions to the task of soil resource assessment but have shown little or no interest to monitor the resource base and the quantification of land degradation. These are new areas of investigation which require guidelines, standards and procedure. The challenge to adopt internationally acceptable procedures for the quantification of land degradation is an important one. Soil scientists are obliged to provide reasonable estimates for rates of land degradation. They should develop early warning indicators of land degradation, to enable them to collaborate with others such as social scientists, to develop and implement mitigating technologies. They have a role in assisting national decision makers to develop appropriate land use policies. The challenges we face today are to: 1. Mobilize the scientific community to mount an integrated program for methods, standards, data collection and research networks for assessment and monitoring of soil and land degradation, 2. Develop land use models that incorporate both natural and human-induced factors that contribute to land degradation and that could be used for land use planning and management. Develop information systems that link environmental monitoring, accounting and impact assessment to land degradation, 3. Help develop policies that encourage sustainable land use and management and assist in the greater use of land resource information for sustainable agriculture, 4. Develop economic instruments in the assessment of land degradation to encourage the suitable use of land resources. ",
        "121 We can perhaps think in terms of a new agenda in our research and development programs. Components that need to be in the new agenda may be several, four of which are mentioned here: 1. Assessment, quantification and monitoring: The increasing demand for real-time information will require resource assessment to adapt. Monitoring of the quality of soil resources will also be subject to the same demands. It is envisaged that the future will require greater attention to the changes of soil properties in addition to kinds of soils. Periodic assessments provide the basic information for national planning, developing mitigation technologies if large scale detrimental changes are taking place. Suitable indicators are required to develop such indicators for soil resources. 2. Land quality and early warning indicators of land degradation: The FAO/UNESCO/UNEP/World Resources Institute all provides data on global assessment of soil degradation, but this data is very subjective to quantify the soil degradation problem. 3. Land productivity and land use options; Sustainable land management is the key to harmonize the environmental and ecological concerns of society faced with the economic realities of producing adequate food and fiber and ensuring a basic minimal quality of life. 4. Decision support systems: Decision makers, in particularly environmentally-sensitive countries with limited natural resources, are expected to make technical decision that are ecologically, economically, and socially acceptable. AGENDA 21 of the Rio Conference in 1992 emphasized this. The purpose of this ISSS Newsletter is to keep earth scientists abreast of developments in the science of land degradation. Your assistance is needed to make this network alive and productive. We hope to produce two Newsletters a year and we need your help. Please send us contributions in the form of short technical communications, book reviews, information on events, and specifically databases. REPORT OF THE 1ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ADANA, TURKEY, JUNE 10-14, 1996 Land degradation has been addressed in many international meetings dealing with natural resources and ecosystems but the Conference at Adana was perhaps the first time that a meeting was devoted to the subject. The purpose of the Conference was to: 1. provide a forum for those interested in land degradation to meet and exchange ideas on the subject; 2. arrive at an initial assessment of the state of information and knowledge on the processes, rates, and factors contolling land degradation; 3. evaluate mitigating technologies to control land degradation; 4. evaluate the need for international collaboration in the task of global assessment and monitoring; The conference started with a welcome address by A. R. Mermut (Canada), Chairman of the Scientific Committee. The speakers of the plenary session were H. Eswaran (USA), W. E. H. Blum (Secretary of the International Society of Soil Science, Austria), W. H. Verheye (Belgium), M. Inbar (Israel), and O. Tekinel (Turkey). They provided excellent examples about land degradation and the challenges that mankind faces today. The Turkish Foundation for Combating Soil Erosion for Reforestation and the ",
        "122 Protection of Natural Habitats ended the day with a cinevision show exhibiting the indicators of land degradation with special reference to soil erosion and degradation of the natural habitat in Turkey. Participants, over 200 from 30 countries in addition to Turkey, presented 76 oral and 86 poster papers. The largest foreign group was from Bulgaria, the Pushkarov Institute of Soil Science. The conference took place at the University of \u00c7ukurova, located along the beautiful Seyhan lake. Topics discussed in the conference were: The assessment & monitoring of soil and land degradation, Mitigation technologies &\\ policies for reducing land degradation, Environmental accounting of soil use and land degradation, History & socio-economics of land degradation, Impact of land degradation on global climate change, Indicators of land degradation, Application of GIS & remote sensing technology to evaluate soil care and land degradation. The discussion session on Friday June 14, was focused on how to deal with land degradation considering chapter 10 of AGENDA 21 of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. A mid-week excursion was organized to show the delegates the typical examples of the most productive soils which are lost permanently to expanding urbanization. Traditional Turkish food and spirits were enjoyed by all the participants. Weekend excursions to Cappadocia together with the Karap_nar, the blooming desert region (previous sand dune area), was worthwhile observing geotectonic beauties, as well as combatting desertification. Delegates of the Conference decided to form a task force. The Soil Science Department of the Univeristy of \u00c7ukurova, Adana, has agreed to provide an interim Secretariat. An Interim Committee to coordinate the work of the Task Force was formed. The delegates decided to have the next meeting in Thailand, upon the request of the Thai delegates. Dr. S. A. Tahoun (Egypt) extended his sincere wish to host the third Land Degradation Conference in the year 2000 in Cairo, Egypt and this was accepted by the delegates. The abstracts of the conference were published by the local editorial board. Reviewed and accepted papers are to be published in a special issue of an International Journal. A few excerpts of the Abstracts are included in this Newsletter. TASK FORCE ON LAND DEGRADATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF SOIL SCIENCE AGENDA 21 of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development emphasizes the need and proposes a wide range of activities to address land degradation in general and desertification in particular. As a response to this challenge, more than 100 countries have signed the Convention to Combat Desertification (CCD) in 1997. A key point of the CCD deals with scientific and technical cooperation on investigation, collection, evaluation of the processes and factors involved in ",

During the last five years the Bank has financed about 108 land degradation related projects for a total of $13.4 billion. The Bank is also leading efforts to develop Land Quality Indicators which will enable land degradation problems to be identified and measured and the efficiency of remedial actions to be monitored. In the African continent, where land degradation problems are most severe, a Soil Fertility Recapitilization Initiative is being considered. In the planned study, measures to address the global dimensions of land degradation and how to integrate them with measures designed to address farm-level and national-level problems will be considered. An important question asked is: How and at what cost would policies, institutions, and investment priorities change if global environmental objectives were added to conventional sectoral objectives? This stems from the fact that there is little experience in the preparation of land degradation control projects that blend global environmental concerns with national sustainable development objectives. It is expected that the proposed theme paper will have three components: ",
        "125 1. a conceptual framework for analyzing the linkages between land degradation and global problems; 2. guidelines for the incorporation of global dimensions in land degradation control projects, including guidelines for the application of incremental cost principles to determine eligibility for GEF funding; 3. concrete examples of how global dimensions can be incorporated into land resource management and land degradation control projects of the Bank. Three fundamental questions were posed at this meeting and readers are invited to send their opinion, with supporting data if possible, to Dr. Hah Eswaran (USDA-NRCS, Fax: 1-202-720 4593): 1. Is land degradation a driver of global climate change? 2. What is the role of land degradation on carbon sequestration in soils? 3. What is the impact of land degradation on crop productivity?

Banin Department of Soil and Water Sciences and the Seagram Center for Soil and Water Sciences, The Hebrew University, Rehovot, Israel Land degradation due to secondary salinization of intensively irrigated land is an increasingly alarming process experienced in many irrigated regions. The major cause is a profound interference in geochemical/salt balances of irrigated regions. Irrigation of arid and arid semi-arid lands has developed at a steep rate since the 1950's, more than doubling in area since then. Quite generally, high hopes for increased agricultural production in these irrigated arid-zones are materialised only during a relatively short (2-4 decades) period of time. A series of decline processes are set in the irrigated land immediately upon the initiation of large-scale irrigation causing, on regional scales, slow but steady yield declines. One of the major and most grave decline processes is the development of secondary salinization, frequently followed by sodification, of soils. This form of land degradation grossly affects the semi-arid and arid-regions. A case study of regional salinization in the Yizre'el Valley, Israel, a 20.000 ha intensively irrigated region in Israel, has shown that as water use in the Valley increased over the years since 1945 to ca. 70.106 m3 per year, importation of soluble salts by water totaled some 15.000 tons as CI per year. Recirculated salt, i.e., salt picked up by impounded surface water and applied to fields, increased significantly and amounted in the later 1980's to more than 9.000 tons CI per year. The source of recirculated salts was the accumulated salts in soils and in the shallow aquifer in the Valley which were leached by flood water and/or drained, or infiltrated into reservoirs, grossly and adversely affecting soil and water quality. ",
        "126 Analysis of a number of cases of regional salinization events, points to the utmost importance of maintaining the geochemical balances in addition to increasing irrigation efficiency. Means of achieving geochemical balance in an irrigated region may include limiting the extent of irrigated areas, developing a well-maintained drainage system which drains tail-water and salinized shallow-aquifer water, and devoting a significant portion of water for \"regional leaching\". The sustained long-term productivity of irrigated lands in arid-zones crucially depends on correctly managing water and soil resources. Regional management of irrigated lands to prevent secondary salinization shall be aimed at carefully balancing the undisputed benefits of irrigation with the long term (on time-scales of 10 to 100 years) detrimental processes that are set in motion at the very moment of introduction of irrigation to arid and semi-arid zone soils. MONITORING CONTAMINATION OF SOILS IN SLOVAKIA J. Kobza Soil Fertility Research Institute Bratislava, Research Station Bansk Bystrica, Slovakia Slovakia in the twentieth century has been characterized by frequent and extensive changes unfavourably impacting all aspects of the environment. Long-term continuing wasteful exploitation of natural resources, extensive pollution of the air, water, soil and land, release of contaminants by the influence of human activity (especially industry, agriculture, etc.) is for the quality of the main components of the environment. The problem of the soil monitoring system in Slovakia has been developed at the Soil Fertility Research Institute in Bratislava since 1992 (agricultural and forest soils together). Important soil properties are monitored as well as chemical, agrochemical and physical properties. The soil monitoring network in Slovakia includes 637 monitoring sites (299 in agricultural soils and 338 in forest soils). Soil sampling is done at standard depths such as, 0,00-0,10 m, 0,20-0,30 m and 0,35-0,45 m, but soil samples from various horizons must not be mixed. The monitoring cycle is 5 years, more dynamic properties have been monitored yearly. Important soil properties connected to soil contamination, soil acidification, soil erosion and soil oppressing, etc. are monitorized as well, as an important factor in inorganic and organic contamination. Trace elements such as Pb, Cd, Cr, Cu, Zn, Ni, As, Hg, Se, Co (total content) and Pb, Cd, Cr, Cu, Zn, Ni (extracted by 2M HN03) were analysed as well as the PAH content from organic contaminants. Finally, it can be said that on the basis of the results obtained the soils of Slovakia -except \"hot spot\" regions and geochemical anomalies- are not expressively contaminated. FACTS ABOUT LAND DEGRADATION IN TURKEY C. Cangif, S. Kapur\", D. Boyraz a and E. Ak\u00e7a\" a Th race University, Department of Soil Science, Tekirda_, Turkey \"\u00c7ukurova University, Department of Soil Science, Adana, Turkey ",
        "127 The soils with high production capacity cover 6.5% (5 million ha) of the total land area (77.9 million ha) in Turkey. This proportion is equal to about 1/5 of the potential agricultural soils of the country. The highly and moderately productive soils of Turkey comprise an area of 19.1 million ha. This is almost equal to one quarter (24.5%) of the country's land. However, there are 7.4 million ha land which are marginally productive, but currently used for crop production. Pasture land, forests and settlement areas cover about 4.8 million ha. About 577.293 ha of land is occupied by various industries and urban settlements, most of which are of prime quality. Un fortunately, a detailed national policy for the proper use of land in Turkey has still not being achieved, in spite of the numerous studies and tedious efforts previously devoted, by the Universities and governmental research Institutes, to the development of legislative measures to combat land degradation, which are especially related to uncontrolled industrialisation, urbanisation and erosion since the establishment of the Turkish Republic in 1923. Thus, based on previous works national land use and conservation policies need to be developed, considering the suitable and sustainable management practices and capabilities of soils, and legislative, together with socio-economic factors. Detailed soil, land use and soil quality maps need to be prepared along with appropriate modelling of major crops i.e. wheat and cotton linked to fertilisation (especially phosphorous), irrigation and use of insecticides and pesticides. Research work is already under progress in southeastern Turkey for obtaining models for sustainable \u03a1 fertilizer management and determination of the appropriate irrigation method for cotton. Detailed breeding experimentation of cotton in southern Turkey is also undertaken in the international center of cotton research based in the \u00c7ukurova University, Adana. Sites representing the historical heritage along with the riches of biodiversity should also be considered within this context. Thus, special areas, apart from the ones which are already lost to unplanned tourism and urbanisation, in the central and southern coastal parts (especially the Mersin province) of the country, should be detached as national parks associated with a multidisciplinar/ approach which will amalgamate elements of history, landscape architecture and soil/earth sciences. Sample sites such as the Karatepe, Cappadocia and Karap_nar national parks in Osmaniye, Nev_ehir and Konya respectively, disclose the coexistence of archaeological beauty with complementing components of nature (geomaterials and endemic plant species). In this regard universities and research institutions have an important role to play. One of the main agendas for land use policies in developing countries should be to establish international institutions whose prime objectives would be to tackle with land degradation in all aspects. International funds should be made available to materialize this in especially Mediterranean and/or arid regions. SOIL EROSION ESTIMATES FOR SOME WATERSHEDS IN IRAN A. J alai i an, A.M. Ghahsareh and H.R. Karimzadeh Isfahan University of Technology, College of Agriculture, Isfahan, Iran ",
        "128 There is no accurate estimate of soil erosion in different parts of Iran. In this study, twenty years records from 120 gaging stations were examined to evaluate soil erosion and sediment yield in some watersheds in Iran. From 37 subbasins in Iran, data from 24 of them were used for this study which covered more than 37 million hectares. The MPSIAC method, which uses nine factors including surface geology, soils, climate, runoff, topography, ground cover, land use, upland erosion and channel erosion was employed to estimate erosion and sediment yields for watersheds without gaging stations. The results show that watersheds under study have an average annual sediment yield of 750 tons/km 2 and an erosion yield of 2500 tons/km2. The Karkheh, Sefid-rood, maroon, Hirmand and Zohreh watersheds had the highest annual sediment yields with 1409, 967, 779, 722, and 704 tons/km 2 respectively. It is estimated that the average annual erosion rate in watersheds of Iran is 20 to 30 times of the acceptable level. Intense erosion and sedimentation has been primarily caused by: 1) over grazing (estimated 76 million sheep currently being grazed on a land area with sustainable carrying capacity of only 26 million), 2) dry farming on steep slopes and deforestation. Available information indicates that 59 % from 17 watersheds of major dams in Iran (about 8.8 million hectares) are badly degraded. Further detailed studies are recommended for soil erosion estimation in different regions of Iran. THE ROLE OF NGOS IN COMBATTING DESERTIFICATION N. G\u00fcder The Turkish Foundation for Combating Soil Erosion for Reforestation and the Protection of Natural Habitats, Istanbul, Turkey Although soil erosion and desertification are very old global problems compared to other global environmental problems which have arisen over the last few decades, they are probably the most serious but the least noticeable ones. While over exploitation of the natural resources, loss and degradation of habitats, pollution are placed at top of the environmental agenda, erosion and desertification are overlooked; the main reason for that, the soil is not considered as a limited resource such as petrol, air, potable water, and exploited in a non-sustainable way. Combating desertification is a complex process which cannot be performed by sectoral efforts, but can only be performed through an collective approach of governments, academic institutions, private sector and people. Within this picture, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) are crucial actors which can form and represent the public opinion, and can be moderators between all the institutions involved. The role of NGOs in combating desertification is vital: Lobbying: many governmental and academic institutions have inventories on soil, hydrologie and geologic structure, land use and other components. It is vital to use these information for combating desertification, therefore a national land use inventory should be made by the governments. As a result of this inventory, a national policy for combating desertification should be designed and corresponding legislative infrastructure should be made consulting all the parties. NGOs have major ",
        "129 roles in this process by enforcing the governmental institutes to initiate the necessary actions. Similarly, NGOs have roles in enforcing governments to design national land use and combating desertification policies. In order to achieve this, close financial correlation between economic development and desertification should be analysed thoroughly by the governments. All these actions can be achieved by means of successful lobbying activities by NGOs on governmental and parliament level. Furthermore, NGOs should take party in the national policy making process. Forming public opinion: results of desertification can be drastic for the whole society. To combat desertification, can be successful by public action on every level. Motivation of public power can be done through extensive public-awareness and education programs. NGOs have a major role in this process too by displaying the development-conservation relationships. Networking: NGOs have a flexible structure to achieve all these targets. They can contact directly governments, scientific institutions, private sector, foreign organizations; can represent the public opinion and influence the decision makers. It is usually easy for NGOs to find technical and financial resources, to collaborate national and foreign organizations, therefore to form a strong network. These features give an important power and major responsibility to NGOs in combating desertification. To tackle this challenge, can be achieved strong organizational structure and institutionalization. GLOBAL EFFORTS TO COMBAT DESERTIFICATION / LAND DEGRADATION S.A. Tahoun University of El-Zagazig, Egypt The natural resources of the ecosystem, including lands, have become under increasing pressure in the past few decades as they are being utilised at levels which may be higher than their inherent carrying capacity. Moreover, many lands are being misused and/or polluted. Therefore, extensive land areas in many countries are subjected to degradation, and the life-support system of an increasing world population is threatened. This case is particularly accentuated in the arid and subarid regions of the world, where land degradation is equated with desertification. The first coordinated international effort to reverse this trend can be traced back to the Stockholm UN Conference on the Human Environment, which was held in 1972. In this conference, 113 nations reached several recommendations to \"safeguard and enhance the environment for present and future generations of man\". The conference created the UN Environment Program (UNEP) which was established in Nairobi, Kenya in 1973. UNEP sponsored a conference on desertification (UNCOD) in Nairobi in 1977 where several studies on the feasibility of regional cooperation were outlined, and a world plan of action to combat desertification (PACD) was adopted. The available information at the time showed that productive land is lost at the rate of 600.000 hectares/year, and that productive land area prone to desertification is about 300 million hectares extending over 100 countries. The cost of productivity lost every year is US$ 25 billion and the needed resources to avert this loss is US$ 2.4 billion per year for 20 years. ",
        "130 Unfortunately, the PACD is not a binding document, and as such, it did not stand a fair chance to be implemented. Financial resources allotted to desertification control activities within the international aid schemes were limited. On the other hand, national governments in many desertification-prone countries did not include desertification control programs within their development plans. The UNEP assessment for the 1984/1992 period showed that desertification was still spreading, and that the world effort to combat it was short of being effective. It was estimated that income forgone due to desertification is US$ 42.3 billion/year. The problem was discussed in the UN Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) which was held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 1992. The conference produced an action oriented document known as Agenda 21 is devoted to the management of fragile ecosystems and combating desertification. Subsequently, the UN General assembly resolved in the same year to establish an Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee for the Elaboration of an International Convention to Combat Desertification (INCD). The committee held meetings in five sessions till an acceptable convention was reached by consensus in Paris in June 1994. The convention comprises a framework of general principles and an operative instrument which includes four different annexes for Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Northern Mediterranean Countries. If taken in good faith, the convention offers new hope in the struggle against desertification. It would be implemented through action programs at the national level complemented by subregional and regional programs. International aid processes would be dramatically reshaped to work through what is defined as the Global Mechanism (GM). It would ensure that funding programs are better coordinated, that funding is based on the needs of affected countries, that donors can be sure that their funds are well-spent, and that recipients obtain the maximum benefit from the available funds. The convention places strong emphasis on the \"bottom-up\" approach and local participation in decision making. For this innovative and complicated process to work, awareness campaigns are needed to inform people at all levels about the new opportunities of the convention. A committee for science and technology would be established to consider key research areas including climatology and meteorology, soil science, hydrology, botany, zoology, ecology, and social sciences. New technology and know-how would be developed, transferred to affected countries, and adapted to local circumstances. Modern communications, satellite imagery, and genetic engineering are some examples of modern tools that would be utilised to combat desertification. The supreme body of the convention is the Conference of the parties (COP), which will include the representatives of all ratifying governments. The COP may meet for the first time 90 days after 50 countries have ratified the convention. According to the current ratification rate, it is expected that the first COP meeting would take place around mid 1997. It may be worthwhile to remember that the convention with its commitments and obligations is a legally binding document, and as such, it stands a fair chance to be implemented. Therefore, it is reasonable to wait for a day in the foreseeable future, where desertification/land degradation in the arid and subarid regions of the world would be eventually checked. ",
        "im INFLUENCE OF LAND DEGRADATION ON THE DOMESTIC MARKET-GARDENING, NUTRITION AND WOMEN'S AND CHILDREN'S HEALTH IN THE ARAL SEA REGION, KAZAKHSTAN A.A. Akinova Institute of Gegraphy, National Academy of Sciences, Kazakhstan A crucial ecological situation was formed in the Aral Sea region prompting a necessity of establishment of quantitative connections between the environment and population's health. The long and uncontrolled use of the Sirdariya and Amudariya river waters for irrigation, reduced river flows into the Aral Sea leading to the exposure of a 30,000 square kilometre saline sea floor. Annually, 75 million tonnes of salt dashed out by wind erosion from this surface polluting the environment for hundreds of kilometres. Absence of rational collecting-drainage systems has led to the rise of highly mineralised ground waters. The soils are now practically unsuitable for agricultural use because of excessive enrichment by windblown and ground-water salts. A collaborative investigation was conducted by the University of London (London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine) and Kazakh Institute of Geography, National Academy of Sciences in the Aral Sea region in Kasakhstan to assess the prevalence of anaemia among women and children and to identify related factors. Nearly 62 % of the household had access to a plot of land where a variety of vegetables and fruit were grown. Analyses of questionnaires showed that meat, vegetable and fruit consumptions decreased in most of the clusters. The prevalence of anaemia among women and children was high: 45,9 % and 64,3 % respectively. Obesity was found among 5,7 % of the women and 11.8% were moderately or severely malnourished. Virtually no wasting was found among the children, but 14,1% were stunted. The prevalence of stunting increased with age. ADVERSE EFFECT OF UNCONTROLLED DEVELOPMENT OF THE URBAN AREAS ON THE AGRICULTURAL LAND IN TURKEY, A CASE STUDY AT THE MERSIN PROVINCE U. Din\u00e7, S. Senol, N.\u00f6zt\u00fcrk, H.Uzbek, M. Ding il and M. E. \u00d6ztekin \u00c7ukurova University, Department of Soil Science, Adana, Turkey In the last decades, increased pressure on agricultural lands from industry, urban and other uses, especially the surrounding large cities, created irreversible losses of natural resources such as highly productive soils. Because of the high rate of population increase and land degradation as a result of soil erosion, improper uses and land ownership laws, most of the people living in the rural areas of Turkey, have moved to large cities. The Mersin Province is a good example for this consequence. For this purpose, the topographic map published in 1963, aerial photos taken in 1975 and Landsat TM digital data acquired in 1993 were used to trace land use changes during last 30 years. All three were ",
        "1\u00ab overlaid by using GIS techniques. The Mersin province continuously spread out to the surrounding agricultural land in an increasing rate from 1963 to the present. Most of the orchards, mainly citrus, have been lost, and now they are occupied by buildings and factories. The city area increased approximately 4.3 times from 1963 to '75, 3.6 times from 1975 to '93 and 15.7 times from 1963 to '93. GLOBAL WETLANDS: A FRAGILE ECOSYSTEM VULNERABLE TO DEGRADATION H. Eswaran and P. Reich USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service, World Soil Resources, Washington. DC, USA Wetlands are disappearing at an alarming rate in many countries of the world and as a result wetland conservation has become a global challenge. Some of the issues include: 1. There is still an inadequate accounting of global extent and kinds of wetlands. National resource assessment still remains the challenge in many countries, particularly developing countries of the world. 2. International effort is needed to assist in developing guidelines and criteria to monitor ecosystem conditions which are necessary to evaluate their condition or state of health. 3. The timber, non-timber and other economic products of wetlands supported traditional communities. In these countries, there was a steady-state in the exploitation-regeneration processes taking place. But population stresses and the increased demands for wetland products are distorting the steady- state and destroying the habitat equilibrium. There is a need to create greater awareness for the inter linked nature of wetlands and associated ecosystems and the recognition that one cannot exist without the other. 4. In many countries, there is a tremendous amount of indigenous knowledge regarding wetland use and management; capturing this knowledge and using it to more scientifically manage them is a challenge that is still to be addressed adequately. 5. Information on the role of wetlands as sources and sinks of greenhouse gases is increasing; yet research, assessment, and monitoring in many countries are still in their infancy and must be enhanced. 6. More research is needed on land-use systems that are 'wetland friendly' to enable a real ecosystems approach to land management. The fragility of wetlands take on an additional importance in the context of the ecosystem as a whole. Institutional support is needed to develop this 'win-win' ethic. 7. Wetlands are non-renewable and have very low resilience or regeneration capacity. This places an additional burden when their management is considered by decision makers. 8. The hydrology of wetlands, such as marsh, peat, small water-bodies, coastal tidal lands etc., very strongly controls and interacts with the hydrology of adjoining or sorrounding uplands; wetlands become contaminated when the adjacent lands are mismanaged. ",
        "133 9. The wetland-upland land systems are non-distinguishable to waterfowl and other organisms. For habitat protection and conservation, the two must be handled in consort. Thus, creating a wetland 'island' probably defeats the purpose. Managing ecosystem niches is not an easy task; the approach must be holistic and ecosystem based. One niche may sometimes be better protected by managing an adjoining niche. 10. The positive environmental role of wetlands in national land use strategies must be emphasized to obtain the support of people to help and preserve this resource. As a first step towards the better understanding of the global magnitude and importance of wetlands, a global map was prepared as a step in the inventory. A tentative division of the kinds of wetlands was made in the absence of an accepted classification. The following table provides the area of the d i f f e r e nt k i n ds of w e t l a n ds GLOBAL DISTRIBUTION OF WETLANDS (Area in 1,000 km2; Percent is of total ice-free land surface) Percent Wetlands Kind Inland Riparian or ephemeral Organic Salt affected Permafrost affected Non wetlands Inland water bodies Total land surface Total Wetlands Area Total land 5,415 3,102 1,366 2,230 6,697 117,241 1,458 137,509 18,810 Percent 3,9 2,3 1,0 1,6 4,9 85,3 1,1 100,0 28,8 16,5 7,3 11,9 35,6 100,0 This assessment will have uses for: global assessment of sources and sinks of green house gases as wetlands are one of the more active geochemical systems; impact of global warming on wetland conditions, particularly in higher latitudes where warming will release high amounts of carbon; impacts on biodiversity due to the trans-national role of wetlands as biological habitats; impacts on landscapes if wetland systems are perturbed. BOOK REVIEWS World in Transition: The threat to Soils. 1994 Annual Report of the German Advisory Council on Global Change. Pubi. Economica Verlag, Bonn, Germany. 225pp. This report has probably not received the wide circulation it deserves and anybody interested in soil degradation will benefit significantly from the ideas and approaches in the monograph. The main section of this report deals with the global threat to soils. The importance of soils for the ecosphere ",
        "134 and the anthrosphere is demonstrated using soil-related environmental trends and their interactions. The Report considers that soil degradation as an important component of Global Change was not adequately dealt with in AGENDA 21. They emphasize the fact that the consequences of land rsource use especially as a result of population growth, will clearly precede the terrestrial effects of climate change over the next few decades. The Report looks at soil degradation as the result of excess loads on the respective ecosystem. An evaluation allowing the quantification of anthropogenic changes and their assessments with repsect to the conservation of natural resource functions and the sustainable use of land, must therefore take as its starting point the measurement of these excess loads. They stress that an important task for research in the future will be to determine the stress-bearing capacity of soils for different types of environmental issues. An innoviate part of the Report deals with the main syndromes of soil degradation. The Report defines what it considers to be the twelve most important anthropogenic \"soil diseases\". Symbolic names are given to each syndrome as listed below: 1. Changes in the traditional use of land: the \"Huang He Syndrome\" 2. Soil degradation through mechanized farming: the \"Dust Bowl Syndrome\" 3. Over-exploitation of marginal lands: the \"Sahel Syndrome\" 4. Conversation and/or over-exploitation of forests and other ecosystems: the \"Sarawak Syndrome\" 5. Mismanagement of large-scale agricultural projects: the \"Aral Sea Syndrome\" 6. Long-range transport of nutrients and pollutants: the \"Acid Rain Syndrome\" 7. Local soil contamination, accumulation of waste and inherited pollution: the \"Bitterfeld Syndrome\" 8. Uncontrolled urbanization: the \"Sao Paulo Syndrome\" 9. Over development and over-expansion of infrastructure: the \"Los Angeles Syndrome\" 10. Mining and prospecting: the \"Katanga Syndrome\" 11. Soil and land degradation through tourism: the \"Alps Syndrome\" 12. Soil and land degardtion as a result of war and military action: the \"Scorched Earth Syndrome\" The Report concludes that, in view of seriousness of the problems, a new efficient institutional framework should now be established and that global soil protection should receive similar attention on the international agenda as has been achieved for climate change. Current Conditions of Ecosystem of Mongolia. I. Szabolcs. Map at scale of 1:1,000,000. Russian-Mongolian Complex Biological Expedition. The map and report reflects the ecological situation in Mongolia indicating anthropogenic processes and soil degradation. More than 300 types of ecosystems are recognized. The report provides data on the degree of anthropic pressure on the environment and becomes a useful basis for future investigations and monitoring.

        "135 The report gives an overview of land degradation in South Asian countries and examines its degree, causes, and effects on land productivity. It also provides a review of programs and institutions in place to combat land degradation and makes proposals to strengthen them. Salinisation of Land and Water Resources. Human causes, extent, management, and case studies. F. Ghassemi, A.J. Jakeman and H.A. Nix. CAB International, Wallingford. 1995. The book evaluates the extent, human causes and management of salinisation. Procedures used in different countries are provided. An intresting feature of the book is the case studies that attempt to determine the causes of salinity in individual countries. ANNOUNCEMENT SECOND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON LAND DEGRADATION: MEETING THE CHALLENGES OF LAND DEGRADATION IN THE 21ST CENTURY KHON KAEN, THAILAND JANUARY 22-31, 1999 Land degradation, either natural or induced by humans, is an important concern affecting the wealth of nations, food security, and the quality of life. AGENDA 21 of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED 1992) emphasized the need for and proposes a wide range of activities to address land degradation in general and desertification in particular. Although much has been said and written about land degradation, there is still much conjecture on the subject as few countries have developed the techniques to measure degradation and subsequently develop spatial or other databases which enable the quantification of the process. Some of the immediate needs include: \u2022 improved procedures to assess degradation at different scales- global, national, and local; \u2022 evaluation of resilience capacities of land and methods to implement the concept; \u2022 development of indicators of land degradation for use at all planning levels; \u2022 development of mitigating technologies, and \u2022 assisting development and implementation of appropriate national policies. The First International Conference organised in Adana, Turkey (June 10-14, 1996), expressed the need to evaluate the science of land degradation. This was in response to the very high amounts of donor funds allocated to address land degradation without adequate information of the kinds, degree, and extent of the degradation problem prevailing in the country. In some instances, as the causes of degradation are not well appreciated, corrective measures through such bi-lateral projects have minimal impact. Land Degradation science is the domain of soil scientists. However, the processes are human induced and consequently social sciences and the understanding of socioeconomic factors causing the degradation is an important factor in developing mitigating technologies. There are also examples of situations where poor national land use policies have accelerated erosion and decline in ",
        "136 quality of the soil. Land degradation science is thus an excellent example of the need to integrate, not only the sub-disciplines of soil science but also other disciplines including the policy arena. The 2nd International Conference is organized to address some or all of these issues. \u2022 The purpose of the conference stems from the fact that: \u2022 sustainable development requires an active national program of natural resource conservation and management; \u2022 sustainable land management, of which soil, water, and nutrient management are the most critical components, contributes to food security and income generation; \u2022 a partial solution to the problem of addressing land degradation includes providing information to decison makers which enables them to make assessmnets on locations and rates of degradation and target appropriate technology; \u2022 through the collection of vital quantitative data on all aspects of degradation and their use in information technology, a powerful tool becomes available for decison making; \u2022 the larger goal of making agriculture friendly to the environment, is only attained by appropriate land management. The conference will be organized around technical presentations, poster sessions, and working group discussions on the following topics: Tools for identification, assessment, and Mitigating technologies - conservation tillage monitoring - identification - ecosystem based management - processes, resilience characteristics of land - water quantity and quality systems - use of information technologies - Food security, biodiversity, and environmental application of system models impacts Land cover and land use - quality of life - deforestation, shifting cultivation - environmentally friendly agriculture - urban and peri-urban linkages Effects of global climate change - soil pollution - soil conditions -mismatch between agricultural systems and ecosystems conditions Land management and land use policies Research and development issues -economics of land degradation - early warning indicators - societal role - monitoring networks -indigenous knowledge -policy framework ",
