        "3 Introduction Based on the experience of the Monitoring Agriculture with Remote Sensing (MARS) system in Europe, the European Commission decided in 2001 to enlarge its crop monitoring activities to other regions of the world. The MARS-FOOD group was established to focus on countries outside Europe and support the Food Aid and Food Security policy of the European Commission by improving methods and real-time information on crop prospects. Now, MARS-FOOD is also providing support and advice in food security information systems and food related need assessments. Concerning the crop monitoring activities, focus has been given to a number of key areas in the world, namely Russia and Central Asia, the Mediterranean Basin, the Horn of Africa and South America (MERCOSUR plus Bolivia). These areas are closely monitored and regular crop situation analysis and reports are issued, based on meteorological and remote sensing data, crop modelling and statistical analysis. Data are also acquired and yield indicators calculated for the rest of the world, but in that case, full analyses are only carried out on an ad-hoc basis. Together with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), JRC has invested during past years in the development and management of regional scientific networks on crop monitoring and yield forecasting. Regional workshops were organized in Cordoba, Argentina in 2002 and in Nairobi, Kenya in 2003, covering respectively South America and the Horn of Africa. Workshop proceedings were produced, dedicated web sites and discussion forum were set up, data and experiences were exchanged. The Workshop on Crop Monitoring and Statistics in Russia and Central Asia (Ispra, Italy, 2004) represented the first step for the constitution of a scientific network in Crop Monitoring and Yield Forecasting in the region. The two days enabled to make the state of the art in crop forecasting and agricultural statistics in Russia and Central Asia, and to have a rich exchange of experiences and methods. The countries of the region can be roughly subdivided into two groups as far as the approaches utilized for agricultural monitoring are concerned. The first group is formed by the countries of the former USSR, which used to share the same reference methodology not so long ago. The situation with the agro-meteorological monitoring in these countries changed after the collapse of the USSR. However, in the majority of the countries of this group, agro- meteorological services still use in essence approaches developed in the Soviet time. The agro-meteorological service of Russia is the most direct continuer of these approaches, which are being used and further developed. In Kazakhstan, the traditional Soviet school of agro- meteorology is blended with a number of adapted \"western\" approaches (for example, simulation of crop growth from the Netherlands, or use of remote sensing methods from the US Department of Agriculture). In practically all the remaining Asian states of the former USSR, FAO has carried out an important capacity building in agro-meteorology with the re- training of the national agro-meteorology experts. In the second group of countries, the monitoring activities are conducted with systems derived from the FAO or USDA approaches, adapted to the local conditions. Moreover, in various countries of region, agro-meteorological monitoring is achieved directly a FAO project, or conducted under the management of the specialists of this organization. It is also necessary to note the IWMI (International Water Management Institute) activities in course for the creation ",
        "4 of a regional remote sensing system for drought monitoring in South-West Asia, which will cover the Central-Asian states of the region. In the present document, the contributions to the workshop by the country representatives are assembled, as well as articles by FAO and JRC specialists. We hope that this volume will help the reader to get a good picture of the state of the art for agro-meteorological monitoring in Russia and the countries of Central Asia, and that it will provide useful material to specialists in agro-meteorology and agricultural monitoring to further improve their knowledge and work.

        "5 AGRO-METEOROLOGICAL MONITORING FOR RUSSIA AND CENTRAL ASIAN COUNTRIES: MARS-FOOD APPROACH Igor Savin, Thierry N\u00e8gre Institute for the protection and Security of the Citizen, JRC Introduction Based on the experience of Monitoring Agriculture with Remote Sensing (MARS) project in Europe the European Commission decided to enlarge the monitoring activities to others regions on the world. The MARS FOOD group (Crop monitoring for food security) was established to focus on countries outside Europe. This activity mainly supports the Food Aid and Food Security policy of the European Commission. MARS FOOD is member of the strategy group for the GSE - ESA Global Monitoring for Food Security (GMFS) project (http://www.gmes.info/), and partner in the GEOLAND Project (Observatory for Crop Monitoring and Food Security) (http://www.gmes-geoland.info). The activities are aimed at improving methods and information on crop yield prospects. Russia and Central Asia, the Mediterranean Basin, Eastern Africa (IGAD sub-region) and the MERCOSUR in South America were selected as pilot areas during the demonstration phase (2001-2004). The pilot area \u201cRussia and Central Asia\u201d includes all former USSR republics situated in Asia (Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan), Russia, Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, as well as western part of China, and northern parts of India, Pakistan, and Nepal (fig.1). Fig. 1. Pilot area \u201cRussia and Central Asia\u201d The main crops cultivated in the countries of the region and their significance in the country food consumption are summarized in the table 1. Potato, wheat, barley and maize are cultivated in all countries of the region, and rice is cultivated in many countries too. Practically all these crops are cultivated for food. Only barley is used primarily for animal feed.

        "7 The monitoring of agro-meteorological conditions is based on the analysis of so-called indicators of crop growth and crop status. Three groups of indicators are considered: meteorological, remote sensing, and statistical indicators. First of all each indicator is analyzed separately, and compare with previous season and with long-term average values. The general conclusion about agro-meteorological conditions and crop status is made based on the results of the analysis of all single indicators. For the Area the analysis is concentrated on the main crops. Results of the analysis are summarized in form of a Bulletin. The time schedule for the Bulletins preparation during a year is defined as follows: Dates for the preparation of the MARS-FOOD AID Bulletin: Region & period number date Russia & Central Asian Countries: 1 November - 1 March CIS & CWA N 1 15 March 1 March \u2013 1 May CIS & CWA N 2 15 May 1 May \u2013 1 July CIS & CWA N 3 15 July 1 July \u2013 1 September CIS & CWA N 4 15 September 1 September \u2013 1 November CIS & CWA N 5 15 November The Bulletin is distributed to a user community for comments and suggestions and is freely accessible on the AGRIFISH MARS-FOOD web site at http://agrifish.jrc.it/marsfood/Bulletins/centralasia.htm. Users are encouraged to send feed- back and comments, which are taken into account to further improvement of the Bulletins. Crops The first Bulletins of the calendar year are dedicated to the analysis of the meteorological conditions for winter cereals. Practically in all countries of the region, wheat and barley are the main winter crops. Additionally, sugar cane and rapeseeds are cultivated in winter in Northern India, Northern Pakistan, Western China and Northern Nepal, as well as potatoes and fodder crops in Afghanistan, and rice in Northern India. Practically all winter crops in Russia and Kazakhstan are cultivated in rain-fed conditions. In Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Georgia and Armenia near 30% of winter crops are irrigated. In Kyrgyzstan, Azerbaijan, Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan near 40-70% of winter crops are cultivated in irrigated conditions. And in Turkmenistan, Kuwait, Northern India, Northern Pakistan, Western China and Northern Nepal practically all winter crops are irrigated. In many countries of the region, more than 90% of cereals are cultivated as winter crops. However, in Russia near 70% of wheat and more than 90% of barley are spring crops. In Kazakhstan, practically all barley and more than 90% of wheat are spring crops too. Near 90% of barley is spring crop in Armenia and Kyrgyzstan. Maize, rice and potato are other important crops, which are cultivated in summer in most countries of the region. The Bulletins of the second half of the year are dedicated to the analysis of summer crops. Crop Growth Indicators The monitoring of the agro-meteorological situation is based on the analysis of the following dekadal data: minimal, maximal and average air temperature, sums of precipitation and global radiation, dekadal values of the climatic water balance, dekadal maps of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Indexes (NDVI), maps and graphs of Dry Matter production modeling outputs, and on the analysis of the long-term statistical yield records. Meteorological Indicators Meteorological data are derived from the outputs of the numerical meteorological model from the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) (UK) ",
        "8 (http://www.ecmwf.int/index.html), and were prepared for analysis by METEOCONSULT (NL). The analysis of meteorological indicators is focused on the monitoring of radiation and temperature regimes, and on the monitoring of precipitation and climatic water balance. The monitoring is based on the comparison between the indicators behavior during the period of analysis and its behavior during the same period of the previous year and long-term average. The results of the analysis are presented in the form of difference maps, and in the form of a table with a text. The colors in the map show the difference between indicators with reference to the previous season, while hatching shows real amount of precipitation, climatic water balance, or percent deviation in radiation sum (fig.3). All maps are accompanied with one a more graphs, which reflect the behavior of one indicator in comparison with the previous season (fig.4). Fig. 3.Difference in Precipitation Sum (mm) for the period May-June between 2003 and 2002 (only for units with winter crops). Horizontal hatching shows regions with an amount of precipitation less than 20 mm during May-June 2003, vertical hatching shows regions with an amount of precipitation more than 200 mm for the same period.

Comparison with the conditions of previous year: hatchings show units, where: br \u2013 better radiation regime; bm \u2013 better moisture regime; wr \u2013 worse radiation regime; wm \u2013 worse moisture regime ) Remote Sensing Indicators SPOT-VEGETATION data are used as a basis for calculation of the remote sensing indicators for crop growth. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is used as a basis of remote sensing indicators calculations. The traditional approach for NDVI calculation is applied: where R r and R n is respectively reflection in the red and infrared parts of the spectrum Daily remote sensing data are preprocessed by VITO (BE) (http://www.vito.be/). The results of the NDVI calculation are presented in form of decadal and monthly maps of actual NDVI values, and maps of difference of the NDVI with previous year and long-term average values (fig.6). After preprocessing, dekadal maximal NDVI values are weighted for pixels where crops are actually cultivated, for each country of the region. Thus, weighted NDVI values are aggregated used as a main indicator of crop status. The use of the crop specific NDVI curves improves notably the accuracy of the analysis, as compared to simple NDVI curve. The representativity of the curves depends very much on the quality of the crop mask used. The crop masks used are an approximation of reality and refers to the particular year in the past. However, figure 7 illustrates how the use of the weighted NDVI can differentiate crop specific growing cycle and thus improve quality of analysis. r n r n R R R R NDVI +\u2212 = ",

        "11 In Russia, the NDVI analysis is conducted additionally for selected segments, where a certain crop is very dominant (for example 108 pixels evenly distributed throughout all Russia for winter wheat growth monitoring) (fig.8). Fig. 8. Point NDVI values dynamics for the pixels with winter wheat in Southern Russia. A more advanced remote sensing indicator used for crop growth monitoring is the Dry Matter Production (DMP). DMP is calculated on the basis of SPOT-VEGETATION data and information about global radiation, applying the Monteith approach: where: \u2022 R 1 [J/m\u00b2/day] is the incoming shortwave solar radiation (200-3000 nm); \u2022 fAPAR 1 [-] is the PAR-fraction absorbed by the green vegetation; \u2022 \u03b5 (T 1 ) [kgDM/JPAR] radiation use efficiency. (Monteith, 1972) DMP-images are expressed in DgDM/ha/day (DgDM=dekagram Dry Matter). Multitemporal time series analysis and multi-annual comparisons offer interesting ways for the monitoring of the vegetation state throughout the year. The results of the DMP analysis are presented in the form of maps of actual DMP values for the current dekad and in the form of difference maps (fig. 9). Difference maps present the difference in dry matter accumulation between the current dekad and the same dekad of the previous year or long-term average. The modeling results are also represented in the maps and graphs showing dry matter production values accumulated from the start of the crop growth season. These maps are visualized in the form of difference maps too (fig. 10). 19 0 50 100 150 200 250 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 25 27 29 31 33 35 2000 2001 2002 69 0 50 100 150 200 250 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 25 27 29 31 33 35 2000 2001 2002 1 0 50 100 150 200 250 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 25 27 29 31 33 35 2000 2001 2002 10000 ) ( 48 . 0 1 1 1 1 \u22c5 \u22c5 \u22c5 \u22c5 = T fAPAR R DMP \u03b5 ",

Briefly, the main idea of the proposed approach is the following. NDVI is at present one of most widely used remotely sensed indexes applied for crop growth monitoring and yield forecast. Usually, conclusions about crop status are obtained by comparing NDVI values designed for the same date of two consecutive years, or with average long-term value. The main shortcoming of this approach is that the development stage reached at a given date may vary between years. It is proposed to use \"crop stage NDVI mosaics\". These mosaics are built not for a given calendar date, but for a certain phenological stage of crop development (for example, for the flowering stage). Then inter annual comparison of the mosaics is used for crop growth monitoring and yield forecasting. Figure 11 contains one example of practical use of the crop stage NDVI mosaics. ",

        "14 Crop stage NDVI values as well as crop stage DMP values will be used in the future as one of the main remote sensing indicator of crop growth. Statistical Indicators The analysis of statistical crop yield long-term series gives additional information for crop yield prediction. Descriptive statistics for the series of 15 years gives information about yield values variability. In particular, the maximal deviations from the average value and from the trend line can be used as indicators of potential minimal and maximal yield. Additionally, the analysis of the statistical yield series includes a trend analysis, and an analysis of the periodic behavior of the yield curve. Figures 17 and 18 illustrate some results of the analysis of potato yield data by administrative units, and Figure 19 gives an example of the potato statistical yield behavior for some regions of Russia. When the periodicity is evident it seems possible to foresee qualitatively (higher or lower) the behavior of the statistical yield in the following year. Fig.17. Long-term trend in the potato yield ( neg \u2013 negative; pos \u2013 positive, 0 \u2013 trend not exists) and level of confidence in its identification (figures from 1 \u2013 low to 3 \u2013high).

Preliminary Approach for crop yield forecasting This approach for yield forecasting was first introduced in 2004 for winter wheat, and is currently in an evolution and streamlining process. The preliminary winter wheat yield figures were obtained through the analysis of all indicators mentioned in the Bulletin. The first approximation for the yield prediction was made based on the analysis of the statistical yield curve behavior (with expert analysis of linear trend, evidence of periodic behavior, and descriptive statistics for last 15 years). Figure 20 contains long-term statistical yield data for wheat in the Tiumen region of Russia, and shows the steps followed in the analysis. The rose bar indicates the extreme deviation of the yield values from the trend line (black). The analysis shows that the probability that the following year (2004) will be local maximum for the yield is high. Therefore, the green lines indicate the range of the most probable wheat yield value in 2004 with the assumption that the yield will be equal to 2003 (corrected by trend). The behaviour of the cumulated climatic water balance (CWB) and the cumulated precipitation were analyzed in a similar way. Figure 21 gives a simple example of such an analysis. The analysis of the CWB curve shows that the cumulated CWB for the region under analysis is better for wheat than in previous season, and better than long-term average value. Based on the assumption that the CWB is a good indicator of the yield it is possible to conclude that the wheat yield in 2004 should be higher than the long-term average value (red line on the right plot), and should be higher than the previous year. Applying the extreme deviation from the trend line, it seems possible to conclude that the wheat yield should be in the green sector of the right plot. Of course, such approach has limits because the crop yield depends on many other factors. However, we use the results of such analysis with caution, and only for confirmation of the tendency established during analysis of the statistical yield curves behaviour. ",

Example of the analysis of meteorological indicators (left plot presents cumulated CWB for Northern Iran, and right plot \u2013 statistical yield of wheat in Iran). As a result, broad ranges of expected yield values are assigned for all countries of the region. Then, a regression analysis between the statistical yield values and separate crop growth indicators is conducted. The indicators selected are: maximum seasonal NDVI value, amount of precipitation cumulated from the beginning of October of previous year, cumulated climatic water balance for the same period (CWB), and the results of dry matter (DMP) accumulation modeling (cumulated for the same period). These indicators were first aggregated for the areas with winter wheat at country level. The regression equations values were statistically significant for Azerbaijan, Georgia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan, between yield and Precipitation sum for Armenia, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Iran, and Iraq, and between yield and DMP for Tajikistan and some regions of Russia. The results of the regression analysis are used to obtain the second approximation of the yields for the countries for which regression equations were established. Finally, the similarity analysis method (search of the year with the similar behavior of the indicator) is applied for the NDVI and DMP curves.

The year \u2013 analogues for the countries of the region, and the corresponding statistical yield constitute the third approximation of the yield. A simple example of the analysis of year - analogue for the NDVI curves behaviour is presented in figure 22. The NDVI 2004 maximum value for rice in Tajikistan is closest to the maximum of the 2003 season. This is a good evidence that the development of vegetation for rice areas in 2004 was similar to the previous season, and that the rice yield which is likely to be close to the yield of the previous season. The analysis of the NDVI curve profiles for the areas with potato in Uzbekistan shows that the NDVI behaviour in 2004 was close to the two previous years. The final wheat yield expectation figures are then obtained through the expert analysis of all yield prediction values, taking into consideration the qualitative analysis of other meteorological indicators, as well as other auxiliary information available. The results are presented in the Bulletin with information about the reliability of the predicted yield values for the different countries of the area. Fig.22. Example of year \u2013 analogues for maximal NDVI values (left) and for NDVI curve form (right). Agro-meteorological Bulletins Agro-meteorological Bulletins (available at the ftp://agrifish.jrc.it/bulletin/ ) contain overview of the agro-meteorological situation during the period under analysis and the crop status assessment at the end of the period. Each Bulletin contains the following sections: - Introduction; - Highlights Country per Country; - Results of the Analysis; - Radiation and Temperature Regime; - Precipitation Sum; - Climatic Water Balance; - Remote Sensing Indicators; - Dry Matter Production modeling; - Statistical Data Analysis (only in one Bulletin per year); - Yield Prediction (not in all Bulletins). ",
        "18 The Introduction contains info about crops, crop development status and a short description of the methodological approaches applied. Highlights give short information about the agro- meteorological conditions during the period under analysis at country level. The analysis of all crop growth indicators is summarized in the page \u201cResults of the Analysis\u201d. The page \u201cRadiation and Temperature Regime\u201d depicts the situation of these meteorological indicators with emphasis on maximal temperatures during the summer period and on minimal temperatures during the winter period. The pages \u201cPrecipitation Sum\u201d and \u201cClimatic Water Balance\u201d include results of the analysis for these two crop growth indicators. The analysis of the NDVI curves and results for the Dry Matter Production modeling are presented in the corresponding pages. Statistical data are analyzed only one time per year on the base of long- term statistical data for a given crop, including last year statistical information. Practically all pages of the Bulletins have a predefined structure, and include presentation of the results in the form of maps, tables and texts. Further development New crop growth indicators will be obtained on the basis of Crop Growth Monitoring System (CGMS) (Supit et al., 1994; Supit, van der Goot, 2005), which simulates crop growth. The European CGMS was modified (Savin et al., 2004), and will be run on the new Database with updated meteo, crop and soil files. The CGMS was elaborated more than 10 years ago to be applied on the European continent, with input parameters prepared according to European conditions. One of the main conditions was to have an operational system with a complete coverage of input data for the whole of Europe. As land use data were not available for each country, the simulation units could not be based on actual land use. Soil suitability was applied as an alternative. The same holds for the simulation of ground water influence. To simulate the capillary rise from ground water, the CGMS needs detailed data on soil physics (hydraulic conductivity). But, these data are not available for the whole continent so it was decided to only implement free drainage even for soils with shallow ground water levels. In some occasions data on land cover and more detailed soil physics are available. The new CGMS offers the user the choice to work with land cover or groundwater influence in the case data exist. In the early to 1990s, the usage of forecasted weather (such as ECMWF) was not considered. However, recent studies have proved that some of the weather variables could be replaced by forecasted weather without reducing accuracy or reliability. Especially for areas outside Europe the usage of forecasted weather could be an attractive alternative for ground observed weather data. In these areas, the ground network weather stations is characterised by low density and time series are often incomplete and/or difficult to acquire. Besides the forecasted weather has the advantage of a full spatial coverage while the ground observed data still have to be interpolated. This interpolation procedure introduces extra uncertainty. When both data sources (observed station weather and forecasted grid weather) are available within the CGMS it becomes possible to compare and optimise the usage of both data sources within the CGMS. The natural conditions for crop growth in the non-Europe areas of the window can be quite different as compared to the European continent. In the semi arid and continental areas harsh conditions like drought, snow and low temperatures far below zero occur. In the former soviet republics the initial soil moisture has a large influence on the final crop yield. A reliable estimation of the initial soil moisture is still a problem but at least the CGMS should offer the possibility to enter this parameter per simulation unit, per year and for a certain date such as the day just after the snow has melted. The loss of winter crops biomass caused by severe winter conditions is difficult to simulate. In practice, one could solve this problem to halt the ",
        "19 simulation on a certain date in fall and restart simulation after winter. Remote sensing data can be used to estimate the biomass fraction that has been lost. The new CGMS version considers these conditions. The CGMS uses the weather data and simulated crop indicators not only to monitor the current growing season but also as an input for the yield forecasting procedure. The current yield forecast procedure of the European system consists of the CGMS yield forecast procedure (also referred to as \u201cCGMS level 3\u201d) and additional procedures to refine and adjust the first crop yield forecast produced by CGMS level 3. The CGMS level 3 uses agricultural yield statistics and simulated crop indicators. This system consists of a linear regression model combining the mean yield, a linear \u201ctechnological\u201d time trend and a linear regression function to explain the residual variation. The residual variation is modelled as a function of crop growth simulation results. These simulated crop indicators account for the inter-annual yield variation that resulted from weather variability. CGMS level 3 uses only 4 possible indicators (potential and water limited simulated biomass and storage organs). In practice many more indicators could be used to explain the inter-annual yield variation like simulated leaf area index, simulated soil moisture, simulated development stage, meteorological indicators (for example the sum of rainfall during flowering) and remote sensing indicators. Besides the application of CGMS level 3, the MARS analysts frequently use other procedures such as scenario analysis or other externally defined equations to estimate the yield forecast. It needs no further explanation that these procedures should be integrated in one tool based on the current CGMS level 3. This tool offers the option to choose among a wide list of indicators, a sub set to be used in the regression module (linear). This list also is used to select indicators for the scenario analysis and user defined equations. The choice between different simulation options, the need to define different indicators and the need to import data in an user friendly way requires a major update of the current user interface of the CGMS version 2.1. The user interface is extended with the option to select administrative regions with the purpose to simulate crop growth and forecast yield only for this region. Conclusion The MARS-FOOD approach for agro-meteorological monitoring for Russia and Central Asian Countries is based on the analysis of different crop growth indicators, which belong to three main groups: meteorological indicators, remote sensing indicators, and statistical indicators. The monitoring is conducted on a dekadal basis, and the results of the analysis are summarized in form of Agro-meteorological Bulletins. The bulletins contain results of qualitative analysis of crop growth indicators behavior and of favorability of current meteorological conditions for crop growth. The main part of the bulletins is devoted to the analysis of the situation for winter wheat growth. A small part of the bulletins of the season is devoted to the analysis of the situation for summer crops (maize, rice, and potato). First attempts for the quantitative crop yield forecasting were made in the last Bulletins. The methodology under development is based on the combination of statistical yield behavior analysis, regression analysis between statistical yield and different crop growth indicators, and similarity analysis for different indicators. Further development of the methodology include the extraction of more crop specific indicators (relative time crop growth indicators), and with the use of crop growth simulation models to obtain additional indicators of crop growth.

        "21 FAO ACTIVITIES IN DEVELOPING AGRO-METEOROLOGICAL TOOLS AND METHODS Michele Bernardi, Ren\u00e9 Gommes Environment and Natural Resources Service Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations Introduction The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is the lead agency of the United Nations for crop and livestock agriculture, forestry, fisheries and rural development with the mandate to alleviate poverty and hunger by promoting agricultural development and improved nutrition. A specific priority of the Organization is encouraging sustainable agriculture and rural development, a long- term strategy for increasing food production and food security while conserving and managing natural resources. The target of FAO\u2019s activities is reducing food insecurity in the world especially in developing countries and countries in transition and this commitment was further re-iterated at the World Food Summit (FAO, 1996) where a Plan of Action was adopted aiming at reducing the number of the world's hungry people in half by 2015. The commitment was renewed at the World Food Summit: Five Years Later (Rome, 2002b). This approach targets, among others, the increase of food production and improved access to food, but there is also a need to monitor the current food supply and demand situation, in order to plan for interventions whenever the possibility of famine and malnutrition exists. With an imminent food crisis, actions need to be taken as early as possible as it takes time to mobilize resources and because logistic operations are often hampered by adverse natural or man-made conditions, including war and civil strife. The availability of objective and timely information is, therefore, crucial and it can be achieved by setting up an operational Food Security Information and Early Warning System (FSIEWS). This paper provides a general description of the structure of the FSIEWS, in which timely and reliable agro-meteorological information has a crucial role, and describes how FAO has, in the last 20 years, supported the enhancement of its quality and quantity. This was done through the development of appropriate tools and methods in line with the technological progress of software, hardware and communication facilities but also by the availability of a large choice of geo-referenced data. The development of tools and methods always proceeded in a total and continuous synergy with field projects, where FAO\u2019s main investment is represented by their \u201ccapacity building\u201d. Since the 1970s FAO has been active in supporting the establishment, improvement and reinforcement of national food information systems, which are the main structure of food security monitoring. Definition of Food Security At the World Food Summit (Rome, 1996) food security was defined as the situation \u201c[\u2026] when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life.\" This definition links the four aspects of food security: availability of staple foods , stability of supplies , access for all to these supplies and the biological utilization of food (FAO, 2001b). ",
        "22 Needs for Food Security Information Forecasting is the basic element of all warning systems, and it must be applied to the four aspects of food security (availability, stability, access and biological utilization), giving decision-makers enough time o react to the warning, with as high as possible a degree of reliability (the more long- term the forecasts the less reliable they are). The lack of systematic information is a serious constraint to effective planning of commercial and non-commercial food imports, and monitoring relief operations, including targeting of beneficiaries and matching types, quantities, timing and duration of relief to actual requirements. For this purpose, there is a need for timely crop forecasts, plus information on cross border or internal flows of people, food and livestock, grazing conditions and herd sizes, market prices of agricultural inputs, basic foods and livestock, and other major determinants and indicators of the food security status and risks of acutely and chronically vulnerable groups. Structure of a FSIEWS Most of the existing food-security monitoring systems are organized around the following four main pillars: (cid:190) Agricultural production monitoring ( APM ), normally combined with monitoring of the products of livestock farming; (cid:190) Market information system ( MIS ) that usually monitors domestic trade and sometimes international trade (import/export); (cid:190) Social monitoring of the most vulnerable populations or monitoring of groups at risk ( MGR ) that focus on monitoring poverty; (cid:190) Food and nutritional surveillance system (also called food and nutrition monitoring) ( FNSS ), which generally, depending on the situation, monitors the health and nutritional status of populations. These four pillars are generally country-wide and linked to the technical services of each of the ministries concerned. They have specific aims and set up their own means and organization but it is fundamental that all of them set up an integrated system. Thus the monitoring of food availability (production + imports - exports - losses) should be supported by monitoring information on both production and foreign trade supplied by the Market Information System; the monitoring of the stability of supplies uses data mainly from the Market Information System, as well as data on the status of infrastructure and stocks; the monitoring of access to these supplies should take into account mainly social indicators (poverty, unemployment, migrations etc.); and the monitoring of biological utilization should use data acquired from health and nutritional monitoring. Figure 1 shows the conceptual framework of the FSIEWS (FAO, 2001b). The FSIEWS in CIS countries Food insecurity continues to be an issue for vulnerable populations in the low-income food-deficit countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and, in particular, in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. However, food security is not given a high policy priority. In addition, the nature of the food security problems and the policy actions needed are poorly understood. This is partly because former centrally planned countries tend to emphasize the availability of food and to underestimate the importance of access to food and its adequate use and utilization. ",
        "23 Fig. 1. The conceptual framework of a Food Security Information and Early Warning System. Before 1995, CIS members received significant volumes of food aid. Subsequently, the European Community, considering food aid an unsuitable implement in emerging market economies, set up the EC Food Security Programme (FSP). Under this Programme, targeted countries receive budget assistance if the conditions agreed each year between the EC and the respective governments are met. One such condition is the preparation each quarter of a Food Security Bulletin by a national Food Security Information System (FSIS). This bulletin provides governments and the donor community with data and an analysis of developments in the FS situation in each country, facilitating the formulation of appropriate policies and the targeting of assistance. However, during the production of the bulletin, it became apparent that the analytical capacity of the FSIS in member countries needed to be strengthened. ",
        "24 For this reason, under an umbrella agreement between the EC Food Security Programme and FAO the following project was approved: \u201cIntensified Monitoring of Food Security in Five CIS Low- income Food-deficit Countries\u201d (code: GCPS/INT/814/EC). Initially, the project focused on training of government and other experts to gather food security-related information and work closely with the FAO Global Information and Early Warning System (GIEWS), to improve GIEWS monitoring and reporting, and to provide better assessments to the donor community. Following the creation of national FSISs in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Kyrgyzstan, the project focus was moved to training members of the in-country FSIS to prepare their own reports and assessments. The main objective of the project was to build the capacity of the national governments, in particular the FSIEWS, to carry out food security analyses and provide early warning of potential setbacks to food security. This would be achieved by the provision of training in the following areas: (cid:190) The concept of food security and frameworks for analysis; (cid:190) The construction of commodity supply and utilization accounts, and national food balances; (cid:190) The analysis of the household budget survey (HBS) to obtain the maximum amount of food security information; (cid:190) Crop monitoring and forecasting techniques to facilitate early warning; (cid:190) The development and maintenance of a food security database to enable the FSIS to have access to the data needed for analysis and to construct early warning and other food and nutrition security indicators. Training in crop monitoring and forecasting took the form of a one-week course by Russian- speaking agro-meteorologists, using a specially prepared training manual in English and Russian. The course introduced selected members of the FSIS, from the Meteorology Office and from the Ministry of Agriculture, to current methodologies for crop forecasting and introduced participants to the GIEWS Workstation and satellite imagery. The participants became acquainted with the tools but were not adequately enabled in their use. However, the training increased collaboration among the staff of the three ministries concerned. More information about the specific activities can be found at the project\u2019s website at: http://www.fnsproject.org/en/index.html. The Agmet Component of FSIEWS The agro-meteorological component of the FSIEWS is integrated into the agricultural production monitoring, particularly, concerning cereal crops and pasture. Most of the crop monitoring and forecasting methods are developed around the water balance calculated during the growing season and take into account the phenological development of the plant. The monitoring of rainfed crops is based on the following principal tools: (cid:190) Use of real-time meteorological data; (cid:190) Use of crop specific water balance models; (cid:190) Processing of real-time satellite images (mainly by NOAA 1 , SPOT-Vegetation 2 and Meteosat 3 satellites); 1 The NOAA satellite produces digital images from which a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is obtained. NDVI provides a measure of the amount and vigor of vegetation at the land surface. The magnitude of NDVI is related to the level of photosynthetic activity in the observed vegetation. In general, higher values of NDVI indicate greater vigor and amounts of vegetation. NDVI is derived from data collected by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellites, and processed by the Global Inventory Monitoring and Modeling Studies (GIMMS) at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). NDVI is a nonlinear function that varies between -1 and +1. Values of NDVI for vegetated land generally range from about 0.1 to 0.7, with values greater than 0.5 indicating dense vegetation. This satellite index is largely correlated with the volume of living vegetation. In arid and semi-arid conditions the state of crops and the surrounding vegetation are closely linked. ",
        "25 (cid:190) Use of spatial interpolation tools; (cid:190) Use of gridded surfaces of crop-related parameters derived or not from satellite images (e.g. soil water holding capacity, soil type, land cover, land use, crop area sample, etc.); (cid:190) Use of seasonal forecasts; (cid:190) Field sample surveys, mainly for harvest estimates. These tools can be used for rapid qualitative evaluations of crop status (development, stage in the cycle, condition, etc.), which can become quantitative depending on the availability of additional information (agronomic data, statistics on yields, long-term time series, etc.) and providing the information is validated. The Agro-meteorology Unit of FAO The Agro-meteorology Unit is part of the Environment and Natural Resources Service (SDRN) in the Department for Sustainable Development. SDRN is the FAO focal point for environmental data. The Agro-meteorology Unit collects near real-time meteorological data (mainly precipitation) from various sources for several hundred stations around the world to be used for the agro-meteorological crop monitoring and yield forecasting. Reference data, covering almost 30 000 weather stations worldwide, including normals (30-year averages) as well as time series, come from various published and unpublished sources, mainly National Meteorological Services and international research centres. Since 1978, Food Security Information and Early Warning Systems have been established in almost 50 countries worldwide and, as mentioned above, the agro-meteorological component is an integral part of the structure of the FSIEWS. In conceiving and implementing field projects aiming at the creation of the FSIEWS, a great attention (also in terms of budget) has always been devoted to capacity building. To achieve this goal, three axes are followed: (cid:190) Direct and permanent link with national agro-meteorological services and regional institutions to avoid to build a new structure but rather strengthen the existing one with particular attention to internal and external staff training; (cid:190) Technical partnership with international organizations; (cid:190) Continuous development of agro-meteorological software for crop monitoring and yield forecasting, mainly database management and applications. Starting in 1974, the Agro-meteorology Unit has developed and continuously improved a crop forecasting methodology with the aim to supply updated information on crop condition in sub- Saharan countries to FAO\u2019s Global Information and Early Warning System (GIEWS), and also to provide tools to the agro-meteorological component of the various national Food Security Information and Early Warning Systems. In the early days, a qualitative (manual) methodology was elaborated, based on the relationship between the Water Requirements Satisfaction Index (WRSI), as produced by a crop specific water balance, and the crop condition (Fr\u00e8re and Popov, 1986). Today, the 2 The SPOT-Vegetation satellite produces digital images from which a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is also obtained. 3 The geostationary METEOSAT satellite produces infrared temperature images every half an hour. In tropical regions it can be assumed that areas with temperatures lower than about \u201340\u00b0C are covered with rain clouds. The cumulated number of hours in a given period (i.e. 10-day) with this low temperature is defined as \u201cCold Cloud Duration\u201d (CCD) and it can be represented as a digital image. The relationship between rainfall and CCD is positive, in other words, high rainfall values generally coincide with high CCD values. As a result, a geo-referenced images is produced to provide dekadal amount of rainfall over Africa, namely RainFall Estimate (RFE). ",
        "26 methodology aims to predict crop yields (tons/ha) before the harvest actually takes place, typically a couple of months in advance (July or August for the northern hemisphere). Databases and Applications Software Development Support Most of the existing FAO agro-meteorological tools were and are developed in pursuing the three axes listed in section 7 and in direct response to local requirements of the FSIEWS but also taking into account of the technological progress, particularly software and hardware. Concerning data, such as background information on field inputs and satellite indices, FAO has often been a precursor by testing the potential of new data types, in particular remotely sensed data. The result is a near-optimal integration of meteorological, remotely sensed and other geo-referenced data for the application of various agro-meteorological tools in combination with GIS\u2019s (Geographical Information System) routines. Since the year 2000, most of the applications programmes have evolved for a better response to users\u2019 needs (FSIEWS in particular), performance and integration. The evolution looks at four objectives along the same viewpoint (from station value to gridded data): (cid:190) Better meteorological data quality and accessibility to a larger audience; (cid:190) Integrated agro-meteorological tools, mainly for crop monitoring and yield forecasting; (cid:190) Spatial interpolation tools, to create climate \u201csurfaces\u201d and to estimate \u201clocal climate\u201d; (cid:190) GIS\u2019s tools for agro-meteorology, mainly for analysis of remotely sensed data. Concerning the first objective, the Agro-meteorology Unit has taken some initiatives to overcome the impasse caused by the end of support of the existing software operating under DOS environment and to migrate the global climatic database into the FAO Oracle Data Warehouse. Climatic and real-time meteorological data from different sources are collected under various forms and, depending on the various input formats, data are either manually entered and stored digitally or processed by the Data Management Module of CLICOM (Climate Computing) software developed by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO, 2001), or by the Automated Climate Data Management (ACDAM) software developed by FAO (Verelst, 2000). The new system will allow incorporating data into a modular database running under a Relational Data Base Management System under MS-SQL Server. Another important objective is the development of AgroMetShell (AMS) which is an integrated toolbox used to assess the impact of weather conditions on crops, using statistical and crop modeling approaches. It is a collection of tools for the integrated analysis of ground data and low resolution satellite information, which have been brought together under a common interface. AMS is built around a database of crop, weather and climate data that are used to compute a crop-specific soil water balance and to derive some agronomic/agro-meteorological value-added variables (indicators) used to assess crop conditions (FAO, 2004). The software integrates data analysis and IDA 4 image functions. The main functions of AMS include the following: (cid:190) Database functions (configure, input, output & manage data); (cid:190) Daily of 10-daily crop-specific soil water balance to monitor crops and carry-out risk analyses; (cid:190) Several methods of spatial interpolation of agro-climatic variables and other indicators and their output in gridded format; (cid:190) A number of calculations commonly carried-out by the operational agro- meteorologist of the FSIEWS, such as calculation of crop water consumption (potential 4 IDA (Image Display and Analysis) is the format of the georeferenced images processed by WINDISP (see below). ",
        "27 evapotranspiration), rainfall probabilities, growing season characteristics, statistical analyses, etc. The third objective is represented by LOCCLIM 1.0 (Local Climate Estimator) which is a computer programme that estimates the climate for any location on Earth. It is based on the worldwide climatic database FAOCLIM2 (FAO, 2001a) and it was developed and programmed by Dr. J\u00fcrgen Grieser of the German Meteorological Service (FAO, 2002a). Using the Inverse Distance Weighted Average (IDWA) approach, LOCCLIM 1.0 offers: (cid:190) Estimate of the climate (expectation values of eight variables) at any location you specified either by co-ordinates or by a mouse click on a map; (cid:190) Estimate of the uncertainty of the given results with respect to regional variability; (cid:190) Estimate of the altitude dependency of the variables and of the horizontal gradient of the variables; (cid:190) Estimates of monthly as well as decadal and daily expectation values; (cid:190) Calendar day on which the variables have their maximum and minimum; (cid:190) Number of days with expectation value above a threshold; (cid:190) Calculation of the length of the \"growing period\" or \"growing season\" which is the period (in days) during a year when precipitation exceeds half the potential evapotranspiration. The beta version of \u201cNEW_LOCCLIM\u201d, next to other improvements, will include eight different interpolation techniques next to IDWA and the possibility to operate on user-provided data. WINDISP is a multi-donor 5 software developed for the display and analysis of satellite derived images of low resolution, high frequency satellite imagery available in near real-time through FAO- ARTEMIS (Advanced Real Time Environmental Monitoring Information System) such as from NOAA, Meteosat and SPOT-Vegetation. The current version (WinDisp version 5.1. FAO, 1998) allows to: (cid:190) Display and analyse satellite images; (cid:190) Compare two images and analyse trends in a time-series of images; (cid:190) Extract and graph trends from a number of satellite images such as during the growing season for comparison with other years; (cid:190) Compute new images from a series of images, and extract statistics from series of images; (cid:190) Display tabular data in map format; (cid:190) Build custom products combining images, maps and specialised legends; (cid:190) Write and execute batch files to automate routine and tedious tasks; (cid:190) Build a customized project interface for providing users with detailed menus of available data for a country or a specific area. Copy of the software (LocClim version 1.0, New-LocClim beta version, AgroMetShell beta version 1.0 and WinDisp version 5.1) can be downloaded from the FAO ftp site: ftp://ext- ftp.fao.org/SD/Upload/Agromet. 5 The donors include USAID-FEWS (US Agency for International Development-Famine Early Warning System Project), SADC-RRSP (Southern African Development Community-Regional Remote Sensing Project), USFS (US- Forest Service), USGS (US-Geological Survey) EROS Data Center, FAO-ARTEMIS, and the European Union.

        "28 Conclusions Agro-meteorology is an important component of the \u201cfood security information and early warning systems\u201d that monitor the availability of food by evaluating the impact of weather and climate on crop development. A sizeable part of the staff and financial resources of the FAO Agro-meteorology Unit is devoted to the technical support to FSIEWS around the world such as in the framework of the project: \u201cIntensified Monitoring of Food Security in Five CIS Low-income Food-deficit Countries\u201d. The main activities of the Unit include the development of tools and methods for crop monitoring and yield forecasting, starting with the rehabilitation and/or strengthening of the (agro)-meteorological networks, and all aspects linked to the data transmission, collection, archiving, analysis and dissemination. The basic philosophy is a total synergy with national and regional institutions and the development of integrated toolboxes, such as AgroMetShell, involving agro-meteorology, remote sensing and GIS tools for data collection, spatialization and analysis.

        "30 Introduction \u2013 MARS STAT The MARS (Monitoring Agriculture with Remote Sensing) STAT Sector of the Agriculture and Fisheries Unit of the Joint Research Centre (DG-JRC EC), is part of the Institute for the Protection and Security of the Citizen. The mission statement of the JRC is focusing now in the support of other EC-DGs in the accomplishment of the EU policies and is strongly \u201ccustomer driven\u201d. The MARS project during the last 14 years from its conception went through several Research Framework Programs, studying, developing and implementing a number of methodologies and techniques in order to answer the requests of different EC Directorate Generals. Among the MARS activities there are outlook statistics on crop production: MARS STAT (support to DG-Agriculture). The need of early European figures on harvests let develop within the MARS project the MARS- Stat activities (Meyer-Roux, Vossen: The first phase of the MARS project, 1988-1993. \u201cOverview, methods and results.\u201d In proceedings of the Conference on: \u201cThe MARS project, overview and perspectives\u201d, Belgirate, November 1993. EUR Publication n\u00b015599 EN, of the Office for the Official Publications of the E.C., Luxembourg, Space Applications Institute, J.R.C. Ispra, pp 33- 81). Among these, a crop yield forecasting system was put in place to supply early information to the DG-Agriculture Outlook group on the development and growth conditions of crops during the campaign. The Yield Forecasting is mainly conducted through Pan-European agro-meteorological methods of analysis (Vossen, Rijks, third print, 1996. \u201cEarly crop yield assessment of the EU Countries: the system implemented by the Joint Research Centre.\u201d EUR Publication N\u00b0 16318of the Office for Official Publications of the EC. Luxemburg, 182 pp.). After some years of research in co- operation with Member States and a pre-operational-phase, the MARS Unit is now running in an operational context what is called the Mars Crop Yield Forecasting System (MCYFS) according to a recent Council/Parliament decision 6 . The system consists in an ensemble of methodologies and tools to provide early information on crops during the campaign. While the operational management of the system has been outsourced (see reference Operational Activities for the MARS Crop Yield Forecasting System. Technical Specifications, ITT OJ 199/S 228-158361 2000 and ITT OJ 2003/S 141-127580 2003), the MARS-STAT group is in charge of r&d, technological improvement, main output quality control, the agro-meteorological analyses, crop yield forecasts and the publication of the MARS bulletins (http://agrifish.jrc.it/marsstat/Bulletins/2005.htm). The data produced for the analysis and forecasts are disseminated through a web site http://ww.marsop.info. Besides other elements of the forecasting system, as meteo interpolated data, remote sensing indicators, software codes and executables, are available for transfer (refer to http://agrifish.jrc.it/marsstat/default.htm). The MARS Stat \u201cmissions\u201d within the 6 th Research Framework Program is to provide timely and independent production estimates and forecasts for the major European crops. The forecasts generated operationally by the MCYFS results and the associated analysis are regularly published and considered as a benchmark by the Outlook analysts in charge of decisions making within the Common Agriculture Policy (for instance to estimate food balance sheets for budget allocation, to take decisions of future stock management, export tenders, set aside rates, etc.). The same crop forecasts are also distributed to the EU member States official network, managed by EUROSTAT, dealing with crop forecasts (mainly agriculture branch of Statistical Institutes or Ministries of Agriculture). However, among its objectives and activities there are not only the running and maintenance of the MCYFS but also r&d in the field of area estimates, the development of a Pasture Monitoring System, the set up of a European agro-phenology network and the introduction/set up of a crop yield forecasting system based on multi-model ensembles probabilistic climate forecasts. Strictly in relation to the Crop Yield Forecasting activity, the main related r&d actions consist in: Improving the data sets 6 The European parliament and the Council adopted on the 22.05.2000 the decision n\u00b01445/2000/EC \u201con the application of area frame survey and remote sensing techniques to the agricultural statistics for 1999 to 2003\u201d. The legal basis had a Renewal of the Decision for the period 2004-2007 (Ref. PE/CONS 3661/1/03 OJ L 309 of 26.11.2003). Research actions related to the system find currently a legal basis on the JRC multi annual working programme (FP6 2003-2006 action 1121 MARS STAT) ",
        "31 - introduction of new meteorological data sets and improvement of the archive of observed data - introduction of meteorological datasets from global circulation models - introduction of new crop parameters for better calibration - introduction of Meteosat Second Generation data - extend the vegetation indicators to new indicators (fApar, VCI, SAVI..) - extend the vegetation indicators from low resolution to medium resolution satellite (MODIS, MERIS) Improving the modeling part: - contribute to new advanced releases of CGMS - development of a CGMS based on probabilistic weather forecasts - new routines for extreme weather impact analysis (frost, heath waves, excess of moisture, droughts) exploiting as well other models than WOFOST (CropSyst, CERES) Adding new modeling platforms - a sensitivity analysis platform - a crop calibration platform Today MARS stat is involved as active partner in European projects such as LUCAS (Land Use/Land Cover Area Frame Sampling Survey) and in international research project such as ENSEMBLES, SEAMLESS and GEOLAND. Overview of the MARS Crop Yield Forecasting System (MCYFS) The MCYFS is called a system because several elements and independent modules are integrated to reach the final purpose, i.e. to monitor crop behavior and produce crop yield forecasts. The MCYFS is run operationally on an area covering the whole European Continent, Maghreb and Turkey. The crops covered by system simulation models are: wheat, spring barley, grain maize, rape seed, sunflower, potato, sugar beet, field bean (pastures, rice, soy bean are in phase of study/evaluation). However, the crop parameters simulated can be extended to other crops or varieties belonging to the same class such as winter barley, durum wheat, field peas. Eventually the system can supply predictors and predictions for more than 11 crops. The main pillars of the system are: \u21d2 Observed meteorological data collection, processing and analysis \u21d2 Simulation of agro-meteorological crop growth parameters \u21d2 Low resolution satellite data analysis \u21d2 Statistical analysis and forecasts ",
        "32 Fig.1. The 4 pillars of the MCYFS The outputs of the system are threefold: a) dB and mapped outputs of agricultural season quality indicators. Examples: extreme temperatures maps at a given crop stage; simulated biomass and grain production, estimated actual soil moisture reserve, state of advancement of the development stage during a given month, differences from the long term average at a given decade or period within the growing season for any agro-meteorological indicator; b) Alarm and risk warning: Detection of abnormal weather conditions (during a given month, or cumulated since the start of the season). c) Calculated yield forecasts. Each ten days meteorological and agro-meteorological maps are produced by the system and screened by analysts. The data are updated on the web site according and published in the MARS bulletin about 6-7 time a year as complete analysis and each 15 days as Climatic Updates during the main crop vegetative period. As depicted in Fig.2 the MCYFS can be ideally divided into three levels: 1- At the first level the meteorological data are collected, quality checked, processed and analysed as own source of information. 2- At the second level a simulation engine (a crop growth simulation system) is run to transform the meteorological data into an effect on crop biomass production. The engines used are the Crop Growth Monitoring System (WOFOST model adapted to the European Scale) and LINGRA (used for pastures). At this stage auxiliary information like soil parameters, crop calendars, crop practices, crop parameters (the last three form the core of the crop knowledge base), are injected as fundamental information for an acceptable simulation. At this level many crop specific indicators/predictors are produced and are transferred to the statistical analysis to support the production of a quantitative yield forecast. The second level of the system includes as well the processing of remote sensing data to produce \u201cmeasured\u201d vegetation indicators which can be compared with the agro-meteorological indicators and used as well as predictors. The satellite sensors are the ones with low and medium resolution, respectively SPOT-Vegetation/NOAA- AVHRR (about 1 km resolution) and MERIS/MODIS (about 300-500 m resolution). 3- At the third level, the indicators obtained from meteo, agro-meteo and remote sensing are related to the time series of the official yields and analyzed through scenarios. The final results are quantitative yield forecasts t hat together with the analysis of the previous output are published into the MARS bulletins. ",
        "33 Fig.2. Scheme and data flow of the MCYFS Overview of the level 1 of the MCYFS The weather monitoring component is one of the main elements of the MCYFS (Genovese G., 2001). It forms a complex system constituted by several components (see Fig. 2). Parts of these are already operational in the current version; others will be activated in the close future. The system is mainly constituted by: \u2022 Fluxes of data : coming from external sources and orientated towards both others MCYFS components and internal (analysts) and external users \u2022 Data Bases: where are stored all the raw and processed data. The DB are based on ORACLE technology \u2022 Software procedures: that permit to manage the fluxes of data and to supervise all the procedure to check, store and elaborate the raw data ",
        "34 Fig. 3: General layout of the weather monitoring infrastructure/components in MCYFS During 2005 will be activated the flux of data from ECMWF, that will permit to use all the potentiality included in the forecasted weather data elaborated both at medium range and long term (seasonal, decadal and century-long) and parameters derived from the satellite MSG (LandSaf) related to vegetation/crop analysis such as evapo-transpiration, global radiation, fraction of vegetation cover, Leaf Area Index. Daily meteorological station data are used in two ways for crop yield evaluations. The first as input for the crop growth model WOFOST; the second as weather indicators for a direct evaluation of alarming situations such as drought, extreme rainfall during sowing, flowering or harvest etc. Essentially, the main goals pursued with this level system are: \u2022 to give input to specific models dedicated to monitor and simulate crops growth \u2022 to directly evaluate the impact of weather on crops status and yields at European level assessing impact and risks. The meteorological station data acquisition and check consists of: \u2022 Station information. \u2022 Raw daily meteorological data. \u2022 Processed daily meteorological data. The processed daily meteorological data consists of 29 meteorological parameters including various cloud cover indicators, air temperature, vapor pressure, wind speed and rainfall. In general, the meteo stations density in the monitored areas is sufficient for the purpose of the project. \u2022 Meteorological stations selected in priority are those located in the agricultural zones and equally distributed over the mainland (instead of over islands - for Portugal, Spain or Greece in particular). In particular, for western Russia (western of Urals) the main areas covered are the agricultural districts. ",

Observations of maximum and minimum temperatures, precipitation amounts and sunshine duration (when available) are contained in the main hours synoptic. METAR data provide temperature, dew point, visibility and cloud amount. As far as available, they can be used for intermediate or even non-standard (i.e. all but main and intermediate) hours. From most countries outside Europe, 3-hourly synoptic data are exchanged world wide and can be made available through Meteo Consult. Data from outside the ECOMET area are transmitted from the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) as if WMO essential. A number of countries in Europe, especially in the east, are aiming to become a member of ECOMET. This might lead to a reduction in the amount of data freely available. 7 Calculated with the Penman formula: E0 free water surface evaporation, ESO evaporation of wet bare soil, ET0 reference evapotranspiration of closed crop canopy ",
        "37 The methodology for the spatial interpolation of the data of the existing network of meteorological stations towards the climatic grid cells centre is based on the studies of Beek et al. (1991a) and van der Voet et al. (1994). It is described by van der Goot (1998a). This method was chosen because its simple approach made it easy to automate while the accuracy was sufficient to serve as input to the crop growth model. The interpolation is executed in two steps: first the selection of suitable meteorological stations to determine representative meteorological conditions for a specific climatic grid cell. Second, a simple average is calculated for most of the meteorological parameters, with a correction for the altitude difference between the station and grid cell centre in case of temperature and vapor pressure. As an exception rainfall data are taken directly from the most suitable station. Processing of data: CALCULATION OF ADVANCED PARAMETERS The global radiation calculation uses one of three formulae (\u00c5ngstr\u00f6m, Supit, Hargreaves), depending on the availability of meteorological parameters. An important component in these formulae is the amount of Angot radiation which is the extra-terrestrial radiation integrated over the day at certain latitude on a certain day. In fact, all of the three formulae estimate the fraction of Angot radiation actually received at the earth surface. The calculation of the Angot radiation and the three different formulae are described by Supit et al. (1994) and van der Goot (1998a). Daily meteorological station data received from GTS does not contain potential evapotranspiration. This parameter is calculated by the CGMS with the well-known Penman-Monteith equation (Allen et all., 1998). Fig. 7: Interpolation from stations to a gridded dataset (50x50 Km). To detect abnormal weather conditions, parameters are cumulated in time and compared with their long-term average equivalent or the previous year equivalent. This comparison shows if a specific period in the current year is more dry or wet, hot or cold etc. Extreme events such as excess of rainfall during sowing, flowering or harvest or prolonged droughts can be detected. All maps of the operational services and the historic archive are presented on internet (http://www.marsop.info) and are available from 1975 onwards. Fig 6 and 7 show examples of maps produced for weather monitoring. ",
        "38 To analyse extreme weather conditions the MARS Unit produces special maps such as \u201c cumulated rainfall in the period of sowing of winter wheat \u201d, \u201c cumulated rainfall and maximum temperature in the period of flowering \u201d, \u201c cumulated rainfall in the period of maturity \u201d and maps presenting the spatial and temporal patterns of maximum temperature at maturity. Fig. 8: Examples of weather indicator maps. In order to permit to the analysts to evaluate in the best way the possible influence of the meteorological conditions on the crops behavior and to analyze the data both in temporal and spatial view were developed simple software interfaces to permit the data extraction and elaboration. The current interfaces are connected directly to the DBs and permit to analyze the data both at station and at single grid cell level. The analysts using a clickable map and defining the interested time length can obtain graphs in which are shown the selected data and are also compared with ",

C-METEO indicators permit to aggregate using specific \u201cweight\u201d for each single parameter according to the relative extension of each CORINE land-cover class. Within the regional boundaries, it is very common that the spatial distribution of the different crops is not quite homogeneous. Therefore, in case we intend to analyze the meteorological conditions at regional scale it is necessary to take into consideration that specific distribution. ",
        "40 C-METEO indicator permits to emphasize the phenomena most relevant for each specific class of land, aggregating the punctual data in a manner to highlight the data recorded in the areas where the selected class of land-cover is more present and, at the same time, reducing those phenomena not relevant for the crops of interest. Fig. 11: Screenshot of the C-METEO temporal analysis. Case-synthesis for the whole of France/Arable Land class One of the main characteristic of the MCYFS Data bases is to have all the information geographically referenced. In such manner is possible to connect a standard GIS software package to the database and to produce special maps for any specific analysis. Many standard maps are operationally produced in order to permit to the analysts to identify the areas probably affected by extreme meteorological events. ",

The crop monitoring component of the MCYFS studies the influence of weather (coupled with soil) on crop growth assuming implicitly that the influence of all other omitted factors (farm management, socio-economic factors etc.) is constant. ",
        "42 However, the results of the analysis cannot be conclusive, when yield is co-determined by factors kept outside the analysis (Van Diepen and van der Wal, 1995). Therefore the final analyse will take into consideration, besides the results of the model, other sources such as information derived from remote sensing images. These images show the integrated effects of weather, soil moisture and management on crop growth but crop specific factors cannot be isolated as covered by model simulations. Besides the regional monitoring of the crop condition, the agro-meteorological component of the MCYFS issues alarm warnings in the case of abnormal meteorological events. Crop indicators like biomass and yields are simulated by the model WOFOST (version 6.0) and form one of the inputs for the quantitative yield prediction. Procedures like WOFOST and data storage (in the ORACLE database) are part of the CGMS (level 2 of the MCYFS). The work within this level is divided into five activities: \u2022 Collection and processing of input data. \u2022 Spatial schematisation. \u2022 Regional crop simulation. \u2022 Spatial aggregation. \u2022 Production of crop indicator maps. Collection and processing of input data Interpolated daily grid weather data are combined with crop and soil data to feed the crop growth model of the CGMS. The following crops are included: winter wheat, spring barley, grain maize, rapeseed, sunflower, sugar beet, potato, field beans and still at validation stage or not yet consolidated stage: rice, soybeans and pastures. Each crop has its own crop parameters which broadly fall into two categories. The first category describes the growth behaviour of each plant and the second category describes the spatial and temporal variation in crop use, for instance which crop is used in a particular location and what the average sowing dates are for this crop (Boons-Prins et al ., 1993; Heemst, 1988). For crops which are harvested before maturity (green crops) the average harvest dates are specified as well. Data of the second category are linked to climatic grid cells. To make optimal use of regional soil information in the MARS project, the existing 1 to 1 million European soil database (CEC, 1985) had to be updated and completed. The soil database was insufficient to supply parameter values needed by the crop growth model WOFOST. Important variables like parent material depth, rooting obstacle, depth of textural change, water regime were added for each Soil Typologic Unit (STU). STU\u2019s are generally too small to be distinguished on a map at scale 1 to 1 million. Therefore, they are clustered in Soil Mapping Units (SMU)). The revision of the soil map included also an update of the topology of the SMU\u2019s. All these improvements lead to the European soil map (1 to 1 million) and database version 3. 1 (INRA, 1995; Le Bas, 1996; Jones and Buckley, 1996). The MAGRHEB countries, Turkey, Russia, Ukraine and Belarus are not covered in the current European soil map version implemented in the CGMS. For these countries data of the 1 to 5 million soil map (FAO, 1995) are used. The soil map is used to determine the maximum available water which a soil can supply to a plant during a period of drought. Further, the soil map is used as a \u201cland use probability map\u201d to define which crops have to be included in the crop growth simulation for a given soil unit. Ideally, this decision would be taken on the basis of actual land-use information, but a European wide detailed classification of land cover is not available. Hence within the CGMS the decision is simply based on the soil suitability of the different crops: if a STU is deemed appropriate then the simulation will be performed. Suitable soils are determined per crop group on the basis of crop growth limiting properties of these soils like slope, texture, agriculture limiting phase, rooting depth, drainage, salinity and alkalinity (van der Goot, 1998). To use simulated crop indicators as input in the quantitative yield prediction they have to be aggregated to administrative regions using agricultural statistics. The administrative regions in EU are called Nomenclature des Unit\u00e9s Territoriales Statistiques (NUTS). The NUTS system is organised as follows: the highest level, the whole ",
        "43 country, is called NUTS-0, which is divided in macro regions: NUTS-1. These macro regions are subdivided in NUTS-2 sub-regions. There two main sources of agricultural statistics including yield, planted area and production. The first source contains the regional agricultural statistics at NUTS level 2. This database is known as the REGIO database of the Statistical Office of the European Community (EUROSTAT) and starts in 1975. The second source refers to the CRONOS database of EUROSTAT which contains the national agricultural statistics, starting in 1955. Spatial schematisation To apply the crop growth model WOFOST at a larger scale, simulation units where meteorological data, soil characteristics and crop parameters can be assumed homogeneous have to be identified. It is assumed that the simulated crop growth is representative for those units. Furthermore, the model output (simulated yield indicators etc.) should be aggregated to a NUTS region for which statistical yield data is available and for which the yield has to be forecasted. So it is necessary to know the mapping between simulation units and NUTS region. For this purpose Elementary Mapping Unit\u2019s (EMU\u2019s) are created which results from the intersection of climatic grid cell, SMU and NUTS region at level 2. Fig 13: In the MCYFS the Elementary Mapping Unit (EMU) is defined as the intersection of climatic grid cells, Soil Mapping Units (SMU\u2019s), and administrative regions (Nomenclature des Unit\u00e9s Territoriales Statistiques, NUTS) Regional crop simulation The heart of the CGMS is the crop growth simulation model WOFOST version 6 (Keulen and Wolf, 1986; van Diepen et al ., 1988; 1989; Hijmans et al ., 1994). The required inputs per EMU are daily weather data, soil characteristics, crop parameters and management practices (i.e. sowing density, planting date, etc.). WOFOST computes the instantaneous photosynthesis, at three depths in the canopy and for three moments of the day. These instant values are then integrated over the depth of the canopy and over the day light period to achieve daily total canopy photosynthesis. After subtracting the maintenance respiration, assimilates are partitioned over the different plant organs roots, stems, leaves and grains as a function of the development stage, which is calculated by integrating the daily development rate, described as a function of temperature. Assimilates are then converted into structural plant material taking into account growth respiration. Above-ground dry matter accumulation and its distribution over leaves, stems and grains are simulated from sowing to maturity on a hectare basis. ",
        "44 The CGMS simulates two production situations: potential and water-limited. The potential situation is only defined by temperature, day length, solar radiation and crop parameters (e.g. leaf area dynamics, assimilation characteristics, dry matter partitioning, etc.). For this situation the effect of soil moisture on crop growth is not considered and a continuously moist soil is assumed. In the water-limited situation soil moisture determines whether the crop growth is limited by drought stress. Therefore a soil water balance is calculated that applies to a freely draining soil, where groundwater is so deep that it does not influence the soil moisture content in the rooting zone. In both, the potential and water limited, situations optimal supply of nutrients is assumed and damage caused by pests, diseases, weed and/or extreme weather events is not considered. To save disk space the results on EMU level are only saved for the last day of a decade. Spatial aggregation For each decade, simulated crop indicators of the EMU\u2019s are spatially aggregated to the climatic grid cells for the production of crop indicator maps and to the administrative NUTS level 2, 1 and 0 as a basis for yield forecasts. The aggregation from EMU to climatic grid cell is based on the weight of each EMU within the climatic grid cell. The weight is calculated as the area fraction of the EMU that has suitable soils in relation to the total soil suitable area of all EMU\u2019s within the climatic grid cell. Aggregation to NUTS level 2 is also based on soil suitability. For some countries information on actual land use at NUTS level 2 and 1 is available. If area statistics are available aggregation to NUTS-1 or NUTS-0 region is based on the area distribution between the \u201cchildren\u201d of this specific NUTS-1 or NUTS-0 region. This only holds if all children of one parent have area statistics. Production of crop indicator maps The CGMS produces crop indicator maps (such as the difference in storage organs between the current year and the long term average) which are presented on internet (http://www.marsop.info) and are available from 1975 onwards. Through the web site you can also view the temporal evolution of crop indicators throughout the current growing season in comparison with other years or with the long term average for a specific NUTS region. Goal and assumptions The MCYFS uses the daily interpolated grid weather to simulate biomass accumulation and crop development. Besides regional monitoring of the crop condition, this MCYFS component issues alarm warnings in the case of abnormal conditions. The outcome of the crop monitoring part is also one of the inputs for the yield prediction. Van Diepen and van der Wal (1995) described crop growth as a complex process which takes place on farms at field level. Crop yields vary among regions, farms, fields, and years. Many different factors influence the process. The cause of variation in crop yield may be sought in factors such as: \u2022 A-biotic: weather, soil type. \u2022 Farm management: soil tillage, planting density, sowing date, weeding intensity, fertiliser rates, crop protection against pests and diseases, harvest techniques, post harvest losses, degree of mechanisation. \u2022 Land development: field size, terracing, drainage, irrigation. \u2022 Socio-economic: distance to markets, population pressure, investments, costs of inputs, prices of outputs, education level, skills, infrastructure. The crop monitoring component of the MCYFS studies the influence of one factor, weather, assuming implicitly that the influence of all other omitted factors is constant. However, the results of the analysis cannot be conclusive, when yield is co-determined by factors kept outside the ",
        "45 analysis. Furthermore, the influence of these factors may be completely overruled when the overall economic and political situation is not stable, or when crop-damaging catastrophes occur, such as warfare, flooding, earthquakes etc. Therefore in the final synthesis not only results of the CGMS are included but also other sources such as information derived from remote sensing images. These images show the integrated effects of weather, soil moisture, management on crop growth but individual factors cannot be isolated. Many of the omitted factors are important at local scale and may lead to variations in yields. The MCYFS assumes that at regional level the influence of these factors is compensated by each other (van Diepen and van der Wal, 1995). Additionally, the MCYFS assumes that effects of weather on yield is regardless the degree of fertilisation (Supit, 1999). The majority of the relations between plant growth and agro-meteorological growing conditions are non-linear. This non-linearity does not allow to first aggregate the input parameters to regional level and next simulate the crop growth at this regional level (Vossen, 1995a). Therefore crop growth simulation takes place at the detailed spatial level where distinct areas are more or less homogeneous regarding weather, soil, and crop management. The MCYFS assumes that the cultivated area of each crop is evenly distributed over all suitable soils, which implies that the production volume increases linearly with planted area. Because complete information on crop areas is missing, the crop yield is estimated for all land that is considered suitable for this specific crop. In reality a given crop could be grown on marginal soils, for instance if the best soils are occupied with more profitable crops. And if the crop is grown on the most suitable soils the inter-annual fluctuation of crop acreage could involve only marginal soils. These assumptions should be kept in mind when calculating and studying production volumes which are the straight multiplication of crop yield and planted area. Compilation of the crop knowledge database Data about the specific growth potentials and constraints of individual crops are an essential input to any crop growth simulation model. During the first phase of the MARS project, a project was launched to collect all possible data of this type and compile a crop knowledge database. Researchers of different institutes reviewed literature to determine the physiological and cultivation characteristics of the crops in various regions of Europe (Burrill et al., 1995). The crop knowledge database includes winter wheat, spring wheat, barley, rice, potato, sugar beet, field beans, soybean, oil-seed rape, grain maize and sunflower. It refers to: \u2022 Agronomic data such as the major varieties grown in each region and the earliest and latest dates of sowing and harvest for these varieties, maximum altitude at which a crop is grown, the most common agricultural practices. \u2022 Region specific physiological information such as crop cycle length and relations between phenology and temperature and day length, initial dry matter after emergence (and, indirectly, plant density). \u2022 Non region-specific, detailed physiological information such as energy conversion, partitioning of assimilates over various plant organs, etc. This information was derived from literature. For wheat, information was also derived from field trials executed in Belgium, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. For other countries and other crops, no detailed field observations were available and consequently calibration of the crop characteristics could not be executed (Boons- Prins et al., 1993). \u2022 Details of optimal, acceptable and harmful conditions for each phenological stage, the event most likely to happen such as the occurrence of a disease, and the impact on the potential production. The results of the project are presented by Russell and Wilson (1994), Falisse (1992), Narciso et al. (1992), Bignon (1990), Hough (1990) and Russell (1990). Boons-Prins et al. (1993) used these ",
        "46 results and constructed parameters to be used as input in the CGMS, including also information from van Heemst (1988). Later, a \u2018Computerised Crop Knowledge base System\u2019 has been built for storing, retrieving and extracting relevant information about crops (Russell et al., 1997). Crop parameters for the CGMS In the CGMS (the table CROP) a selection of crops is included as listed in Table 1. The crop parameters of the CGMS fall broadly into two categories. The first category describes the growth behaviour of each plant. This category is copied from the region and non region specific physiological information of the crop knowledge database. The information is stored in the table CROP_PARAMETER_VALUE. The table PARAMETER_DESCRIPTION explains the parameters. Table 1: Crops included in the CGMS. Crop number Crop name Crop number Crop name 1 winter wheat* 9 soy beans 2 grain maize* 10 oil rapeseed* 3 spring barley* 11 sunflower* 5 rice 12 green maize 6 sugar beet* 13 winter barley 7 potato* 14 spring wheat 8 field beans 15 spring rape seed *crop simulations used in an operational context The second category describes the spatial and temporal variation in crop use, for instance which plant is used in a particular location and what the average sowing and harvest dates are for this plant. For crops which are harvested before maturity (green crops) the average harvest date is specified as well. This information is taken from the agronomic data of the crop knowledge database. The data are linked to climatic grid cells, and are stored in the table CROP_CALENDAR. Different climatic grid cells, which have the same crop, can have different varieties. These varieties can be different for instance for the required temperature sum to reach a certain crop development stage. Such crop parameters that differ from the original crop are stored in the table VARIETY_PARAMETER_VALUE. An important problem is that information was often available at the wrong scale. For example, the sowing dates for a region are often known only for a small sample of fields. Information how representative these samples are, is usually unavailable while this information is needed for accurate scaling up from the site-specific information to a NUTS level. Similarly, values of crop modelling parameters obtained from individual trials will differ from those that would have been obtained if a complete enumeration had been achieved. This is of particular importance wherever the relations are not linear (Vossen and Rijks, 1995). Another problem is that, although the inventories were carefully compiled, information frequently is not available for certain parameters and in certain regions or countries. In such cases a \u2018best guess\u2019 was made. Each crop is assigned to one of the following groups: cereals, root crops and maize (see the table CROP_GROUP). These groups describe the requirements of a crop with respect to soil characteristics such as agricultural limiting phase, texture, slope, drainage, rooting depth, alkalinity and salinity. The requirements determine whether a soil is suitable to grow a specific plant. ",
        "47 Crop simulation The heart of the CGMS is the crop growth simulation model WOFOST which is a deterministic, dynamic, explanatory \u201cpoint model\u201d. In the CGMS this point model is applied for each individual simulation unit. The core of the WOFOST\u2019s crop growth sub model has been taken from the SUCROS model (Spitters et al., 1989; Van Laar et al., 1992). The principles of WOFOST\u2019s water module are described in Van Keulen and Wolf (1986). The initial version of this model was developed by the Centre for World Food Studies and AB-DLO (van Diepen et al., 1988; 1989). In the CGMS, WOFOST version 6.0 has been used (Hijmans et al., 1994). In WOFOST, crop growth is simulated on the basis of eco-physiological processes. The major processes are phenological development, CO2-assimilation, transpiration, respiration, partitioning of assimilates to the various organs, and dry matter formation. This is illustrated in Fig. 14. Potential and water-limited growth is simulated dynamically, with a time step of one day. Figure 14: Crop growth processes (\u2018Ta\u2019 and \u2018Tp\u2019 are actual and potential evapotranspiration rate; \u2018temp\u2019 is temperature and \u2018dvs\u2019 is development stage) (Kropff and van Laar, 1993). For specific details of the simulation processes the reader should refer to: Methodology of the MCYFS, VOL 2, Agro-meteorological modelling, processing and analysis. 2004, Lazar and Genovese eds. (http://agrifish.jrc.it/marsstat/Crop%5FYield%5FForecasting/METAMP/) Currently an improved version of CGMS (release 8.0) is available (I. Savin et al. , 2005) ",
        "48 Figure 15 Crop growth parameters simulation schema and examples Overview of the Level 2 of the MCYFS: remote sensing data and indicators Remote sensing has always been an important cornerstone of the MARS-project. Since the start in 1988 the two main types of earth observation systems have been largely exploited. The high- resolution sensors (HR) such as Landsat-TM and SPOT-XS/HRVIR deliver images with a pixel size of 10-30m, i.e. smaller than the average crop field in most regions of the European Union. HR- data were thus used in MARS-Actions 1 and 4 for crop mapping by means of analogue or digital image classification techniques and for the subsequent assessment of the crop acreage. From 1992 onwards, with the introduction of the new CAP (plan Mac Sharry), the focus of these applications partly shifted towards the control of the demands for area-based subsidies, which are submitted every year by most EU-farmers. HR-images are however unsuited for small-scale crop monitoring at the national or continental level, because of their limited extent (width of 60 to 180 km) and low temporal frequency (only a few registrations per year of the same site). As a consequence, the remote sensing component of the MARS vegetation monitoring and yield forecasting operations (Action 3 and the actual MCYFS) had to be based on the information provided by low-resolution sensors (LR), such as NOAA-AVHRR and (since 1998) SPOT-VGT (VEGETATION). Thanks to their large field-of-view, LR-systems have a much better synoptic view and temporal frequency: the individual scenes have an enormous width (up to 3000 km), such that the entire earth surface is scanned every day. The intrinsic drawback is of course situated in the low spatial resolution, with pixels of about 1km\u00b2, i.e. far above the average field size. Most LR- ",
        "49 pixels thus have a mixed nature (\u201cmixels\u201d) as they cover groups of adjacent land parcels. Compared to the HR-data, the measured optical signals are more difficult to analyse because they are a mixture of the \u201cpure\u201d signals emitted or reflected by the individual crops or other land cover types. Figure 16 Examples of a soil moisture analysis as derived from CGMS The computation of NDVI-images is a traditional and wide-spread practice in the world of LR image processing. The NDVI or \u201cNormalized Difference Vegetation Index\u201d is a combination of the measured reflectance in the Red (Rr) and Near Infrared (Rn) parts of the spectrum: (1-1) Compared to the individual reflectance, the NDVI is less sensible to external influences related to the atmosphere, viewing geometry, and the state of the underlying soil. As a consequence it is a good indicator of the amount and condition of the vegetation. The NDVI of terrestrial vegetation steadily increases with canopy cover from 0.15 (bare soils) up to 0.8 (dense canopies). On the other hand, water bodies have negative NDVI, while clouds are characterised by values around zero. The use of NOAA-AVHRR already started in 1988 with the beginning of the MARS-project, and it still continues today. To this goal the JRC installed a receiving antenna in Ispra and developed a dedicated software called SPACE, which converts the raw data registered over Europe into fully corrected daily mosaics at 1.1 km\u00b2-resolution (S1-syntheses or Level3). Later on, a second software r n r n R R R R NDVI +\u2212 = ",
        "50 was established for the further elaboration of the SPACE-outputs. This MARS-APPLICATION downsizes the data to 4.4 x 4.4km\u00b2, derives new images with NDVI and surface temperatures, and generates more cloud free 10-daily and monthly NDVI-mosaics (S10/S30-syntheses), which are finally used to compute difference images (actual NDVI \u2013 values of previous year). Many of these pictures and especially the NDVI-differences have been published in the MARS-bulletins and they proved very useful for the qualitative identification of zones with relative growth progress or retardation. A major step towards a more quantitative analysis was realised in the mid-nineties with the introduction of the CNDVI\u2019s (Genovese et al., 1999) which are the NDVI-means for each NUTS2 region in the EU, weighted as to the relative importance of the cropland. These image- derived values are stored in database format which allows the import into a vectorial GIS and facilitates the further (agro-)statistical analysis in combination with the yield indicators provided by the model. In November 2000, the JRC outsourced the MCYFS-operation to the MARSOP1-consortium. By then a number of new elements have been introduced: \u2022 From November 2000 onwards the AVHRR-data are captured by the antenna of the \u201cFreie Universit\u00e4t\u201d in Berlin which has a better coverage of the European continent, especially to the east. The SPACE-software was adapted in order to cope with the new facilities of NOAA16. \u2022 In the frame of the related RNA-project, the full JRC-archive of European AVHRR-images over the period 1989-2000 is currently being re-processed with the latest version of SPACE, called SpacePC (Piccard et al., 2002a). \u2022 In addition to AVHRR, the remote sensing component was enforced with the 10-daily syntheses (S10) of the LR-sensor SPOT-VGT (VEGETATION). \u2022 The MARS-APPLICATION was rewritten, streamlined and further extended in order to deal with both sensors. The new version is called MARSOP-APPLICATION. New applications have been developed since 2003: \u2022 On top of classical NDVI new indicators are produced like SAVI, FAPAR, DMP, VCI and VPI from NDVI; \u2022 All the data will follow one standard European projection(instead of 2 projections); \u2022 New sensors like MERIS will be introduced. Extraction of Databases with Regional NDVI-Means (CNDVI, AVHRR + VGT) So far the remote sensing approach only dealt with images. Images however occupy huge amounts of disk space and their spatial unit (the pixel) is not appropriate for agro-statistical purposes. Crop yield data, either official numbers or forecasts, are always expressed per \u201cregion\u201d and stored in databases. The gap between both approaches can however be bridged by the computation and subsequent storage in database format of the regional means of certain image values. In this way the CNDVI-method developed by Genovese et al. (1999) computes regional NDVI-means, but it goes one step further as the values are weighted according to each pixel\u2019s acreage occupied by the land cover type of interest (a specific crop or group of crops). In the MCYFS, the CNDVI-methodology (Genovese et al ., 2000) is applied routinely on the decadal S10/L5-images of AVHRR and VGT. Besides these composites some more ancillary raster maps are required. The first is the \u201cregions-image\u201d, a raster version of the EU-NUTS2 vectorial map (596 different regions). The others contain the pixel-fractions of the land cover classes of interest. These \u201cfraction images\u201d (1 per class) were derived by JRC from the vectorial CORINE Land Cover Production Database. ",
        "51 Figure 17: Flowchart of the remote sensing component of the MCYFS. Below, we will respectively indicate the regions, land cover classes and pixels with the symbols or subscripts r, c and i. For each pixel i, the following variables can be read from the input images: its NDVIi, the region ri to which it belongs, and the surface fractions fc,i covered by the classes c. For the region r of interest, the number of pixels Nr,i with \u201cgood\u201d NDVI-values must first be computed (it depends on the considered decade, as the pixels with missing values are excluded). For the class c of interest, we can also specify a fraction threshold t: pixels with fc,i<t will not be included in the computation of the mean NDVI. For the given region r and class c of interest and the specified threshold t, the CNDVI is then computed as follows: i N i i t c r t c r N i c,i i t c c,i i t c i t c r c,i i t c c,i i t c NDVI W CNDVI f f W t f if , t f if i r i r \u22c5 = \u22c5 \u22c5 = \u2265 = < = \u2211\u2211 ,, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , 1 0 \u03b4 \u03b4 \u03b4 \u03b4 ",
        "52 First, \u03b4 c,t,i is just an auxiliary variable used to indicate whether the pixel i has to be included or rejected in the computation of the regional mean. Then, for each pixel in the region a relative weight Wr,c,t,i is derived with regard to the class of interest. Note that the pixels, eliminated by the threshold, have zero-weight and do not contribute to the normalisation factor in the denominator. Finally, the CNDVI \u2212 or more specifically CNDVIr,c,t of class c in region r \u2212 is the mean of the NDVI\u2019s of the Nr,i pixels in the region, weighted as to their (t-thresholds) surface fraction. One modification should be added: the CNDVI is only computed for regions/classes/ thresholds for which the number of retained pixels ( \u03a3\u03b4 c,t,i summed over Nr,i) is at least 100. In practice, the CNDVI-computations are repeated for the following five variables: \u2022 For the 596 regions r in the EU-NUTS2 map (at least those covered by the CORINE-map). \u2022 For the 11 CORINE-classes c for which JRC prepared fraction-images (see table 5-4). \u2022 For 8 different thresholds t (in %): 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 (t=0% means that all pixels in the region are included, however still weighted as to their fractional cover fc,i). \u2022 For every decade in the year. \u2022 For the S10/L5 NDVI-composites of NOAA-AVHRR and SPOT-VGT. Figure 18. Ancillary image maps for the CNDVI-computations (AVHRR-version in Albers-projection with 4.4km resolution). Starting from the left the NDVI image, the NUTS coverage and CLC The program also computes the simple regional NDVI-means, and stores them as well in the ORACLE-database. However, the CNDVI-values are class-specific and hence completely different from these simple NDVI-means. Genovese et al. (1999) observed that the CNDVI temporal profiles show much higher dynamics and a better representation of the phenologic growth cycles of the concerned classes. In a simple way, the CNDVI-approach thus realises a decomposition of the mixed NDVI-signal (spectral unmixing). To illustrate the practical use of the CNDVI\u2019s, we briefly summarise the work of Vignolles et al. (1999) on the yields of wheat in 16 regions of southern Spain over the years 1995 to 1997 (16 x 3 = 48 data points). Several yield indicators were defined ",
        "53 by integrating the decadal (and temporally smoothed, see figure 4-6 CNDVI-values over longer periods (the entire season or specific phenological stages). These indicators (X) were then linearly regressed against the officially reported harvests (Y). The best results (R\u00b2=88%, standard error=0.3 ton/ha) were obtained if the CNDVI X-indicators were integrated over the period from flowering to ripening, and if only the real wheat-grown regions were included in the regression (15 data points). For that optimal situation, pixel thresholds (with the above t-values) didn\u2019t have any effect, but in the sub-optimal cases (other integration periods, less severe selection of regression points) it drastically improved the yield prediction. For wheat in southern Spain, an optimal threshold value of t=30% was found (for CORINE class 12). Table 2: CORINE land cover classes for which the CNDVI is computed.

        "54 New Indicators and Sensors in MCYFS Surface Temperature with AVHRR Estimation of the TS is only feasible for AVHRR, because the VGT and MERIS sensors do not provide information in the thermal infrared (TIR). Currently the TS is computed with the simple method of Price (1984) and implemented outside SpacePC. In the new version, TS will be derived with the renown method of Coll & Caseles (1997). The emissivities in the two thermal bands ( \u03b5 4, \u03b5 5) will be derived from the NDVI with the approach of Cichlar et al. (1997). Finally, the requested information on total water vapour will be extracted, in the same way as for SMAC, from the atmospherical tables. For H20-vapour, we will dispose of 6-hourly measurements, gridded to a 1.5\u00b0 mesh and on-line delivered by MeteoFrance. These values will be temporally interpolated to the exact registration time. The TS-image will be added to the Level2 IMAGE and included in the later NDVI-MVC compositing, which creates the final SpacePC output: the daily composite (Level3 or S1). VCI (Vegetation Condition Index) and PCI (Productivity Condition Index) Two relative range indices call VCI and VPI will be used to reflect every dekad the progress of the green biomass along the year and the greenness level compared to the historical years. They will be calculated for NOAA and VGT NDVI series at pixel level. The VPI (see Annexe, fig.3), developed by Sannier et al. (1998), is a categorical type of index which is referenced against the NDVI percentile-images of the historical year, and classified in different frequency groups. Within MARSOP2 11 percentile images will be calculate from 0% (Minimum of the historical series) to 100% (maximum of the series). By comparing the pixel\u2019s actual NDVI-value with these percentiles, it will be assigned to one of the 11 percentile groups (\u201cproductivity classes\u201d). The VCI or Vegetation Condition Index (Viau et al., 2000) is a relative range vegetation index but the RRVI computed for X=NDVI. VCI (y,p)=[X(y,p)-Min(p)]/[Max(p)-Min(p)] SAVI (Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index) The \u201csoil-adjusted vegetation index\u201d or SAVI (was first proposed by Huete (1988) as an alternative for NDVI, because it is less sensitive to variations in the reflectance \u03c3 of the soil background. It will be produced regularly from 2004. The SAVI should allow better green vegetation monitoring particularly with low plant cover. The variant proposed by Baret & Guyot (1991) will be implemented. Based on the European soil map The main pedological units will be extracted from the European soil map and the corresponding soil lines expressing the relation of Near Infra Red band (N) versus Red band(R), will be calculated: \u03c3 N = \u03b1 + \u03b2 * \u03c3 R The parameter will allow the pixel calculation of the new index: SAVI = \u03c3 N / ( \u03c3 R - \u03b1 / \u03b2 ) DMP The Monteith formulation should be corrected, and the important efficiency-term was split in two components ( \u03b5 = \u03b5 1. \u03b5 2): photosynthetic efficiency \u03b5 1 and autotrophic respiration \u03b5 2. Whereas \u03b5 1 depends on T12 (light-time period), \u03b5 2 depends on T24 (day+night), which is generally lower. These parameters are computed as in WOFOST/CGMS: T12=0.75*(Tmin+Tmax), T24=0.50*(Tmin+Tmax). (see Annexe, fig.6) ",
        "55 MSG products for assimilation The CGMS model uses mainly 3 primary inputs: rain, temperature and radiation. The data input are coming from meteo stations which distribution is not homogeneous and which data delivery is not always regular. Some inputs like radiation are also particularly difficult to acquire. In alternative these parameters can be derived from MSG. The Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) with a better spectral resolution (12 channels) and a high frequency data acquisition every 15\u2019, gives new possibilities to generate biophysical indicators that can be used in the crop yield models (solar radiation, evapotranspiration, Albedo, fraction of vegetation cover, LAI, FAPAR, snow cover). MERIS New remote sensing sensors can improve the reliability and precision of the data acquisition necessary for the crop monitoring. MERIS is one of these new satellites that have a better resolution (300m) than the low resolution (1km) SPOT VEGETATION and NOAA data currently use within MARS STAT sector. Due to the size of the agriculture plots in Europe, the use of higher resolution sensor with daily acquisition can improve the accuracy of the crop monitoring .

They contribute to the conjuncture analysis mainly through different qualitative products. The analyses are made at pixel or nuts level through: ",
        "57 Maps showing for each pixel the spatial distribution of one indicator at a fixed time or by comparison to a reference time period: Graphs at nuts level showing the evolution of an indicator for a specific area of interest along a given period mainly through the CNDVI; Stratified maps showing the main time profile (6 to 10) of an indicator or its relative difference with an other time period. This spatio-temporal association is generated by statistical cluster method. Overview of the Level 3 of the MCYFS: the crop forecasts The objective of the quantitative forecast level (3) of the MCYF System is to provide the most likely, precise, accurate, scientific, traceable and independent forecasts for the main crops\u2019 yields at EU level taking into account the effect of the climate during the season as early as possible during the cropping campaign (and until harvest). The main role of the MCYFS (level 3) is to provide yield statistics of the major crops at EU and national level, as accurate and timely as possible, while ensuring independence from all external sources of estimates, including the national statistical systems (Genovese, 1998). To realise this objective crop yield forecast procedures are applied which combine all kinds of input such as historical yield statistics, weather indicators, simulated crop indicators, remote sensing based vegetation indices, additional information sources and expert knowledge. Time series of historic yield statistics of EUROSTAT are an important data source in this procedure which is mainly based on regressions. In this context the MCYFS assumes that the official yield statistics are objective statistics and reflect the real situation. This is sometimes objective of discussion as the MCYFS can then be seen as an instrument to forecast the \u201cthe official yield\u201d not the actual crop yield. However, the system is such that the forecasts can also be issued as own independent elements from crop yield time series. Vossen and Rijks (1995) stressed that due to unknown farming practices and uncertainty in the MCYFS input data quantitative forecasted yields can never be valid for a specific locality. They can be valid or reliable for (very) large areas such as countries or large regions, provided the information and model outputs were first carefully weighted for the relative importance of soil types, groups of varieties, common farming practices etc. Vossen and Rijks (1995) also stated that in relation to these limitations forecasting methods have to be validated per country and/or large regions. To produce the most likely, precise accurate, scientific, traceable and independent forecasts for the main crops different statistical tools are used: trend analysis, regression analysis, scenario/similarity analysis. At the end of the process different possible forecasts are available and often \u201cstatistically\u201d acceptable. The \u201cmost performant result\u201d is then individuated and selected according to statistical tests (De Koning et al., 1993) on the models used and scenarios analysis results. The measurement error (cause of main bias) is constantly a concern for the MCYFS as this could affect the results of the whole analysis. This means that on the side of the predictors it is often a material of R&D to improve the processing of the remote sensing signals or the re-calibration of the CGMS on updated crop parameters in order to obtain \u201cpredictors\u201d as much as possible correlated with the observed crop yield. The concept of \u201cscientific\u201d includes the individuation of a direct link within cause and effect in the models used and the repeatability of the experience. In fact the system is tailored in a way that the same model with the same data sets can be repeated in any time obtaining the same result. For that reason any time the configuration of the system changes (for instance a new parameter calibration is injected in the model) the all archive of output like the time series of \u201cpredictors\u201d is re-generated. The source of the forecast can be in the system of different nature. For ",
        "58 that reason the system keeps track systematically of the variables, methods and models which were at the base of the final forecast. The system is then tailored to measure the current climate (level 1) and transform the effects into crop biomass production (level 2). This part is \u201cinductive\u201d as the initial observations of the climate are measures given by samples on points (meteorological stations) in some day hours. The remote sensing indicators, as another piece of the system and part of the level 2, give a \u201cmeasure\u201d of the general effect of the environmental conditions on the vegetation without specifying which part of the climate is really influencing the portion of the vegetation observed. The process is here \u201cdeductive\u201d. The convergence of \u201cevidence\u201d from the two sides (bottom-up \u201cinductive\u201d from model simulation/ top-down \u201cdeductive\u201d from Remote Sensing measure) is often considered in the framework of crop forecasting as sufficient to conclude on current crop behaviour and justify resulting forecasts with the mostly reduced uncertainty. However, in this framework, the error of measurement is often neglected and let underestimate the uncertainty which should be associated to the forecast. The improvement of the \u201cmeasures\u201d precision do of the predictors is a constant effort of the MARS team in charge of the MCYFS. More efforts are being made in order to control the uncertainty related to unpredictable future climate impact remaining from the moment of issuing the crop yield forecasts and the final harvests. One is the use the \u201censembles\u201d probabilistic output from weather circulation models as initial input in the model and define an ensembles-probabilistic final predictors on which base the crop yield forecasts. \u201cEU level\u201d and the geographic dimension. The geographic dimension of the forecasts given by the MCYFS goes theoretically from the EMU (Elementary Mapping Unit) concept dimension to the Continental dimension passing through the grid cells (50x50 km) regions (NUTS2,1) and country levels. In theory the \u201cpredictors\u201d production can be generated at whatever geographic level according to the layer available (catchments boundaries could also be used). For practical reasons linked to the management of the information and to the constraint of deriving the final forecast mainly re-calibrating the \u201cpredictors\u201d on time series of observed yields, the system runs at Country level and then aggregates the results at EU level. In practice, while \u201cpredictors\u201d are systematically produced and stored at grid, NUTS2, 1, 0 level, the quantitative final forecasts are given at National level and then aggregated at EU level weighting the results with the most recent crop area data available. The EU and National crop yield forecasts are made available to the DG-AGRI and EUROSTAT and published in the MARS bulletins. Taking into account the effect of climate during the season, as early as possible during the cropping campaign (until harvest). Concept of \u201cpredictors\u201d. The main idea steering the MCYF System is that the climate can have a significant effect on crop yield, determining most of the interannual variability. The time lag of the forecast is normally one year ahead. It means that the system forecasts the crop yield at harvest during the current agriculture season. In the current conception of the System the climate so far observed will determine the crop yield at harvest. Here, two directions are developed; the first through the classic approach of regression modelling where at time \u201cn\u201d the forecast obtained by the model selected implies a \u201cnormal\u201d effect of climate from time \u201cn\u201d to the harvest; the second one is developed through the scenarios where at time \u201cn\u201d the crop yield forecast is determined according to the range given by the ensembles of climatically similar years (developed in section 3.6). However, today one of the R&D directions to improve the system is the introduction of climate forecasts at different time span in the system. This approach uses output from CGM forecasts ensemble climate forecast approach (see vol.1 of this series) seems one of the most promising. The experience is investigating the use of forecasts at 10 days, monthly, seasonal and on climatic dimensions (dekad, century). The result expected could improve the timeliness of the forecasts, partially improve the uncertainty of the system treating its input/output flow in a probabilistic \u201censemble\u201d approach: at time \u201cn\u201d the crop ",
        "59 yield forecast at harvest will include the effect of the most probable weather from time \u201cn\u201d to harvest as given by the climatic forecasts. The \u201cpredictors\u201d are any variables which can be observed annually and related to crop yield at harvest time. The nature of the \u201cpredictor\u201d can be meteorological (any parameter as tmax, tmin, rain, radiation levels. PET) regionalised (CMETEO for instance see Chapt. 1); crop specific simulated parameter (for instance CGMS crop-soil moisture see Chapt. 2); derived from remote sensing (SPOT-Vgt NDVI and the regionalised version CNDVI see Chapt. 3). The trend extrapolation is also considered as a predictor. The function of the trend and period on which to calculate it is object of discussion as can heavily influence the final model. In the process of finalizing a bulletin report the MCYFS analysists goes through the following steps (A) meteorological impact evaluation (B) crop status assessment (C) crop growth expectations (D) yield forecasts The scheme is followed during the analysis and along the season. In steps from A to C the \u201cpredictors\u201d are generated, confronted and analysed, then in step D are statistically evaluated. In the modelling process other medium and long-term non-biological or non- geophysical factors that could influence the crop yield, such as a technological trend, are taken into account, basically modelling the yield time trend, including the main factors of technological improvements. Hence, the classic approach in the field of prediction, suggesting that the past generates the future, is respected. The forecasts (or early estimates) are therefore always available, updated in near-real time and able to anticipating most other sources of information (Genovese G., 1998). The forecasting approach The crop yield forecast procedure assesses yield forecasts in ton.ha-1 fresh weight using different methods and software tools. The philosophy of the approach is outlined in the following: y = f1(trend) + and/or [ 1 ] f2 (crop simulation) and/or f3 (meteorological data) and/or f4 (satellite data) and/or f... (other input) + e residual error. The functions f. are explained in the other volumes of this series. Of course the linearity is here just a simplification. This approach can generate a big number of available forecasts, only part of them statistically performant and acceptable and a few respecting a direct link cause (climate impact)-consequence (crop yield) as logic. This is why within the MCYFS some priorities are followed in selecting the final model which will give the forecasts. 1) As a first step, yields are predicted by the CGMS statistical sub system which uses agricultural yield statistics and simulated crop indicators. This system consists of a linear regression model combining the mean yield, a linear time trend and a linear regression function to explain the update until harvest ",
        "60 residual variation (Vossen, 1990b; 1992). The linear time trend represents the influence of long- term economic and technological dynamics such as increased fertiliser application, improved crop management methods, new high yielding varieties, etc. on yields. The residual variation is modelled as a function of crop growth simulation results (potential or water limited dry weight of the simulated biomass or storage organs). As said before these simulated crop indicators account for the inter-annual yield variation that results from weather variability. 2) When for a certain combination of country and crop the accuracy of the predicted yield is deemed not to be sufficient, the MARS analysts at JRC start to redefine trend periods and functions. This part must not be underestimated as the trend reference can have a serious effect on the final forecasting model selected. 3) In some occasions the analysts build their own prediction models for certain combinations of crops and countries. These models use other crop indicators like simulated leaf area index and CNDVI. At the moment this part is not automated and thus time consuming. In future, these indicators and new indicators such as CMETEO (see Vol. 1 of this series), Ta/Tp (see Vol.2 of this series) will be added to the automated procedure of the statistical sub-system of the CGMS. 4) To deal with the uncertainty given by the unknown evolution of the season from the moment the forecast is issued to the moment the crop is harvested, agro-meteorological scenario\u2019s can be produced and analysed. The scenarios are currently based on agro-meteorological similar years as detected by cluster and factorial analyses (Principal Component Analysis (PCA) techniques). Once agro-climatic years are detected which are similar to the current year, the resulting range of final yield performances of these years can be attributed to the current season. The extremes maximum and minimum yields obtained in the clusters of similar years are always characterised through the factorial analysis. If a trend exists the range of final yields will be corrected for this trend before relating the yields to the current year. This technique helps to understand how the yield prediction could still change before harvesting. 5) As a last attempt to determine the yield forecast, and in the optic to be able to release a forecast at EU level by aggregating National forecasts, the calculation of the trimmed average is performed. I.e. yield statistics of the last five years are taken and ranked. The trimmed average is the average of the three centre years. This trimmed average will be used as yield forecast when all other methods (prediction models such as CGMS level 3, trend analysis, scenario analysis) do not lead to satisfactory results or when there is a lack of data, a gap in the time series. At the moment the human analysis based on the accumulated experience and knowledge of the phenomena involved, is a consistent weight in the decision of which model better expresses the final yield. For instance a low simulated yield scenario (scenario analysis) could be accepted as forecasts if there are clear signs of the effect of negative factors which are not modelled in CGMS (i.e. heat stress in final grain maturity, strong rain at harvest, but also higher than normal risk of potential pests and diseases, severe drought effects etc.). The final choice is made empirically trying to optimise the pattern of reliability given by all sources. The optimisation of this pattern is an objective function of the MCYFS (Genovese, 1998). Decisions and final choices are documented through a system called COBO (Control Board). The final predicted yields for each country, as established by the MARS analysts, are published in the MARS bulletin. The yield forecasts that are produced automatically by the statistical sub system of the CGMS are available on internet (http://www.marsop.info). It shows how the yield forecasts of the CGMS develop throughout the growing season. ",
        "61 According to previous analysis (Genovese 1998) the desired level of accuracy is reached when the error is lower than 3% at national level. The level remains appreciable if it is lower than 6%. If the error is greater than 6% the yield forecast can be considered unacceptable with one exception: if the error is still lower than that of any other source available. In that case the MCYFS still produces an improvement which could be economically relevant. For winter crops the yield forecast should be accurate before June, for summer crops before August. A global evaluation of the system performances was made in 1998 using data until 1997 (Genovese, 1998). The RMSE error has been used as error indicator by comparing the MCYFS forecasts with ex-post observed results. The average yield forecast error ranges from about 3% to 5% at EU level for the main crops (8.3% for durum wheat). In absolute terms the average error for wheat ranges between about 2 and 4 quintals ha-1 both for European and national levels (Genovese, 2001). In general what has been shown is that the system gives higher errors at the beginning of the season and lower at the end according to a cumulative effect of the climate impact on the crop behaviour. The error analysis is repeated each year in order to carefully watch the performance of the MCYFS, individuate sources of errors and take decision on which part of the MCYFS has to be improved. The MARS Unit launched a study called QUAMP (Quantitative Assessment of MARS Predictions) to calculate the overall performance of the system including the period 1998-2001. Various authors have proposed to subdivide crop yield in three components: mean yield, multi- annual trend and residual variation (e.g. Vossen, 1989; Dagnelie et al., 1983; Dennet et al., 1980; Odumodu and Griffits, 1980). It is assumed that the interacting effects of climate, soil, management, technology, etc. determine the mean yield. Observed national, regional and sub- regional yields show a trend in time. The trend is mainly due to long-term economic and technological dynamics such as increased fertiliser application, improved crop management methods, new high yielding varieties, etc. The third component, the residual variation, is considered to be the variation among years (Dennet et al., 1980). It is exactly this part which should be explained by weather, crop and remote sensing indicators. According to Dennet et al. (1980) and Odumodu and Griffits (1980), the technological time trend should be removed from the crop yield time series, assuming that the residual variation is independent of that trend. This approach can be summarised as (Vossen, 1989): (1) (2) (3) (4) where: Y T : observed yield in year T [ton.ha -1 ] Y : mean yield [ton.ha -1 ] f(T) : technological trend as a function of time [ton.ha -1 ] ) ( weather f e = e Y Y T T = \u2212 \u02c6 ( ) T f Y Y T + = \u02c6 ( ) e T f Y Y T + + = ",
        "62 e : residual, not explained by trend [ton.ha -1 ] $ Y T : estimated yield in year T using a trend function [ton.ha -1 ] f(weather) : function of weather variables (e.g. 10-day rainfall etc.) [ton.ha -1 ] Palm and Dagnelie (1993) fitted various time trend functions to national yield series (ton.ha-1) of several crops for 9 EU member states. Regressions were executed for the period prior to 1983 and a forecast for 1983 was made. This procedure was repeated for successive years up till 1988. The prediction results were compared with national yield values. Of the tested functions a quadratic function of time performed best. However, differences with a simple linear trend function were small. In a next step, these authors removed the trend from the yield series using the quadratic function. The residuals for the period prior to 1983 were regressed against various meteorological parameters and a prediction for 1983 was made. Again, this procedure was repeated for successive years up till 1988. This was done for 19 Departments in France. Comparing the predicted and official yield series demonstrated that the applied meteorological variables did not improve the prediction accuracy. Swanson and Nyankori (1979) for corn and soybean production in the USA, Sakamoto (1978) for wheat production in South Australia, Agrawal and Jain (1982) for rice yields in the Raipur District in India, considered the technological time-trend dependent on the residual variation. According to Winter and Musick (1993), Hough (1990b) and Smith (1975), weather affects farm management practices such as planted area, timing of field operations, application of inputs, etc. Hence, the time trend should be analysed simultaneously with the explaining variables. This approach can be summarised as (Vossen, 1989): (5) where: b0 is \u2018theoretical\u2019 yield in absence of a trend and weather influences. Swanson and Nyankori (1979) showed that the time trend was underestimated when weather data were not analysed simultaneously with the time trend. Similar results were found for millet in Botswana (Vossen, 1989). Equation 5-5 does not account for the interaction between crop growth and weather variability. Also root characteristics and soil physical properties are not accounted for. Therefore Vossen (1990b, 1992) proposed to use crop growth simulation results to describe year-to-year yield variation. In a crop growth simulation model weather and soil characteristics are summarised and crop characteristics, including yield form the output, i.e. simulation results quantitatively represent the influence of weather variables on crop growth. The yield can be written as: (6) where: f(simulation) is function of crop growth simulation results that accounts for the yield variation that result from weather variability. Current Situation In the MCYFS yield forecasts in ton.ha-1 fresh weight are produced using different methods and software tools. This figure shows the various steps in the analysis to derive yield forecasts and forms the reading guide for the following paragraphs. The philosophy of the yield forecasting approach is outlined in the following formula: (7) where: ( ) ( ) e weather f T f b Y T + + + = 0 ( ) e simulation f T f b Y T + + + = ) ( 0 e RS or and SIM or and MET or and T f Y T + = ) / / / ( ",
        "63 YT : observed yield in year T [ton.ha-1] f(T) : technological trend as a function of time [ton.ha-1] f(MET) : function of weather indicators [ton.ha-1] f(SIM) : function of simulated crop indicators [ton.ha-1] f(RS) : function of remotely sensed indicators [ton.ha-1] e : residual, not explained by trend and functions [ton.ha-1] This approach relies on the elasticity of adding or excluding factors, during the year, that improve the forecasts. The factors can be complementary in some part of the year, in other parts they can be considered less certain. Each one of the elements represents a self-contained model able to produce a yield forecast, but with a different degree of accuracy or, if not measurable, of reliability. The first predictions of production volumes are based on the extrapolation of historical crop yield time series and planted area. Crop yield predictions are refined in the course of the year, from early indicators based on provisional data to final results. Information provided by various sources are analysed and combined to improve the initial predictions. The GIS, relational databases and statistical software are intensively used to manage all information stored in the MARS project archives. During the process to establish the forecasts connection with the knowledge of the structure of the territory is maintained (morphology, pedology, crop practices in use etc.). For instance the crop phenology simulation permits to check how the climatic evolution influences the crop development. In case of a negative influence probable yield losses should be quantified. Existing literature can indicate the probability of yield losses for the crop investigated, considering the problem at that time, and the constraint of the territory (Genovese, 1998). The priority scheme for the forecasting procedure: is as follows: \u2022 use CGMS based forecast, if results are not performing then: \u2022 evaluate trend alone, if not performing: \u2022 try other prediction models, if not performing: \u2022 evaluate scenario\u2019s, if not performing: \u2022 use a trimmed average, eventually The scenario analysis is in fact run systematically and the extremes values obtained are used to generate the two extreme pessimistic and optimistic scenario of final crop yield. This information is evaluated especially in the early part of the season. The CGMS prediction model Official statistics of regional mean yields are predicted by the CGMS using one of the following simulated predictors (see Chapt.. 2 for a detailed description of the predictor): \u2022 Potential dry weight of the simulated biomass (ton.ha-1). \u2022 Water limited dry weight of the simulated biomass (ton.ha-1). \u2022 Potential dry weight of the simulated storage organs (ton.ha-1). \u2022 Water limited dry weight of the simulated storage organs (ton.ha-1). Originally, it was intended to predict yields by solely using the water limited weight of storage organs in the prediction model. Later on, the other three were added. Water limited yield, for instance, is inappropriate for a region with a lot of irrigation. Furthermore drought stress can be strongly reduced in case of groundwater influence. This factor is not included in the CGMS. The simulated biomass indicators were added because these are more robust, and less sensitive to modelling errors in the distribution of assimilates. Moreover they also allow yield prediction during the growing season, when grain filling has not yet started or grains are still very small (de Koning et al., 1993). Today, within the new releases of CGMS (release 8) all of the crop parameters can be used as predictors including Leaf Area Index, Soil Moisture and Development Stage. Other ",
        "64 indicators will be implemented soon as the ratio between the estimated actual crop transpiration and potential crop transpiration (Ta/Tp, see Vol. 2 for a description). The statistical sub system of the CGMS uses a combination of a linear time trend and crop growth simulation results as proposed by Vossen (1990b, 1992). This prediction model can be described as: (8) where: T Y \u02c6 and S T are estimated yield and simulation results or predictors (ton.ha-1), respectively in year T, and b0, b1 and b2 are regression constants. Constant b0 represents the average official statistical yield (ton.ha-1), constant b1 is the yearly increase of the official yield (ton.ha-1). Sub- optimal production circumstances such as drought, low temperatures etc. are allowed for by the constant b2, which should lie between 0 and 1. Per region, for a moving window of at least 9 years, the regression coefficients are established and subsequently used for yield prediction of the 10th year (\u2018one-year-ahead\u2019). The selection of the predictor to forecast the final yield is as follows. Each candidate predictor is fitted to the data currently available for this region. Candidates with a negative estimate of b2 are rejected because of the nature of the process. From the remaining ones, that with the lowest jackknife mean square error is selected. Jackknife errors are calculated by simulating that an observation is absent and that the predictor is used to assess its value. It reveals the error in predicting the observation which had been kept out of sight. Obviously, jackknife errors are not entirely relevant in the present situation where we want to predict the future rather than to reconstruct the past. For direct application it is more relevant to investigate the prediction of the one-year-ahead. Still the jackknife method is used because the jackknife error-size estimates are less variable, being based on a larger number of predictions. With the same number of observations \u2018n\u2019 the jackknife method has \u2018n\u2019 error estimates while the \u2018one year ahead\u2019 prediction, has only \u2018n-y\u2019 error estimates where \u2018y\u2019 is the number of years on which the prediction is based. More detailed descriptions are given by de Koning et al. (1993) and Jansen (1995). A quadratic trend function is also considered in the CGMS. However, based on results of Palm and Dagnelie (1993) and de Koning et al. (1993), it was concluded that a linear trend sufficiently describes the increasing official yields. A smooth trend of any type over a large number of years assumes a continuity which might be unrealistic (de Koning et al., 1993; Vossen, 1992; 1990a). According to Vossen and Rijks (1995) the predictor should only be based on data from the recent past. The length of the series should nevertheless be long enough to give a sufficient number of degrees of freedom in the regression analysis. Gradual shift in the time trend is allowed for by the shortness of the time series, used to derive the predictor. The statistical sub-system of the CGMS version 2.3 has recently been redesigned in S-PLUS 2000 Professional (Kuyper, 2001) as a spear module. In CGMS version 8.0 the level 3 module has been reconverted using Delphi language, enlarged in functionalities and re-included in the system. Scenario or analogue analysis To deal with the residual uncertainty given by the unknown evolution of the season from the moment the forecast is issued to the moment the crop is harvested, agro-meteorological scenario\u2019s can be produced and analysed. The scenario analyses consist in finding the most similar agro- meteorological years basing on the time series of parameters simulated by the CGMS. The analysis is based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Factor Analysis and Cluster Analysis (Hair et al., 1998). As input crop indicators of the CGMS of all available years are used. It is stressed that the climatic similarities are established basing on the time series of agro-meteorological parameters. In fact year similar in climatology are not necessarily similar in crop response as small changes in the T T S b T b b Y 2 1 0 \u02c6 + + = ",
        "65 sequence of the meteorological events can have a major effect in crop behaviour, this is why the approach is run directly on the crop parameters. Fig. 21: An example of the evolution of the yield forecast in the course of the growing season as given by the automatic level3 of CGMS. These results are systematically available on www.marsop.info and are updated regularly. 1.00 1.25 1.50 1.75 2.00 2.25 2.50 2.75 3.00 3.25 3.50 3.75 4.00 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 YIELD t/ha linear trend maximum minimum Fig. 22: Maximum and minimum trend evolution for wheat in Rumania based on the period 1991-2000. The PCA gives a new combination of independent variables (factors). The first factors, explaining up to 90% of the variability, are selected and the combination of pairs of factors\u2019 axis are analysed using as unit the original variables. The Unit (years\u2019 observation) are then plotted on the new factors to characterise the years (for instance dry and hot season\u2026). This is repeated for each country and at crop level (we remind that the original variables are the crop growth parameters as simulated by the CGMS). The analyst launches then a cluster analysis on the new factors (normally a hierarchical cluster) obtaining groups of homogeneous year according to obtained factors. Similarity or dissimilarity matrixes help to put a hierarchy on similarities among years. Once the score of similarities obtained and the hierarchy of similarity obtained the forecast is obtained as weighted average of the corresponding yields (in case de-trended). Weights are given by the similarity indexes. From the cluster of similar years different simple statistics are also used: ",
        "66 within the group of the similar year the maximum and the minimum values of yield are used for optimistic and pessimistic yield scenarios. Here follow some examples: 1 - Germany soft wheat scenarios in 2003 made during the second dekade of May using as input all dekades of soil moisture and development stage values (years analysed from 1975 to 2003): The scree plot on the left shows the eigenvalues of the factor analysis run on 20 variables. The first two corresponding axis (the most explanatory) are given above on the right. One can note that the first quadrant is correlated with development stage (all concentrated here) direct expression of the influence of temperatures on crops. The y axis is explained by the crop soil moisture in April. Looking at the axis counter-clockwise the north-east direction in the first quadrant expresses the most hot and humid years (in terms of effect on crops), the north-west direction in the second quadrant the cold and humid years, the southwest in the third quadrant the cold and dry year, the south-east in the forth quadrant the hot and dry years. The graph below shows the position of the years in the new axis obtained (first two): ",
        "67 In this example, one can note that the 2003 was at that time not so far from the origin appearing as a year slightly dry and cold in May. However, the position of 2003 in the new system of co-ordinates was opposite to 2002 (year characterised by a very high level of precipitations). 2- Spain soft wheat scenarios in 2000 made during March using as input all dekads of soil moisture and development stage values (years analysed from 1975 to 2000): In this example all the variables are analysed in the same dekad. The variables are Dev. Stage (DS), Soil Moisture (SM), Potential Biomass (PB), Potential Storage Organs (PS), Waterlimited Storage Organs (WS), Potential Leaf Area Index (PLAI) and Water Limited Leaf Area Index (WLAI). The difference between potential and water limited indicators is explained in of this series. The factor analysis gave the following results that show that the first two components explain almost 90% of the variability. and this is the corresponding plot and the contribution of each variable to the final variability: 6.190 77.373 77.373 6.190 77.373 77.373 .987 12.336 89.709 .987 12.336 89.709 .702 8.774 98.483 6.297E-02 .787 99.270 4.665E-02 .583 99.853 9.297E-03 .116 99.969 2.371E-03 2.963E-02 99.999 7.247E-05 9.059E-04 100.000 Component 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Total % of Variance Cumulative % Total % of Variance Cumulative % Initial Eigenvalues Extraction Sums of Squared Loadings Total Variance Explained Extraction Method: Principal Component Analysis. ",
        "68 And below the corresponding plots of the variables on the first 2 axis and the units (year). The year 2000 was placed among the normal year at that time. To be stressed the years in the fourth quadrant of the last chart that can be read the area of the dry and hot years (years of drought) already well characterised in March. This technique helps to understand how the yield prediction could still change before harvesting. In theory the more the growing season advances the lower is the number of similar years remaining thus lower the uncertainty. Further studies are in course to validate the approach.

        "77 CROP STATE MONITORING AND CROP\u2019S PRODUCTIVITY FORECASTING IN RUSSIA Alexander Kleschenko, Oleg Sirotenko, Oleg Virchenko National Institute on Agricultural Meteorology, Russia Introduction Agro-meteorological information is of significant importance for normal economies. It is worth to give only the one example: there is a special Commission for Agricultural Meteorology between the only six technical commissions established by the World Meteorological Organization. In Russia the agro-meteorological observations began in 1884 almost simultaneously with meteorological and hydrological observations. In 1938 was established the Institute of Forecasts and the agro- meteorological department was not the smallest within the structure of the Institute. In 1965 the department was moved in Obninsk, 100 km from Moscow. In 1977 the department was transformed in the National Institute on Agricultural Meteorology. Now the staff of the Institute is equal to 92 employees, among them 7 professors and 15 researchers with PhD degrees. The activity of the Institute is aimed at investigating and understanding of weather and climate influence on crop growth, development and productivity. There are several types of activity the Institute is involved in, such as development of new technologies and procedures, preparation of agro-meteorological forecasts, reviews and reports. The Institute is conducting research projects in such areas as agro- meteorological forecasting and modeling, climate change and agriculture, agro-climatology, application of remote sensing to agro-meteorology and agriculture, procedures and techniques of agro-meteorological observation. Within the country the agro-meteorological services reach the end users through a specialized system, which provides hydro-meteorological services and products to different kind of consumers. This article describes the main components of the agro-meteorological subsystem, shows its advantages and weak points, and presents some perspectives and further developments. The system of agro-meteorological services It is necessary to emphasize once more that the majority of end users receive agro-meteorological information and relevant products through the system of agro-meteorological services, which is a component of Russian hydro-meteorological service. The structure of this agro-meteorological system is presented on Fig. 1, and the scheme of its work on the Fig. 2. The base, the foundation of the system is the agro-meteorological network. The network gathers the ground truth data about parameters of vegetation within the fields and pastures. There are 1034 agro-meteorological stations, which conduct routine ground observations. The number of measured or evaluated parameters is numerous enough: 20 for atmosphere, more than 10 for soils and 30 for plants. The second level consists of agro-meteorological groups or divisions within district hydro- meteorological bodies, which work in each from 89 administrative unit, so called subjects of Russian Federation. The employees from that level prepare some agro-meteorological documents, such as reviews, bulletins, forecasts, etc., and provide agro-meteorological services and information to the local administration, farmers and other local users (on Fig. 1 it is denoted by CGM \u2013 from Center on Hydro-meteorology in Russian transcription). ",
        "78 Fig.1 The structure of the agro-meteorological system. Fig. 2. The flow chart of the system work The next level coincides with partition of the country territory on the big economic regions or areas with several districts in each. The corresponding hydro-meteorological body, UGMS on the Fig. 1, located in the center of the regions, include the agro-meteorological department, which is responsible for all types of agro-meteorological services within the region. As a rule the structure of the agro-meteorological department includes not only technical and operational divisions but a research group. The personnel of such groups conducts some regional agro-meteorological projects, tests and evaluates new technologies, procedures and approaches. The two organizations are situated on the top of this agro-meteorological pyramid: the agro- meteorological department of the Hydro-meteorological Center of Russia (Moscow) and National Institute on Agro-meteorology (Obninsk), GMC and CXM on Fig. 1. The responsibility concerning the territory, cultivated crops, types of forecasts, etc. is shared between them. The relevant documents and forecasts are used generally by different government bodies and structures. As to the flow chart of the system work (Fig. 2) it is necessary to emphasize that there are the problems with access to the source of information, marked out with red. The demand on agro- meteorological information and products from the several categories of users (also marked by red) ",
        "79 is very low, and, which is more unacceptable, they do not rely on agro-meteorological information even in situations when such information is of significant importance. There are several key factors, which ensure the sustainability and effectiveness of the system. First of all, it is the unique set of agro-meteorological information \u2013 agro-meteorologists have several series of yield and meteorological parameters being observed continuously during 75 \u2013 100 years, and dozens of series in 50 years long. It is also very important that the agro-meteorological community poses a number of valid procedures for developing, testing and implementing new techniques and approaches. The principal elements are testing and implementing. The consequence of actions looks as follows: \u2022 The new technique and results of its testing conducted by authors are considered on the session of the national or a regional scientific & technical council \u2022 If the council decision is positive the new technique with the detailed instruction on application and the test program is sent in districts or regions to conduct independent test and evaluation during 2 \u2013 3 years. \u2022 The results of such independent testing and evaluating are estimated on the session of the corresponding regional scientific & technical council, which could recommend to use the new technique as a base or auxiliary procedure. After using such scheme to all new techniques, methods and procedures agro-meteorologists received the very reliable tool kit working effectively in majority of agro-meteorological situations. Forecasting and monitoring Agro-meteorological forecasts are the product, which is the most known and the demand on it is always high. There are several types of forecast with the scale from district to the country. Traditional forecasts of crop productivity are issued on June 20 and July 20. The forecasting accuracy T (in per cents) is estimated through a relative error P (in per cents) according to the following relationship P = (|Yf \u2013 Yr| / Yr ) \u00b7 100%, where Yf \u2013 forecast, Yr \u2013 real yield T = 100 - P The corresponding results for winter crops are presented in the table 1. There are several approaches being at extensive use at preparing agro-meteorological forecasts. First of all, it is the statistic analysis, including the calculation of some regression relationships with different sets of predictors, which are of significant dependence from cultivated crop, territory, time, etc. Effectiveness of such relationships could be very high, especially if they are used at the well defined specific conditions. The problems arise at the attempts to spread the regressions on other territories, periods or conditions. In such cases it is desirable to use so called \u201cdynamic models\u201d of crops growth and development. There were several attempts to develop decision support systems for forecasters, but till now the contradiction between effectiveness and universalism of similar systems is not resolved. A new technique of agro-meteorological forecast with increased lead time on the base of statistic approach, but with some synoptic parameters (sea temperature, pressure, circulation index) as ",
        "80 additional predictors were developed in our institute by a team headed by Prof. Pasov. The flow chart for such forecasts is presented on Fig. 3. Table 1.

        "82 The very important and useful information is gathered through the subsystem of agro- meteorological monitoring. For our country with a long and severe winter agro-meteorologists have developed special procedures for winter crop state evaluation at vegetation cessation in autumn and at crop growth resumption in spring. Agro-meteorological bodies at all levels prepare the report with evaluation of crop growth condition every 10 days during the vegetation period. The example of output document, prepared on the base of remote sensing data from meteorological satellites such as Meteor \u2013 3M or NOAA calibrated with the ground true observations (the crop\u2019s density was used) is presented on Fig. 6. Blue denotes clouds and water, other colors correspond to crops with different state \u2013 bad, satisfactory, good and satisfactory. In the recent years the importance of drought monitoring has been increased. To meet the new challenges the special center for drought monitoring was established in 2002. The center will develop techniques for drought detection and evaluation, for estimation of impact on agriculture. Fig. 6. Crop state estimation (end of September, 2003) The center conducts monitoring on the territory of the following states: Azerbaijan, Armenia, Byelorussia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzia, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. The example of an output document could be seen on fig. 7. There are two very promising areas for agro-meteorology: crop growth modeling and remote sensing application. They are not the new approaches, but until now, at least in our country, they develop in parallel with other areas of agro-meteorology. We want to change the situation. ",
        "83 Fig. 7. Spread of drought (Russia, July 2004, 3 \u2013 medium ) The weaknesses and further development of agro-meteorological system We think that the system of agro-meteorological service has suffered from three main weaknesses. The system was developed in the times of the USSR for conditions of central planned economy and it is not fitted very well to the market realities. For example, there are problems with the assess to some information sources, even at the top level. There are no formal procedures to take the decision on the base of agro-meteorological forecasts, and the majority of end-users does not want to pay anything for agro-meteorological information and products. The second weakness is due of agro-meteorological observation quality deterioration and drastic decrease of agro-meteorological network. The third weakness, according to our point of view, is the result of insufficient efforts to joint the huge existing experience of agro-meteorologists with achievements of modern information technologies. We want to develop and implement a new information subsystem of agro-meteorological services, which could be able to evaluate crop\u2019s state and to calculate some estimates for yield for any crop within any area at any time. To do this we relay on the following results, tools and resources: \u2022 Crop growth model developed by the team headed by Prof. Sirotenko \u2022 Algorithms and procedures for processing and interpreting remote sensing data developed by the team headed by Prof. Kleschenko \u2022 Software for processing, interpreting and distributing meteorological, agro- meteorological and remote sensing information developed and tested by the staff of our institute \u2022 C++ (Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0) as a principal programming language \u2022 InterBase as a Data Base Management System \u2022 MatLab (Release 13) as a library of different procedures \u2022 Data Fusion and results of Rough Sets Theory as means for data integration \u2022 Windows XP as an operational system ",

        "85 MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT OF SPRING CROPS IN KAZAKHSTAN Umirzak Sultangazin, Nadiya Muratova, Alexey Terekhov Space Research Institute, Ministry of Education and Science, Kazakhstan Introduction The Republic of Kazakhstan (RK) is a newly independent country at the center of the Eurasian continent with ninth largest landmass in the world, about 2.7 million square kilometers. About 82% of the total area of Kazakhstan is used for agricultural purposes, but mainly it is low productive pastures. Arable lands were about 10% of the territory and were decreased to half after economic reforms in 1994. Despite of this fact, Kazakhstan remains position of significant grain producer and exporter of wheat in Central Asia region. Most of the arable lands are located in the northern part of the country where typical landscapes are steppe and forest-steppe and most crop production is only rain fed. The average annual precipitation is about 400 mm with considerable spatial and inter-seasonal variations that result similar variation in crop yields. At present time, arable lands are basically located in five administrative oblasts (Fig. 1) and produce up to 16 million metric tons of grain under good weather conditions. About 8 million tons of grain is used for domestic consumption, and the rest is exported. So monitoring of agriculture areas and crop condition is very important for republic economics and grain market. Accurate and timely information about crop yield is critical data for local managing organizations. Fig. 1. Remote monitored crops lands in Northern Kazakhstan Modern technology like remotely sensed (RS) data with GIS techniques is advantageous to acquire information about agriculture production (Moulin et al., 1998; Zakarin et al., 1999; Doraiswamy et al., 2001, 2002; Sultangazin et al., 2005). At present time NOAA and TERRA satellite data are really accessible for Kazakhstan. American satellite data NOAA/AVHRR with low resolution (1 km) \u0438 TERRA/MODIS with middle resolution (250 m) have wide (more than 2000 km) scanning swath of the Earth surfaces, that allow to provide high frequency of one place covering by the satellite information and practically carry out daily monitoring of Kazakhstan territory. System of agricultural production remote evaluation on the base of satellite low and middle resolution data is most effective for territory of Northern Kazakhstan, where not irrigated zone reaches 2000 km from the East on the West and 700 km from the South on the North. Applicability of these satellite data is caused by the large sizes of crop fields (from 200 to 500 ha), which settled down usually as compact massive with above 1000 sq km typical size. Additionally, the primary vegetation in Northern Kazakhstan is spring wheat and pasture. Practice of spring wheat or barley single-crop cultivation creates 78% 36% Part in the general area of the state Part of arable lands under crops ",
        "86 extremely favorable conditions of low and middle resolution satellite data use for monitoring tasks. Practical use of the satellite information for sowing areas estimation has been initiated by the Government RK order to Space Research Institute of the Ministry of Education and science (SRI) in 1997. The satellite information with low spatial resolution NOAA (1 km) was used for this work. At performance of the Ministry of Agriculture (MA) order RESOURCE Russian satellite multispectral data with middle resolution (160 m) of MSU-SK scanner were analyzed in 1998. In 2000-2001 European technology of sowing areas remote estimation has been adapted by TACIS program of the technical help (ISEAM project). In 2002-2004 by the MA order SRI carried out space monitoring of agricultural production basically by TERRA/MODIS data (250 m resolution). SRI experience in use of the satellite information has allowed to develop National space monitoring system (NSMS) of agriculture. Space monitoring system of agriculture Today many countries are developing space monitoring systems in interests of various economy branches. At the present moment elaboration of Kazakhstan NSMS is started. One of NSMS tasks is the grain manufacture control. The system has to control of land use and supply MA and others state and commercial structures by the operative and objective data about agricultural production. General scheme of agriculture space and special ground monitoring is showed on figure 2. Full realization of the suggested scheme is possible only within the framework of the special state program. Separate blocks of this system already function due to the organization of satellite information reception in SRI. Since 1994 there is being exploited the Centre of remote sensing data receiving and processing in Almaty where the data from NOAA, TERRA, Meteor-3M satellites are being received daily. These data cover the territory of Kazakhstan and neighbor countries 5-6 times per day. SRI develops the technologies of satellite data processing during several years (Terekhov, Muratova, 2002; Sultangazin et al., 2003, 2004; Muratova, Terekhov, 2004). New SRI center started to work in the beginning of Space monitoring of agriculture Monitoring of spring sowing and harvesting calendar dates Spring soil productive moisture stock monitoring Spring sown areas estimation Crop yield forecast Fallow fields areas estimation Monitoring of crop state Arable lands ground surveys Agriculture economic efficiency Fig 2. Scheme of agriculture space and special ground monitoring ",
        "87 2004 in Astana where Indian IRS satellite data are received. The reception of Canadian RADARSAT satellite data is planed to be organized in 2005. The organization of operative reception and thematic processing of satellite information in frame of NSMS work allow to estimate the real situation in the main crop sowing regions of Kazakhstan and neighbor territories of Russia, which influence and form the local grain market. A brief overview of Kazakhstan experience on wheat discrimination and inventory, growth assessment and production forecasting follows below. Ground surveys for satellite data calibration Ground surveys is key inform source of agriculture space monitoring. There are two approaches to field observations. The first is the field inspection when information for simple thematic processing is collected. The list of such tasks includes crop and fallow fields\u2019 masks creation. For example, fallow fields have several mechanical processing during vegetative season to remove weeds. Dynamic spectral pattern of these objects is close to bare soil and does not change during any weather conditions. So, there is no sense to carry out annual spectrometer measurements. It is enough to collect once the spectral signatures database which is necessary for classification of satellite data and creation of crop and fallow masks every year. The second approach is required at the decision of complicated tasks. The set of various weather and agro-technical factors make complex interrelation between spectral characteristics of fields and states of soil and vegetation. Into the list of such tasks enter following: spring soil moisture stock evaluation, planting dates determination, wheat state and weed infestation level estimation, crop productivity forecast. For example, wheat yield depends on biometrical parameters of ear. The ear size depends on spring soil moisture stock and weather conditions during critical period of its forming. Green biomass volume is formed earlier. Therefore, under unfavorable conditions small ear can be formed even at big plants biomass. Other important problem is weed infestation. Weed shoots depend from temperature and humidity condition in spring. The warm and dry spring provokes early and fast growth of weeds. Therefore, mechanical processing of fields, which is used everywhere in Northern Kazakhstan, considerably reduces weed infestation level. The damp and cold spring slows down shoots of weeds. In this case planting can pass up before weed shoots appearance and the contamination of fields reaches significant degrees. Thus, the same level of projective leaf covering can correspond with unequal crops productivity. Increase of yield forecast accuracy demands carrying out of annual ground surveys for current year features definition. The maintenance and technology of ground surveys carrying out in two approaches described above differs also. In the first case, this is expert inspection of fields with fixing of real land use types, fallow or other. The choice of route is based on soil and climatic zoning of Northern Kazakhstan. In the second case, there is a task of express surveys of arable lands 10 million hectare. It is necessary to collect the information about wheat state not only in view of soil - climatic features, but also weather variations inside territory of Northern Kazakhstan. There is limit of time on carrying out of all works. The collected information should concern to one phase of wheat growth. During a month, the same place can be in completely various condition. The high air temperature and humidity deficit can considerably change wheat state during 10 days. So reasonable time of ground surveys is 10-14 days when crop are earing and flowering. Special researches (Sultangazin et al., 2005) has been developed the crop fields surveys scheme. The simplest scheme of ground surveys is based on inspection of one spot on a field, ",
        "88 not further 200 m from border, and correlation of the received data to field average spectral characteristics. Thus, the information from 300-500 crop fields in all parts of Northern Kazakhstan collects within 10-14 working days. The level of errors is estimated as 6 %. Crop recognition and mask building Spectral channels of mid-resolution satellite systems such as MODIS (250 m pixel size) and Resource MSU-SK (160m) in red (MSU-SK \u2013 2 nd channel 0.54 \u2013 0.60 um; MODIS \u2013 1 st channel 0.62 \u2013 0.67 um) and near infra-red (MSU-SK 4 th channel \u2013 0.8 \u2013 1.1 um, MODIS \u2013 2 nd channel 0.841 \u2013 0.876 um) intervals are suitable for monitoring vegetation cover and crops from emergence to maturity. The typical size of crop fields (about 400 ha) allows covering them by 80-140 pixels of the satellite image with middle resolution that it is quite enough for the sure definition of their spectral characteristics. Cultivation of crops predetermines the certain law in change of spectral characteristics of fields during the vegetative period, connected with agro-technical works and features of plant growth. It enables to distinguish crops based on the analysis of spectral characteristics in red and near infrared channels and their and environment changes during the vegetative period. Vegetation classification requires multi-temporal imageries during the period when land use and land cover changes occur. Three key periods during the growing season were selected. These periods were at phenological stages when cultivated (agriculture, perennial grass species) or natural (pasture, meadows) vegetation have particular phenology stages of growth and their spectral reflectance were distinctly different. The specific crop stages that could potentially be identified by remote sensing data are crop shoots, maximum green biomass and maturity. The satellite imageries were carefully selected for clear sky conditions during each of the key period of crop development. For example data analyses in 2000 vegetation season was done using the Resource MSU-SK imageries dated April 25, May 6, June 10, 12, 13, July 13, 27. There was no data available from Resource MSU-SK satellite system in 2001 and MODIS satellite imageries were chosen for following dates: May 2,11,13, 23, 29; June 1, 7, 8, 9, 14; July 19, 20, 23, 24, 30, August 1, 2, 4, 12, 14, 15, 16, 21, 23 and September 5, 10, 12. In 2002 MODIS satellite imageries were cloudless in May 8, 11, 19, 20, 24, 26; June 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 14, 18, 19, 20, 23, 24, August 3. The satellite images are processed for geometric correction and cartographic standardization and combined during three to four weeks to produce a composite image for each described above phenological period. First period is from 15 May to 15 June is when planting and emergence of spring crop occurs. Cloudless pixels from all images during this period were examined for excess over the certain threshold value of reflectance in infrared band and their maximal values composite image was developed. The same procedure was done with selection criteria of minimum value in the infrared band below a threshold value and a second composite image was developed. The maximum and minimum composite images identify the locations of the presence of soil preparation for planting spring crops. The maximal reflectance above a set of threshold values identify not only agricultural fields but also the multiyear perennial grass species cultivated for forage. Second period for separation of agriculture crops is during July 10 to 31, when spring crop begins the stage of grain development. During this period the crops have reached the maximum level of leaf area index and above ground biomass. A maximum value composite image was developed from the reflectance in infrared band during this period. Based on historic data, the crops are expected to reach this stage during a three-week period due to differences in planting dates. The maximum value composite is expected to be the highest magnitude for agriculture crops during this period. ",
        "89 The final key period for classification is between August 15 and September 15 when the crops mature occurs. A maximum value composite of in red band reflectance was developed from the selected images during the same period. The high red band reflectance of the senesced crops that reached maturity is a very good identifier of cropped areas. RGB composite image (fig. 3) is formed from three mosaic images for key stages of crop development. The next step is crop classification developed by standard procedure like supervised classification method. Figure 4 shows the crop mask map-scheme for 2002. Table 1 contents the result of the classification for various crop and non-crop classes. Ground survey information was collected from 2139 fields. There were 460 non-crop fields and 1679 spring crop fields. Using our classification procedure, remote sensed data was able to identify 410 non-crop fields and 1729 crop fields. Thus 96,6% fields have been determined by satellite information as crops and 76,7% as non-crop cultures. Therefore, the MODIS 250 m pixel resolution data is sufficient for current agricultural land use pattern recognition. Table 1.

Sowing period for spring wheat and barley in Northern Kazakhstan is started in the beginning of May and continued till the middle of June. Harvesting is carried out from the end of August up to the end of September. Sowing date is one of the important factors determined crops productivity in Northern Kazakhstan. Grain cultures\u2019 cultivation guesses several spring fields processing procedures last of which is sowing. Period of sowing dates can reach 40 days and more. Main reasons of such large duration are the deficit of agricultural techniques and variation of spring weather conditions. Spring soil moisture stocks and summer precipitations form different conditions of crops growth that influence on their productivity. So sowing date choosing is one among important moments, which guarantee crop productivity. ",

        "91 Cultivation of spring grain cultures in Northern Kazakhstan accepts three following sowing periods: early - May from 5 to 15; optimal - May 15-25; late - May 25 - June 10 and far. The optimal dates of sowing ensure biggest productivity more often than other periods. However, there are frequent cases when the weather features determine greater productivity of early or late crops. For example, in 2003 the late crops had agro-meteorological advantage. Estimation of spring wheat sowing calendar dates is based on daily monitoring of the territory by the TERRA/MODIS satellite system during May and first half of June. The mechanical field processing is easily fixed with near infrared (2nd channel) spectral characteristics or vegetation indexes. SAVI (Huete, 1988) is the best among various vegetation indexes for Northern Kazakhstan conditions. Shoots and crop active growth is fixed as increase of SAVI or reflection values (fig. 5). The biggest spectral differences between crops with various sowing dates are observed in images during the period of 1-15 days after the finish of late sowing. In this period, early sowing crop fields already have 30-40 days for development and are bushing. Late ones have not been standing yet or have insignificant projective covering vegetation. Cloudless images are the best for this period analyzing and crop sowing dynamics estimation. Careful choice of a basic image is highly required for sowing dates estimation when dynamics of crop reflectance in infrared band is used for big areas. The basic problem of this approach is dependence between the soil reflection values and surface humidifying. There is the most objective picture after cyclone pass when soil on the big territory is humidified and has minimum of reflectance. In this case it is possible to use reflectance of 2 nd channels for processing. If such images are absent, then it is better to use of SAVI mosaic image. Average spectral characteristics of ground test fields are determined among chosen basic image. Ground data can be received from interviews of agronomists or from special field board containing information about current land use. Usually this is field size, type and sort of culture, sowing date etc. The part of these fields with known sowing dates is used for calibration curve (fig.6). The other part is helpful for an estimation of procedure accuracy. Than calculation inside preliminary built crop mask are carries out and a map of sowing dates is constructed. The results of space monitoring are presented to the authorities as graph (fig. 7) and scheme map of spring wheat sowing areas disposition, on which the sowing dates to be marked by colors (fig. 8). The system of fallow areas control is based on RS data from red and near infra-red channels which are the mostly sensitive to vegetation condition. At fallow areas estimation current and last year satellite data are used. Two methods of fallow areas estimation are developed. The first of them includes recognition of fields to be fallowing in accordance with normal agrarian recommendations. Mechanical processing is usually carried out up to 6 times during the period when weeds grow. Such fields are easily distinguished from all other land use types by the low values of reflection coefficients in near infra-red band during the whole vegetation season except sowing time (fig. 9) and fallow fields mask can be built by the simple threshold algorithm applied for images processing. ",
        "92 ` The second method of fallow fields recognition consists in definition of the whole fallow area including unprocessed fields. At present time, only limited number of agricultural districts (the area of 100,000-300,000 hectares) are estimated by this way and accompanied by creation of geoinformation systems with databases including satellite information. In this case the fields, which last year were used as arable lands and this year are not sowed, have been considered to be fallow. Thus, all fallow fields with infringement of the accepted norms (2 or 1 mechanical processing during the vegetation period) are accounted for. Fig.8.

        "93 Described fallow fields areas estimation is curried out for 10 million hectares of crop lands in Northern Kazakhstan. For example, RS analysis of 2003 season showed that about 12 % of fields have been processed with technological norms. Crops harvesting is one of the major stages in grain production. MA has interests in two moments of harvesting. First is harvesting way. There are different ways of crop harvesting. At present time MA recommends to harvest with mulch preparation and straw spreading which is the most progressive and saving soil fertility way. Characteristic dynamics of crop field spectral changes during harvesting with straw scattering are shown on the figure 10. The increase of reflection during the period between the end of August and the beginning of October specifies field harvesting. This effect is used for harvested acreages estimation. The second task is harvesting dynamics parameters estimation. Early frosts can damage the ungathered crop. Therefore, rate of harvesting is one of controllable parameters. The researches have shown that it is possible only by high resolution RS data to monitor crops harvest works. Fixing of field specific texture (fig. 11) or reflection increase indicate harvesting process. Unfortunately, to receive full high resolution covering 10 million hectare cropland in Northern Kazakhstan during the harvest period is not possible yet. Therefore the control of harvest rate can be carried out selectively for small territories on the basis of single high resolution images. Crop state estimation and potential productivity forecast There are several parameters characterized yield. Potential yield (PY) is cereals biological productivity under current weather condition and optimal technology of cropping that means the first culture after fallowed field, sown in optimal calendar dates by grain of good/high quality. PY is defined during ground surveys for test sites (one square meter area): PY = A*B*C/1000, where \u0410 \u2013 average number of seeds in one ear, \u0412 \u2013 population of plants, \u0421 \u2013 average weight of 1000 seeds.

        "94 Actual yield (AY) is PY with calculation of harvest loss and weed influence. The northern agriculture zone is characterized by significant variability of key parameters of spring cereals growth. The density of wheat productive stalks on one square meter may change from 150-200 in southern dry steppe areas to 350-450 in northern more humidified parts of the zone. The portion of soil surface participating in formation of the reflected light stream, even when the maximal volume of wheat green biomass (earing or flowering time), may reach 50 % (Fig. 12). Spectral characteristics of crop fields with factor of low projective covering depend strongly from the ground characteristics such as soil type and moisture, plants shaded area. These factors create some difficulties of spring crop recognition. So some optimal spectral parameter has to be selected for wheat state estimation and yield prognosis. Coefficients of Earth surface reflectance in red (RED) and (NIR) spectral zones are usually applied for vegetation conditions analyses. Different spectral vegetation indexes can be used as parameter. Among them, the simplest parameter is reflectance value in near infra- red channel (NIR). Some more complex vegetation indexes are following: Simple Ratio (SR); Weighted Difference Vegetation Index (WDVI); Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI); Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Global Environmental Monitoring Index (GEMI). Typical Northern Kazakhstan soil reflectance values are shown on the figure 13 and in Table 2. MODIS data was taken for fallow fields during vegetation period beginning from 1 May. All indexes were tested on model example. It was assumed, that 50% of model site is covered fully by plants, and another 50% is opened ground (Table 2). NIR, SR, WDVI, NDVI, SAVI \u0438 GEMI indexes were calculated for four different soil conditions and two set of vegetation reflectance values (Table 3). Table 2.

SR and NDVI show the worst results in all tests and are least suitable for quantitative estimation of vegetation condition in Northern Kazakhstan. GEMI has the least sensitivity to soil spectral characteristics variations, however appreciably loses WDVI, NIR, and SAVI in sensitivity to vegetation condition. WDVI demands frequently extra detailed and inaccessible information on soil without vegetation spectral characteristics. NIR and SAVI are close according to test results and optimal for quantitative estimation of vegetation condition in Northern Kazakhstan. NIR is suitable only for preliminary selected territories under agricultural crops in cloudless conditions. An additional benefit is use in calculations only one channel that it is surely concerning possible hardware problems with balance of channels sensitivity. Thus, at presence of land use mask and cloudless images it is possible to use of near infra- red reflection values for grain crops productivity forecast, for example 2 channel AVHRR/NOAA or TERRA/MODIS.

Choice of test fields was based on several criteria such as absence of weed infestation, optimum term of sowing and high quality of sowing material. Therefore, test sites got out inside mask of fallow fields in the last year. Preliminary zoning of Northern Kazakhstan territory by hydrothermal factor for June and July was carried out to fix spatial variations of weather conditions in current year and their influence on test fields productivity. A total of 33 well- managed wheat fields were chosen from various parts of Northern Kazakhstan for developing the calibration curve. A linear regression was constructed with an r2 value of 0.76. It was a basis for calculations of potential biological productivity (Fig. 14 - A). Monitoring of crop rotation and weed infestation estimation Weed infestation is the most influencing factor on crop productivity especially in cold spring years (Sultangazin et al., 2003). The volume of weed green biomass frequently exceeds the volume of spring wheat green biomass and thus the crop productivity is reduced to less than half of normal production. This causes the great challenge in wheat production forecast results based on remote sensing data, since the current satellite sensors (MODIS, AVHRR) and standard analyses methods cannot differentiate weeds from wheat. Spring wheat and barley are the dominating culture in Northern Kazakhstan. The basic type of cultivation was rotation of fallow and crops. Chemical methods of protection of crop fields from weeds now are just in progress. Low prices for grain in domestic market and low productivity do not give a chance to use the herbicides in ample amount. Herbicides against the most widespread type of weed (wild oats) are used insufficiently. The basic way of struggle against weeds is the mechanical processing of soil in spring planting time. The most efficient method is the keeping of part of arable lands as fallows. This method implies periodically cleaning fields from weeds by using machinery during vegetation period. The large grain companies use three-four years field rotation system. Poor farms may practice 8 or even 10 years field rotation system. Accordingly, the level of weed infestation in such fields is higher.

        "98 In 2001 USDA, Agricultural Research Service studied the spring wheat crop production in Northern Kazakhstan. The research was a part of USDA/NASA project entitled \u201cAssessment of Global Crop Production from New Generation Remote Sensing Technology\u201c. 22 fields were chosen in Shortandy rayon of Akmola oblast to measure the crop reflectance and wheat biometrical parameters. In this research the weed amount was analyzed both for defining the quantitative structure and their share in green biomass (Fig. 11). It was discovered, that the most typical weed for this region is wild oats, which architectonics and physiology of growth is very similar to wheat\u2019s. Quantitative estimation of crop field contamination degree is the key to develop the methods of crop productivity forecast for Northern Kazakhstan. The standard approach of yield prediction that uses the unequivocal connection between green biomass volume and spectral characteristics is not sufficient, especially when up to 60 % of total vegetative weight belongs to weeds. It is necessary to develop the methodology for calibration of satellite data on the base of annual ground surveys on selected test fields, which should be standardized under the factor of contamination. The quantitative description of field contamination can be described by degree that presents the part of weeds in number of plants. The degree of contamination was defined for one square meter areas in the typical places on the test fields. Contamination factor closely connected to weather condition and has significant variability. For example, in 2002 and 2003 the weather conditions were close in moistening but the spring weathers were unlike and the contamination factor influenced differently to crop productivity. By our estimation the yield lost caused by the weed infestation in 2002 was about 40 %, and in 2003 was about 25 % of potential grain yield and it consists with the estimation of Ministry of Agriculture of RK. Fields weed infestation is closely connected with number of culture after fallow. Ground observation is necessary for accumulation of information about weed infestation levels for different rotation fields in current year condition.

        "99 to estimate quantitatively current crop rotation system and thus to weigh influence of weedness factor on crops productivity in the current year. Two calendar periods are the most informative when satellite data are processed. First is sowing period from the second half of May to the beginning of June. There is a good spectral gradient between areas under crops and natural vegetation in this period. Second one is from second half of July to the beginning of August when the greatest reflectance difference is fixed between crops (earring-flowering phase) and fallow fields. Masks created for fallow fields during last 3 years by remote sensing data allow analyzing current structure of the spring cereals in view of fallow-crop rotation system. At present time four following classes of crops are developed: 1 st - the first sowing after fallow; 2 nd - the second sowing after fallow; 3 rd - the third sowing after fallow and 4 th - the fourth and more sowing after fallow (figure 12). The appreciable differences are observed between 1 st , 2 nd and 3 rd classes (fig. 13). Difference between 3 rd and 4 th classes is insignificant. Therefore, deeper historical analysis is not necessary. In the last years, the dynamics of crop rotation in croplands in Northern Kazakhstan had the positive tendency. The number of fallow fields grew (fig. 14) from 7 % in 2001, 8 % in 2002, 11 % in 2003 to 12 % in 2004. The satellite control of crop rotation and defining the contamination degree is rather perspective way to correct yield forecast obtained by statistical methods and physiological models of wheat growth. 1 2 3 4 Fig. 12 Fragment of fallow-crop rotation map ",
        "100 Spring wheat forecast using remote sensing data Two approaches to spring wheat productivity prognosis based on spectral features of grain crops or physiology of plant growth according current weather conditions are developed and tested in SRI. The first standard approach to wheat productivity prognosis consists in following scheme. Based on functional dependence of test fields spectral characteristics and biometrical parameters crops yield values were predicted and specified with the degree of weed infestation at various levels (fig. 14 - B). Spring crop production prognosis is made during grain-fill period in August 10. For example, 2002 spring and first half of summer season were anomalous cold and humid in Northern Kazakhstan. The extra moisture has provoked amicable growth of weeds, which had essential influence to crops states and grain production respectively. Thus, in 2002 weed infestation had the greatest unfavorable influence to crops condition and caused essential decrease of their productivity, despite of good water providing. With taking into account of these agricultural and meteorological features cereal productivity prognosis was developed on the base of RS data. For this purpose (1) the analysis of stable snow cover melt process was attracted and the stock of soil productive moisture was evaluated in sowing time; (2) cloudy cover monitoring was conducted and the evaluation of probability precipitation zones was done during vegetation period; (3) the thermal satellite channels allowed observing the temperature condition. The total yield forecast for spring wheat was done with consideration of all factors and weed infestation level estimation. Three classes of weed infestation parameters that reduced yields were determined as 1.0; 0.67; 0.42, accordingly. The predicted total harvest volume was within 7 percent of reported one. The outcome had been represented to the customer as a map with prognosis of crop fields productivity for Northern Kazakhstan in scale 1:1000000 (Fig. 15). There was also estimated 40% loss in spring wheat crop production due to weed infestation. SRI has also a physiological model of crops growth called WOFOST adapted to conditions of Kazakhstan. The model simulates growth of concrete culture in specific soil and meteorological conditions.

        "104 DEVELOPING ON-LINE NEAR-REAL TIME DROUGHT MONITORING SYSTEM FOR SOUTH WEST ASIA Smakhtin, V.U., Thenkabail, P., Gamage, N. International Water Management Institute, Sri Lanka Introduction Droughts are recurring climatic events, which often hit South Asia, bringing significant adverse economic and social consequences. The latest drought in South Asia (2000-2003) affected more than 100 million people, with severe impacts felt in Gujurat and Rajastan states in western India, in Pakistan\u2019s Sind and Baluchistan provinces, as well in parts of Iran and Afghanistan. Political instability, war and economic isolation have further exacerbated the effects of drought. In the last 20 years, increasing population has added to the growing demand for water and other natural resources in South Asia. The need for accurate quantification of drought impacts and monitoring of drought onset, progression and spatial extent is of critical importance in politically, economically and environmentally sensitive countries in the region. Traditional methods of drought assessment and monitoring rely on rainfall data, which are limited in South Asia, often inaccurate and, most importantly, difficult to obtain in near-real time. In contrast, the satellite sensor data are consistently available and can be used to detect onset of drought, its duration, and magnitude (e.g. Thiruvengadachari and Gopalkrishna, 1993; Kogan, 1997). Even crop yields can be predicted 5 to 13 weeks prior to harvest using remote sensing techniques (Ungani and Kogan, 1998). Vegetation condition over the world is reported occasionally by NOAA National Environmental Satellite Data and Information System (NESDIS) using the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data (Kogan, 2000). But the characteristic spatial resolution of the AVHRR data (10 X 10 km) is coarse for effective drought monitoring at small scales, such as a district or a village. A recent successor to AVHRR is the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS), an advanced narrow-band-width sensor, from which composited reflectance data are made freely available every 8 days by NASA and USGS, through the Earth Resources Observation Systems (EROS) data centre (Justice and Townshend, 2002a). Time series of MODIS imagery provide near-real-time, continuous and, relatively high resolution data (0.5 X 0.5 km), on which the assessment of drought development and severity in regions with scarce and inaccurate on-the-ground meteorological observations (like southwest Asia) could be based. Other data which could be used for the same purpose include data from Indian satellite sensor (Kumar and Panu, 1997; Johnson et al. 1993), data from sensors on SPOT satellite, etc. However, neither is available as simply in near-real time as MODIS. At present, there is no efficient system in the region, to analyze and deliver drought-related information to the stakeholders on the ground, or to share this information between countries, which do, however, share a common problem \u2013 drought. Therefore, this study sets to develop a prototype on-line drought monitoring system based on complementary features of the above remote sensing data types. Such system should allow drought development in the region to be monitored at different scales over the entire study area, through to country level and further to the level of individual states, provinces, and smaller administrative subdivisions within those. Geographically, this study covers Afghanistan, Pakistan and western parts of India (Fig. 1). These regions/countries are known to be drought prone. Also, it was envisaged that the results of socio-economic studies conducted in this region by various government agencies and ",
        "105 NGOs to assess the impacts of the latest, drought may be utilized in the future to assess the performance of the drought monitoring system under development. At the same time, the principles of the system should be generic and replicable in a larger geographical area (e.g. covering the entire South Asia from Iran to Bangladesh and from Nepal to Sri Lanka) or in different parts of the world. Fig. 1. The topographic map of south west Asia, showing the study area (circled), country boundaries and the boundaries of smaller administrative subdivisions. Data and Methods Data acquisition and pre-processing AVHRR. Both AVHRR and its successor MODIS, carried on board of NOAA and Terra- Aqua series atellites respectively, are cost effective sensors, which cover the globe at least once a day. The AVHRR sensor (Kidwell, 1991) collects radiance data in five spectral bands including red visible (0.58\u20130.6 \u00b5m), near-infrared (0.725\u20131.1 \u00b5m), mid-infrared (3.55\u20133.93 \u00b5m) and two thermal infrared bands (10.3\u201311.3 \u00b5m and 11.5\u201312.5 \u00b5m). Only four bands, together with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI, described in the next sub- section), are useful for this study (Table 1) due to unresolved calibration issues with the mid- infrared band (Smith et al. 1997). The well calibrated, long time-series AVHRR radiance data have the spatial resolution of 0.1 o (pixels of approximately 10 X 10 km) and are available with a monthly step resolution for a period from 1982 to 2001. These radiance data were pre- processed by NASA Goddard Space Flight Centre (GSFC) and are available at their web site www.daac.gsfc.gov/data/dataset/AVHRR for free downloading. Pre-processing includes the derivation of maximum value composite (MVC) monthly images from original daily radiance data. The procedure of deriving monthly MVCs includes the examination of daily radiance values for each waveband, together with NDVI values \u2013 for each month for each pixel. The highest daily radiance/NDVI value in a month is identified and retained. This minimizes problems of cloud impacts typical of single-date remote sensing studies (Goward et al., 1994; Eidenshink and Faundeer, 1994). Data is further corrected for atmospheric attenuation (e.g. dust or haze - Cihlar et al. 1994), and distortions due to sun angle and satellite sensor view angle (Kogan and Zhu, 2001; Cracknell, 1997). The downloaded data need to be converted to Country State/Province District ",
        "106 percent reflectance to allow comparisons with percent reflectance measured from MODIS (Thenkabail et al, 2004). MODIS, a successor of AVHRR, is the primary sensor for monitoring terrestrial ecosystems in NASA Earth Observing System (EOS) program (Justice et al. 2002) and has several advances on AVHRR (Table 1; Huete et al. 2002). The MODIS sensor acquires data in 36 spectral bands, with variable spatial resolution of 250-1000 meters (depending on a band). The 36 MODIS bands could be utilized in atmospheric, land and ocean studies. Seven bands are considered optimal for land applications (Justice et al., 2002). Composite MODIS data have a temporal resolution of 8 days and are available from 2000 onwards. The 8-day, 7-band data are made freely available by USGS EROS data centre (http://edcdaac.usgs.gov), after corrections for molecular scattering, ozone absorption and aerosols. The data are also adjusted to nadir (sensor looking straight down) and standard sun angles, using bi-directional reflectance (BRDF) models (Vermote et al. 2002; Justice et al. 2002). The downloadable data are available as radiance, which needs to be divided by 100 to obtain reflectance in percent. In summary, there are a few features that make the use of MODIS data attractive for drought monitoring. First, the MODIS data are free. Second, the most recent MODIS data are available within 8 days (in near-real-time). Third, MODIS Internet data sources have excellent search and browse facilities. Fourth, MODIS products undergo numerous calibrations, pre-processing and normalizations (e.g., atmospheric correction) and the data are available as processed products (e.g., reflectance). These capabilities facilitate multi-date comparisons. MODIS data continuity from Terra and Aqua satellites is guaranteed over time with successor satellite and sensor systems already planned and assured at least until 2018, with National Polar-Orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) series of satellites (Justice and Townshend, 2002b). Finally, MODIS has 36 spectral bands, of which 7 are considered optimal for land studies (Vermote et al., 2002). Table 1 Remote sensing data, indices and thresholds relevant to drought monitoring Indices for drought monitoring Drought monitoring indices derived from AVHRR or MODIS data (Table 1) are radiometric measures of vegetation condition. They utilize reflectance data in two or more spectral bands, thus enhancing the vegetation signal and reflecting the differences in vegetation type, growth stage, canopy cover and structure.

        "107 Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). NDVI was first suggested by Tucker (1979): NDVI = ( \u03bb NIR \u2013 \u03bb red ) / ( \u03bb NIR + \u03bb red ) (1) where \u03bb NIR and \u03bb red are the reflectance in the near infrared (NIR) and red bands respectively (Table 1). The NDVI is the most commonly used vegetation index and varies in a range of -1 to + 1. However, NDVI: (a) uses only two bands and is not very sensitive to influences of soil background reflectance at low vegetation cover, and (b) lags behind antecedent precipitation (and therefore, drought conditions) by up to 3 months (Reed, 1993; Farrar et al., 1994; Rundquist and Harrington, 2000; Wang et al., 2001). The latter is because of a lagged vegetation response to developing rainfall deficits due to residual moisture stored in the soil. The lag time is dependent on whether the region is purely rainfed, fully irrigated, or partially irrigated. The greater the dependence on rainfall, the shorter is the lag time. NDVI itself does not reflect drought or non-drought conditions. However, the severity of a drought (or the extent of wetness \u2013 on the other end of the spectrum) may be defined as NDVI deviation from its long-term mean (DEV NDVI ). This deviation is calculated as the difference between the NDVI for the current time step (e.g., January 1995) and a long-term mean NDVI for that month (e.g., a 18-year long mean NDVI of all Januaries from 1982 to 1999) for each pixel: DEV NDVI = NDVI i - NDVI mean,m (2) where NDVI i is the NDVI value for month i and NDVI mean,m is the long-term mean NDVI for the same month m (e.g. in a data record from 1982 to 1999, there are eighteen monthly NDVI values for the same month (e.g. eighteen Aprils), and twelve long-term NDVI means (one for each calendar month). When DEV NDVI is negative, it indicates the below-normal vegetation condition/health and therefore suggests a prevailing drought situation. The greater the negative departure, the greater is the magnitude of a drought. In general, the departure from the long-term mean NDVI is effectively more than just a drought indicator, as it would reflect the conditions of healthy vegetation in normal and wet months/years. Vegetation condition index (VCI). VCI was first suggested by Kogan (1995, 1997). It shows how close the NDVI of the current month is to the minimum NDVI calculated from the long- term record. (NDVI J \u2013 NDVI min ) VCI J = ------------------------------- *100 (3) (NDVI max \u2013 NDVI min ) where NDVImax and NDVImin are calculated from the long-term record (e.g., 18 years) for that month (or week) and j is the index of the current month (week). NDVI values are calculated using (1) above. The condition/health of the ground vegetation presented by VCI is measured in percent. VCI values around 50% reflect fair vegetation conditions. The VCI values between 50 to 100 % indicate optimal or above-normal conditions. At the VCI value of 100% the NDVI value for this month (or week) is equal to NDVImax. Different degrees of a drought severity are indicated by VCI values below 50%. Kogan (1995) illustrated that the VCI threshold of 35% may be used to identify extreme drought conditions and suggested that ",
        "108 further research is necessary to categorize the VCI by its severity in the range between 0 and 35%. The VCI value close to 0% reflects an extremely dry month, when NDVI value is close to its long-term minimum. Establishing and validating inter-sensor relationships MODIS and AVHRR data have different optical characteristics. They also differ in pre- processing methods (e.g., atmospheric correction) as well as spatial and temporal resolution (Table 1). To ensure continuous flow of data for drought assessment, inter-sensor relationships are needed. During years 2000 and 2001, there are 19 months (from February 2000 to August 2001) of concurrent data for both AVHRR and MODIS sensors. This offers the opportunity to establish the relationships between the two data sets (e.g. using NDVI AVHRR and NDVI MODIS ). To make both data sets comparable in time, the four 8-day MODIS NDVI images were composed into 32-day NDVI images through a maximum value compositing (MVC) procedure. Then the NDVI AVHRR and NDVI MODIS were calculated for the randomly selected large number of administrative units during the 19-months long concurrent period. Even for the concurrent period, the NDVI MODIS will not be exactly the same as NDVI AVHRR due to different sensor characteristics. For example, the narrower MODIS spectral bands eliminate the water absorption region in the near infra-red part of the spectrum and also render the red band more sensitive to chlorophyll absorption (e.g. Huete et al., 2002). Atmospherically corrected NDVI MODIS generally exhibits a higher dynamic range than atmospherically corrected NDVI AVHRR. This is attributed to the narrow band width of MODIS (Huete et al., 2002), which result in a greater dynamic range of NDVI for the same given biomass. The NDVI AVHRR is therefore likely to \u201csaturate\u201d faster in the study of vegetation biomass than NDVI MODIS , saturation being the loss of sensitivity of a sensor after full canopy cover is achieved. The study established regression models for two NDVI types for each month (as well as for the pooled data of all 19 months) for all terrestrial biomes in the study area (Thenkabail et al., 2004). The established regression relationship between 0.5 km NDVI MODIS and re-sampled 0.5 km NDVI AVHRR at regional scale is NDVI MODIS = 1.0256 * NDVI AVHRR + 0.1151 (4) R 2 = 0.78 Similar relationships were also developed for all 12 calendar months of the year (Thenkabail et al, 2004). The monthly models explain up to 95 % variability in data of two sensors. These models are critical in linking the data from two sensors and facilitating continuous monitoring of vegetation conditions in a drought context. The limited period of concurrent MODIS and AVHRR observations (19 months) does not offer full possibilities for validating these regression relationships. However, the validity of the regression equations could be illustrated using independent datasets \u2013 from outside of the main study area, encircled in Figure 1. NDVI MODIS values simulated using the established models are referred to as \u201csimulated NDVI MODIS \u201c, since they were derived from AVHRR. Figure 2 illustrates that there is a clear similarity between the observed and simulated NDVI values in an example district in India. Thenkabail et al (2004) illustrated (on the basis of 76 data points from 19 months in 4 districts outside the study area) that simulated NDVI MODIS explained 88 % variability relative to actual NDVI MODIS .

The left figure in each row shows the actual DEV NDVI MODIS coverage, while the right one \u2013 simulated DEV NDVI MODIS values. Overall, the comparison of each pair of images per month reveals clear similarities in the NDVI magnitude and spatial distribution. The level of similarity repeats itself for other months. Drought monitoring in near real time Principles of monitoring The important implication of the established relationships for emerging drought monitoring programs is the possibility to combine the estimates of maximum, minimum and long-term mean NDVI values derived from the AVHRR data with the actual MODIS data. MODIS data have so far only a \u201cshort life\u201d (2000-present) and the long-term estimates of two mentioned NDVI drought characteristics (DEV NDVI and VCI) at the MODIS level of spatial resolution are missing. The established regression equations may be used to estimate 0.5 km MODIS characteristics from the available AVHRR data. Therefore, the required minimum, maximum and long-term NDVI mean values may be estimated at the finer scale and consequently DEV NDVI and VCI estimates may be made available at this scale (0.5 km resolution) as well. As the NDVI MODIS data \u201cbuilds up\u201d with time, long-term NDVI characteristics can be determined directly from the MODIS data. The advantage may therefore be made of complimentary features of both types of data, where MODIS data form the basis, on which to develop a prototype for a near-real time drought monitoring system at the scale of a country, state, district or pixel with 8 or 16-day time interval. The extent of negative deviation of NDVI from its long term mean for a pixel of 0.5 X 0.5 km, as well as the values of VCI in a \u201cdry\u201d range (Table 1) are the two indicators of drought magnitude. The duration of either continuous negative deviations or low VCI values are the indicators of drought persistence. Individual pixels\u2019 values of DEV NDVI or VCI at any point in time can be averaged over a district, basin, state, province, country or region to give a spatially averaged value indicating how dry or wet this district, basin, etc is. ",
        "110 Drought identification: an example with historical drought An operational drought monitoring system should be capable of detecting emerging droughts in time and should ideally aim to positively impact the efficiency of existing drought policies and declaration procedures in countries of the region and beyond. The possibility of detecting droughts using the above principles can be illustrated by an example of the most recent drought of 2002 which severely hit Rajasthan and Gujarat states of India. The recent publication of the Department of Agriculture and Cooperation (2004) reviews the events which happened in each state during the drought of 2002. In the end of July 2002, on the basis of ground observations on rainfall and crops\u2019 conditions, the Government of Rajasthan declared that drought hit all 27 districts of the State. Similarly, in the middle of October 2002, the Government of Gujarat declared that 14 out of 20 districts of the State were drought hit. Figure 3 Spatial distribution of actual and simulated values of DEV NDVI for Afghanistan for three arbitrarily selected months of the year 2000. Images showing actual DEV NDVI values are in the left column and images showing corresponding simulated values are on the right. The authors of this paper have analyzed MODIS images for several successive months from the beginning of 2002 in order to establish how many districts could have been identified as drought-hit using remote sensing information exclusively. For this, the DEV NDVI and VCI values of all 0.5 X 0.5 km pixels in each district of Rajasthan and Gujarat were averaged for the latest MODIS image in each month. Thus, one monthly value of DEV NDVI and one ",
        "111 monthly value of VCI per district were calculated. The next step was to calculate the number of districts in each state per each month, where monthly indices were below the drought thresholds. For the DEV NDVI the threshold was 0.0 and for VCI two thresholds were used \u2013 50% and 35% (Table 1). The first VCI threshold is normally perceived as the one below which the vegetation starts to loose its vigor, which is the first indication of an emerging drought. The second VCI threshold may be perceived as the beginning of a severe drought (Kogan, 1995). Figure 4 Spatial distribution of the VCI values over Rajasthan State, India, during the drought of 2002. In Gujarat, in the month of drought declaration (October 2002), the number districts which had their averaged indices\u2019 values below the selected thresholds (VCI 50 , VCI 35 and DEV NDVI ) were 14, 10 and 17 respectively. In the previous month of September 2002, the numbers for ",
        "112 the same were 6, 1 and 9, indicating that the State is moving into a drought already (although only one district was found to be under severe drought conditions). In Rajasthan, in the month of drought declaration (July 2002), the number of districts which had their averaged indices\u2019 values below the selected thresholds (VCI 50 , VCI 35 and DEV NDVI ) were 21, 18 and 18 respectively. But in the previous months of May and June, the number of districts with index values below any of the three thresholds was always at least 16 with May showing all 27 districts as drought hit in terms of all thresholds. Figure 4 illustrates the distribution of the VCI values over Rajasthan (the district boundaries are shown in black) from May to October. The low VCI values dominate over the state since May 2002 and become extremely low by October. Such assessment is rather crude due to averaging of pixel values by district. Also, no distinction was made between rainfed and irrigated areas. However, the example shows that monitoring principles outlines above would effectively allow drought onset to be predicted up to two months in advance of the actual historical declaration dates in both states. This could have certainly ensured anti-drought actions to be taken in advance. The same principles are applicable to monitoring future emerging droughts in different parts of the region and feed directly into the development of an on-line regional drought monitoring system (DMS) for south-west Asia. Main features of the on-line drought monitoring system The prototype DMS is setup on the Internet (http://dms.iwmi.org; Figure 5) and includes the facilities to explore NDVI and drought related indices (DEV NDVI and VCI) at different scales \u2013 from pixel to a region. The indices are used to continuously examine the condition of the ground vegetation and to define (following the above mentioned principles) whether a pixel, a district or a region is in a drought condition or not. At present, the user of the DMS can: \u2022 Explore the spatial condition of ground vegetation throughout the entire south-west region, at the level of specific district in respective countries and at the level of specific pixel of 0.5 by 0.5 km. The default spatial image shows the distribution of NDVI over a district, sub-district administrative boundaries if any exist and some landmarks including rivers/canals, roads and or settlements. A similar approach is followed for other indices (Figure 6). The new remote sensing images are uploaded every 16 days. The list of exact dates of data uploading may be accessed through the front page of the DMS web site (Figure 5). \u2022 Create the on-line time\u2013series graphs of drought-related vegetation characteristics and study the deviation of those from the long-term mean for a district or pixel. The graphs can be built for a time period selected by the user and allow the developing deficits of vegetation density and vigour to be detected and quantified on line. (Figure 6). Once the district is selected on the front page of the DMS, the default time series graph appears which shows the long-term average NDVI and the current NDVI time series. The start of the plotting period can be interactively selected at this point and the time series graph \u2013 re-plotted. Similarly, other indices can be examined at this stage by clicking the appropriate link on the screen and accessing the on-line database. By clicking on any point on the district image on the left-hand window (Figure 6) a specific pixel of 0.5 by 0.5 km is selected and its coordinates are displayed. Clicking \u201crefresh\u201d button on the right-hand window will re-draw the time series graph of the corresponding index for this specific pixel . ",
        "113 \u2022 Download images of vegetation indices for selected districts / provinces (in Afghanistan) for inclusion in various reports or presentations. These images may be previewed before downloading (Figure 7). Downloading of the actual data behind the images - for other types of more detailed analysis off-line will also be possible in the near future. Both images of the entire study area and images of a specific district for any of the three indices (NDVI, DEVNDVI and VCI) for any or all dates during the last 20 months could be downloaded. \u2022 Learn about the use of remote sensing data for drought monitoring \u2022 Link to other drought monitoring web sites \u2022 Explore Help facilities, provided on-line System maintenance The common steps involved in the maintenance of the system include: \u2022 Routine downloads of MODIS 500-m land surface reflectance data from USGS data gateway every 8 or 16 days. The data are downloaded in \u201ctiles\u201d, six tiles covering the entire study area. Downloading the data from six tiles takes about 5 hours at a speed of 45 kb/s. The downloaded data for one date for the entire study area occupies approximately 1 Gb of disk space. If a similar system is to be reproduced for a specific country in the region, the time and space requirements could be reduced. \u2022 Processing of the downloaded data using commercially available ERDAS software package. All raw downloaded data are imported into ERDAS and re-projected into geographic latitude and longitude coordinates, using facilities provided by ERDAS. \u2022 Combining the re-projected data of all six tiles into one file covering the entire study area (the procedure known as \u201cmosaicing\u201d). This is followed by the calculation of NDVI values for each pixel and each district in the study area, using Eq (1). The \u201cNDVI file\u201d is stored as part of the array of similarly processed images for previous dates. These pre-processed data form the time series of images, which are then used for continuous drought monitoring. \u2022 Eqs (2) and (3) are used to calculate current VCI and DEV NDVI for each pixel from NDVI data. Long-term means, maxima and minima, required to calculate these indices for each pixel are obtained using Eq (4) or a set of similar relationships between NDVI MODIS and NDVI AVHRR listed in Thenkabail et al (2004). He values of current drought-related vegetation indices are averaged for all pixels over each district in the study area. There are currently 104 districts in the study area for which this operation is performed. Therefore, monitoring in the current system setup is effectively performed at two levels of spatial resolution \u2013 pixel and district. Sub-district administrative division (e.g. talukas, tehsils ) can be incorporated into the system as well. \u2022 Uploading the images of NDVI, DEV NDVI and VCI for the latest date for each of the 104 districts in the study area. These images (.jpg files) serve as gateways to the actual pixel-level data in an on-line database. (Creating these images is a relatively time consuming exercise and a new, more effective on-line interface to the actual data is currently being designed) \u2022 Uploading the actual NDVI, DEV NDVI and VCI data for the latest date for each of the 104 districts in the study area. Due to the limitations related to the storage of actual data for the region, the system currently holds only the latest 20 months of data on- ",

Conclusions and way forward This paper suggested a methodology for continuous drought monitoring by linking two different remote sensing data sets. The methodology was tested for a study area in southwest Asia, which includes Afghanistan, Pakistan and two states in western India (Gujarat and Rajasthan). Indices used for drought monitoring are based on Red and Near Infrared thermal channels out of the available 7 (in MODIS). The alternative channels, however, suggest a possibility to explore and possibly develop more effective indices, which could be better indicators of drought conditions. This could be a challenging direction for the future research. The study established and validated methods and techniques of drought assessment across two different generations of remote sensing data. It therefore created options for enhancement of existing free remote sensing data. The best option incorporates the long-term NDVI characteristics calculated from AVHRR into MODIS at the resolution of 0.5 km. This option is particularly attractive for the future drought monitoring, as it will have all the advantages of the better MODIS technology. The availability of MODIS data is guaranteed at least till 2018, with continuity missions planned with its successor NPOESS. Therefore, the AVHRR- MODIS-NPOESS data sets may effectively form one continuous data stream from 1982 to 2018, and possibly beyond. This would make it the single largest source of spatial data available for the south Asia region (and for the entire globe). Figure 5 The front page of the DMS web site. ",

        "116 The study has developed and made accessible on-line a prototype of a regional drought monitoring system. Considering the spread and frequency of droughts in the region on one hand, and the lack of ground climate observations and technical capacity in the countries of the region to deal with droughts \u2013 on the other, such a system could play an invaluable role for drought preparedness. It is envisaged that the system will emerge with time into a valuable addition to decision support tools for drought management in the region. The system needs to be developed and tested further to cater for specific requirement and conditions of individual countries. This calls for collaborative action in the region and for input from responsible national agencies. The principles on which the system is based are generic and can be reproduced outside the study region as well. Two issues are important for the future development of this system and its integration into a drought early warning system(s) either at a national or regional scale. The first is that drought monitoring based on remote sensing data, needs to be modified and enhanced in many ways. The second is that drought monitoring represents just one component of a drought early warning system, which needs to be established in every country of the region. It is necessary to: \u2022 extensively test the monitoring system against the ground data on rainfall, plant/ crop characteristics (e.g. density), yield anomalies etc. A more detailed evaluation of the remote sensing data in different parts of the region is certainly necessary before predictions based on such data can be used reliably in drought mitigation. \u2022 develop more reliable categories/thresholds of numerical values of remote sensing indices used \u2013 for quantification of drought severity. For example, the use of VCI in drought studies is relatively new and has large potential. But the categorization of the VCI severity values below 50% should also be carried out and more scientifically justified \u2022 monitor other climatic variables like rainfall, river flow reservoir storage and groundwater in support of remote sensing information \u2022 based on all above variables and their categorization / thresholds and in cooperation with responsible national agencies in the region - formulate drought warning messages of varying degree (e.g. drought watch, drought warning, drought emergency, etc) \u2022 ensure that drought reports and warnings reach the target groups and relevant agencies \u2022 ensure that drought warning systems are institutionalized in each country, that relevant supporting policies exist and that appropriate responses are developed by each agency concerned for each level of drought severity Many of these issues are of technical nature, others are clearly policy-related. The goal of further development would be to increase the accuracy of drought prediction in south Asia in terms of time and space (e.g. to ensure that droughts can be predicted a month in advance in any corner of the region and be delineated more accurately). To achieve this, it is necessary to link remote sensing data with medium-term weather forecasting and to increase the accuracy of these forecasts. Both can be achieved through increased support for research in these fields. If the drought impacts on crop production can be diagnosed long before harvest, this could be the vital step for regional food security and trade. The information generated by the monitoring system should eventually be available on the weather TV channels in the countries of the region. Developing reliable drought warning systems should be considered one of the primary goals of future anti-drought work, which calls for regional cooperation. ",

        "119 AGROMETEOROLOGY IN KYRGYZ REPUBLIC Marina Faleyeva Kyrgyz-Hydromet Service, Kyrgyzstan Geographic location The Kyrgyz Republic is a small, predominantly mountainous country situated in the Eastern part of Central Asia. It shares borders with Kazakhstan in the North, China in the East, Uzbekistan in the West and Tajikistan in the South. The state borders are located mainly on natural boundaries \u2013 along the edges of the high mountains and the rivers. The territory has an East-West extend of 900 km. The Kyrgyz Republic has a surface of 198.5 km 2 . You can see on Figure 1 that the main part of mountain ridges have a latitudinal extend grouping in three chains divided by intermountain valleys: the northern chain, the middle chain, and the southern chain. Fig.1. Physiography of Kyrgyz Republic. The northern chain is called Kungey Ala-Too, Kyrgyz Ala-Too and Talas Ala-Too. The mean hight of the ridges is about 3.3-3.7 km with top elevations from 4.5 to 5.17 km. The southern chain is called Kok Shaal-Too, Borkoldoy-Too, Naryn-Too and Atbashy ridges. The mean height of the ridges is about 3.1-4.4 km with top elevations from 4.05 to 7.44 km. All of these chains meet in the east where they form The Meridional ridge. It is the highest part of the Tyan-Shan with peaks of Pobeda (7439 m) and Khan-Tengry (6995 m). About 90% of territory lies 1000 m above sea level. The irrigated lands comprise 72 % of the republics territory. ",
        "120 Kyrgyz Republic consists of 6 regions (oblasts). These administrative regions are called Chuy, Talas, Osh, Jalal-Abad, Batken, Naryn and Issyk-Kul oblasts (fig.2). Fig.2. Administrative map of Kyrgyzstan Climate conditions The climate of Kyrgyz Republic is continental, arid, is characterized by a long sunshine duration, a high-altitude zoning and a great diversity of the landscape. The countries climate varies due to its high relief contrast. Its continentality and aridity is due to the southern location of the country, its remoteness form oceans and its vicinity to large deserts. A great variability and contrast of climate conditions especially are noticed on seasonality and on fluctuations of temperature in local microclimates. Summer (up to 2000-2500 m) is hot and dry everywhere especially in Fergan, Chuy and Talas valleys. Winter is quite cold especially in mountains and intermountain hollows. Sun time duration is long and there is little cloudiness. The moistest area of the republic are the western sites of the mountains of the Fergan ridge (up to 1500-2000 mm per year), whereas the driest place is situated near Balychy city on Issyk-Kul lake (about 115 mm per year). The main feature of the mountainous climate of Kyrgyz Republic is its height zoning caused by simultaneous change of temperature and precipitations regimes. However this phenomena shows up differently in different climatic areas. It is possible to undertake the following height zoning: ",
        "121 1. The valley-foothills semi-desert area with an altitude of 750 to 1500 m characterized by an arid continental climate as it can be found in the southern area of the temperate zone; 2. The medium mountainous area with an altitude of 1200-1500 to 2700-3000 m with temperate continental climate; 3. The high mountainous sub Alpine \u2013 Alpine area with an altitude of 2700-3000 m to 3500-3700 m with a continental cold climate; 4. Glaciological area with an altitude of more than 3400-3600 m with a very extreme climate similar to arctic. There is the Issyk-Kul lake located in the north-east of the republic. The lake was formed by tectonic activities. Because of the orographical insularity the climate of Issyk-Kul area is very specific and almost maritime. It is milder, warmer and moister than in other valleys of Tyan- Shan having the same altitude. Issyk-Kul is subtropical lake by its thermal regime. Here is moderately warm in summer and not cold in the winter on the shore. The hydrological conditions of Kyrgyz Republic are of a complex nature. Kyrgyzstan has considerable water resources. The average annual of rivers run-off is 49 km 3 . Kyrgyzstan has 1960 rivers with a length of more than 10 km. The total number of mountain and high- mountain lakes is 3,000. 700 km 3 of water is stored in the form of ice in the glaciers. The main hydrological feature of Kyrgyz Republic is its rivers run-off system. There is no river which enters from the outside borders of the country. The Kyrgyzstan\u2019s rivers flow down the mountains in all directions: to the north, south, west and east and end outside of Kyrgyzstan or flow into the large internal-drainage reservoirs Issyk-Kul and the Chatyr-Kul lakes. The biggest river of Kyrgyz Republic is Naryn. The Naryn\u2019s river is 534 km long. In northern Kyrgystan the period with a temperature of 10 degrees above zero lasts from 160 to 190 days. The sums of active temperature accumulate to 3,000 degrees for this time period. This period is 190-212 days long in the south with temperature sum of about 4,000 degrees. Research on climate change was undertaken for the orographic mountainous territory of Kyrgyzstan. A higher increase of average annual temperature for Kyrgyzstan was recorded when compared with the overall global increase of 1.6 degrees centigrade. The measured increase in temperature was in the range of 0.6 to 2.4 degrees centigrade. The annual precipitation sum hardly changed on average (an increase of 23 mm or 6%). Nevertheless an increasing of sum precipitation of 1-2 to 20-30% in all the climatic areas of the Kyrgyz Republic were recorded except for the Inner Tyan-Shan. In this area the sum precipitation decreased by 41-47%. A global change prediction was made for the year 2100 using global climatic models. These models predict an average annual temperature increase of 2,5...3,0 centigrade and an annual increase of precipitation sums of 10-15% compared with the norm of 1961-1990. However, the predicted changes of temperature and rainfall will be heterogeneous. and the models predict that precipitation sums will decrease greatly in the Inner Tyan-Shan. Furthermore the models predict and the snow line on higher altitudes and a decrease of the Owing to it the height of snow line will increase and in future the glaciation will diminished. The agro-meteorological observations are made by the main hydro-meteorological administration of the Ministry of ecology and emergency of the Kyrgyz republic on 30 meteo- stations and 10 agro-posts. The network of agro-meteorological stations and posts of Kyrgyzhydromet is shown in figure 3. ",

        "126 AN INTRODUCTION TO WHEAT YIELD FORECASTING IN IRAN Mohammad Akhavan Ghalibaf Yazd University, Yazd, Iran. Introduction Wheat (Triticum L.) is the most important crop in Iran with respect to its cultivated area and to its overall production . Iran located between 25 and 40 degrees north latitudes and between 44 and 63 east longitudes. Iran has an area of about 165mil hectares. The total cultivated areas in Iran are 19million hectares, from which 11.9mil hectares are not cultivated yearly. About 55% of cultivated areas in Iran are rain fed and 45% are irrigated (table 1) (Khodabandah, 2002). Table 1. The global land uses in Iran Land use type Area(mil. hectare) Cultivate Lands 19 Range Lands 106 Shrubs and Woodlands 19 Mountains, Deserts, Rural and Urban 21 Total 165 Why is crop (wheat) yield forecasting importance for Iran? The following points answer this question: \u2022 Essential food for people is wheat bread. \u2022 Because of political aspects, governments subsidize wheat bread, therefore wheat bread can be sold below the \u2018real\u2019 price. \u2022 Wheat is a strategic crop for Iran. \u2022 Deficit of wheat must be imported by the trading ministry and the quantity of the import needed must be forecasted. \u2022 Deficit of wheat yield is as a drought index for every province and is important in order to determine the subsidies the government gives to a province. Morphological and climatological characteristics of Iran Iran is located in the desert agro climatologic zone. However, due to its character of relief, it has different climates in its different parts (graphic 1). Most regions of Iran can be defined as following: \u2022 Iran is a mountainous country \u2022 With arid lands \u2022 With pale desert to brown semi desert soils (Aridisols) in plains and piedmonts and Litosols (Lithic Torri Orthents) in mountains (with exclusion of some limited parts in North, Northeast, West, and South \u2013West with kastanozem and kastanozem like soils, and brown and brown like soils. \u2022 Annual means of precipitations in Iran differ from about 65 mm in Central Iran to above 1000 mm in North and North West. \u2022 Iran has vertical agro climatologic characteristics with a change of the climate zone related to height from sea level (fig. 1-4). ",

        "128 Fig.4. Remained ice and snow in summer on the mountainous high lands in central Iran Limitations for crop growth in Iran The main limitations for crop growth in Iran are the following: \u2022 Water balance deficient for non-irrigated cultivations dry land and semidry land farming); \u2022 Natural disasters like as storms, flooding, landslides, mudflows, \u2026and so plant diseases and insects; \u2022 Late or soon freezing (for tree yields); \u2022 Exceeded temperature or sun radiation in arid lands. In extra Arid zones of Central Iran agro-ecological farming is possible in the limited valleys with north aspects (Fig.5). However, the lands with high cultivation potential are prone to disasters such as flooding due to the seasonal dynamics of the rivers. Relatively little land area has a potential for cultivation (fig.6) in the most parts of Central Iran. Fig.5. A colour composite (7-4-1) in Central Iran (villages shown in green). ",
