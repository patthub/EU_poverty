        "Regional data \u2013 an overview Regional and Urban Statistics Reference Guide 2010 1 1 I. REGIONAL DATA \u2014 AN OVERVIEW Eurostat\u2019s regional statistics cover the principal aspects of the economic and social life of the European Union, including demography, economic accounts and labour market data. The concepts and definitions used are as close as possible to those used by Eurostat for statistics at national level. Part I of this Guide describes the territorial classification (NUTS), answers frequently asked questions, gives an overview of the publications and websites related to regional and urban statistics and provides details of contact persons for further information. In Part II, the contents of the Eurostat database of regional statistics (REGIO) are described comprehensively. All in all, there are currently more than 150 tables in REGIO; 1 an alphabetical overview of all the tables can be found in the annex. Urban statistics are dealt with in Chapter 4 of Part I, and the tables of indicators and variables for various spatial levels of over 300 cities are described in detail in Part III of this Reference Guide. A full range of data for measuring the quality of life in European cities was collected in 2003/2004 (for reference year 2001) and in 2006/2007 (for reference year 2004) in the context of the \u201cUrban Audit\u201d, and the data can be accessed in Eurostat\u2019s free dissemination database. The next similar data collection has started beginning of 2010. - - - For any feedback, methodology question or suggestion for improving this Reference Guide, please send an e-mail to: berthold.feldmann@ec.europa.eu. 1) The regional data can be directly accessed under http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/statistics/search_database .

The history The history The history The history of regional and urban statistics of regional and urban statistics of regional and urban statistics of regional and urban statistics As regional policies of the European Communities have a long history, also the regional statistics that support these policies exist since a long time. Already the founding document, the Treaty of Rome of 1957 , established in its Article 2 as a mission to promote the harmonious development of economic activities throughout the Community. The accompanying instruments put in place asked for a better development of less favoured regions \u2026, which had to be identified with the aid of regional statistics. But it was with the first enlargement with Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom in 1973 that the regional dimension of Community action was growing significantly. It saw the creation of the European Development Fund , which was in charge of intervening in regions lagging behind (Mezzogiorno of Italy) and in declining industrial regions (on request of the new Member State United Kingdom), supporting the financing of infrastructure and productive investment. All these intervention had to be backed up by statistics. In 1986, the Single Act established an ambitious goal for the Community: \" to create, before the first January 1993, a market which will remove barriers to the free movement of persons, goods, services and capital. A number of accompanying policies are needed to facilitate the implementation of the 'big market'. One of the most important of them is targeted to the reduction of the gap between various regions of the Community and to help the least prosperous regions with the aid of so called 'Structural Funds' \". Moreover, the Lisbon Treaty , in its article 3, makes territorial cohesion an explicit Objective for the future of Cohesion Policy. The current crisis with its asymmetric territorial impacts has increased the importance of territorial cohesion within the EU, and the discussion about the concept has gained momentum. In October 2008, the European Commission adopted a Green Paper on \u201cTerritorial Cohesion\u201d. These developments strengthened the role of Regional Statistics in Eurostat. Until 1999, most regional statistics were collected by the Eurostat unit responsible for regional statistics, i.e. the predecessors of unit E4. That meant that the whole data flow from sending out a data request to the Member States until the dissemination of regional data in a Regional Yearbook that contained hundreds of tables was concentrated in one unit. In 2000, Eurostat decided that regional data to be collected by the thematic domains, which have close contacts to their thematic colleagues in the National Statistical Institutes. The proximity to national data also facilitated the data validation. While data collection was initially nearly always based on a gentleman\u2019s agreement, several thematic units created a legal base for important regional data collections. Until 2004, Regional Accounts, which may be considered the corner stone of regional statistics (by generating among others regional GDP statistics), was allocated to unit E4. Since then it is under the umbrella of National Accounts. ",
        "Regional data \u2013 an overview Regional and Urban Statistics Reference Guide 2010 3 1 Since the turn of the century, urban statistics , i.e. a data collection below the NUTS levels, has grown in importance for Cohesion Policy and started to supplement regional statistics. Its data collection is concentrated in unit E4. In some areas regional statistics also play a significant role in specific policy topics, such as rural development. These topics require the coordination and analysis of a subset of indicators for certain types of regions. 2. 2. 2. 2. Regional breakdown Regional breakdown Regional breakdown Regional breakdown 2 22 2.1. .1. .1. .1. What is a region? What is a region? What is a region? What is a region? A \u201cregion\u201d is defined as a tract of land with more or less definitely marked boundaries, which often serves as an administrative unit below the level of the nation state. Regions have an identity which is made up of specific features such as their landscape (mountains, coast, forest, etc.), climate (arid or high-rainfall), language (e.g. in Belgium, Finland and Spain), ethnic origin (e.g. Wales, northern Sweden and Finland or the Basque country) or shared history . Most, if not all, of the above features may be particularly noticeable in one location but are usually to be found to some degree over such a wide area that they cannot be used in themselves to mark off one region from another; in other words, the boundaries are \u201cfuzzy\u201d. If they are to be used for any administrative (or indeed statistical) purpose, however, regions need to be given a clear-cut shape. The limits of a region are usually based on one of the following: a) natural boundaries Rivers, mountains, sea or lake coasts and sparsely populated areas, such as extensive woodlands or marshes. All of these are physical barriers that divide two groups of people and thus prevent them forming a larger unit. Often in the past, these natural boundaries provided a convenient line along which to agree a frontier between competing local powers. In this way, they became b) historical boundaries Until relatively recent times, much of Europe was a patchwork of dukedoms, principalities, free cities, kingdoms, etc. In a number of cases, some of the scattered territories of the feudal age appear on modern maps as enclaves (Baarle Nassau, Llivia, Busingen, Ceuta, etc.). Whether these historical frontiers continue to be used as regional boundaries depends often on the degree to which old divisions of territory were retained when nation states were being formed. In northern Spain, for example, complex administrative boundaries reflect the scattered territories of the Kings of Aragon and Navarre. By contrast, France completely restructured its administrative units under Napoleon. During the unifications of Germany ",
        "Regional data \u2013 an overview Regional and Urban Statistics Reference Guide 2010 4 1 and Italy, many of the less powerful political units disappeared as recognisable regions, while the more powerful retained a function as regions within the new nation state. c) administrative boundaries The functions of government (including initially defence, taxation and justice) require power to be exercised by administrative units at a lower level than the nation state, either through \u201ctop-down\u201d devolution of responsibilities or through a federal structure. While sometimes these are \u201cnatural\u201d or \u201chistorical\u201d regions, they are often more or less arbitrary units. These communes, counties, provinces, etc. are subject to change, for example to reflect political or population trends. Other administrative boundaries often still reflected in modern regional structures are religious, such as parishes and bishoprics (among the oldest administrative boundaries), or established to meet the needs of democratic representation (e.g. wards and electorates). 2 22 2.2. .2. .2. .2. Regions as an administrative concept Regions as an administrative concept Regions as an administrative concept Regions as an administrative concept A region is an attempt to group together populations or places with enough in common to comprise a logical unit for administrative purposes. It is a recognition that spatial differences require appropriate administrative structures. In this context, \u201cadministrative structure\u201d means that an administrative authority has the power to take administrative, budgetary or policy decisions for the area within the legal and institutional framework of the country. Ideal requirements for a region Appropriate boundaries: \u2022 acceptability to the people administered; \u2022 homogeneity of the unit; \u2022 suitable size. Stable boundaries: \u2022 permit data collection over an extended time frame ( time series ); \u2022 more meaningful units ( people identify with them ). Local government reorganisation may disrupt this pattern until the new territorial arrangement, in turn, becomes accepted. Hierarchy of regions Traditionally, smaller regions have often been administered as part of larger regions which, in turn, make up the nation state. Note: this is not necessarily the same thing as a political hierarchy. Political power may be highly centralised in the national capital or may be devolved to individual regions. Examples of highly devolved regional powers (policymaking regional administrations): \u2022 Comunidades Auton\u00f3mas in Spain; \u2022 L\u00e4nder in Germany; \u2022 Gewesten in Belgium. ",
        "Regional data \u2013 an overview Regional and Urban Statistics Reference Guide 2010 5 1 2 22 2.3. .3. .3. .3. Two alternative concepts of regions for statistical purposes Two alternative concepts of regions for statistical purposes Two alternative concepts of regions for statistical purposes Two alternative concepts of regions for statistical purposes Two types of regional division are usually recognised: (cid:1) normative regions reflect political will; their boundaries are fixed in terms of the remit of local authorities and the size of the region\u2019s population regarded as corresponding to the economically optimum use of the resources they need to accomplish their tasks; historical factors may also be at the root of an agreement to maintain the autonomy of certain administrative divisions; (cid:1) analytical (or functional) regions are defined in terms of particular analytical requirements; they categorise areas on the basis of specific geographical criteria, such as altitude or soil type, or by economic and social criteria, such as the homogeneity, complementarity or polarisation of regional economies. From a statistical point of view, each of these two types of breakdown has strengths and weaknesses. Normative regions usually have a statutory existence in the administrative practice of the country concerned. They are clearly defined, usually universally recognised and relatively stable. They comprise the structure within which certain levels of government exercise their powers, particularly where regional policy is concerned. Normative or administrative regions are therefore generally adopted by the national statistical systems as the most appropriate units for data collection, processing and dissemination. The drawback of this approach is that the administrative and historical grounds for defining these regions differ widely from country to country. International comparability is therefore difficult to achieve, even in terms of area and population. In addition, borders of normative or administrative regions often cut functional links that are vital to understand socio- economic phenomena. Analytical or functional regions are, as their name suggests, very useful for economic analysis. There is a growing interest by users for these functional regions, in particular for so called Labour Market Areas (LMAs), defined as the employment catchment areas in a country. In many countries LMAs are already delineated and used for analytical purposes. Since several years Eurostat studies in detail if these national LMAs are sufficiently comparable and could be used in a European context. DG REGIO uses for its analysis approximations of LMAs with the aid of aggregations of NUTS 3 regions. 2 22 2.4. .4. .4. .4. The NUTS The NUTS The NUTS The NUTS classification classification classification classification At the beginning of the 1970s, Eurostat set up the \u201cNomenclature of Statistical Territorial Units\u201d ( NUTS ) as a single, coherent system for dividing up the European Union\u2019s territory in order to produce regional statistics for the Community. 2 For thirty years, implementation and updating of the NUTS classification was managed under a series of \u201cgentlemen\u2019s agreements\u201d between the Member States and Eurostat, sometimes after long and difficult negotiations. 2) For the latest status of NUTS, see the RAMON classifications server on the Eurostat Internet site http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/ramon/nuts/splash_regions.html. ",
        "Regional data \u2013 an overview Regional and Urban Statistics Reference Guide 2010 6 1 Work on a Regulation to give NUTS a legal status started in spring 2000. This was adopted in May 2003 3 and entered into force in July 2003. A first amendment to the NUTS Regulation to reflect the 2004 enlargement was adopted by the Council and Parliament in autumn 2005. An amended regional breakdown in existing Member States, following the rules of the Regulation, was discussed in 2006 and adopted in early 2007. 4 A further amendment following the enlargement of the EU in 2007 was adopted in early 2008. 5 One particularly important goal of the Regulation is to manage the inevitable process of change in the administrative structures of Member States in the smoothest possible way, so as to minimise the impact of such changes on the availability and comparability of regional statistics. NUTS favours institutional divisions For practical reasons connected with data availability and regional policy implementation, the NUTS classification is based on the institutional divisions applied in the Member States (normative criterion). NUTS is a hierarchical classification Regional levels (1 to 3) NUTS subdivides each Member State into a whole number of regions at NUTS 1 level. Each of these is then subdivided into regions at NUTS level 2, and these in turn into regions at NUTS level 3. Leaving aside the local level (municipalities), the internal administrative structure of the Member States is generally based on two of these three main regional levels. This existing national administrative structure may be, for example, at NUTS 1 and NUTS 3 levels (respectively the L\u00e4nder and Kreise in Germany), or at NUTS 2 and NUTS 3 ( r\u00e9gions and d\u00e9partements in France or Comunidades aut\u00f3nomas and provincias in Spain). Providing a complete breakdown, i.e. at all three NUTS levels, therefore means identifying a regional level for each Member State in addition to the two main levels mentioned above. This additional level thus corresponds to a regional structure that is less extensively used for administrative purposes \u2014 or which may indeed be instituted solely for this statistical purpose, without having any administrative function whatever. Depending on which levels already exist, the additional level may be created at any one of the three NUTS levels. Since France, for example, has functional administrative units at levels 2 and 3, the additional level is introduced at NUTS level 1. This is also the case for Italy, Greece and Spain.

Community policy may, however, be applied to areas that are not compatible with NUTS. This has long been the case with agriculture, where there have been schemes to support mountainous or disadvantaged agricultural areas and, more recently, support schemes in other domains, such as coastal and urban areas. To meet the demand for statistics linked to defining, implementing and monitoring these policies, and the growing general need for information at local level, Eurostat has set up an infra-regional information system, the first step being to compile a Community classification of local administrative units (\u201cLAU\u201d) compatible with NUTS. Two further levels have been defined in accordance with NUTS principles, but only the smallest of these (LAU level 2) has been set for all the Member States. This usually corresponds to the \u201cmunicipality\u201d. ( See also Chapter 4 below.) 2 22 2.5. .5. .5. .5. Applying NU Applying NU Applying NU Applying NUTS to a particular country TS to a particular country TS to a particular country TS to a particular country There are several stages in applying the classification to a particular Member State. First, the administrative structure of the country is analysed. Next, a check is made of whether regional data are collected and disseminated on the basis of this regional breakdown, which they usually are. The average size (mainly in terms of population) of the units of the various existing administrative levels is then analysed to determine where these levels belong in the NUTS hierarchy. There are two possible outcomes: (cid:1) the average size of the level examined corresponds more or less to one of the NUTS levels (average across the other Member States of the Union), in which case the administrative structure in question is adopted in its entirety, without change, as the NUTS regional breakdown at this level. Of course, given the historical development of the regional structure, this may mean that the size of individual units in the country concerned differs considerably from the Community-wide average size of units registered at this NUTS level; (cid:1) no administrative structure has an average size similar to the Community average; in this case an ad hoc breakdown, called \u201cnon-administrative units\u201d , is compiled by grouping together existing smaller administrative units. Because there are no historical constraints on the regional breakdown, in this case Eurostat pays much stricter attention to compliance by all regions with the population thresholds set in the NUTS Regulation.

The amendments of the classification is adopted by the Commission in accordance with the so called regulatory procedure with scrutiny. In 2010, it is the second time that the Commission amends the NUTS classification according to the rules of the NUTS Regulation. The purpose of the revision is to reflect recent changes in the administrative division of Member States as well as accommodate national requests for modifications of non-admnistrative units.

SIRE SIRE SIRE SIRE - -- - European infra European infra European infra European infra- -- -regional information system regional information system regional information system regional information system In addition to the collections of regional statistical data, Eurostat also has some data for the local administrative units (local authority level, LAU). There is a separate collection of local data, called SIRE (European infra-regional information system), which is described solely in this chapter, but not in the remainder of this Reference Guide, given that SIRE does not form part of the Regions domain. The SIRE database is not publicly available but restricted to users inside the European Commission. It consists of a classification for local administrative units (LAU levels 1 and 2) and statistical data from the ten-yearly population censuses. Flags denoting eligibility for the structural funds (under the EU regional policy) are also available. The total number of LAUs is around 120 000 in the EU-27, with an additional 40 000 in the EFTA and candidate countries. Since there are frequent changes to the local administrative units, Eurostat tries to follow its development from year to year. Some countries make very frequent changes to their LAUs, while others virtually never change them. No attempt is made to link data from different censuses in any comprehensive manner. Links to the regional NUTS levels are stored in the database. The NUTS Regulation makes provision for EU Member States to send lists of LAUs to Eurostat. A new version of the lists with codes and names as on 1.1.2009 was published on the Internet in early 2010.

Censuses are not held on the same date in every Member State. For the 1981,1991 and 2001 rounds the time lag between the earliest census in a particular round and the last was about three years. Around 30 variables are collected from the population censuses. They include total population, sex and age distribution, economic activity of the population, number of households, dwellings with tenure status and level of education. For confidentiality reasons, data for small local authorities arewithheld by Member States. The variable \u201ctotal population\u201d is available for all local authorities, however.

The history The history The history The history In 1999 the Commission conducted a tentative data collection of comparable indicators for European cities. The purpose of this \u201cUrban Audit\u201d was to test the feasibility of collecting comparable measurements of the quality of life in European cities. Over the entire EU (EU- 15 at the time), around 480 variables were collected for the 58 largest cities \u2013 although London and Paris were omitted since they were considered too difficult to cope with in a test phase. After completion of the Urban Audit, the Commission decided that there was a clear need to continue and improve this approach of collecting comparable information on urban development. The next data collection waves for Urban Audit data took place in 2003 (for EU-15 cities) respectively 2004 (for the new Member States) and in 2006/2007 (for the EU-27 cities plus cities in Norway, Switzerland, Turkey and Croatia). 5.2. 2. 2. 2.

From these variables, derived indicators are calculated by Eurostat. The following domains are covered by the Urban Audit dataset: ",

Eurostat is responsible for coordinating the flow of Urban Audit data at European level. This role involves keeping in contact with the national coordinators and with the main users in the Commission, feeding the database and disseminating the results of the Urban Audit. A team of experts, made up of senior statisticians, assists Eurostat regarding methodology questions on, for example, definitions of variables and estimation methods required to match the available data with the requested statistics. National coordinators are essential as the link between the cities and Eurostat. The first choice for national coordinators has been the National Statistical Offices, as they have the necessary expertise in statistical matters and, in many cases, already have at their disposal a large number of the statistics required. In other cases, like Germany, city networks act as national coordinators. The National Urban Audit Coordinator (NUAC) collects data from the cities and other sources, validates them and makes sure that a complete set of urban statistics is transmitted within the deadlines set. A large volume of data already existed in the NSOs\u2019 databases or in administrative registers available to them. The remaining data have to be collected from the cities. The local authorities collect a range of data for their own purposes, namely administration of the city, urban planning, etc. Next Urban Audit data collections It was decided that from 2009 onwards there should be an annual Urban Audit data collection of a restricted number of 30 to 40 variables.

This will complement the binding rules of the Regulation.

The following provisions, which apply to all Eurostat databases, concern REGIO tables with indicators expressed as monetary values: \u2022 On 1 January 2002, the euro became the national currency for the citizens of the euro-zone Member States (Belgium, Germany, Greece, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal and Finland). \u2022 Slovenia joined on 1 January 2007. \u2022 Cyprus and Malta joined on 1 January 2008. \u2022 Slovakia joined on 1 January 2009 The possibility for users to make cross-country comparisons (and aggregations) and for single-country time series analysis for the euro-zone Member States will be maintained (see explanations below). From 2002 on, Eurostat has been publishing two main families of data series: 1. data expressed in \u201cnational currency (including \u201ceuro-fixed\u201d series for euro-zone countries)\u201d; 2. data expressed in \u201ceuro/ECU\u201d. As before, the natural use of the two sets of data is different and clearly separated. The first set is used for single-country time series analysis (comparison over time), the second for cross-country comparisons and aggregations. 6 66 6.4. .4. .4. .4. When are data updated? When are data updated? When are data updated? When are data updated? Most tables from other thematic units inside Eurostat are more or less constantly updated. It is not possible to indicate a specific month for the update. Some data are still requested from the Member States by the regional section itself. These data requests are sent out annually but the timing in the year depends on the domain. REGIO tables are updated when the data are sent to Eurostat, once they have been checked by the domain manager and/or her/his assistants. 6 66 6.5. .5. .5. .5. Are the data checked for coherence?

        "Regional data \u2013 an overview Regional and Urban Statistics Reference Guide 2010 20 1 rules the domain manager then has to contact the Member State to determine which of the subtotals was wrong. The domain manager will also check which data are missing and if there is any reason for this. Obviously, there is not much point in ringing up Helsinki to ask: \u201cWhere are your figures for olive plantations?\u201d Once checked, the figures are then loaded into Eurostat\u2019s statistical databases. 6 66 6.6. .6. .6. .6.

No . This used to be the case many years ago when a number of Eurostat\u2019s thematic units also held regional data in their section of the database. Since 2000, however, a consistent effort has been made to present all European regional data in the Regions domain. The only exception to this general rule concerns the nomenclature used: if a set of data uses territorial units that deviate substantially from NUTS, it is not considered mature enough for the Regions domain. While in the short term this may mean not having access to certain data, it is the only way of preserving the collection-to-collection comparability of data within the Regions domain. 6.7. 6.7. 6.7. 6.7. What are \"Tables by themes\"? What are \"Tables by themes\"? What are \"Tables by themes\"? What are \"Tables by themes\"? A sub-set of statistical indicators exists separately in an area of the database called 'Tables by themes' (until last year called \"Main Tables\") . This area of the database was created with the less experienced users in mind. It holds a selection of the most important indicators of the database and allows for easier selection of the indicators as well as providing additional options for visualising the statistical indicators, including geographical mapping. Please note that the indicators in this area are just a copy of existing indicators in the data- base and thus do not hold any additional statistical information. On the regional level, the number of Tables by themes has been considerably increased in 2009 (by over 400%). By now there are 55 tables available for the ten different statistical domains as well as 11 tables with Urban Audit data. These Urban Audit tables are a subset of demographic, economic and social indicators. 6 66 6.8 .8 .8 .8. .. .

In spring 2008, regional data from the 7 non-European OECD countries Australia, Canada, Japan, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand and the USA were added to the database. The territorial division for the latter countries is the one used by the OECD, which has developed a codification similar to the NUTS at two \"Territorial Levels\", abbreviated TL.

However, the NUTS classification is valid for EU Member States only; in the case of candidate countries, reference should be made to SR (\"Statistical Regions\"). Both classifications are based on the same requirements and assumptions and are therefore comparable. Furthermore, ESA95 is based on a Council Regulation that applies to EU Member States only; however, the candidate countries are also involved in the ESA95 delivery programme. 7 77 7.1 .1 .1 .1. .. . Estimating Estimating Estimating Estimating r rr regional GDP egional GDP egional GDP egional GDP From 1999 onwards, Eurostat has been estimating regional GDP on the basis of the ESA95 national and regional accounts, starting with the reference year 1995. Before the end of each year, data are delivered by Member States for the reference year t-2. Once the data have been processed within Eurostat, they are made available (e.g. in February 2008 data are published for 2005). The data are available in the Regions domain under the names \u201cREG_E2GDP\u201d and \u201cREG_E3GDP\u201d. In order to obtain figures per inhabitant, the figures from regional accounts, i.e. GDP in Ecu/euro (and PPS) are divided by the regional average population figures for the same year. The method for regionalising the national GDP is the same as in previous years, i.e. the regional breakdown is based on the most recent data on the regional structure of gross value added (GVA) at basic prices, which is the concept introduced by ESA95. The GVA figures on which this regionalisation is based are corrected for \u201cfinancial intermediation services indirectly measured\u201d (FISIM) for almost every country. The GDP estimation algorithm usually follows a bottom-up approach, i.e. estimates are made first for NUTS level 3 regions, then for NUTS level 2 and, finally, for NUTS 1 regions. If GVA for a given year is not available at NUTS 3 level, the figures at NUTS 2 level are broken down using the regional structure of the latest available year. Where Extra-Regio data are available, the corresponding GVA is allocated proportionally to all the regions in the country concerned. Regional GDP is expressed in both Ecu/euro and PPS (purchasing power standards). Current European structural policy rules call for per inhabitant figures rather than regional GDP values per se . To make sure that regional accounts figures are consistent with national accounts figures, regional population figures are adjusted in such a way that the sum of all regions of a country equals the population figure published by national accounts. This estimation procedure features a number of key assumptions and interesting characteristics: o The basic assumption is that the regional GVA structure tallies with the regional GDP structure. o Furthermore, use of national purchasing power parities (PPPs) is based on the assumption that there are no \u2014 or negligible \u2014 purchasing power disparities ",
        "Regional data \u2013 an overview Regional and Urban Statistics Reference Guide 2010 22 1 between the regions within individual countries. Although this assumption may not appear entirely realistic, it is inevitable in view of the available data. Regional GVA figures provide sound basic data. They are compiled by EU Member States and candidate countries and checked for consistency by Eurostat. Different national survey procedures and sources are not necessarily a cause for concern, provided the results are comparable in terms of accuracy. As a measure to provide transparency about national methods, between 2000 and 2004 the national statistical offices produced Quality Reports for regional GVA, where the methods applied in each country were described in detail. At the beginning of 2008 they started to produce new detailed Inventories of methods applied and sources used. These inventories are gradually becoming available since the end of 2008 and can be obtained on request. Estimation problems occur in some cases with \u201cnowcasts\u201d. Experience has shown that there is never a point in time during year t+2 at which all the countries are able to supply data on GVA structure for year t at every regional level, which could then be used to estimate the regional GDP values for year t. Similar problems occasionally occur with data on average population, particularly at NUTS 3 level. To ensure that estimates can nevertheless be calculated for year t, in such cases the GVA structure of year t-1 or earlier years is assumed to be stable. This means that estimates are based not on the GVA or population structure of year t, but on the last available structure. 7 77 7.2. .2. .2. .2. Regional Regional Regional Regional u uu unemployment nemployment nemployment nemployment r rr rates ates ates ates Definitions The main source for regional labour market data is the EU-wide Labour Force Survey (LFS). The definitions of the survey\u2019s indicators follow the definitions and recommendations of the International Labour Organisation (ILO). Employed persons are all persons aged 15 and over who, during the reference week, worked at least one hour for pay or profit, or were temporarily absent from such work. Family workers are included. Unemployed persons comprise persons aged 15 to 74 who were: (cid:3) without work during the reference week; (cid:3) available for work at the time (i.e. were available for paid employment or self- employment before the end of the two weeks following the reference week); (cid:3) actively seeking work (i.e. had taken specific steps in the four-week period ending with the reference week to seek paid employment or self-employment) or who found a job to start within a period of at most three months; All three conditions must be fulfilled simultaneously. Economically active population (sometimes also labelled as labour force, active population or active persons) comprises employed and unemployed persons. Unemployment rate represents unemployed persons as a percentage of the economically active population. ",
        "Regional data \u2013 an overview Regional and Urban Statistics Reference Guide 2010 23 1 The youth unemployment rate relates to persons aged 15 to 24. Dispersion of employment (unemployment) rates is the coefficient of variation of regional employment (unemployment) rates in a country, weighted by the absolute working age population (active population). Underperforming region is a region with a significantly high unemployment rate, or a significantly low employment rate, as compared with the rest of the country. The threshold at which a region is labelled \u201cunderperforming\u201d regarding unemployment is 150% of the national unemployment rate and, regarding employment, 90% of the national employment rate. Unemployment rates down to NUTS level 2 Down to NUTS level 2, the unemployment rates, like all the regional labour market data provided by Eurostat, are derived from the LFS. Unemployment rates at NUTS level 3 LFS NUTS level 2 absolute unemployment and economically active population figures broken down by sex and age (15 to 24 and 25 and over) are divided between NUTS level 3 regions in accordance with the distribution of NUTS level 3 absolute unemployment and economically active population figures by sex and age (15 to 24 and 25 and over) provided by countries. Unemployment rates at NUTS level 3 are calculated subsequently by programme. The source of the NUTS level 3 absolute unemployment and economically active population data provided by countries and used when attributing LFS NUTS level 2 absolute figures to NUTS level 3 depends very much on the country. The source can be LFS annual average figures, LFS three-year average figures, reliable register figures or some other reliable source. The table set out below indicates the source for each country: Data source and reference period for NUTS level 3 figures, by country Country Data source Reference period Belgium Register-based data annual average Bulgaria LFS annual average Czech Republic LFS annual average Denmark Register-based data annual average Germany Register-based data annual average Estonia LFS 3-year-average Ireland Household survey annual average Greece LFS annual average Spain LFS annual average France LFS + register-based data annual average Italy LFS annual average ",

Both are calculated using data at NUTS level 2 and NUTS level 3. High values for these indicators show that there are big differences in employment and unemployment levels between regions in a country. While the dispersion is a measure of the extent of these differences, the underperforming concept tries to spot regions where employment and unemployment situation is relatively worse when compared to the country average. Those regions being spotted, some indicators can be computed, e.g. the percentage of population in these regions. 8. 8. 8. 8.

General presentation General presentation General presentation General presentation The agricultural collection of the REGIO database contains a number of variables, such as agricultural accounts, structure of agricultural holdings, land use, some agricultural pro- duction, etc. These will be described in more detail in the following text. The data are supplied to Eurostat by theme, on the basis of EU legislation or of gentlemen's agreements. The user should refer to the legislation or manuals, which are indicated below in the corresponding sections, to obtain detailed definitions concerning the variables and methodologies used for information, collection or treatment. This documentation refers to data at national level, and is equally valid for regional data. Any necessary adaptations to meet the needs of regional data are mentioned in the texts below. Land use (table AGR_R_LANDUSE) The definitions are those used in Eurostat agricultural statistics. Occasional minor differ- ences between national and regional statistics are due to the fact that certain areas that are not recorded in the course of agricultural surveys are estimated at national level but cannot be regionalised with the same accuracy. Crop production (areas harvested: yields production) (table AGR_R_CROPS) In principle, the data correspond to \"harvested\" production, including losses and waste on the farm, quantities consumed directly on the farm and quantities marketed.

The horse populations are taken from national surveys or censuses carried out in either May-June or December. Production of cows\u2019 milk on farms (1000 tons) [table AGR_R_MILKPR] If a Member State cannot supply the data, Eurostat (Unit E2) estimates this (with the agreement of the Member State) using a method which the members of the Working Group on Milk and Milk Product Statistics accepted at their meeting on 14-15 November 2001. The estimation method is based on the total production of cows\u2019 milk on farms as indicated in table C of Decision 97/80/EC, and on the regional distribution of dairy cattle. Agricultural accounts according to EAA 97 (Rev 1.1) [table AGR_R_ACCTS] The agricultural accounts are defined as a satellite account to the National Accounts (ESA 95) and are submitted by the Member States according to Regulation (EC) 138/2004. The figures presented in table AGR_R_ACCTS are broken down from the agricultural accounts on country level at regional level. In the compiling a combination of bottom up and top down approaches are used. The regional data at NUTS level 2 are collected on gentleman agree- ment and submitted only in current prices.

General presentation General presentation General presentation General presentation Definition of population The statistics on population refer to the national, regional and local population at its usual residence. In accordance with this concept, the following persons are consid- ered to be usually residents of the geographical area in question: those who have lived in their place of usual residence for a continuous period of at least 12 months before the reference date or those who arrived in their place of usual residence during the 12 months before the reference date with the intention of staying there for at least one year. Eurostat collects from Member States and other countries participating in the Eurostat re- gional annual data collection data on population on 1 January. Countries may provide the legal or registered population instead of the usually resident population. Population data Table reg_D2JAN80 contains data on the 1 January population for all Member States, with the exception of Ireland (mid-April population) and the United Kingdom (30 June popula- tion). This table covers 5-year classes of age for the period 1980 \u2013 1989. Table reg_D2JAN contains data on the 1 January population by single years of age and sex, by NUTS level 2, from 1990 onwards. Table reg_D2AVG provides the average population by single year of age and sex, by NUTS level 2 from 1990 onwards. The average population is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the population on 1 January for two consecutive years. Table reg_D3AVG contains data on total average population by sex and NUTS level 3 from 1990 onwards. The average population is principally used for calculating per capita GDP, birth rates and mortality rates. Area and population density Table reg_D3AREA contains data on the area of the regions of the European Union. Two area concepts are available: total area, including inland water bodies, and land area defini- tion. Not all countries can provide data according to both concepts. For most countries the difference between total and land area is is not significant. These data are given in km 2 (1 km 2 = 100 ha) and are used primarily for the calculation of the population density (table reg_D3DENS). ",

This data is copied from the OECD's public database. For additional infor- mation on the data presented in the OECD tables and the corresponding meta-data, please refer to the OECD website: http://stats.oecd.org Population change The demographic statistics on births and deaths are based on registered information that the Member States and other countries participating in the Eurostat data collections pro- vide. The regional demographic statistics contain detailed data at NUTS level 2 on the number of live births distributed by single year of age of mother (table reg_d2natag ) and data on num- ber deceased persons, by single year of age and sex (table reg_d2morag). Two definition for age are available in the tables: age in completed years (i.e. age at last birthday) and age reached during the year (i.e. age at 31 December). Table reg_D3NATMO contains an overview of the natural population change (total number of births and deaths) at NUTS level 3, including the following crude rates. \u2022 Crude birth rate: ratio of live births to the total average population, per 1000 in- habitants \u2022 Crude death rate: ratio of total deaths to the total avearge population, per 1000 in- habitants Table reg_d2infmo provides data on infant mortality and infant mortality rate, by NUTS level 2. Regional population projections Based on past trends, an analysis of driving forces and expert opinion, Eurostat has pro- duced a set of internationally consistent population projections at national level (EUROPOP2008: EUROstat POpulation Projections 2008-based). This exercise has been fol- lowed by a regional breakdown for those Member States that, according to the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) as of 2006, have a NUTS level 2 that is different from the national level. Population projections are 'what-if' scenarios that aim to provide information about the likely future size and structure of the population. As with Eurostat population projections at national level, EUROPOP2008 regional population projections present one of several possible population change scenarios at NUTS level 2 based on assumptions for fertility, mortality and migration for the period 2008-2030. The current regional scenario complements the demographic profile suggested by population projections produced by other statistical insti- tutes or other international organisations, which draw alternative paths for the possible evo- lution of the population. The projections have been compiled using the standard demographic cohort-component model. The country specific input parameters (EUROPOP2008 at national level; for informa- ",

Additionally, the regional variation in demographic behaviour is quantified for the period 2008-2030. For fertility and mortality the regional variation from the national overall fertility and mor- tality is expressed using the indirect standardisation method (standardised ratio). First, the national fertility and mortality age- and sex-specific rates are applied to the regional popula- tion, yielding a hypothetical number of events; then the observed number of regional events is divided by this hypothetical number to obtain a regional scaling factor. The regional scal- ing factors thus obtained represent an estimate of the extent to which regional fertility and mortality are above or below the national overall fertility and mortality. For international migration, scaling factors were calculated as the ratio of the regional crude migration rate to the national crude migration rate. This indicator also equals the ratio of the share of the regional net migration in the total country net migration and of the regional population in the total population. For fertility, the regional scaling factors have been relatively stable in recent years. Regional differences from the respective national figure (at national level standardised ratio by defini- tion equals to 1) are, for the vast majority of regions, in the range of \u00b120% for the years that have been used to calculate the regional scaling factors. Similarly, for mortality, the regional scaling factors for males and females have also been relatively stable in recent years. On the whole, regional mortality differences have been smaller than the corresponding fertility dif- ferences. For the projections, therefore, the regional scaling factors have initially been set to the average value in recent years. International migration has been estimated as a residual of the demographic balance and it therefore includes all imperfections which might affect the other components of the equa- tion. In order to calculate the necessary information for Greece, Portugal and Ireland, the data on international migration for these countries were indirectly derived from the internal migration data from the last census. For France data for internal migration were available as an average for the period 2004-2008. This might have affected the results for the regions of these countries. The base year (starting year i.e. 2008) regional scaling factors have been set to the average over recent years where data were available. Consequently, assumptions have to be made concerning the degree to which the scaling fac- tors will change over the projection period 2008-2030. Specifically, the difference between the national and the regional scaling factor is assumed to decline by a quarter by 2030. For instance, where a region's scaling factor for a component is 0.80 (meaning that it is 20% below the national level, which by definition equals to 1) this will be 0.85 at the end of the projection period. The scaling factors for each year between the base year and the target year have been ob- tained by linear interpolation. In addition to the above assumptions on fertility, mortality and international migration, assumptions were made about inter-regional migration. The age and sex-specific rates of inter-regional migration were estimated by means of a model that uses as an input the inter-NUTS level 2 departures and arrivals by age, sex and ",
        "Detailed description of the database (REGIO) Regional and Urban Statistics Reference Guide 2010 47 2 region, and the total number of inter- NUTS level 2 migrations by region of origin and region of destination (origin-destination migration matrix). Assumptions were made about national residential mobility and the degree of attractiveness of the regions; therefore, assumptions were made about internal mobility as a whole (intra- plus inter-regional moves) plus the convergence/divergence of the regions in terms of attrac- tiveness (full convergence would signify that net inter-regional migration is zero). In the cur- rent regional EUROPOP2008 population projections, internal mobility and regional differ- ences are assumed not to change from the recent situation (calculated as an average of internal migration flows in recent years depending on countries' data availability). The as- sumptions are quantified in the origin-destination migration matrix. Using a specific model, these assumptions on internal mobility and attractiveness are ultimately translated into in- ter-regional migration rates. The age structures for fertility, mortality and international migration at regional level are assumed to be identical to those at national level, while for inter-regional migration they are derived from the model and are region-specific. The Eurostat regional population projections are fully consistent with the Eurostat national projections, in terms of both the input (rates) and, with the application of specific consis- tency algorithms, the output (events) side. Therefore, the regional assumptions and results are linked to the assumptions and national results of EUROPOP2008. Specifically, in order to ensure consistency between the national and the regional EUROPOP2008, the regional projection model checks for each type of event (births, deaths, and international migration), whether the regional numbers add up to the national number from the national EUROPOP2008. If not, the regional numbers of events are proportionally adjusted in line with the national level. Consistency between regional and national scenarios is thus achieved both on the input side (equivalent rates) and on the output side (equivalent numbers of events). Specific methodological remarks: (cid:1) It should be noted that in principle, the period 2003-2007 was used; however, the ex- act number of years may differ between components and countries, depending on data availability. (cid:1) The base year is 2008 and eventual revisions of the population for the jump-off year have not been incorporated in the current version of the regional population projec- tions in order to keep consistency to the EUROPOP2008 national population projec- tions. (cid:1) EUROPOP2008 at national level: For information on the 2008-based population projec- tions at national level refer to Eurostat publication, Statistics in Focus titled \"Ageing characterises the demographic perspectives of the European societies\", 72/2008. Census data at regional level Regional data from the 2001 Census of Population and Housing have been stored in the REGIO database on a country/table basis. ",
        "Detailed description of the database (REGIO) Regional and Urban Statistics Reference Guide 2010 48 2 Until 2008 there were no legal basis for the collection of census data. Census data were col- lected on a voluntary basis according to the Table programme for the Community Pro- gramme of Population and Housing Censuses in 2001. Each country has carried out a cen- sus according to a time plan agreed in the country. Thus there is a wide range of census dates, from March 1999 in France to 2002 in Poland, Ireland and Slovenia. Nevertheless, census data from all countries are considered to form part of the \u201c2000/2001 round\u201d of cen- suses of population and housing. The only exception is Malta, which held censuses in 1995 and 2005. The overview below indicates which reference dates have been used in the census table programme and also what is the source of the data.

The total headcount is available for all countries, though. Countries which did not carry out a census around 2001 have collected similar information from other sources, mainly regis- ters. Out of the 40 tables in the table programme of the censuses of population and housing in 2001, tables 29-37 deal with the regional level at NUTS level 3. The titles of the 9 regional tables are listed below. Because the censuses were carried out before the NUTS 2006 version came into effect, the tabulation of regional census data has been done in the countries according to the NUTS division in force at the time of the census. Eurostat has made an effort to re-code the re- gional census tables to NUTS 2006. This has been possible for a large majority of regions, but there are some exceptions, due to regions splitting after the census date. The tables from the censuses of population and housing in 2001 represented at regional level (NUTS level 3) and included in REGIO are: TABLE 29 Usual resident population and economically active population by sex, age and indicator of internal or international migration TABLE 30 Usual resident population by sex, group of age, type of household and household status TABLE 31 Usual resident population by sex, group of age and economical status (current activity and status of employment) TABLE 32 Usual resident population by sex, age group, marital and cohabitational status, size of household and selected social indicators TABLE 33 Usual resident population by sex, country of citizenship and indicator of birth TABLE 34 Usual resident population by sex, age group, highest educational attainment, cur- rent activity and occupation TABLE 35 Usual resident population by sex, major branch of economic activity, indicator of citizenship and status of employment TABLE 36 Private households by type and number of members and population by age group and economic activity TABLE 37 Dwellings by indicator of conventional character, occupancy status, type of own- ership and type of building LIFE tables Life table is one of the most important and most widely used devices in demography, su- marizing various aspects of the variation of mortality with age and showing, for each age, the probability that a person of that age will die before their next birthday.

General presentation General presentation General presentation General presentation The regional accounts are compiled in accordance with the \u2018European System of National and Regional Accounts\u2019 (ESA), which should be referred to for the definition of the aggre- gates. They are designated by the abbreviation ESA-Reg, which is a simplified version of the ESA. The ESA-Reg covers only a part of the aggregates defined by the ESA, i.e. gross value added, compensation of employees, gross fixed capital formation, employment (in persons and in hours worked) and household accounts. Data collection is according to the ESA95 classification 1 . ESA95 data start with 1995 as the first reference year and are available for both EU countries and non-EU countries. Data are collected using NACE Rev. 1.1 as classification of the economic branches. Data according to NACE Rev. 1.1 is available in A3 and A6 breakdown (see the table next page). Data collection according to NACE Rev. 1.1 is based on Regulation 1392/2007 (OJ L 324, 10.12.2007). Data is collected either on NUTS level 2 or level 3. Data delivery for variables from non-EU coun- tries is voluntary. For each of the three sets of tables there are certain derogations for a number of Member States. In order to allow comparisons of European regional data with that of non-European regions, Eurostat now also stores regional data from Australia, Canada, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Japan and USA. This data is copied from the OECD's public database.

General presentation General presentation General presentation General presentation Down to NUTS level 2, the source for regional labour market data is the European Union Labour Force Survey (LFS). This is a quarterly household sample survey conducted in the Member States of the European Union as well as in EFTA and Candidate countries. The LFS target population is made up of all persons in private households aged 15 and over. The definitions of the survey\u2019s characteristics follow the definitions and recommendations of the International Labour Organisation (ILO). For NUTS level 3, we use either a distribution of LFS NUTS level 3 data, if available. If not, the geographical distribution of register NUTS level 3 data is used to estimate NUTS level 3 figures. Data collection is structured the following way: Regional Labour Market \u2022 Regional economically active population \u2013 LFS series and LFS adjusted series \u2022 Regional employment \u2013 LFS series \u2022 Regional unemployment \u2013 LFS adjusted series \u2022 Regional socio-demographic labour force statistics \u2013 LFS series \u2022 Regional labour market disparities \u2013 LFS series and LFS adjusted series \u2022 Regional labour market data based on pre-2003 methodology (data up to 2001) - LFS adjusted series The first four sub-folders contain annual average data except for years in which the coun- tries listed below either had only \u2018spring\u2019 Labour Force Survey or provided Eurostat only with \u2018spring\u2019 Labour Force Survey data (this is second-quarter data except in the case of France and Poland, where this is first-quarter data). The \u2018spring\u2019 LFS data in the first four sub-folders is used for the following countries and years: EU countries: Germany: 1 1999 \u2013 2004 France: 1999 \u2013 2002 Ireland: 1999 \u2013 2002 Luxembourg: 1999 \u2013 2002 The Netherlands: 1999 Sweden: 1999 \u2013 2000 Estonia: 1999 1 ) Although Germany only introduced the continuous LFS covering all four quarters in 2005, the Statistisches Bundesamt in Germany provided Eurostat with estimates of annual average unem- ployment, economically active population and unemployment rate figures down to NUTS level 2 regions. These estimates are calculated on the basis of the LFS. The rest of the 1999\u20132004 re- gional labour market statistics on Germany represent second-quarter data. ",

The last sub-folder, i.e. \"Regional labour market data based on pre-2003 methodology (data up to 2001) \u2013 LFS adjusted series\", contains \u2018spring\u2019 LFS data. The regional labour market data for EFTA countries were published for the first time in Sep- tember 2003. After the major reform of regional labour market statistics in 2003 (changing from second- quarter LFS results to annual average LFS figures), Eurostat provides annual regional la- bour market data from 1999 onwards (exceptions are mentioned above). In 2005, estimates of annual regional employment and unemployment rates for 1995-1998 were published. For more information about regional labour market statistics see the meta data information in the the dissemination database. Basic concepts and definitions The European Union Labour Force Survey provides population estimates for the main labour market characteristics, such as employment, unemployment, economic inactivity, hours of work, occupation, economic activity and much else as well as important socio-demographic characteristics, such as sex, age, education, households and regions of residence. The division of the population into employed persons, unemployed persons and economically inactive persons (sometimes labelled as inactive persons) follows the ILO definition. Other concepts also follow broadly the recommendations of ILO. \u2022 Population covers persons aged 15 and over, living in private households (population living in collective households, i.e. residential homes, boarding houses, hospitals, reli- gious institutions, workers\u2019 hostels, etc. are not included). This comprises all persons living in the households surveyed during the reference week. This definition also in- cludes persons absent from the households for short periods (but having retained a link with the private household) owing to studies, holidays, illness, business trips, etc. Per- sons on compulsory military service are not included. \u2022 Employed persons are all persons aged 15 and over who during the reference week worked at least one hour for pay or profit, or were temporarily absent from such work. Family workers are included. \u2022 Employment rate represents employed persons as a percentage of the population. ",
        "Detailed description of the database (REGIO) Regional and Urban Statistics Reference Guide 2010 101 2 \u2022 Unemployed persons comprise persons aged 15-74 who were (all three conditions must be fulfilled simultaneously): 1. without work during the reference week; 2. available for work at the time (i.e. were available for paid employment or self- employment before the end of the two weeks following the reference week); 3. actively seeking work (i.e. had taken specific steps in the four-week period ending with the reference week to seek paid employment or self-employment) or who found a job to start within a period of at most three months. \u2022 Economically active population (sometimes labelled also as labour force , active persons or active population ) comprises employed and unemployed persons. \u2022 Economic activity rate represents economically active population as a percentage of the total population. \u2022 Unemployment rate represents unemployed persons as a percentage of the economi- cally active population. The youth unemployment rate relates to persons aged from 15 to 24 years. \u2022 Long-term unemployment share represents long-term unemployed (12 months or longer) as a percentage of the total unemployed persons. \u2022 Dispersion of regional employment (unemployment) rates is the coefficient of em- ployment (unemployment) rates in a country, weighted by the absolute active popula- tion of each region. \u2022 Underperforming region is a region with either an employment rate below 90% of the national rate or an unemployment rate above 150% of the national unemployment rate. To compute the EU aggregate, the rates of all regions are compared with the EU employment and unemployment rates. \u2022 Lifelong learning represents participation of adults aged 25-64 in education and training. 5.2. 5.2. 5.2. 5.2.

Migration statistics Migration statistics Migration statistics Migration statistics 6.1. 6.1. 6.1. 6.1. General presentation General presentation General presentation General presentation The regional migration datasets provide the national figures corresponding to the in and out movements within the country: reg_mig2mint . No distinction is made between national and non-national residents, but movements that involve the crossing of national borders are not included. Requested definitions of migrants are the internationally recommended definitions for the measurement of migration flows. Applied definitions of age may not always be homogeneous, the standard definition being age at the end of the year . Therefore anomalies can be found in the y0 and y0_4 age classes be- cause of the relabeling of the classes for standardisation purposes. The internal migration flows at NUTS level 2 are split in the arrivals and departures tables distributed by age. Internal migration by sex and region of origin and of destination matrices per country gives the regional distribution of the flows for regions at Nuts2 level. Regions in the GEO list work out the number of departures with a destination in the corre- sponding PARTNER regions. Total inflows, in the intersection of the PARTNER regions with the corresponding region in the GEO list at NUTS-0 level -national level- should therefore match the figure for the corre- sponding region in the arrivals table, while total outflows, in the intersection of the GEO regions with the corresponding Nuts0 region -national level- in the PARTNER, will corre- spond to the figure for age total in the departures table. Due to intra-regional migration, data from some of the countries and for some years in the detailed arrivals and departures by age tables were not consistent with the internal migra- tion matrix by origin and destination. To solve this problem, Eurostat estimated adjusted figures for these two tables. The following procedure was followed: totals from the internal migration matrix were trans- ferred to the column with the totals in the arrivals and departures tables, while the age dis- tribution in the original data was maintained by applying the age percentages to the new total figures from the flow matrix. The resultant estimates have been consequently flagged as Eurostat estimates. 6.2. 6.2. 6.2. 6.2.

General presentation General presentation General presentation General presentation Definition of R&D Research and Development (R&D) includes creative work undertaken on a systematic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of man, culture and soci- ety, and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications (see the Frascati Man- ual, \u00a7 57) 1 . R&D expenditure Expenditures measured are intramural R&D expenditures. This measure contains are all expenditures for R&D performed within a statistical unit or sector of the economy during a specific period, whatever the source of funds. They thus include current expenses such as employment costs or expenditures on materials, plus capital expenditure on, for example, buildings or equipment. Regional data on R&D, at NUTS Levels 1 and 2, are supplied by Member States, generally on the basis of national surveys. Some time series can show a break due to changes in methodology. More information of the measurement of R&D expen- diture can be found in the Frascati Manual, chapter 6. R&D personnel Total R&D personnel includes all persons employed directly in R&D activities as well as those any supplying direct services to R&D activities such as managers, administrators and clerical staff. Total R&D personnel can further be divided into the three occupational groups Researchers, Technicians and equivalent staff and Other supporting staff. In regional statis- tics only Researchers and total R&D personnel are accounted for. For methodological notes: see the Frascati Manual, chapter 5. As with the expenditure table, data are provided by Member States R&D sectors The institutional classification of the R&D performing units is following the institutional classification of National Accounts for the Business Enterprise Sector and the Private Non- Profit sector but differs in one major; due to the special importance of Universities and Technical Colleges, the sector \"government\" of National Accounts is split in two: \"Govern- ment sector\" and \"Higher education sector\". The latter includes not only all universities, col- leges of technology and other institutes of post-secondary education (whatever their source of finance or legal status), but also all research institutes, experimental stations and clinics 1 ) Frascati Manual 2002: Proposed Standard Practice for Surveys on Research and Experimental Development, OECD Publishing, ISBN: 9789264199033 ",

Patents A patent is a legal title of industrial property granting its owner the exclusive right to exploit an invention commercially for a limited area and time. Patent data provide a measure of R&D output. REGIO contains data on patent applications to the European Patent Office (EPO) from the regions of the Member States of the European Union at NUTS levels 1 and 2. There are two parts to the regional patent table, namely patent applications to the EPO by IPC section and patent applications to the EPO in high-technology fields. Human resources in Science and Technology (HRST) According to the Canberra manual 2 , HRST are people who fulfil one or other of the following conditions: a) successfully completed education at tertiary level in an S&T field of study b) not formally qualified as above but employed in an S&T occupation where the above qualifications are normally required.

General presentation General presentation General presentation General presentation The SBS (Structural Business Statistics) describes the activity of businesses in the Euro- pean Union. The regulation applies to all market activities (except agriculture) normally in- cluded in industry, construction, the distributive trades and services. The statistical units used for the compilation of structural business statistics are listed in Section I of the Annex to Council Regulation (EEC) No 696/93 on the statistical units for the observation and analysis of the production system in the European Community. Definitions Enterprise The enterprise is the smallest combination of legal units that is an organisational unit pro- ducing goods or services, which benefits from a certain degree of autonomy in decision- making, especially for the allocation of its current resources. An enterprise carries out one or more activities at one or more locations. An enterprise may be a sole legal unit. Kind-of-activity unit The kind-of-activity unit (KAU) groups all the parts of an enterprise contributing to the per- formance of an activity at class level (four digits) of NACE Rev. 1 and corresponds to one or more operational subdivisions of the enterprise. The enterprise\u2019s information system must be capable of indicating or calculating for each KAU at least the value of production, inter- mediate consumption, manpower costs, the operating surplus and employment and gross fixed capital formation. Local unit The local unit is an enterprise or part thereof (e.g. a workshop, factory, warehouse, office, mine or depot) situated in a geographically identified place. At or from this place economic activity is carried out for which \u2013 save for certain exceptions \u2013 one or more persons work (even if only part-time) for one and the same enterprise. Credit institution Credit institutions are defined in the first indent of Article 1 of Council Directive 77/780/EEC: 'credit institution means an undertaking whose business is to receive deposits or other repayable funds from the public and to grant credits for its own account'.

General presentation General presentation General presentation General presentation Causes of death Data source and quality Eurostat's Causes of Death Statistics is the collection by Eurostat of statistical data on causes of death (referred to below as COD data) at sub-national (NUTS 2) level. These series contain COD data since 1994 (except for Belgium 1993), disaggregated by sex, by 65 causes of death, by country and \u2013 for the European Union \u2013 by region at NUTS level 2. Tables contain the absolute numbers and crude death rates for data at sub-national level. For data at regional level only crude death rates are given. Standardised rates at regional level will be included in subsequent versions for reasons discussed below. The data compiled in this series are obtained from the data provided by the National Statis- tical Institutes (NSIs) and by designated governmental agencies of the EU-15 Member States. The Eurostat Task Force on 'Causes of death statistics' (TF/COD) has been particu- larly helpful in generating this data series. The quality of the data is subject to the way in which the information on causes of death is reported and classified in each country. Procedures for the collection of cause-of-death data are relatively homogeneous between European countries (death certificate form, Interna- tional Classification of Diseases, etc.). In spite of these common features, important quality and comparability issues remain. It should be noted that inter-country differences, in par- ticular for specific causes such as accidents, drug abuse or alcohol related death may be caused by certification and/or coding differences. With effect from 1993, EUROSTAT decided to address at Community level a revised proce- dure for reporting on 'causes of death statistics' as well as the problem of comparability of these statistics. The proposals for future work were endorsed by the Working Group (WG) on \"Public Health Statistics\", which at its meeting in February 1996 established the Task Force on 'Causes of death statistics' (TF/COD). With the general aim of improving the quality and comparability of cause-of-death data, the specific aims of the work of this TF/COD are i. to prepare initiative for data quality improvement and reporting of causes of death, ii. to examine methodological problems related to specific causes of death (e.g. ill-defined causes, violent death, deaths related to conditions such as alcohol or drug abuse) iii. to make recommendations to Member States on iimproving quality and comparability. An overview of the situation in European countries on certification and coding practices re- sulted from survey of the registration of causes of death among EU countries, carried out in 1997 by SC8-INSERM (Institut National de la Sant\u00e9 et de la Recherche M\u00e9dicale \u2013 France) ",
        "Detailed description of the database (REGIO) Regional and Urban Statistics Reference Guide 2010 152 2 with the assistance of the Eurostat TF/COD for Eurostat. More detailed information on causes of death requiring special attention, on the issue of unknown and ill-defined causes and on problems linked to legal investigations, confidentiality and rules on the certification of external and unknown causes are being collected. Causes of death \"EUROPEAN SHORTLIST\" For its demographic statistics Eurostat used to work with a shortlist of 11 groupings of causes of death. In 1995 all Member States were consulted on Eurostat's proposals for a revised reporting procedure on 'causes of death statistics' and Member States agreed to co- operate to arrive at a more detailed data collection at EU level. The Working Group on 'Public Health statistics' mandated the Task Force (TF) on Causes of death statistics to work out together with Eurostat practical points and technical aspects. All Member States welcomed the use of a shortlist of 'causes of death' as an important tool for international comparisons of mortality data, primarily for analysis at regional level and for the analysis of long-term results, such as retrospective studies and mortality projections. For those Member States where (a) national shortlist(s) already exist(s), a European shortlist could be used in addition. The COD selected in the 65-point list have been chosen \u2013 with the assistance of the TF/COD \u2013 after careful examination of many lists being used by the Member States and of WHO in- ternational summary tabulation lists. It includes the most relevant COD for the EU, and the basis on which the causes were selected for this list were: \u2022 of relevance with respect to EU mortality patterns; \u2022 of relevance of national and sub-national health programmes; \u2022 of relevance for disaggregation by regional (NUTS 2) level; \u2022 of special importance to mortality trend and projections; \u2022 the subject of 'frequently asked questions'. Another important element for arriving at the 65-point list was that not all MS collect data at the same level of detail of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) (World Health Organisation) \u2013 some at 3-digit, others at 4-digit level \u2013 and that MS do not all introduce ICD-10 at the same year. This will, for a period of 5 to 10 years, seriously hamper the collec- tion of comparable COD statistics in Europe. Since existing shortlists could not be used for the different ICD versions, care was taken that all the 65 causes in the list were compatible with all the versions of ICD; in fact this is a shortlist for COD that is compatible with the Eight, Ninth and Tenth Revisions of ICD. Core data The first two series give data at sub-national level, by sex, 5-years age groups and by cause of death (65 COD list). The first series contains the absolute numbers of deaths . The second series gives age-specific death rates per 100 000 population by sex. Standardised rates are only given for data at a national level; for data at regional level only crude death rates are given. Standardised rates at regional level will be included in subsequent publications. It is important to realise that it is the absolute number and the crude death rate that reflect the burden of disease in a country; standardised rates indicate differences between countries and regions and are used for identifying meaningful trends. ",
        "Detailed description of the database (REGIO) Regional and Urban Statistics Reference Guide 2010 153 2 A third series gives data at national and at regional (NUTS 2) level in crude death rates per 100 000 of population by sex, by 10-year-age groups and by cause of death (65 COD list). For reasons of confidentiality, some 'causes' or some 'age groups' have been compressed. Since Eurostat will be making comparisons at the NUTS level 2, the number of deaths by each cause in the 65-list will be very small, thus leading to a \"small numbers\" effect. If the number of deaths from one cause is for instance '2' in one year while in the next year the number increases by another two than the total number of deaths and the death rate from that cause has 'doubled' and is therefore unstable from year to year. This makes it neces- sary to use for the data at regional level at least three-year rolling averages to avoid mislead- ing fluctuations. Calculations for this are ongoing and standardised rates at regional level may be included in NewCronos in the future.

Tourism statistics Tourism statistics Tourism statistics Tourism statistics 10.1. 10.1. 10.1. 10.1. General General General General presentation presentation presentation presentation This collection on regional tourism statistics contains data on (cid:1) The capacity of collective tourist accommodation (number of establishments, number of bedrooms, number of bedplaces) and (cid:1) Occupancy in collective accommodation establishments (arrivals and nights spent, bro- ken down into residents and non-residents). Definitions Definitions Definitions Definitions Capacity of collective tourist accommodation Number of establishments The local unit is an enterprise or part thereof situated in a geographically identified place. At or from this place economic activity is carried out for which - save for certain exceptions - one or more persons work (even if only part-time) for one and the same enterprise. The accommodation establishment conforms to the definition of local unit as the production unit. This is irrespective of whether the accommodation of tourists is the main or secondary activity. This means that all establishments are classified in the accommodation sector if their capacity exceeds the national minimum even if the major part of turnover may come from restaurant or other services. Number of bedrooms A bedroom is the unit formed by one room or groups of rooms constituting an indivisible rental whole in an accommodation establishment or dwelling. Rooms may be single, double or multiple, depending on whether they are equipped perma- nently to accommodate one, two or more people (it is useful to classify the rooms respec- tively). The number of existing rooms is the number the establishment habitually has avail- able to accommodate guests (overnight visitors), excluding rooms used by the employees working for the establishment. If a room is used as a permanent residence (for more than a year) it should not be included. Bathrooms and toilets do not count as a room. An apart- ment is a special type of room. It consists of one or more rooms and has a kitchen unit and its own bathroom and toilet. Apartments may be with hotel services (in apartment hotels) or without hotel services. Cabins, cottages, huts, chalets, bungalows and villas can be treated like bedrooms and apartments, i.e. to be let as a unit. Number of bedplaces The number of bedplaces in an establishment or dwelling is determined by the number of persons who can stay overnight in the beds set up in the establishment (dwelling), ignoring any extra beds that may be set up by customer request. The term bedplace applies to a sin- ",
        "Detailed description of the database (REGIO) Regional and Urban Statistics Reference Guide 2010 170 2 gle bed, a double bed being counted as two bedplaces. The unit serves to measure the ca- pacity of any type of accommodation. A bedplace is also a place on a pitch or in a boat on a mooring to accommodate one person. One camping pitch should equal four bedplaces if the actual number of bedplaces is not known. Nights spent by residents and non-residents A night spent (or overnight stay) is each night that a guest actually spends (sleeps or stays) or is registered (his/her physical presence there being unnecessary) in a collective accom- modation establishment or in private tourism accommodation. Overnight stays are calculated by country of residence of the guest and by month. Normally the date of arrival is different from the date of departure but persons arriving after midnight and leaving on the same day are included in overnight stays. A person should not be regis- tered in two accommodation establishments at the same time. The overnight stays of non- tourists (e.g. refugees) should be excluded, if possible. Arrivals of residents and non-residents An arrival (departure) is defined as a person who arrives at (leaves) a collective accommoda- tion establishment or at private tourism accommodation and checks in (out). Statistically there is not much difference if, instead of arrivals, departures are counted. No age limit is applied: children are counted as well as adults, even in the case when the over- night stays of children might be free of charge. Arrivals are registered by country of resi- dence of the guest and by month. The arrivals of non-tourists (e.g. refugees) are excluded, if possible. The arrivals of same-day visitors spending only few hours during the day (no overnight stay, the date of arrival and departure are the same) at the establishment are excluded from accommodation statistics. Country of residence A person is considered to be a resident in a country (place) if the person: (i) has lived for most of the past year or 12 months in that country (place), or (ii) has lived in that country (place) for a shorter period and intends to return within 12 months to live in that country (place). International tourists should be classified according to their country of residence, not ac- cording to their citizenship. From a tourism standpoint any person who moves to another country (place) and intends to stay there for more than one year is immediately assimilated with other residents of that country (place). Citizens residing abroad who return to their country of citizenship on a temporary visit are included with non-resident visitors. Citizen- ship is indicated in the person\u2019s passport (or other identification document), while country of residence has to be determined by means of question or inferred e.g. from the person\u2019s ad- dress.

Hotels and similar establishments Hotels and similar establishments are typified as being arranged in rooms, in number ex- ceeding a specified minimum; as coming under a common management; as providing certain services including room service, daily bed-making and cleaning of sanitary facilities; as grouped in classes and categories according to the facilities and services provided; and as not falling in the category of specialised establishments. Hotels Comprise hotels, apartment hotels, motels, roadside inns, beach hotels, residential clubs and similar establishments providing hotel services including more than daily bed-making and cleaning of the room and sanitary facilities. Similar establishments Comprise rooming and boarding houses, tourist residence and similar accommodation ar- ranged in rooms and providing limited hotel services including daily bed-making and clean- ing of the room and sanitary facilities. This group also includes guest houses, Bed & Break- fast and farmhouse accommodation. Other collective establishments and Specialised establishments Any establishment, intended for tourists, which may be non-profit making, coming under a common management, providing minimum common services (not including daily bed- making) and not necessarily being arranged in rooms but perhaps in dwelling-type units, campsites or collective dormitories and often engaging in some activity besides the provision of accommodation, such as health care, social welfare or transport. Holiday dwellings Include collective facilities under common management, such as clusters of houses or bun- galows arranged as dwelling-type accommodation and providing limited hotel services (not including daily bed-making and cleaning). Tourist camp-sites Consist of collective facilities in enclosed areas for tents, caravans, trailers and mobile homes. All come under common management and provide some tourist services (shop, in- formation, recreational activities). Camping sites let pitches for tents, caravans, mobile homes and similar shelter to overnight visitors who want to stay on a \u201ctouring\u201d pitch for one night, a few days or week(s), as well as ",

Persons and goods carried \u2022 Road transport: the survey covers road transport carried out by vehicles registered in each Member State, on its national territory and abroad. Vehicles with a useful load capacity of not more than 3.5 tonnes or a total permitted loaded weight of not more than six tonnes may be excluded from the survey. Data are collected according to the legal act (Council Regulation 1172/98) and the definitions are based on the Glossary and legal act as well. The data at regional level are available in the road freight trans- port measurement part of the transport domain. \u2022 The data on maritime and air transport refer to domestic and foreign traffic at big ports only (ports with turnover above 1 mln tonnes or/and 200 thous. passengers per year). \u2022 In the case of air transport, passengers changing aircraft in an airport in the region are counted twice (once on arrival and again on departure), whereas passengers continuing their journey in the same aircraft from the reporting airport are counted only once as transit passengers. \u2022 Annual national and international railway passenger transport by region of embarka- tion and region of disembarkation and annual national and international railway goods transport by region of loading and region of unloading (NUTS 2) \u2013 tables under prepa- ration) \u2013 these two tables refer to 2005 data (data collected very 5 years); they will be available in the rail part of the transport domain.

Journeys made by vehicles transporting goods The indicators in this data set describe the European Regions as a function of the transport of goods. The main focus is the journeys made by vehicles transporting goods: how many journeys start, transit and end in a certain region and how many kilometres are driven by those vehicles within the regions or to reach a certain region. The indicators are the result of a transport modelling exercise, carried out in the study on the development of the regional dimension of road transport statistics (reference ERDF study 98/00/27/220) of which the methodology is described in an accompanying report on indica- tors.

This term covers both navigable rivers and lakes and navigable canals. The length of rivers and canals is measured in mid-channel. The length of lakes and lagoons is measured along the shortest navigable route between the most distant points to and from which transport operations are performed. A water- way forming a common frontier between two countries is reported by both. Categories of navigable in land waterways The categories of navigable inland waterways are defined with reference to inter- national classification systems such as those drawn up by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe or by the European Conference of Ministers of Transport.

The survey data refer to 1992 for Greece, to 1993 for Germany and Ireland, to 1995 for Italy and Portugal and to 1996 for France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Spain, Austria, Sweden and Finland. Additional data used in the transport model haven been obtained from Eurostat New Cronos. One trip is defined as a journey of one truck from one place to an other, this can be within a region of from one region to an other. The total number of trips is equal to the total number of vehicles/day. Production and attraction are expressed as the number of trips from (produc- tion) or to (attraction) a region. Intra-regional traffic is the traffic that is produced and attracted by the same region. Origin and destination of the truck is the same region. ",

General presentation General presentation General presentation General presentation Labour Costs are the total expenditure borne by employers for the purpose of employing staff. They include employee compensation, with wages and salaries in cash and in kind, employers\u2019 social security contributions, vocational training costs, other expenditure, such as recruitment costs and spending on working clothes, and employment taxes regarded as labour costs minus any subsidies received. Labour costs and their main components are expressed in absolute terms (Euro, national currencies - if different - and Purchasing Power Standards (PPS)) and pro rat a (annually, monthly or hourly and per capita or in full-time units (FTU)), as aggregates or broken down by full- or part-time employment. The labour costs structure is given as a percentage of the overall value of the different core components. As far as available data and confidentiality rules permit, all variables and proportions are further broken down by size category, economic activity and region (larger countries only). Economic activity is broken down at the division level of the General Industrial Classifica- tion of Economic Activities (NACE) for Sections C to K. From the survey 2004 on, the infor- mation is also available for NACE Sections M to O. Some of the countries also provided data in respect of Sections A, B and L. Five size categories are distinguished: 10 to 49 employees, 50 to 249 employees, 250 to 499 employees, 500 to 999 employees and units having at least 1 000 employees. Some of the Member States have extended their survey coverage to smaller units, so that a sixth size category for units with fewer than 10 employees is available in their case. 12 12 12 12.2. .2. .2. .2.

General presentation General presentation General presentation General presentation The data given in this domain is collected by the National Statistical Institutes and is based on Eurostat's annual model surveys on ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) usage in households and by individuals. Part of the data collected are used in for monitoring the development of the European information society. The relevant indicators are defined in the i2010 benchmarking framework. The framework is derived from the i2010 strategy , which seeks to further boost efficiency throughout the economy through wider use of ICTs, creating a single European information space and aims at achieving an inclusive Euopean information society. The aim of the European ICT surveys is to collect and disseminate harmonised and compa- rable information on the use of Information and Communication Technologies in households and by individuals and in enterprises at European level. Data for this collection are supplied directly from the surveys with no separate treatment. Regional breakdowns are only available for households and individuals and have been pro- vided on a voluntary basis for 2006 and 2007. Starting from 2008, NUTS 1 is to be reported on an obligatory basis (hence by all countries), whereas NUTS level 2 is still optional. Re- gional data have been reported by a number of countries for the following indicators: \u2022 Households with access to the Internet at home \u2022 Households with broadband connection \u2022 Individuals regularly using the Internet \u2022 Individuals who have never used a computer \u2022 Individuals who ordered goods or services over the Internet for private use 13 13 13 13.2. .2. .2. .2.

General presentation The Urban Audit is a response to the growing demand for an assessment of the quality of life in European cities , where a significant proportion of European Union citizens live. The Urban Audit is a joint effort by the Directorate-General for Regional Policy (DG REGIO) and Eurostat to provide reliable and comparative information on selected urban areas in Member States of the European Union, in candidate countries, in Switzerland and Norway. Comparison of cities by regional, national and European agencies as well as between the cities themselves, according to their position in Europe (central \u2013 peripheral; North \u2013 South) and certain developments in different areas (economic activity, employment, public trans- port, education level etc.) as well as disparities within cities are very useful, not to say cru- cial, for policy measures. In the Urban Audit project, Eurostat has been responsible for coordinating the flow of Urban Audit data at the European level. Contact address (e-mail): Estat-Urban-Audit@ec.europa.eu In terms of organisation, the national Coordinators at the NSOs have been an essential link between the cities and Eurostat. Much data already existed at the NSOs in their databases or in administrative registers available to them. The remaining part of the data had to be collected from the cities. Spatial levels Data have been collected on four spatial levels: (cid:3) the Core City (C) according to the administrative definition, as the basic level, (cid:3) the Larger Urban Zone (LUZ) being an approximation of the functional urban zone centred around the city, and ",
        "Detailed description of the Urban Audit database Regional and Urban Statistics Reference Guide 2010 204 3 (cid:3) the Kernel (K) was created for some capital cities where the concept of the \u201cAdminis- trative City\u201d does not yield comparable spatial units 1 (cid:3) the Sub-City District (SCD) being a subdivision of the city according to population criteria. The selection of participating cities and the definition of the composition of the LUZ and the SCD in terms of spatial units had to meet certain criteria: (cid:5) the participating cities in each country should represent about 20% of the population in that country, (cid:5) the participating cities should reflect a good geographic distribution within the coun- try (peripheral, central), (cid:5) coverage should reflect a sufficient number of medium-sized cities (medium-sized cit- ies having a population of 50 000 \u2013 250 000 inhabitants, large cities with >250 000), (cid:5) data should be available and comparable. This \u201csampling\u201d procedure for the Urban Audit project was closely and specifically designed by Eurostat, DG REGIO, the NSOs and the cities in the countries. The final selection of par- ticipating cities in the Urban Audit represents a compromise between all aspects. Cities have, as local councils or governments, most of the responsibility for managing urban change. Very often, they are service providers, and develop and maintain the infrastructure; the relevant local administration is empowered to run the city. In this respect, it is clear that information is available at an administrative level. More than this, urban areas also have an impact on surrounding areas in terms of commuting, job concentration, traffic systems etc. In this way, there is also a need for clearly defined functional urban regions and de- mand for information on these larger urban entities, including the hinterland. The definition of the Larger Urban Zone, which corresponds to an estimate of the Functional Urban Region (FUR), is a complex issue. The definition of FURs varies according to the na- tional and local context, although the FUR is very often identified as being an employment zone or a commuting area. There are variables for which the core city is relevant (for example provision of services for the inhabitants of the city) and others for which only the LUZ makes sense (for example GDP). There are also variables (such as crime, by way of example) which are difficult to ren- der comparable from one country to another or from city to city. Statistics at a sub-city level are more a matter for the cities themselves. The bigger the city, the more relevant such statistics, as there are likely to be significant intra-city disparities. 1) Applying the concept of the \u201cAdministrative City\u201d does not always yield comparable spatial units. \u201cGreater London\u201d for example (as classified at the NUTS level 1 region UKI) has a population of 7.2 Mio inhabitants, whereas \u201cParis\u201d (as classified at the NUTS level 3 region FR101) has a popu- lation of 2.1 Mio inhabitants. To facilitate better comparison between the largest cities in Europe, an additional spatial unit, the \u201cKernel\u201d has been developed for some capital cities. Please note that the \u201cKernel\u201d corresponds to a different spatial hierarchy in the cities. ",
        "Detailed description of the Urban Audit database Regional and Urban Statistics Reference Guide 2010 205 3 This is also the level with which the public will identify, as it corresponds to neighbourhoods with their own individual characteristics. The approach of collecting data from existing sources makes it difficult and sometimes im- possible to achieve comparability of variables over the entire \"population\". The National Ur- ban Audit Coordinators did their best to achieve comparability of urban data, at least within their own country. Wherever it was not possible, attempts were made to estimate the data; where this has been achieved it is noted in the database with a flag or free-text in the meta- data of the UA database. Participating cities 322 cities in 27 Member States, plus 47 cities from Switzerland, Norway, Croatia and Tur- key, are represented in the urban data collection. The first two letters of the code indicate the country of a given city. ",

The list of participating cities was agreed bilaterally with the Member States. In the Large City Audit a reduced number of variables (see table in the section titled \"Variables\") are collected at the core city level for the reference years 2001 and 2004. Variables Nine different areas of variables have been defined. The coding enables the content to be pinpointed. The first two letters of the variables plus the following digit make for easy con- tent identification.

        "Detailed description of the Urban Audit database Regional and Urban Statistics Reference Guide 2010 212 3 Indicators The indicators have been calculated by Eurostat based on the variable data set. The exact calculation algorithms are listed below with the detailed table description. For indicators, only the reference periods in the TIME dimension are indicated. There are no reference years in the INFO dimension, as the indicators are not necessarily calculated from variables of the same year; this depended on their availability. Beginning of 2010 Eurostat introduced variables and indicators relating to the city hinter- land , i.e. larger urban zone minus core city. Reference periods Four reference periods have been defined for the data set: 1989 \u2013 1993 1994 \u2013 1998 1999 \u2013 2002 2003 \u2013 2006 These periods have been created for ease of data comparison \u2013 especially for the indicators \u2013 even if not all the data could be collected for the same year. 2004 and 2001 are the reference years for the main data collection, 1996 and 1991 for the \"historical\" data collection. The preferences for the reference period (depending on availabil- ity) have been fixed as t, t+1, t-1, (t+2, t-2) (t = 2004, 2001, 1996 or 1991). Perception survey The citizen\u2019s perception of the quality of life within \u201ctheir\u201d city is important information. Per- ception indicators are the result of opinion polls among a representative random sample of inhabitants of the city in question. Collecting information on perception indicators remains a costly operation despite the adop- tion of a sample survey and the use of telephone interviews as the data collection method. This explains why the perception survey was limited to a selection of interesting topics for the Urban Audit. It is also the reason why only some Urban Audit Cities were chosen. This situation may change in the future if close co-operation with the cities is established. The following perception indicators were reported in the Urban Audit: 1. Perception of integration of foreigners 2. Perception of housing market 3. Perception of health services 4. Perception of safety in the city 5. Perception of employment opportunities 6. Perception of financial well-being 7. Perception of the quality of local administration services 8. Perception of education quality 9. Perception of education facilities 10. Perception of air quality 11. Perception of green space provision ",
        "Detailed description of the Urban Audit database Regional and Urban Statistics Reference Guide 2010 213 3 12. Perception of the public transport quality 13. Perception of the quality of the ICT infrastructure 14. Perception of the quality and quantity of cultural facilities 15. Perception of the quality and quantity of sports facilities In 2004 the survey was carried out in 31 cities of the 15 EU Member States with a repre- sentative sample of 300 citizens. In 2006 the survey was carried out in 75 cities of the 27 EU Member States, Turkey and Croatia with a representative sample of 500 citizens. End of 2009 the survey was again carried out in the same cities as 2006, with the same sample size. This time some questions were dropped and some other questions added (not listed yet under \"C. Perception data\"). 2.

Data sources Most of the urban statistics variable data have been sent by National Statistical Offices. The indicator tables have been calculated by Eurostat, based on the variables. 4. Legal basis All data supply of urban statistics is based on a voluntary agreement, as there is no Com- munity legislation yet on this topic. 5.
