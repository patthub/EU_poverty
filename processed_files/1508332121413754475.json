C ontrary to popular opinion, it is men and not women who have major problems with the concept of combining work outside the home with family responsibilities. Having a life and responsibilities both inside and outside the home demands no new psychological somersaults from women. After all, they have been managing both for years. This is not to say that women have no problems at all in this regard. But their problems are mainly concerned with the volume of work they are faced with Wendy O'Conghaile, who is responsible for coordinating women's issues in the Foundation's programmes, looks at the Foundation's past, present and future work in this area. and the discrimination they often encounter especially in access to training or career development. This could be considerably reduced if men were able to take a greater share of domestic responsibilities and could learn how to integrate working and living. This may be a radical perspective but is likely to gain more currency in the future as the population ages, more women become active in the labour market, and in civic society, and men and women generally become more concerned about achieving a balanced life style which is multi dimensional and does not make home life and life outside the home mutually exclusive.

        "EUROPEAN FOUNDATION FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF LIVING AND WORKING CONDITIONS Improvement of Living and Working Conditions is its ability to look at living and working conditions in an integrated way. However, in framing its 1989-92 programme, the Foundation might appear to have neglected the issues surrounding equal opportunities between men and women and the gender implications of developments in living and working trend towards a service- oriented economy; the ageing of the population and increasing diversity and disparity in lifestyles and standards of living; the increased awareness of environmental issues; and the growing aspirations for greater involvement in the processes of debate and decision making in society. The 1989-92 programme was in this newsletter show. In order to strengthen the gender perspectives in its work and to highlight better its contribution to the study of equal opportunities for women and men, the Foundation decided at the end of 1989 to take a number of steps: - to commission a review of its current and conditions in the European Community. Naturally, as half of the Community's population, women are concerned and affected by the processes of social and economic change identified in the Foundation's programme. These include major economic restructuring and increasing flexibility in the labour market with persistently high rates of unemployment, and the built around these major changes and comprises six themes. They focus on industrial relations, new forms of work, health and safety, environment, living conditions and new technology. No area of the programme is devoted specifically to women's issues. Nevertheless it is clear that much of the Foundation's current work does relate closely to the issues affecting the quality of women's lives as the articles planned work in order to assess how it is dealing with women's issues and how this could be improved;* - to allocate special responsibility for women's issues across all themes of its programmes to one programme manager; - to publicise better what it is already doing; - to commission, where possible, additional work within existing resources to strengthen the gender dimension in on-going studies; - to strengthen and develop contacts with those responsible for women's issues and the development of equal opportunities at international/European and national levels. Over the past year this has meant that the Foundation has been increasingly active in drawing out the women's issues from its work. Working with my colleagues in the Foundation I have been able to assess and highlight the issues of concern to women in the different programmes. This has led to a comprehensive presentation of the Foundation's work in an address to the European Parliament's Committee on Women's Rights and to strengthen contacts with the I Commission services dealing s with equal opportunities between men and women. It has also been possible for me to participate in a number of international seminars and conferences relating to women's issues, such as at the International Healthy Cities Symposium on Women, Health and Urban Policies in Vienna and the WHO/UNEP conference on Action for Public Health and Supportive Environments in Sundsvall, Sweden.

        "EUROPEAN FOUNDATION FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF LIVING AND WORKING CONDITIONS was represented at the seminar to launch the third EC Equality Action Programme organized by the Irish Council for the Status of Women and contributed data to the second Commission on the Status of Women in Ireland to assist the Commission in drawing up its recommendations to the Irish Government. Review of the Foundation's Work 1985-92 and its Implications for Women representatives of the Foundation's Administrative Board pointed to the need to incorporate the gender dimensions of any programme from the very earliest stages. In the context of the rapid political, social and economic change to be Dublin was the venue where the 1990 Woman of Europe was awarded to Dr. Niki Goulandris by President Mary Robinson and the Foundation hosted a dinner to mark the occasion. In July the Women's Rights Committee of the Irish Parliament visited the Foundation for an exchange of information. Over the coming year, the Foundation will be developing its programme for 1993-96. In approving the faced in the coming decade there was also considerable support for the idea of a more specific allocation of resources in the future to work specifically focusing on women's issues. In the development of any new programme on women, the Foundation will take account of its specific role and capacity, especially its ability to deal with living and working conditions in an integrated way. As a member of the Council of Europe subcommittee on family affairs commented during a recent visit to the Foundation, \"Women have already managed to combine work and home; now we have to make men do it\". * Review of European Foundation Studies 1985- 1992 and its Implications for Women.

All publications (except where otherewise indicated) are available nationally W o m en on t he m o ve A recently published Foundation report, Mobility and Social Cohesion in the European Community - A Forward Look, draws attention to the role of mobility in women's changing lives and aspirations. In general, women tend to have lower mobility than men, owing to their gender and social roles, which affect all areas of their life-style, not merely their travel circumstances. Earlier Foundation research on commuting had pointed to women as tending to travel shorter distances to work, more likely to be dependent on public transport and often combining travel to work journeys with other purposes, eg. escorting children, shopping and other service functions. It also confirmed a higher incidence of reported health complaints among women travellers, particularly related to stress. This more recent report supports the importance of these issues and extends the analysis indicating the disadvantages sometimes experienced by female migrants in relation to residence and work permits. Since many women enter Member States as dependents or tourists rather than as workers in their own rights, they have greater problems than men. The way in which women's residential and employment mobility is usually constrained by the nature of their family responsibilities is also covered. Housewives returning to part time work increase their daily travel by 30%. (cont 'd. Pg - ",
        "EUROPEAN FOUNDATION FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF LIVING AND WORKING CONDITIONS (fromPg3) The relationship between transport, mobility and work underlines the different constraints on men and women in obtaining and retaining a job. By changing the content of their lives, women place new demands on the built environment and on transport provisions. Urban zoning and service decentralisation policies have tended to add to women's mobility difficulties. United Kingdom research has shown that women could substantially increase their work incomes if they were able to commute beyond the local area and that they are constrained from doing so by gender role activity constraints rather than travel costs. In addition to the impact of their family role and their greater dependency on public forms of transport, women also face the problems of coping with children while travelling and a growing fear of physical assault or sexual harassment. Such fears prevent some women from travelling, particularly by public transport. In this research, the Foundation is pointing to the need for the mobility issue to be taken into account in policies aimed at equal opportunities and improved social and economic cohesion. Its work to date indicates that mobility issues are central to many of the problems of social exclusion and marginalization faced by disadvantaged women. E vidence of the significant role being played by women in action to improve the quality of life at local level is emerging from the Foundation's research on \"Coping with social and economic change at neighbourhood level\". Important gender differences exist in the role the neighbourhood plays in the everyday life of men and women. Many aspects of women's work, paid and unpaid, are located in and around the local neighbourhood and women appear to have a much wider variety of local contacts. Where there is poverty it is women, particularly those with children, who have to manage the day-to-day pressures. Local projects based in the community can help lessen the vulnerability and dependence of women : by providing access to education and training; by organizing child care and family support services, and by fostering the personal growth and development of women (Social Change and Local Action: coping with disadvantage in urban areas, published by the Foundation in 1990). Examples of local projects, such as Helping Hands and the Women's Contact Centre in Tallaght, Ireland and Thamesmead's Meet a Mum Association in the U.K., have been included in the Foundation's field research underway in seven Member States to examine the role of community action in improving the quality of life in disadvantaged urban areas. What is also becoming evident, however, is that women are not only amongst the beneficiaries of local action, but they often also play an important initiating role in grassroots self-help projects. But the more formal the organization, the less likely women are to participate or to occupy key, particularly paid, positions. Perhaps what we are seeing is a continued perception in voluntary activity of women's role as unpaid workers/carers, an additional element of invisibility in women's contribution to the economy and society. Is women's involvement in local action a response to the disproportionate burden placed on them by the lack of appropriate services and the unequal sharing of care responsibilities? Or is it the influence of the women's movement, which has encouraged amongst women a more widespread recognition of the need to take action on issues affecting them and the benefits of doing so? The Foundation's work shows there may be significant differences in women's role, its origins and its visibility in the various Member States, particularly between northern and southern Europe. ",
        "EUROPEAN FOUNDATION FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF LIVING AND WORKING CONDITIONS In 1991 the Foundation will undertake further analysis of the field surveys of households, community organizations and policy makers, to look more closely at the role of women in bettering the life of their local communities. Many women have clearly shown a concern and willingness to work for improvements in their localities. Given this, policies aimed at facilitating and resourcing local action should acknowledge and take account of this contribution, and assist it to emerge and develop. Women's access to more formal qualifications, associated with entry to the paid jobs in local action, could be increased. The domestic and family obligations preventing some women from participating in local initiatives should also be acknowledged and the needs of such women Finally, the links between the unpaid contribution of women to community life and women's disadvantaged position in the labour market would bear closer examination. For women coping with poverty in disadvantaged urban areas, these may be two sides of the same coin. Results of this programme will be available in 1992 when a major conference on Citizen Action : Involving People at Local Level will be held at the Foundation. CARING POR GRANNY - but who cares ? The Community's Social Charter and the Action Programme of the Commission reflect the widespread debate - among social partners, governments and voluntary organizations - about women as care providers. This is overwhelmingly a debate about childcare and its implications for women's equal access to the labour market. But the context for care is changing with the falling birth rates and a growing number of older people who need support and care. One assessment is that the average carer now spends 16 years looking after children but 17 years supporting parents. In the UK, it is estimated that there are 3.5 million women caring for older people, i.e. twice the number of mothers of children under the age of 5! The family is the main provider of care. In general, studies show that two- thirds or more of all carers of older people are women. Most carers are from the family of the dependent person, tending to be first the spouse, then daughter and daughter-in-law. There is a good deal of information now available in some Member States about the role and situation of family carers. Data are notably lacking from Southern Europe, although the pattern of community care, mainly by female relatives, appears the same. There are important differences between countries in household composition, attitudes, development of services and policies to support carers. The Foundation's current project on 'family care' is seeking to fill some of the gaps in information about the problems and perspectives of carers, and to look specifically at the development or otherwise of policies and services designed to support carers. Quite a lot is known about the needs of carers - for recognition, respite care, financial, emotional and practical support; much less is known about how to support these carers sensitively and effectively. There is a continuing debate about whether women carers in the community are less likely than men in the same situation to receive support from formal services. Many case studies indicate that service providers do have different attitudes to, and expectations of, women. But there is little material directly on this, and differences cannot be inferred readily from the data on use of services. The near future is bound up with considerations on the one hand about the availability of women as carers (demography, divorce, residential, mobility, changing attitudes), and on the other hand with needs of and for women in employment. A 1989 survey by 'opportunities for women' estimated that in the UK, 500,000 women with children wanted to return to work compared with \u00cc .75m of those caring for adults. Employment policy is an issue for today; there are three million worker/carers in the UK alone. The tensions between employment and caring are not going to diminish. Improving the quality of life for the carers, as well as the cared-for, will demand more recognition of women's work, both in the home and in the place of paid employment. Initial results from this Foundation study should be available from the end of 1991. ",
        "EUROPEAN FOUNDATION FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF LIVING AND WORKING CONDITIO Who makes the decisions ? One of the key conclusions of the E.C. conference Women and the Completion of the Internal Market (Dublin, February 1990) was that increased participation by women in the decision-making process - in work, trade unions, political parties, government departments and the media - become a central objective of the Third Programme for Equal Opportunities. The Foundation sees participation as an important vehicle for improving the quality of life, especially working life, and has completed a significant volume of work in this area. Although the gender aspect was not specifically targetted in this work, it appears that participation by women in collective bargaining and other forms of social dialogue tends to be low. This raises the question of whether issues critical to women (e.g. low pay, childcare provisions, welfare dependency, etc.) appear on the agenda for social dialogue at all. The Foundation has undertaken to ensure that its future research in this area will consider: . the extent of female participation in the different forms and processes of industrial relations, the agenda for social dialogue and the extent to which it reflects issues relevant to women workers in general, or specific groups of women workers or tackles issues of positive action for women . the degree and nature of involvement of women workers in representative organizations and participative structures in the process of consultation with regard to the introduction of new technologies and the possible barriers to such involvement, for example discontinuity of employment or relatively low level of labour force participation . the level and nature of participation of women workers in positive action experiences in firms, trade unions and other organizations and the evidence of innovations and experiences of dealing with issues of concern to women on the agenda for social dialogue and in industrial relations and participation at the workplace . the extent to which different actors or groups of actors in the arena of industrial relations are composed of an under or over representation of women and the implications of this for improvements in the quality of working life and the participation of women in certain key actor groups, for example management and design. Telewomen I n his \"Third Wave\" Alain Toffler emphasized the importance of the home as centre of society and production of the future. This would have a particular interest for women as they could combine their professional and private life at one place. The profile of women teleworkers in Europe was highlighted in an important research report of the Foundation, \"Women and New Technologies\" while a survey undertaken in five EC countries gave indications about the future of telework. The women interviewed in the Foundation's survey were interested in teleworking because it offered independence and flexibility, a reduction in commuting, and the opportunity to spend more hours with the family and the children. The main disadvantages reported were the absence of legal protection, the social isolation and the intrusion of the work into family life. A recent conference, entitled \"Women, Work and Computerization\", at which Voula Mega (a Foundation research manager) participated, was organized at the initiative of the International Federation for International Processing (Helsinki, 30 June - 2 July 1991). Interesting case studies on telework from Canada and Australia were reported. One of the most interesting points concerned the potential for combining homework ",
        "EUROPEAN FOUNDATION FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF LIVING AND WORKING CONDITIONS with childcare, as well as the vulnerability and insecurity of teleworkers. The teleworkers' isolation, it was suggested could be reduced by networking, information campaigns and union organizing. The main conclusions of the Helsinki conference were: \u2022 in the new technological era and the transition from economies of scale into economies of scope and increasing diversity, new methods of organizing working life have to be implemented in order to help women to overcome attitudinal and cultural obstacles on the way to the use reintegrate emotional and intellectual work and to build support for enabling and empowering those who traditionally have been left out of technological development. how are women faring? A typical work - does it have special implications for women? The Foundation has set itself the task of finding out, and is basing its investigation on the data derived from its survey of practical experiences with part-time work, fixed-term of new technologies; \u2022 participative design methods, which require greater communication skills (in which women excel) have to be adopted in order to \u2666 Director's Note \u2666 Developments in Europe - the completion of the internol market, the adoption of a charter of fundamental social rights and an action programme to implement it, the launch of the third equality action programme, the creation of new Community agencies, as well as the changing geographical shape of the Community - all have stimulated the Foundation into taking a renewed look at its role and its priorities. As part of this assessment of its work programmes The Foundation is casting a critical look at how far women's interests have been taken into account. Articles in this newsletter show that much has already been achieved in this area. Contacts at European level with the Women's Rights Committee of the European Parliament and the Commission's ' Equal Opportunities' division, and at national level, such as the visit to the Foundation of the Irish Parliament's Committee on Women's Rights, are proving invaluable in identifying how a gender perspective can be best integrated into the Foundation's future work. Having worked in this area for the past twenty years and having seen what can and must be achieved, this is for me personally a most welcome development. contracts, Saturday work and evening work. A first comprehensive analysis of the data was presented at a European round table in Brussels on 22 March 1991. Debating the findings, participants (representatives of the social partners, national governments, the Community institutions and international organizations) endorsed the general thrust and suggested issues for further analysis. One of these has now become the focus of a specialized secondary analysis of the data: are there potential advantages or disadvantages associated with atypical forms of work which have special relevance for women? Because of the nature of the survey - where management representatives and employee representatives were interviewed not as individuals butas representatives of their function or constituents - the answers to these questions are not as straightforward as one might wish. The Foundation has called together a small study group to investigate methods of analysis which would allow for definition of the issues, e.g. - to compare opinions of managers and employee representatives in establishments with a high percentage of female staff to establishments with a high percentage of male staff - to compare opinions of female employee representatives with opinions of male employee representatives ",
        "EUROPEAN FOUNDATION FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF LIVING AND WORKING CONDITIONS - to compare results in branches which have typically a high precentage of female staff to branches which are more typically \"male\" branches - to select branches with typically high percentage of female staff and compare the opinions of female staff representatives to the opinions of male staff representatives - to analyse further all questions in the questionnaires with a view to selecting those which have an identifiable women's dimension and look at the answers to these questions specifically to see if there are differences between branches, countries, \u00a1ob content, qualifications, etc. In other words, there are promising avenues for further analysis. The results will be reported in due course in NEWS. For the moment, interested readers may obtain a summary of first results of analysis (which are not yet gender- specific) by writing to the Information Officer of the Foundation. Nightworking Women Why do women work at night? Because they want to? Because they have to? Demographic, economic, cultural and social trends, as well as the general relaxation of legal restrictions, have led to an increase in the opportunities for night work open to women. Some of the reasons they avail of these opportunities reflect a lack of choice, such as no day work available or the type of work is only available at night. Other reasons reflect a positive choice, i.e. unusual free time during the day, higher earnings, more time for family and homework. Even the more positive reasons for working at night, however, can have negative aspects. Financial bonuses may have to be spent on buying a car to ensure safe commuting at night, and the car may end up costing more than the extra earnings. More time for home and family responsibilities may be achieved at a cost to necessary day\u00adtime sleep. Some of the different working conditions obtaining to night work can have great appeal: more responsibility at work; greater freedom from supervisors; better atmosphere at work. But an important characteristic associated with nightwork is that of fear. A study by De Lange*, cited in de Haan and Jansen**, gives figures for percentages of male and female staff experiencing fear on evening and night shifts in health care services. Although these facts are not easy to interpret, the main point is obvious : fear occurs in shiftwork, is worse at night, is worse for women, and is worst in travelling to work. What can be done about it? The minimum is certainly to be aware that fear exists, take whatever steps are possible to counteract it (e.g. better lighting, better transport arrangements, closer car\u00ad parks, etc.) and remain sensitive to the genuine fears that people may develop. * De Lange WAM.
