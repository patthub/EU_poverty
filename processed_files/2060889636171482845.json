        "your FrEE accEss to EuroPEan statistics \u2013 thE Eurostat wEbsitE Eurostat provides free access to its data. It publishes harmonised statistics on the European Union (EU) and the euro area and offers a comparable, reliable and objective portrayal of social and economic trends. Eurostat collects data from national statistical authorities according to EU-wide methodologies. Data are, therefore, genuinely comparable. EU data may be analysed by country or by region, and many data sets also include information relating to the candidate countries and other non-member countries too. Free access to all tables and databases. There are two main ways to access Eurostat\u2019s data: - look for Tables containing data for selected indicators from the nine statistical themes and EU policy indicators; - use more sophisticated tools (Eurostat\u2019s Data Explorer) for extracting user-defined queries from Databases. To discover more, open a web browser and go to the Eurostat homepage at: ec.europa.eu/eurostat. To access data, click on the link to the Statistics Database that is presented in the top- left of the homepage. Alternatively, from any other web page on Eurostat\u2019s website, the database can be accessed in one click (using the database icon at the right-hand end of the top menu bar). It is also possible to access the tables and databases for a par- ticular statistical theme or subject, click on the \u2018Statistics\u2019 tab in the top menu bar and then se- lect the subject of inter- est; each of these has its own dedicated section on Eurostat\u2019s website and the vast majority of these have links to relevant tables and da- tabases. Methodological documents, structured according to the Euro SDMX Metadata Structure (ESMS) provide supporting information on aspects such as data collection methods, data treatment, classifications and definitions. The metadata also covers aspects such as data coverage, frequency of data release, quality, relevance, accuracy and reliability, coherence, and revision policies. tablEs Tables are pre-defined insofar as the user cannot select additional indicators. All the tables on Eurostat\u2019s website open using an application called TGM (Tables, Graphs and Maps). Tables are split into two main sections in the Data Navigation Tree \u2013 Tables by themes and Tables on EU policy. The tables on EU policy are of particular interest as they often cut across topical subjects: Short-term indicators (euro-indicators) provide an overview of recent economic developments within the euro area, EU and Member States. The indicators include: balance of payments, business and consumer surveys; external trade; industry, commerce and services; the labour market; monetary and financial indicators; national accounts; and consumer prices. Structural indicators provide an instrument for assessing the progress made with respect to the European Union\u2019s growth and jobs strategy: general economic background; employment; economic reform; innovation and research; social cohesion; and the environment. Sustainable development indicators monitor the progress being made in relation to the quality of life and well-being for present and future generations, through the efficient use of resources, while tapping into the ecological and social innovation potential of the economy, ensuring prosperity, environmental protection and social cohesion: socio-economic development; sustainable consumption and production; social inclusion; demographic DatabasEs Data can also be viewed from multi-dimensional databases \u2013 using the Data Explorer. Most databases on the Eurostat website include: a geographical dimension (countries, regions or cities); indicators; time; and measurement units (for example, euro, %, physical units); as well as a series of flags (for example, identifying estimates or forecasts). There may be a variety of other dimensions depending on the specific data set in question (for example, breakdowns by gender, age, or type of economic activity/sector). The Data Explorer The Data Explorer is a tool which allows users to select across all dimensions of a database. It allows the user to build user-defined queries and then to structure the results as cross-tabulations which may be based on two, three or four dimensions. The Data Explorer allows these user-defined selections to be saved using Internet bookmarks \u2013 which can be set to display either static or dynamic tabulations. The latter provides users with the possibility to set-up a tabulation with a certain number of time periods, and then to update tabulation when new information is available, while maintaining the structure of the table. The Data Explorer also provides tools for making extractions \u2013 these can be saved in similar formats to those produced by TGM. More advanced functions are available to users who register on the website \u2013 for example, larger extractions, bulk downloads, or a wider variety of file formats for exporting data. External trade data Highly aggregated data on external trade can be viewed and extracted through Eurostat\u2019s standard database utilities. However, Eurostat collects detailed information concerning the external trade of the EU and trade between the Member States which covers over 10 000 products that are traded with more than 250 partner countries, compiled on a monthly basis. This detailed data can be extracted using a specific application for external trade and production statistics (Comext). othEr intErFacEs There are two other data-related interfaces available directly from the Eurostat homepage. Country profiles This interface allows a wide range of indicators to be compared across two countries (or geographical areas); it shows the latest data in a summary table. Within the table, hyperlinks to the TGM utility are provided for each of the indicators, allowing users to access a wider range of information, such as a full set of country information or lengthier time-series. Within the country profiles interface, the choice of countries and the statistical themes is set by the user. The Business Cycle Clock (BCC) This is a graphical interface for displaying key economic indicators. Its aim is to help users understand the pattern of economic developments within an economy over time (through studying upturns and downswings in economic activity) \u2013 the business cycle. The BCC covers a wide range of indicators, such as GDP, consumption, investment, exports and imports, (un-) employment, economic sentiment, industrial production, industrial new orders, inflation, labour costs, producer prices, production in construction, and deflated retail sales. These indicators are seen to move in close proximity to each other, although some are leading (for example, economic sentiment), while others tend to lag (for example, unemployment). changes; public health; climate change and energy; transport; natural resources; global partnership; and good governance. Employment and social policy indicators present data that can be used to monitor and report progress in relation to the following policies and strategies: the European employment strategy (EES); the open method of coordination on social inclusion and social protection; the education and training programme 2010; and i2010 \u2013 a European information society for growth and employment. The TGM interface TGM is a self-contained interface used for viewing, printing and downloading data which runs in a web browser. The interface allows users to define the style of graphs and maps, and to save these using bookmarks. Tables: display data; allow users to show (or hide) footnotes/ flags, labels and codes; provide different options for saving data (MS Excel, HTML, XML or TSV); allow the information to be printed. Graphs: provides a range of graph types; select data based on the underlying main table; customisation of axis scales and sorting of values. Maps: choice of styles; user-defined classes for map shading; inclusion of geographical features such as rivers; navigational tools to focus on a particular country or region. usEr suPPort Support for Internet users Eurostat and the other members of the European statistical system, have set-up a system of user support centres for Internet users. These exist in nearly all of the Member States, as well as some candidate and EFTA countries. For the best possible and personalised support, requests should always be addressed to the relevant support centre whose mission is to provide additional, and free-of-charge, help and guidance to users who are having difficulty in finding the statistical data they require.
