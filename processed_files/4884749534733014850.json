I should like the provisions of Rule 25(2) relating to questions put to our institution to be respected, i.e. for answers to be given within the time, limits set out in this Rule. President. \u2014 Your statement has been noted, Mr Pan- nella. Every effort will be made to respect these dead lines. The Bureau will consider the question you raised this week. ",
        "No 1-286/2 Debates of the European Parliament 14.6. 82 2. Agenda President. \u2014 At its meeting of 11 May 1982 the enlarged Bureau drew up the draft agenda which has been distributed. At their meeting this morning the chairmen of the polit ical groups instructed me to submit several amend ments to the House. (The President read the amendments to Monday's and Tuesday's agenda) 1 I call Mr Moreau. Mr Moreau. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, if I have under stood you correctly, the Bureau has reversed the order of debate but is the Hopper report still on the agenda and will.it be debated in the presence of the represent ative of the Council? Colleselli report (Doc. 1-278/82). We have got a pro cedural problem here, I believe, because the Colleselli report is based on proposals that were published by the Commission on 15 October. The Committee on Agri culture decided to go ahead and draw up a report on these proposals, only to be later informed by the Com mission that they had now been withdrawn. We have got an assurance from Commissioner Dalsager that we will be consulted on the new proposal which is now coming forward from the Commission. I would submit to Parliament, Mr President, that we would get ourselves into procedural difficulties if Par liament were to go ahead and adopt the Colleselli report at this time when in fact we should be waiting until we get the new proposals from the Commission. I therefore ask you to refer it back to the Committee on Agriculture, and I would hope that we would be able to deal with it as urgently as possible. Indeed I hope we will get some support in the House to get it through as urgently as possible, because I have got a lot of sympathy for the wine producers. President. \u2014 That is correct, Mr Moreau. The Hop per report will be taken together with Mr Tindemans's statement on the Belgian Presidency. The report will therefore be included in the discussion but the resolu tion will be put to the vote. Mr Moreau. \u2014 The vote on the resolution will take place on Wednesday? President. \u2014 Mr Provan, I think your request is a very sensible one. But so far I only heard that the Commis sion and the Council insist that the report bv Mr Col leselli (Doc. 1-278/82) is urgent. So if different propos als from the one before us now are being put forward I shall gladly follow your advice. But I have to ask the Commission first if that is the case. I call the Commission. President. \u2014 That is correct. I call Mr Hopper. Mr Hopper. \u2014 Mr President, do I understand, there fore, that the Hopper report will be part of the second debate on organizational problems and that it will definitely begin at 3 o'clock; in other words, that the first debate will not be allowed to spill over into the afternoon? Mr Andriessen, Member of the Commission. \u2014 (NL) Mr President, I can say little more than that the Commission would greatly appreciate the report being dealt with in compliance with the wish expressed this morning and on previous occasions. President. \u2014 Mr Andriessen, the question was whether the Commission has put forward or intends to put forward other proposals as Mr Provan's suggests. President. \u2014 It is not quite possible to fix the timing because the groups have a certain sovereignty, but your understanding about our intentions, Mr Hopper, is perfect. I call Mr Provan. Mr Provan. \u2014 Mr President, I hope that I can assist you slightly with the log jam that is obviously develop ing in your agenda. Not for the first time we have wine as one of the sub jects on our agenda today. I refer to item No 100, the Mr Andriessen, Member of the Commission. \u2014 (NL) The latter is not the case, Mr President. President. \u2014 Mr Provan asked that the Colleselli report should be sent back to the Committee on Agri culture. I have to honour that request. We can allow one speaker for and one against. I call Mr Gautier. Mr Gautier. \u2014 I just have one question for the Com mission. See Minutes. President. \u2014 I am afraid it is too late. ",
        "14.6. 82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/3 Mr Gautier. \u2014 Why? I am familiar with the Rules of Procedure. When one Commissioner says one thing and another something else, it would be interesting to hear what the Commission as a college says. President. \u2014 I assume, Mr Gautier, that the Commis sion speaks with one voice and that Mr Andriessen has spoken on behalf of the Commission. Mr Provan moved that the report be referred back to committee. I call the Committee on Agriculture. Mr Curry, chairman of the Committee. \u2014 Mr Presi dent, at the meeting on 25 May, Commissioner Dalsa ger undertook to forward the new documents on the wine policy to the Committee on Agriculture. May I inform you that last Thursday, three weeks after that meeting, one copy in French and two copies in Italian arrived at the Committee on Agriculture's secretariat in Luxembourg. Therefore, if the Commission treats this as a matter of urgency, it should have demon strated more urgency by itself despatching the neces sary documents to Parliament. I would suggest, Mr President, that it would be poss ible for this item to be placed on the agenda of the committee meeting next week, that we could conse quently vote, with your permission, at a special meet ing on the Monday of the July part-session and still deal with this matter in the July part-session if that meets with the approval of the House. President. \u2014 You spoke in favour of referral back to the Committee in view of developments that have taken place. I call Mr Sutra. Parliament to deliver its opinion to the Commission and Council of Ministers. If we now fail to debate the Colleselli report we shall be in effect refusing to give information to the Council and Commission and one of the three institutions will be absent from the decision-making process. There would then be no new report on the wine-growing sector and I know that is what some Members want. Since they have lost in the debate on the substance of the isssue they are now trying to win through a proce dural dispute. The Committee on Agriculture reached a decision a fortnight ago: it decided to discuss the report and went on to do so. It took a lengthy vote on all the amendments and today Mr Colleselli is intro ducing his report on behalf of the Committee on Agri culture with all the amendments which have already been adopted. I therefore ask for the agenda to remain unchanged, Mr President. (Mrs Castle asked to speak on a point of order) President. \u2014 Not at this moment, Mrs Castle. We have just heard one speaker for and one speaker against the proposal. I do not think I can permit a point of order just before the vote as that would mean an additional speech for or against the proposal. (Parliament approved the proposal to refer the report back to committee) I call Mrs Castle on a point of order. Mrs Castle. \u2014 It is now too late. My point of order concerned the vote. Mr Sutra. \u2014 (FR) I am surprised by this discussion to the extent that it has taken place once before and the Members of the Committee on Agriculture, such as my friend James Provan or the new chairman David Curry, were present and know how strongly I had to protest in the Committee on Agriculture against what I described as dilatory manoeuvres when a Member of the Conservative Group continued the discussion even after he had been defeated in a vote. Our chairman, Mr Curry, then said to him: 'Mr Hord, the matter is closed; we have just voted and you have been beaten'. I am astonished to see the resumption of these dilatory manoeuvres. The Committee on Agriculture decided with full knowledge of the facts to consider the Colle selli report. It knew perfectly well how far work had progressed. It is true that there have been changes and proposals from the Committee dating back to Octo ber; we are acquainted with them and we felt that at this juncture following the Luxembourg compromise the Colleselli report provided a valid instrument for President. \u2014 I call Mr Forth. Mr Forth. \u2014 Mr President, I would like to oppose the proposals that you have made to change the agenda and I hope that you will submit them to the vote of the House, as I know you will. I do this partly because I think it totally confuses the substance of the agenda, but also because \u2014 and this is a very worrying trend \u2014 it is becoming clearer at each session that the chair men of groups are hijacking the agenda by sitting in secret, and making a substantial number of changes of which we are only appraised less than an hour before the sitting. This means that ordinary Members increas ingly have less facility to exercise their rights under Rule 56 to make further changes to the agenda. We are therefore left, as mere mortals, in the position of only reacting to what that secret conclave of chairmen has proposed and being unable to make positive pro posals to the agenda for ourselves. And therefore for that reason, if for no other, Mr President \u2014 and I ",
        "No 1-286/4 Debates of the European Parliament 14.6.82 Forth hope that you will bear this very much in mind \u2014 I would like to oppose, and I will vote against the changes that you have proposed to us for Tuesday's agenda. President. \u2014 Mr Forth, of course you are perfectly correct in saying that there was a different agenda proposed but you have to realize that that agenda was fixed a month ago and the Rules clearly state that it is the function of group chairmen to try to bring the agenda up-to-date if the need arises. It is quite clear that in the last month some decisions have been made concerning a number of issues on this agenda, and one of them is, shall we say, closely related to the Hopper report. It is now unavoidable that the President-in- Office of the Council should pronounce on some basic elements of the Hopper report and therefore this morning it was decided by the chairmen of the politi cal groups to include the Hopper report in the discus sion on the declaration of the President-in-Office of the Council. It seems to have a certain logic. You pro pose that we should not do so: that means that we have to vote on it. I have heard your voice; I need now one speaker for and one against. Mr Bangemann, you wish to speak against? Mr Bangemann. \u2014 I want to speak for, Mr President. As a point of order in advance I would like you to defend us against the charge of holding what was called a secret conclave of group chairmen, as some kind of Mafia. (Mixed reactions) Mr President, if I am accused of being stupid, I am quite happy about that. I accept that. But could you please defend the chairmen against this accusation? President. \u2014 Mr Bangemann, I never take non-serious allegations seriously. (Laughter) the only solution to all our difficulties would be for this House to agree to have a two-week part-session every month. That would give us enough time to dis cuss all the various subjects that interest individual Members. > But if we meet for only one week, we must have com promises. In this case, the compromise consists in Mr Hopper's report being included in the debate on Mr Tindemans's statement, especially as the President of the Commission will be referring to it and undoubt edly making a few remarks on the mandate of 30 May. I call on the House to endorse this reasonable pro posal. President. \u2014 Do you wish to speak against the motion, Mr von der Vring? Mr von der Vring. \u2014 (DE) Mr President, could you please help me out of a situation in which I shall other wise have to oppose this proposal. I simply wanted to ask you what we are supposed to be voting on now, because I did not understand everything you said. President. \u2014 Mr Forth moved that the agenda be rein stated as originally drawn up. The Bureau, however, felt that in view of the long statement which the Presi dent of the Commission was to make, it would be bet ter to reorganize the whole of the morning's debate. Mr von der Vring. \u2014 (DE) Mr President, you said 'as originally drawn up'. But I did not understand every thing you said after that. Perhaps you could remind us of all the amendments. I do not understand what we are to vote on now. Could you please make this abso lutely clear? (The President again read the amendments to Tuesday's agenda proposed by the Bureau) President. \u2014 I call Mr Balfe. Mr Bangemann. \u2014 (DE) At any rate, we have a pre liminary draft before us. It will and must be changed in the light of the events in the three weeks since it was drawn up. A proposal will then be submitted to the House. Parliament is completely free to accept or reject this proposal. If we are going to organize our debates during any part-session in such a way that all the committees are satisfied and if we are going to organize them in such a way that we finish at an appropriate time, which is also important for the press, we shall have to do some things which may not please some people. I too would prefer it if we could meet for two weeks every month and I have said in my group today that Mr Balfe. \u2014 Mr President, I think it is in the interests of all Members of this House to support this resolu tion if they are interested in Members of this House having any influence on the structure of debates. It seems to me that each month we come in here the departures proposed from the draft agenda get slightly bigger. We have also reached the point where Ques tion Time is being devalued. We now have Council questions not only appearing on Tuesday instead of Wednesday as they usually do, but the hour is also being changed. President. \u2014 Mr Balfe, there is no change in Question Time. It was proposed and has been withdrawn. You did not hear me propose it. ",
        "14.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/5 Mr Balfe. \u2014 Question Time is now from 5.30 p.m. to 7 p.m. on this agenda that I have. President. \u2014 That is different. Mr Balfe. \u2014 But none the less there has been a distinct trend to change the agenda quite substantially from the one that is first drafted and circulated. I think it would be a salutary lesson to the Bureau for this reso lution to be carried in order that they might show a little bit more decorum in future in the proposals they bring before the House. Because whilst some minor amendments are undoubtedly needed on occasion, I do feel that the Bureau is increasingly treating the House in a very cavalier fashion. I would invite them to support Mr Forth's motion. President. \u2014 I call Lady Elles on a point of order. (Protests from the Socialist Group) Lady Elles. \u2014 Mr President, I would like to point out to Mr Balfe that it is not the Bureau who alters the agenda or discusses the agenda. It is the chairmen of political groups together with the President. So would he kindly get his nomenclature right. President. \u2014 I call Mr Boyes. Mr Boyes. \u2014 I would like you to give a ruling, Mr President. I would like you to inform the House how you decide who can raise points of order at certain times. The leader of my group , Mrs Castle of the Brit ish Labour Party, tried to raise a point of order at a very similar time to which a vice-president of the Par liament, Lady Elles, raised her point of order. Could you tell me why one was allowed and one was not allowed? President. \u2014 Well, Mr Boyes, the answer is simple. The one caught my eye and the other did not. (Laughter) I put to the vote the proposal by Mr Forth to restore the former agenda. (...) (The vote was taken) The agenda as proposed will stand. Mr Cottrell. \u2014 Mr President, can we have an elec tronic check on this? President. \u2014 If you wish, but it was quite clear. We will vote by electronic vote to see whether we maintain the agenda on Tuesday as proposed now by the chair men of the political groups. (The result of the vote was confirmed) I call Mr Enright. Mr Enright. \u2014 Mr President, I am in no way criticiz ing your presidency because you always chair these sittings with brilliance, wit and incisivenees. I would nevertheless like to challenge the last ruling on the vote because it is utterly confusing for this House to vote twice on the same motion but have to vote Yes in order to get the result one way on one occasion and No in order to get exactly the same result on the second occasion. I would therefore suggest that the Noes would have won last time if only the Yeses from the previous vote had known that they should have voted No this time. President. \u2014 I call Mr Balfe. Mr Balfe. \u2014 A point of order, Mr President, which follows from Mr Boyes's point of order. I distinctly heard you say to Mrs Castle when you refused to call her on her point of order that she could not be called because a vote was in progress. Now we really must be clear whether or not a point of order can be called after a speech for and against and before a vote. It is important that this House understands whether or not one would be allowed. And I would ask you to give a definite ruling on whether or not you will recognize people as a matter of principle. 1 President. \u2014 I think it is a valid point and it would be helpful if the Committee on the Rules of Procedure and Petitions could give us some pertinent advice on it. It is my feeling that it should not be done. (The President readout changes in Wednesdays' agenda) I call Mr Boyes. Mr Boyes. \u2014 Mr President, concerning Question Time. You appear to have changed questions to the Commission to Wednesday from their usual place on Thursday... President. \u2014 There is some misunderstanding. You have received a written notification that the Bureau would probably propose that questions to the Com mission should be taken at the time normally reserved for questions to the Council and vice versa. In the 1 See Minutes. ",
        "No 1-286/6 Debates of the European Parliament 14.6.82 President meantime it has turned out that Mr Tindemans is able \u2014 or that the Council is able \u2014 to be here on the ori ginal day scheduled for questions to the Council. So the Council Question Time will remain where it is, that is on Wednesday, and the Commission's Question Time will remain where it is, that is on Tuesday. There will be no change. Mr Boyes. \u2014 Is that going to be a regular occurre- ance? One of the things that concerns me, Mr Presi dent, is that some people may think that Question Time is an unnecessary interlude, but many of us think it is a very important part of the agenda. We have been finding in the last few months that Question Time is missed out altogether. Recently questions to the Council were cut by 30 minutes, and I notice again that other changes have been made. I just plead with you, Mr President, to realize that Question Time is an important part of the agenda and that the timing must be kept as consistent as possible. President. \u2014 Mr Boyes, there is no proposal what soever to diminish in any way the time available for Question Time, or to change the substance in the sense of changing the Council for the Commission. I call Mr Seligman. Mr Seligman. \u2014 The Council on Wednesday, the Commission on Tuesday. Is that correct? President. \u2014 That is right. I call Mr Jackson. Mr C. Jackson. \u2014 We all accept that there may need to be changes in the agenda, but I would like to ques tion the change of the debate on the Rabbethge report from Thursday to Wednesday. I can quite understand the rapporteur's view that it is sensible and logical to have all the North-South items taken together. But this could have been thought of weeks ago. It could well have been made known to us all at group meet ings, perhaps last week. I wish it had been! But at this stage Members will have made arrangements on the basis of the existing agenda, and changes, as we all know, can cause considerable inconvenience. So, Mr President, may I make some requests? First, that you use your influence on the group chair men to keep changes to an absolute minimum. Second, that you re-examine the system for determining the agenda to see' whether it is not possible to have an intermediate stage such that groups can be informed of changes proposed to the agenda at group meetings during the week prior to the session. And, thirdly, as Mr Forth has requested, to exert great discipline when it comes to changes to the agenda. President. \u2014 Mr Jackson, I cannot quite promise that because, as the Rules state, for reasons of topicality some changes are inevitable. In this case it was discov ered a bit late that there was a relationship, let us say in North-South terms, between the Michel report and the Rabbethge report, so that it was only decided quite late to propose that they be dealt with separately in the same debate. If you want to propose that we do not do so, we shall have to vote on it. If you do not propose that, I shall keep it on the agenda as proposed. Mr C. Jackson. \u2014 Mr President, I am not going to make that proposal, I merely wish to register a protest. President. \u2014 I call Mr Forth. Mr Forth. \u2014 Mr President, could I ask you, following this discussion, whether you could find some way of lengthening the interval between the deliberations of group chairmen under Rule 55 and the ability of Members under Rule 56 to propose a further change in the agenda? I think that a key part of the problem is that those of us who are not privy to the discussions that go on, find that we are very often faced with an entirely new agenda and, therefore, do not have the ability to make the proposals which are allowed for under Rule 56. So really I am asking, Mr President, whether you can find some way of making us aware of what is being proposed at your meeting with the chair men of groups prior to the session so that we can con sider these changes and make further changes under Rule 56.1 think that would help. President. \u2014 The problem is how to combine the last-minute events and the events you can calculate a week before. But we will look into it. (The President read the amendments to Thursday's and Friday's agenda 1 \u2014 Parliament adopted the agenda as amended] 1 3. Action taken on the opinions of Parliament President. \u2014 The next item is the statement by the Commission on the action taken on the opinions and resolutions of the European Parliament. 3 Mr Wurtz. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, during the debate on Mr Moreland's report on coal policy at our last part-session I asked Commissioner Giolitti the follow ing question: 'Do you intend to take specific account 1 See Minutes. 2 Deadline for tabling amendments \u2014 Speaking time: see Minutes. 3 See Annex. ",
        "14.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/7 Wurtz of the new guidelines of the French Government and of the French Coal Board Management by adopting a general rule to the effect that all countries with coal reserves must step up their production with aid from the Community?'. What action have you taken on the resolution adopted by Parliament after that debate, Commissioner? Can you also confirm that your measures take effective account of the targets of French coal-mining policy, namely the extraction of 30 million tonnes by the end of the 1980s? Mr Andriessen, Member of the Commission. \u2014 (NL) The Commission is giving very serious consider ation to the new French energy policy which foresees an accelerated exploitation of France's own energy sources, including coal. As you are no doubt aware, the Commission has, heretofore, repeatedly exhorted the Member States to consider increasing that part represented by coal within their overall energy pro duction where this is economically viable. The latter is a prerequisite. In the Commission's opinion the new French energy policy can make a substantial contribu tion to the attainment of the Community's energy policy objectives for the 1990s on which the Commis sion is shortly to present a report. I can therefore assure the honourable Member that the Commission will give its fullest consideration to the measures envis aged by the French Government. I must, however, point out that the French Government has not as yet officially submitted its new energy policy programme to the Commission, and accordingly the latter has not yet conducted an official study of them. But the policy outlines are known and we are endeavouring to take account of them. It goes without saying, and the Com mission intends to continue stressing it, that develop ment of one's own energy sources, including coal, wherever economically viable, is of great importance. I shall end by repeating that the Commission's proposals have heretofore gone unheeded due to the conflicting priorities and views of the Member States. Faced with such a situation the Commission endeavoured to put the emphasis more on the use to which coal could be put rather than the production aspects thereof. How ever, the Commission would be only too happy to adopt those measures it judges positive in the new French programme. Mrs Clwyd. \u2014 Mr President, at the last part-session Parliament voted by a large majority to ask the Coun cil and the Commission to make enquiries and take action on the safety of three British journalists still imprisoned in Argentina. I contacted the Commission some ten days ago to ask what action they had taken. They told me they had taken no action because they felt it was a matter for the Council. I hope that they have revised their opinion on what action they should take. I would be glad if the Commissioner could now confirm that the Commission has pursued this resolu tion of Parliament actively and with some vigour. Mr Andriessen, Member of the Commission. \u2014 (NL) The resolution in question requested that jour nalists, in particular, be given suitable treatment while in detention. From the information at the Commis sion's disposal the safety of the three journalists in question is assured. The resolution requested an addi tional guarantee which we consider to have already been given and the Commission, under the circum stances, saw no grounds for further action. Mrs Maij-Weggen. \u2014 (NL) Mr President, page 2 of the Commission's document contains a statement to the effect that, in four cases, the Commission gave its reasons for maintaining its original proposal. One of these is, ostensibly, Mrs Vayssade's report on the steps to be taken to assure the promotion of the equality of women. I would like to make the following observa tions and/or questions. Firstly it is misleading to say that the Commission has decided to maintain its original proposal given that it had already amended it before Parliament delivered its opinion. Consequently, I consider that this report does not belong under this heading. Furthermore I would appreciate an explanation by the Commission as to how it can justify amending a proposal before Parlia ment had addressed itself to the contents thereof. Secondly, is it not true to say that the Commission did not take account of Parliament's recommendations in their entirety? Two of the amendments in question were submitted to the Council and have indeed been ratified by them. I would therefore suggest that this report is definitely erroneous on two points. I would welcome some action from the Commission on this together with an explanation as to how reports eman ating from them can contain such fallacies. Mr Andriessen, Member of the Commission. \u2014 (NL) Mr President, I must admit that the honourable Member is quite right in pointing out the unduly terse nature of the Commission's document. It is true that we have taken account of a number of the points con tained in the Vayssade report and intend to make pro posals based on them. Mrs Maij-Weggen has quite rightly pointed out that, in this case, a subject has been presented under an incorrect heading. However, it would be unfair to accuse the Commis sion of slavishly exploiting the ideas emanating from the parliamentary committees and of incorporating them into its revised proposals. In some cases the Commission has already revised its original proposals even prior to the formal presentation of the parliamen tary committee's report on the Commission's original proposal. If the Commission's revised proposals are broadly similar to those of the parliamentary com mittee there will be a general consensus. Should these revised proposals run contrary to those of the commit tees then the Commission should have the courage of ",

Mr Balfe. \u2014 Mr President, the Commission will recall that at the last part-session this Parliament adopted and forwarded to it a resolution on the use of plastic bullets in Ireland. This resolution had the support of all of the parties in this House other than the British Conservative Party. Following that, the Commission may have noticed that the British Government has announced that it is going to use even bigger plastic bullets and take no notice of this Parliament. I wonder if the Commission could let this Parliament know what it has done with the resolution and, more impor tantly, whether it will be in a position to report back to this Parliament, maybe next month or in September, on the steps it has taken to implement the resolution. Mr Andriessen, Member of the Commission. \u2014 (NL) Mr President, if I recall correctly, this resolution was directed at a number of Member States rather than at the Commission itself. No specific action was requested of the Commission. We have therefore taken no action, nor do we envisage taking any in the future. Should the House formally instruct the Com mission to act on this matter, we shall not hesitate to do so. Mr Moorhouse. \u2014 Mr President, at the April part- session we adopted a resolution on the financing of a fixed link across the Channel, expressing the view that we were convinced that the Community must be involved in the decision on the construction of a fixed link across the Channel and calling upon the Commis sion to submit within one month the specific report requested by Parliament in 1981 on the problems of financing the link and the possibilities of Community assistance and to put forward specific proposals to secure such Community assistance. When Mr Conto- georgis, the Commissioner responsible, replied, he agreed to provide this report within one month. I am speaking about the April plenary part-session. Now since we know that this report is indeed available \u2014 we were so informed in the Committee on Trans port \u2014 may we be told when the report will be made available to Parliament as a whole? This, as I am sure Commissioner Andriessen will appreciate, is a very important matter, because we have some reason to suppose that the findings of the Anglo-French study group are about to be published. Furthermore we know from the meeting of the Council of Transport Ministers last week that considerable interest \u2014 one may even say enthusiasm \u2014 was shown by some mem bers of the Council in the setting-up of a common transport infrastructure fund. So we have this urgent matter and we are looking for the paper promised by the Commissioner. Mr Andriessen, Member of the Commission. \u2014 (NL) Mr President, to the best of my knowledge this report has already been made available to Parliament and should by now be in the possession of the honour able Member. It is possible that there has been a hitch in the distribution by Parliament's secretariat, but, as far as I am aware, the Commission has completed its task. Mrs Squarcialupi. \u2014 (IT) Mr President, I wish to recall the Commission's attention to Mrs Scrivener's report on the fight against drug abuse. In this report Parliament had asked to participate in the United Nations' initiative for reconversion of the cultivation of opiates. The United Nations body responsible for combating drug abuse has asked the European coun tries, particularly those countries most severely affected by the drug problem, to collaborate in this programme. I therefore wish to ask if the Commission has already contacted this international body, and I would also like to be informed regarding the way in which these contacts are generally initiated, so as to be sure that Parliament's requests are being followed by practical measures. Mr Andriessen, Member of the Commission. \u2014 (NL) Mr President, I am unable to confirm whether the Commission has already begun discussions on this matter. On the basis of Mrs Scrivener's resolution the Commission is currently examining the priorities involved. Its tentative line of thought is in the direction of cooperation with other international agencies involving the pooling of information, experience gath ered, statistics as well as the promotion of studies and research which forms part of what the honourable Member has just stated. As soon as the Commission has finished its deliberations it will contact the relevant bodies. Mrs Cinciari Rodano. \u2014 (IT) Mr President, I would like to return to the question raised by Mrs Maij-Weg gen, to which the Commission has not given an answer. The Commission's text was altered before Parliament expressed its opinion. It appears that the Council reached its decision on the basis of a text which dif fered from the one approved by Parliament, without the latter having been informed. The Commission apparently agrees that it happened this way, and for this reason I would be grateful for a precise response on its part. The Commissioner has also affirmed that the text of the document which was distributed to us is not com pletely accurate. In that case I would like to know what the Commission has done, considering that both the Commissioner, here in the Chamber, and Presi- ",
        "14.6. 82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/9 Cin\u00e7iari Rodano dent Thorn, before the Committee of Inquiry into the Situation of Women, declared that they shared Parlia ment's views and considered it particularly useful for the measures the Commission intended to take in order to overcome the resistance of the Council. Which text did the Commission follow, then: the first, the second, or Parliament's? Which text did it finally defend before the Council? Mr Andriessen, Member of the Commission. \u2014 (NL) Mr President, I hope the House will not hold it against me that I do not have at hand the exact text submitted to the Council but I am prepared to provide the House with a written answer as soon as possible. Mr Martin. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, I have noted the information given by the Commission on disaster aid made available since the last part-session. In view of the urgency and extreme gravity of the situation, I should like to know what the Commission intends to do to assist the peoples of Lebanon and Palestine who are the victims of savage Israeli aggression. Under the Israeli bombs . . . President. \u2014 Mr Martin, I must call you to order since that has no connection with the resolution adopted last month. If you wish to speak on this topic, you must do so during the debate on urgency or the joint debate tomorrow with the Council. Mrs Vayssade. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, I should like to return to the position adopted by the Commission on the action programme and to supplement Mrs Cinciari Rodano's question by asking the Commission to be more specific about the action it proposes to take on Parliament's vote concerning the content of the action programme without simply referring to the Council's proposal adopted on 27 May. In short, does the Com mission intend to act on the requests relating to educa tion and health problems put forward by Parliament in its resolution? Mr Andriessen, Member of the Commission. \u2014 (NL) Mr President, the House will recall that the resolution in question contained a considerable num ber of suggestions which are being given careful con sideration by the Commission with a view to elaborat ing an effective course of action. As I have already stated, some of the points contained therein could have been formulated better. I can assure Mrs Vays sade that the Commission intends to follow up a num ber of these suggestions in the near future and her committee will shortly be receiving the report of the Commissioner specifically responsible for this matter. President. \u2014 The first part of Question Time, ques tions to the Commission, is now closed. I call Mr Van Minnen on a motion of order. Mr Van Minnen. \u2014 (NL) Mr President, my point of order goes back to the Commissioner's answer to Mrs Clwyd's question on the British journalists currently being detained in Argentina. As President, you have correctly stated that debates have no place in Question Time to the Commission. My point of order is that, when questions are asked, they should be answered. This House adopted a resolution on which the Com mission was requested to take action; the Commis sioner has just deemed such action to be superfluous in view of the fact that the journalists in question are being handled with kid-gloves. It is only logical that the Commissioner should elaborate on this bewilder ing, entirely unexpected and, if true, heart-warming news. President. \u2014 Mr Van Minnen, I rather doubt that your remarks have the character of a point of order. Furthermore the Commission did not say that the journalists in question were being handled with kid- gloves. Such paraphrasing of an answer is carrying things a little too far. Would you care to comment, Mr Andriessen? Mr Andriessen, Member of the Commission. \u2014 (NL) Very briefly, Mr President, I have informed the House on the basis of the information in my posses sion. I am not at liberty to reveal my source at present. Nor was this requested. The question was whether the Commission had taken action on the resolution adopted by Parliament. I have answered that question and I am at a loss to understand why Mr Van Minnen has to make it a point of order. President. \u2014 I call Mrs Clwyd on a point of order. Mrs Clwyd. \u2014 Mr President, on a point of order. We are left in a situation where we are unable to ask the Commission supplementary questions. I think it is quite frustrating to put a question to the Commission, hear the answer and not have the opportunity to come back with a supplementary. Now I would hope that the Committee on the Rules of Procedure and Peti tions would look at this situation because it is unsatis factory for those of us who really want to get to the bottom of the action or non-action taken by the Com mission. President. \u2014 Mrs Clwyd, I think you are wrong. The system has only been in operation on a trial basis for one month. But there is still Question Time where you have every opportunity of putting supplementary ques tions to get the maximum information out of the Commission. If you are not satisfied with the answers I think you can insist further during Question Time. ",
        "No 1-286/10 Debates of the European Parliament 14.6.82 4. Request for a Member's immunity to be waived President. \u2014 The next item is the report (Doc. 1-298/ 82) by Mr Donnez, on behalf of the Legal Affairs Committee, on the request for a Member's immunity to be waived. I call the rapporteur. Mr Donnez, rapporteur. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not think that there is any need for a long debate on this request for the parliamentary immunity of our colleague, Mr Pannella, to be waived. It seems to me that the report which I am presenting to you on behalf of the Legal Affairs Committee and above all the decision already taken by our Parliament on 9 March last in connection with a similar case are sufficient in themselves. In my report, the Legal Affairs Committee is in effect asking you to maintain the precedent established by Parliament on 9 March 1982. The accusations made against Mr Pannella by the competent Italian judicial authorities relate to press articles which our colleague caused to be published on 29 March 1982 in his capacity as editor of an Italian publication. Following these press articles the compe tent Italian courts sentenced our colleague primarily for inciting young persons to refuse military service. Mr Pannella appealed against this verdict and the case is now pending before the Appeal Court in Rome. The public prosecutor of that Court has asked us to waive Mr Pannella's parliamentary immunity to enable pro ceedings to be taken against him pursuant to Italian law. Such are the facts. his arguments but they were not accepted by the Legal Affairs Committee which is of the opinion \u2014 follow ing the decision taken by you on 9 March 1982 in con nection with a report by our colleague Karel de Gucht on a similar case \u2014 that the primary purpose of parlia mentary immunity is to guarantee the integrity of our parliamentary institution and the independence of its members. It follows that immunity cannot be waived for reasons relating solely to the political activities of an individual member. Of course immunity does not imply impunity. The purpose of immunity is to protect our institution, to protect Parliament and not to grant a privilege to one or other of its members. After due consideration the Legal Affairs Committee, consistent with its own previous practice, held that it was not in the interest of our parliamentary institution for the parliamentary immunity of Mr Pannella to be lifted. I personally regret the decision of the Legal Affairs Committee as far as he is concerned because he wanted his parliamentary immunity to be lifted. But I also believe that this decision accords totally with the principles of our jurisprudence and ultimately reflects the interests of this parliamentary institution of ours. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I therefore call upon you to confirm the decision taken by the Legal Affairs Committee and to refrain from waiving Mr Pannella's parliamentary immunity. IN THE CHAIR: MR LALOR Vice-President As to the legal aspect, I would remind you that Article 10 of the Protocol on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Communities stipulates that, for the duration of parliamentary sessions, Mem bers of our Assembly shall benefit on their national territory from the immunities granted to Members of the Parliament of their respective country; a further relevant consideration is the ruling by the European Court of Justice that the European Parliament holds an annual session and account must not be taken of the intervals between sittings or part-sessions. Pursuant to the jurisprudence of the European Parlia ment, Mr Pannella benefits from the immunity recog nized to members of the Italian Parliament by virtue of Article 68 of the Italian Constitution which \u2014 and I am merely noting the legal facts \u2014 does not allow Mr Pannella the right to waive his immunity. I must remind you that Mr Pannella personally wishes to renounce the parliamentary immunity from which he benefits. He put his request to the Legal Affairs Committee which heard him at length. He put forward President. \u2014 I call Mr Pannella. Mr Pannella. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, with your per mission, I should like to comment briefly on the state ment by our esteemed colleague, Mr Donnez. First of all, this whole matter comes under the appeal jurisdiction of the Assize Court. In principle, the public prosecutor could have asked for me to be sent enced to well over 15 years in prison. I was acquitted by the Assize Court on the accusation of substance and sentenced to four months for a minor offence. But the prosecutor \u2014 who had already pleaded against me \u2014 lodged an appeal. As a result, Mr President, they wish to judge all my offences in the Assize Court. I might even say my crimes since after all it is an Assize Court. Now, Mr President, in the name of the rights of each individual, I must call upon all our colleagues to show a measure of prudence. Mr President, each one of us has an inalienable right which is an integral part of ",
        "14.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/11 Pannella ourselves, of our history and of our truth: an indivi dual right. When an occasion arises on which there is a contradic tion between the corporative interests of an institution and the fundamental rights of an individual, are we always to rule in the same way as we have done up to now? I do not think so, Mr President. I am asking you \u2014 on my own behalf and also for the benefit of others in future \u2014 to recognize that I have the right to a public acquittal: the right to see unmasked a proce dure which was politically based and tantamount to persecution, the right to be judged in the name of my own people, the people of Italy. That right cannot be taken from me in the name of the prerogatives of our colleagues. The corporative prerogatives of an institu tion cannot be allowed to prevail over the fundamental right of an individual. That is why I am asking you, Mr President, to allow me to be judged in my own country in order to de nounce the use of the law by public prosecutors who do no honour to a constitutional State. I ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to allow me to stand judgment. I think we all subscribe to the same princi ples of law. They will allow me to say that I have defended at one and the same time the prestige of our Assembly and my own fundamental rights. I hope that I shall be authorized to do so, Mr President, because a very serious process is under way in Italy: only a few days ago \u2014 and I say this publicly to the Legal Affairs Committee \u2014 an Italian magistrate appealed to the constitutional courts against the prerogatives of our Assembly since our Assembly had not responded to the initiatives of the Italian magistrature after the immun ity of an Italian Member of Parliament had been lifted for one year. I therefore hope that a different decision will be taken in my case and, moreover, that more attention will be paid in future to the rights and duties of the individual. Mr President, thank you for allowing me to express my views clearly in this way. I am aware that I owe this opportunity to your own sensitivity and am infin itely grateful to you. which Mr Pannella had been found not guilty by the first judge. Mr Pannella was acquitted on the funda mental charges but sentenced to four months' impri sonment for offences which he qualifies as minor or, more specifically, crimes which he qualifies as minor. I am using Mr Pannella's own terminology here. The only question which arises in this instance is to ascertain whether there is not sometimes a conflict of interests between the rights of a Parliamentarian and the rights of Parliament. Of course a Member of Par liament as an individual citizen has the right to stand trial. I did not fail to draw the attention of the Legal Affairs Committee to this major disparity which may exist between the right of a Parliamentarian to have his own innocence recognized by the competent courts of his country and the right of Parliament to protect our own institution. There may be a contradiction here and Mr Pannella alluded to this contradiction a moment ago. But, in the light of the decision taken by the Legal Affairs Committee, I do not believe that the contradiction exists in this particular case and I wish now to give you an example which Mr Pannella can verify for himself. When he was a member of the Italian Parliament other legal proceedings were instituted against him. By reason of his capacity as an Italian Parliamentarian, the Italian Parliament had to consider a request made by the competent authorities for his parliamentary immunity to be waived. On four occasions out of five that request was rejected. This means that even the Italian Parliament, applying the Italian Constitution, reached the same decision as the Legal Affairs Com mittee is now asking you to take in four cases out of five \u2014 the fifth instance being a special case. I am sorry to some extent that Mr Pannella cannot have an opportunity to explain his own position to the compe tent courts but the mere fact of our decision not to waive Mr Pannella's parliamentary immunity suggests that we consider him perfectly innocent. That at least is my interpretation of the situation. President. \u2014 The debate is closed. The vote will be taken at the next voting time. President. \u2014 I call the rapporteur. Mr Donnez, rapporteur. \u2014 (FR) I assume, Mr Presi dent, that the Assembly would like the rapporteur for the Legal Affairs Committee to give certain clarifica tions following the latest statements by Mr Pannella. I do not seek to dispute the explanatory observations made by Mr Pannella and I willingly take note of them. I did not want to say so myself but it is perfectly true that the public prosecutor of the Italian Republic has lodged an appeal in respect of three charges on 5. Relations between the EEC and the United States of America President. \u2014 The next item is the interim report (Doc. 1-300/82) by Mrs Gredal, on behalf of the Legal Affairs Committee, on the political aspects of relations between the Community and the United States of America. I call the rapporteur. ",
        "No 1-286/12 Debates of the European Parliament 14.6.82 Mrs Gredal, rapporteur. \u2014 (DA) Mr President, since 1972 there has been a constant succession of meetings between the US Congress and the European Parlia ment. After the last meeting in The Hague last January and following a discussion in the Political Affairs Committee, it was decided that a report should be prep ared on relations between the USA and Europe. I wish to stress that this document must be viewed as an interim report. It should be regarded as the political signal we wish to give to the US Congress at the meet ing which is to be held with the Congress and is due to begin next week. A political signal which gives some indication of where we stand. A more extensive report will be prepared at a later date which will also cover economic, currency, agricultural and other matters, in addition to the political aspects, thus providing a systematic review of all the problems in our relations with the USA. I am old enough to remember the part played by the United States and the American people in the Second World War. But many young people today, both in the USA and in Europe, have not had this experience \u2014 fortunately, it might be added. It is our duty, there fore, in my opinion, on both sides of the Atlantic to ensure that the historical facts of this interaction be passed on to the new generations. But that does not mean that we cannot express concern. It does not mean that we should ignore and overlook a number of questions and problems of both an economic and a political nature. On the contrary, we should draw attention to them. The decision of the Political Affairs Committee to submit to Parliament a motion for a resolution on transatlantic relations is based on the view which is very prevalent in Europe that it is time to launch a new kind of dialogue aimed at clearing up mutual misun derstandings and at strengthening solidarity between the USA and the countries of the European Com munity. This was a feeling which came across strongly at the Hague meeting in January 1982, to which I have referred. We also noted at this meeting that there were a number of differences, not only among the Euro peans but between Europeans and Americans, and we were able to see and to gauge the very strong political will on both sides of the Atlantic to renew and strengthen dialogue and cooperation. We face problems in the world which may seem insur mountable. World peace, for which both sides bear a heavy responsibility, is under constant threat. The debate in Parliament this week will no doubt reflect this. It is therefore particularly necessary that the two sides understand each other's actions and lines of approach. Unfortunately, this has not always been the case, and I would therefore emphasize point 2 in my motion for a resolution, which reads: Parliament is of the opinion that the partners, on questions regarding world peace and security must recognize that they are of equal importance, even in situations in which their interests conflict; the partners must not therefore take unilateral deci sions on questions affecting world peace and security: the principle of equality requires a com prehensive exchange of views and early consul tation in connection with all decisions. Through the years there has been close cooperation between the USA and the Community at different lev els. I would emphasize what is particularly necessary in closer cooperation between the democratically elected representatives. It is not a question of the European Parliament having powers to negotiate with the US Congress. That is not necessary. Our main task is to influence one another, have our lines of action mutually understood and perhaps change them in the process. President Reagan has just visited Europe. We shall dis cuss the results of this visit with our American col leagues next week in Washington, and our question to them will most certainly be: do you now have a more understanding attitude towards the independent stance which is developing in Europe and which is deter mined in many cases by a political, geographic and economic situation which is different to that of the USA? I shall not concern myself with details in my introduc tion, Mr President, but I must say that the failure to reach a mutually satisfactory settlement of a question as important as that of trade in steel is bound to be cause for concern in Europe. The Political Affairs Committee has adopted this report by a large majority but, as I have said, it is an interim report. Personally, I should have liked to see certain points omitted, but it is especially important to me that the European Parliament express its views as unanimously as possible on relations with the USA. This also applies to critical views \u2014 after all, we can not always come out in agreement on US policy, since attitudes in this respect vary from one political group in Parliament to another. But it is especially important in my view, as I have said, that we express our opin ions on a basis as close as possible to unanimity. President. \u2014 I call the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. Mr von Wogau, drafisman of an opinion. \u2014 (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the visit by the Presi dent of the United States of America to Europe was a welcome occasion to cement the friendship between Europe and the United States. But a few days later we then had the American decision on steel imports, and the newspapers are now talking about a trade war between the Community and the USA, albeit in quota tion marks. Next week the European Parliament's delegation will be leaving for Washington, and one of its tasks will be to help to resolve thisdispute. ",
        "14.6. 82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/13 von Wogau What, then, has happened in the last few weeks and months to the Community's trade policy towards the United States? On 12 January seven American com panies complained of 92 cases of dumping in the steel sector. Many of these complaints have since been withdrawn, but in the cases that remain anti-dumping duties have now been imposed, and the Commission's intensive efforts in the last few weeks to achieve a negotiated settlement have obviously failed. We very much regret this, because we all know that action of this kind has the tendency to produce coun teraction. The European companies are accused of enjoying export advantages through the subsidies they receive. But subsidies are also granted in the United States in certain sectors, the chemical fibre sector, for example, where the split gas price for US companies produces a considerable competitive advantage. The question that could and should be asked here is whether the European Community should not take corresponding measures. There is a serious danger now of our getting into a situation in which action by one side prompts the other to take further action, thus aggravating the dis pute. There is after all no shortage of critical economic questions in relations between the United States and Europe, an example being agricultural exports, where the Europeans are accused of protectionism. And then there is the question of trade with the Eastern Bloc, the United States' policy of high interest rates and its exchange rate policy \u2014 these are all items that will be on the agenda when our delegation goes to Washing- The European Community is the competent organ ization for these trade policy questions, and it has the ability to take action. The Communtiy is the body with which the United States must negotiate. That is the very reason why parliamentary control of the current negotiations is particularly important, and that is also why the delegation has a particularly important task to perform in the United States. We must make it clear on the other side of the Atlantic that, despite the protectionism we are constantly accused of, we are still the United States' largest cus tomer for agricultural products. We must also point out that the agricultural subsidies granted in the United States, albeit in a different way, are at least as high as they are in Europe. According to the calcula tions we have, the agricultural subsidies granted on both sides of the Atlantic total something like 1% of gross domestic product. We must further point out that the United States' policy of high interest rates has a very marked effect on us Europeans and that it is slowing down growth throughout the world. Of course, we must also remember that this policy was introduced after com plaints from Europe that the Americans should at last do something about their high rate of inflation. The problem of inflation has now been largely solved in the United States: inflation rates have fallen. Today the administration is keeping interest rates up by making excessive use of the capital market, an accusation which must, however, be levelled at the Europeans as well. I believe we must try to have a policy to terminate the period of high interest rates adopted on both sides of the Atlantic. We must also see to it that a coordinated policy on exchange rates is pursued on both sides of the Atlantic. The exchange rate policy of the Federal Reserve Bank is having an extremely adverse effect on trade throughout the world because short-term erratic fluctuations are not being offset. Something must be done about this both in Europe, through greater concentration under the European Monetary System, and in the United States. Above all, we must join in emphasizing that protec tionism is harmful, that, in economic policy terms, it is the brother of isolationism. Let us remember the simi lar political situation between 1919 and 1930, when the United States and Europe drifted ever further apart not only in economic policy but in all policies, with the catastrophic consequences for economic and also for general policy with which we are all familiar. We must now do everything we can to prevent a recurrence of such mistakes. Mr Bruno Friedrich. \u2014 (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Socialist Group welcomes the fact that this report is being debated today, immediately before the departure of Parliament's delegation to the USA. We should particularly like to thank Mrs Gredal for the care she has taken over this report and for the bal ance she has struck. It was approved by a large major ity in the Political Affairs Committee. After President Reagan's visit to Europe and the sum mit talks in Versailles and Bonn it is important for our Parliament's delegation to know that it has the support of the widest possible spectrum of political opinion in this Parliament before it leaves for the USA next week, since this will help in its difficult talks there. We, therefore, hope that a large majority will vote for this report. In the last few weeks in particular, however, there has been repeated talk of a crisis between the USA and Europe, and as a result of a decision taken by the majority of the Political Affairs Committee, the report also contains a reference to the danger of a split between Europe and the USA, caused by the Soviet Union. The Socialist Group considers such fears exag gerated, and we shall therefore be voting for the dele tion of this sentence. Why? The peoples of Europe will never forget that the USA has twice this century, in two World Wars, saved the democracies of Europe from dictatorship. Joint de- ",
        "No 1-286/14 Debates of the European Parliament 14.6.82 Bruno Friedrich fence and also the further development of democracy and human dignity still form the common foundations of our relationship. That is why Europe welcomed the American President's visit. His visit was necessary because for the first time since the end of the Second World War a world economic crisis and a world-wide arms race have now both occurred within the space of 10 years. We should not forget that in the 1930s it was the same combination of economic crisis and arms race, accompanied by unbri dled national egoism, that led to the Second World War. Nor should we forget that this disastrous combi nation of an arms race and economic crisis is further aggravated today by hunger and other problems in the Third World. In a situation that has changed so dramatically the European Community and the USA must accept their joint responsibility for world eco nomic stability and the stabilization of world peace. We welcome the fact that Mrs Gredal has said in her report that the European Parliament should not leave it at the general definition of principles. The Socialist Group, therefore, welcomes the determination with which President Mitterrand called in Versailles for measures to fight unemployment. High-interest-rate policies, the inability to cooperate in monetary matters and protectionism motivated by national interests do not strengthen the Western alliance; they weaken it. In plain language, it came as a disappointment for the countries of the European Community \u2014 and for the European Parliament, I would add \u2014 that only a few days after the Versailles summit special duties were imposed on steel imports from the European Com munity into the USA. In even plainer language, Mr President, Defence Secretary Weinberger calls on the Europeans not to supply the Soviet Union with steel pipes. His colleague the Trade Secretary calls on the Europeans not to supply steel pipes to the USA. But the Europeans are supposed to buy American soya beans, there's nothing wrong with that. But Europe's steel workers cannot unfortunately live on American soya beans. In short, in relations between the USA and the European Community each side should treat the other as an equal partner, this being, as the report points out, the common basis of their relations. We cannot accept the dominance of the national interests of either side. The Socialist Group also sees the need for this equality of partners in questions of security and disarmament. Federal Chancellor Schmidt was right when he emphasized at the summit meeting that security is con ceivable only if both East and West understand that the loss of balance between the superpowers is a threat to peace in the world. We therefore see the American President's readiness to negotiate on practical action to achieve disarmament as a step in the right direction. The European Parliament's delegation will undoubt edly also be asked in the USA next week about the criticism being voiced by the younger generation in Europe. It is the strength of democracy that it guaran tees the younger generation the chance to protest. Major peace movements are to be found only in Europe and the USA. There is none in the Soviet Union. All of us in the European Parliament should therefore regard the joint search for a stable peace, particularly among the younger generations of Europe and the USA, as an opportunity to begin a new and urgently needed European-American dialogue. President. \u2014 I call the Group of the European Peo ple's Party (Christian-Democratic Group). Mr Habsburg. \u2014 (DE) Mr President, on behalf of the European People's Party I welcome Mrs Gredal's report and motion for a resolution, particularly those parts which were contributed by the majority of the Political Affairs Committee and not least the reference to the fact that the Soviet Union and those it has taken under its wing will do anything to separate Europe from America. In the last few days there have been two events that must be looked upon as extremely positive in this con nection. First, President Reagan's visit, which at last showed the Europeans the real Reagan and not the distorted picture they are all too often presented. Second, those impressive proclamations in Germany of friendship for America, organized by the CDU and CSU in Bonn and Munich to show what the Euro peans, and particularly the younger generation, really think of the United States. The younger generation cannot, after all, be equated with what is known as the peace movement. Very many young people have joined the camp of those who want a positive peace policy. We saw \u2014 or at least I saw on the K\u00f6nigsplatz in Munich \u2014 that the younger generation remember quite clearly what we owe the United States, that we must be grateful to the United States for the preserva tion of peace in Europe. Of course, there is tension between us from time to time. Reference has been made, for example, to what has happened in the steel sector. On that subject I should at least like to say this: the report of the Com mittee on Economic and Monetary Affairs contrasts the pressure exerted by the Americans as regards credit granted to Eastern Bloc countries with the sale of American foodstuffs to the Soviet Union. My per sonal comment on this is that I have no objection to the sale of foodstuffs because it at least means that Soviet money is being spent constructively on the peo ple of the Soviet Union, whereas loans from us would make it only too easy for that country to pursue its insane armaments policy. The tensions that have occurred between America and Europe, particularly a few years ago, have been due, on the one hand, to something of a European inferior- ",
        "14.6. 82 Debates o\u00ed the European Parliament No 1-286/15 Habsburg ity complex, because we have simply not made pro gress towards unification fast enough. On the other hand, we have had the unpredictability of American policy, especially at the time of President Carter. In both respects there has now been a fundamental change for Europe, since, despite all the pessimistic statements, we have made great strides towards unifi cation. After all, we have shown in the Falklands crisis, for instance, how united Europe can be, and we have also shown that it is possible to find a way of making a constructive change to the unfortunate Luxembourg Agreement. On the American side the advantage is that the United States has now become predictable. This is a good basis from which to begin. The balance is slowly being restored. For the first time for many years we can now speak to each other as equals, and that is why the mission is particularly important. In conclusion, I should like to wish the members of the delegation a great deal of success in Washington and in particular to express the hope that this interim report will very soon give way to a clearly worded final report which puts forward practical proposals for an extension of the dialogue. President. \u2014 I call the European Democratic Group. Sir Fred Catherwood. \u2014 Mr President, the first time I heard Mr Habsburg speak, he said that Europe should be independent of America. If he is still saying the same thing, I agree with him. But I think that we really must not be in the position where we canot discuss economic issues with them because we are dependent on them, beholden to them and anxious that we do not get split from them by the Soviet Union. I really would like to remind Mrs Gredal of the saying that the business of America is business. I entirely agree with everything that is in here, but I think that we, in our Group, would like to point out to her that if you do not take up business items with the Americans when there are business issues, they will take it that you agree with all the things that they are doing and have no objection to them. The fact of the matter is that we disagree most profoundly with some of the things that they are doing at the moment. Therefore I would like to support very much what Mr Bruno Friedrich and MrvonWogau have said. I would simply like to put it like this. The Americans have, for reasons of their own, decided to rearm mas sively without raising taxes, and they have to find the money from somewhere. So they have to raise about a thousand million dollars on the market. That means to say that they have got to have colossal interest rates, which are at a record high. I think they are now 10% over the going rate of inflation. When you talk to people like the Saudi Arabians you find that they really think that they have never seen anything quite so marvellous as the fact that they can get 10% over the real rate of inflation. So naturally they pour their money in there, and the rest of us are left with 10 million unemployed. Now that is not a stable situation. I think what needs to be said very clearly to the Amer icans is that if you go on with this economic policy, you are producing an unstable situation in America. How long are the American Blacks going to put up with the colossal rate of unemployment that they have? You are producing an unstable employment situation in Europe and that is not good for anyone, least of all for the free industrial democracies. You are putting enourmous strain on the entire world econ omic system,' because that system depends on free trade. If you do not sustain stable exchange rates \u2014 Mr von Wogau referred to benign neglect \u2014 if you neglect the exchange rate and you allow it to go up and down, you put enormous and intolerable pressure on trade and on the ability of countries and groups of countries to agree between themselves on trade. So from unemployment you get colossal pressure for protectionism, and from uncertainty in exchange rates you get enormous pressure on the whole general agreement on tariffs and trade. I think the position now is that unless they can change their economic policy and unless they bring greater stability into the situation, they are going to make it extremely difficult to maintain the entire post-war Bretton Woods system. I think that the President, who comes from California, and the Administration have got to be made to face the international consequences of the domestic, polit ical and economic policies that they now have. I hope Mrs Gredal will put this view very forcibly as a view of this Parliament. President. \u2014 I call the Liberal and Democratic Group. Mr Haagerup. \u2014 (DA) Mr President, I think it should be stated plainly \u2014 as has already been said in a number of quarters here in Parliament \u2014 that we should neither seek to trivialize nor ignore the con flicts of interest which may arise and which in actual fact generally have arisen between the USA and the European Communities. Several speakers, including Mr von Wogau and Mr Friederich, have referred to these conflicts of interest, most recently in the steel sector. We should also not underestimate their seriousness, and I would point out to Sir Fred Catherwood, with whose remarks I am in broad agreement, that I do not think he has any reason for concern that we shall not get an open discussion with the Americans of the points which separate us. I was previously a member of Parliament's delegation to the USA, and it would be untypical of the Ameri- ",
        "No 1-286/16 Debates of the European Parliament 14.6.82 Haagerup cans \u2014 and I would hope of ourselves also \u2014 to try to sweep disagreements under the carpet instead of dis cussing them openly. I therefore feel that we should face up to the fact that we have these disagreements. We are sending a delegation to Washington at a time when, let us face it, there will be emotional grounds for adopting quite conflicting views on some issues which are of vital concern to the Community, to our Member States and to our peoples. But, having said that, I would add that all these matters should be viewed in relative terms and that we should keep a cer tain sense of proportion. It is against the background of our desire to maintain this sense of proportion and to show that there are things which link us very closely with the United States and that we want to be able to discuss them openly with our friends in America, that we decided by an overwhelming majority in the Politi cal Affairs Committee to give what Mrs Gredal called a signal, a political signal at the time of our departure and our arrival in the United States. I think that is important. On behalf of my Group, therefore, I urge that we adopt this motion, which bears witness to the very strong bonds which link us with the United States, irrespective of the disagreements which may arise between us. It is against the background of this full recognition of the strong bonds between us that the delegation will be conducting its negotiations next week in the USA. President. \u2014 I call the Group for the Technical Coor dination and Defence of Independent Groups and Members. The People's Movement against the EEC also submit ted an amendment. In it we asked the delegation to stay within its powers and to impress upon the US congressmen that defence and military matters do not fall within the scope of these powers and that the European Parliament is not the political arm of NATO. One of my reasons for moving this amendment was that there is evidence from the official reports of past US delegations of attempts on the part of US con gressmen to exert pressure during these missions for a greater effort of armament and of a lack of resistance to this pressure on the part of the delegations. Now this delegation is to make its journey on the basis of this document which, to begin with, is virtually 100% pro-American, secondly, has been given an anti-peace slant and, thirdly, goes way beyond the competence of the European Community, in that it contains a statement calling for the Community to play an active role in NATO. This goes far beyond the wishes of the Danish Government. It goes way beyond the powers of the Community and, I would have thought also, far beyond Mrs Gredal's political posi tion. I call on her to reconsider whether it is right for her to make the trip as the delegation's chairman on the strength of this document, which has been given such untoward overtones and which falls outside the powers of the European Community. President. \u2014 I call Mr Herman. Mrs Hammerich. \u2014 (DA) The first draft of Mrs Gre dal's report was loosely formulated and quite harm less. It was mostly a collection of eulogizing references to the great importance of the USA to Europe, the world and peace, and to the great importance which Mrs Gredal attaches to the delegation's mission. But Mrs Gredal's text took on an ugly cold-warmongering aspect when the Political Affairs Committee set to work on it, and that is not so remarkable, for it is well known that, when a peaceable person puts a peaceable proposal before Parliament and its committees, it emerges at the other end of the process as something resembling a declaration of war. A number of amendments were adopted to make the text more pro-American and to shift the emphasis from generalities to matters of security policy. The external threats to the Community were mentioned, the USSR was singled out as the enemy and in addi tion \u2014 worst af all \u2014 point 1 was reworded to include a sentence expressing 'hope that the Community's active role in the Atlantic Alliance. . . would be extended in consultation with the United States;' That is a very serious matter which I do not think Ireland will go along with and which will not be especially pleasing to the Danish Government. Mr Herman. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentle men, I share the view of a number of other Members that we must definitely broach our economic prob lems, especially those on which there are differences of opinion, with the Americans. I therefore wish to com ment briefly on the problem of interest rates with particular reference to the dollar. I think we would be better advised to deal with the problem of monetary cooperation and of the dollar rather than with that of interest rates. Why? Because we cannot ask the Americans at one and the same time to fight inflation and to reduce their interest rates. We cannot ask them to reduce the deficit on their public finances if we are not resolved to take similar action in our own countries; neither can we ask them to guar antee our security while at the same time reducing their budgetary effort in that sector. We are therefore not in a strong position to raise the subject of interest rates. On the contrary we are on much firmer ground when we raise the subject of international monetary cooperation. It is in the interests of the United States and of us all to have a world in which international economic relations are not disturbed and threatened as they are today by fluctuations in interest rates. While stressing the fact that the world cannot be left at the mercy of fluctuations in the value of the dollar which ",
        "14.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/17 Herman is the principal reserve currency, we cannot just let things slide today especially as we, like the Americans, pay lip service to the need to fight inflation effectively. Today the potentially most dangerous inflationary situation resides in the lack of international monetary order and in the fact that the international banking system is able, without any form of control or criteria, to generate international liquidity which is the root- cause of inflation. In this particular area we have a strong case and I hope we shall make our views known clearly. President. \u2014 I call the Commission. Mr Andriessen, Member of the Commission. \u2014 (NL) The Commission considers that the Gredal report goes a long way towards improving the climate of relations between the Community and the United States and therefore supports the views expressed therein. It is a timely initiative, coming as it does, at a moment of ever-increasing need, on both sides of the Atlantic for a closer dialogue and a reaffirmation of our mutual bonds. It is undeniable that in recent years serious misgivings have emerged on both sides regard ing the sincerity and intensity of our traditional Atlan tic cohesion and collective destiny. It is clear that such misgivings have hampered the resolution of a number of points of conflict between the United States and the Community involving international monetary, com mercial and development issues. The current dispute over steel and agriculture is a typical example of this. Monetary and interest rate policies, on which almost all of the honourable Members have spoken, attest further to the deterioration in the economic climate. Yet many of these issues are of a technical rather than a purely political nature and it should be possible to seek technical solutions to them. The international and bilateral instruments and procedures are certainly not lacking. What is lacking \u2014 and this is where issues of a technical nature become politicized \u2014 is a political climate of mutual trust, so essential for thrashing out conflicting issues. Were these conflicts to intensify, they could place serious strains on bilateral relations. In this respect the Commission deplores the measures introduced by the US Department of Commerce on 10 June 1982 to levy countervailing charges on certain steel imports from the Community and regrets its in ability to. prevent such measures despite the lengths to which it went and the good will it displayed. The imposition of these measures could pose further seri ous problems for existing commercial ties and aggra vate an already tense situation. I believe that such a dangerous evolution can only be avoided by initiatives and signals \u2014 and I deliberately use the word 'signal' because, in introducing her interim report, the hon ourable Member referred to 'a signal' before the dele gation leaves for the US. It should be a political signal designed to demonstrate clearly to our American part ners that the Community is ready to minimize the dif ferences of opinion to what they really are instead of exacerbating them. We wish to resolve differences of opinion in an atmosphere of dialogue by stating the Community's own point of view because business is business and, as such, should be handled in a business like manner. I can only hope that the initiative of the Political Affairs Committee and, if possible also, of the plenary sitting, will provide one of these signals and that the visit of your delegation to the USA will contribute to an improvement in the political climate. I can assure you that the Commission fully supports this initiative and is actively looking forward to the committee's final report and proposals. The Commission is prepared to provide information to Parliament should such be required. Whether that embraces direct assistance from our Washington representative office, as requested in the resolution, or that such information would be channelled via the Commission, is another matter; but the Commission is quite prepared, as requested by Parliament, to provide all the information necessary for the elaboration of the delegation's visit. President. \u2014 I call the rapporteur. Mrs Gredal, rapporteur. \u2014 (DA) I should like to thank Members for the contributions they have made today. I should like in particular to refer to Sir Fred Cather wood and to Mr Herman, who were involved in the discussions specifically concerned with trade policy questions. I am fully aware that 'business is business' in the United States. The motion for a resolution which I have drafted does not specifically address questions of trade, economy and currency; as has been said, that will come later, but that does not prevent us from hav ing several important discussions during the course of our visit on trade policy and currency questions. It forms part of our programme, as I have indicated in discussions with your Committee, Sir Fred. I would say to Mrs Hammerich that, if she had lis tened to my speech, she would have heard me say that there were certain things in the resolution that I was not entirely happy with personally. But in the interests of having an all but united Parliament behind a stance vis-\u00e0-vis the United States, I accepted the draft which emerged from the work of the Political Affairs Com mittee. We are not making this trip on the basis of this piece of paper but on the basis of a programme which will be put to our meetings in the United States, and I feel under no compulsion to stand down as chairman of the delegation. If one wishes to be absolutely immune to all possible influence, then yes: one should simply ",
        "No 1-286/18 Debates of the European Parliament 14.6.82 Gredal withdraw and abstain from all votes on the various issues. I shall not withdraw, I want to exert an influence on our relations with the United States, positively as well as negatively. I have my own views but, as chairman, I shall express the views of Parliament as a whole. President. \u2014 The debate is closed. The vote will be taken at the next voting time. 6. Carriage of passengers by roads (ASOR) President. \u2014 The next item is the report (Doc. 1-182/ 82), by Mr Buttafuoco, on behalf of the Committee on Transport, on the proposal from the Commission to the Council (Doc. 1-901/81 - COM(81)617 final) for a deci sion concluding the Agreement on the interna tional carriage of passengers by road by means of occasional coach and bus services (ASOR). I call the rapporteur. Mr Buttafuoco, rapporteur. \u2014 (IT) Mr President, lad ies and gentlemen, the document which it is my privi lege to present, by virtue of the unanimous wish of the Committee, concerns the agreement between the European Community on the one hand and Austria, Finland, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and Yugoslavia on the other. This agreement deals with the liberalization of the international car riage of passengers by road by means of occasional coach and bus services. This agreement was pursued through negotiations conducted with these countries on the basis of Article 4 of EEC Regulation No 117/66 of 28 July 1966, which is echoed in the report presented by Mr Van der Gun on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy and Transport. It applies, as has been said, to the international carriage of passengers by road by occasional services which do not meet the require ments for either regular or shuttle services as laid down in the agreement itself. The measures for liberal ization in the field of transport and the documents required today, and there are many of them, are to be replaced by a single control document, while the administrative tasks are to be entrusted to the Euro pean Conference of Transport Ministers. The agreement, which is to last for five years \u2014 and it is possible to modify it within three years of its being put into effect \u2014 will bring about a better and more rational management of these services, speeding up administrative formalities by means of standardized controls and thus considerably reducing the time needed to cross the frontiers. At this point it would be well to stress the economic aspect of the proposal, which is definitely favourable, and the accompanying increase in tourism, which will certainly be considerable. Particularly noteworthy, however, is the, political significance implicit in the adoption of this agreement, which is the first regula tion in the context of the common transport policy to extend beyond the geographical boundaries of the Community and establish a system which is binding for other countries as well. In conclusion, I express the hope that the reservations on the part of Yugoslavia, which we heard about only through an oral communication from the Commission, have been overcome, for this country is especially important by virtue of its position as a compulsory route for such services to and from Greece. I further hope that the agreement will be extended to cover categories of transport not yet included, in order to obtain a significant improvement in transport by road in the frontier regions. As you can see, ladies and gentlemen, the agreement is definitely positive, and I hope that its aspects, all of them encouraging for a common transport policy, can be widely accepted in this Parliament, and that the unanimous approval obtained by this proposal in com mittee will find significant support here. (Applause) President. \u2014 I call the Socialist Group Mr Seefeld. \u2014 (DE) Ladies and gentlemen, we were unanimous in our approval of this report in the Com mittee on Transport of the European Parliament, which, of course, means that it also had the support of the members of the Socialist Group. I should therefore like to thank Mr Buttafuoco for his report and tell him that my colleagues and I will again be voting for it here in the Chamber. Ladies and gentlemen, I have two or three comments to make. We feel the Commission should explain to us today whether it has been possible to settle the dis agreements with Yugoslavia to which the rapporteur has just referred. We believe this is necessary because we know that in the coming summer months tourism will again be playing an important role in Yugoslavia and that many of the difficulties that occur when peo ple cross the frontiers with this country could be removed if by that time the directive had reached the stage where Yugoslavia's difference of opinion with the Commission, with us, with the European Com munity could be overcome. This is also important for us because we have obliga tions to our fellow member country Greece. I believe ",
        "14.6. 82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/19 Seefeld that we must therefore make very sure that anything which might be an obstacle to traffic to and from Greece is eliminated, Yugoslavia being an important transit country. Mr President, we also feel that a directive of this kind cannot be approved here without a reference to the fact that, although this is a positive step because it is a Community transport policy measure whose effect will be felt beyond the Community's frontiers, there are still a number of difficulties in transfrontier transport. I cannot therefore let this opportunity pass without referring to the many inadequacies that exist at the Community's internal frontiers. Much as I welcome the improvement in the situation as it concerns third countries \u2014 and I have said we-approve this report \u2014 I would nevertheless point out that we must also do everything we can to bring about a significant simplifi cation in transfrontier transport by bus. Ladies and gentlemen, here in Strasbourg of all places it should be pointed out that pointless checks are still made on fuel tanks and that buses are occasionally held up even at the Community's internal frontiers. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to cut a long story short, we must do everything we can to help make it easier to cross frontiers because in the holiday months in particular the citizens of this European Community hardly have a better opportunity of seeing what progress we are making, if any. Seen from this angle, what Mr Buttafuoco has presented here on behalf of the Committee on Transport is a positive decision. I can only hope that you will all vote for this resolution. Mr Kazazis. \u2014 (GR) Mr President, I too would like to congratulate Mr Buttafuoco for his excellent report, with which I find myself in total agreement on all counts and which the group of the European People's Party will of course support with its vote. This agreement, the ASOR agreement for short, will without doubt contribute to reducing the obstacles that arise at the internal frontiers in the Community in the area of passenger transport by road, and its adop tion will achieve one of the fundamental aims that motivated the formation of the common market, which is referred to in Article 3c of the Treaty, and by this, of course, I mean the elimination of obstacles to the free circulation of people within the Community. The basic aim of the ASOR agreement is, of course, to eliminate the differences existing between the various legal situations that govern the unscheduled interna tional passenger routes that are being created between areas that are party to the agreement. For this reason it is proposed to simplify \u2014 fronter checks and the administrative formalities by establishing a single con trol document. However, the most important result of the liberalizing measures will doubtless be the develop ment of the passenger routes and consequently an increase in the flow of tourist traffic. Indeed, for countries like Greece and Italy for which tourism is a prime factor of development, this agreement is parti cularly important. Mr President, we want to see further liberalization of passenger transport by road, and urge the Commission to continue its efforts in this direction with a view to extending the agreement to transport categories that are not yet included, and especially to the regular and scheduled routes; this would bring about a consider able improvement of road transport to out-of-the-way places. However, I was very sorry to learn that the fears expressed by Mr Buttafuoco in his report in con nection with Yugoslavia's doubts about becoming a signatory to this agreement were justified. Indeed, on 26 March in London the ASOR agreement was signed by the Community and by the other third countries, while Yugoslavia declined to become a co-signatory to it. This fact is very worrying for the following reasons : Firstly, Yugoslavia itself is a tourist country visited by many tourists from all over Europe. Thus, while the agreement is in force it will have only limited results for that country. Secondly, Yugoslavia is very much a through-route for road transport. It is a compulsory route for road traffic to and from Greece. Thus, while Yugoslavia persists in refusing to sign the ASOR agreement, Greece, which is a peripheral and distant country with many problems in the transport sector, will find itself involuntarily and unjustly at a disadvantage. Mr President, I need not remind you about the other problems that Greece has to face in connection with transport owing to our geographical position. I would just like to refer to the enormous problem of securing for Greece a large enough num ber of transit permits for trucks passing through Yugoslavia, and the annual negotiations that take place with that country to satisfy the Greek hauliers. For this reason it is vitally important, and I ask the Commission and the Council to take note of this, to do all we can to persuade Yugoslavia to become a co-signatory of the ASOR agreement so that a situ ation of discrimination against Greece may be avoided. Let us not forget that the Community has already granted loans to Yugoslavia in connection with the recent construction works on its motorway. In addition, within the framework of the negotiations for regulating the quantities of baby beef that could be imported into Greece at a reduced rate of duty, the Community showed understanding for the Yugosla vian demands. Thus, the Commission and the Council must associate the matter of the agreement with other matters that may constitute future subjects of negotia tion with Yugoslavia. President. \u2014 I call the Group of the Eurpean Progres sive Democrats. ",
        "No 1-286/20 Debates of the European Parliament 14.6.82 Mr Nyborg. \u2014 (DA) Mr President, I heartily wel come Mr Buttafuoco's report. It is decidedly a step in the right direction. It is the first time that the Com munity has made use of its external powers in the transport sector and, by invoking Article 228 of the Treaty, has pursued its interests with one voice. Secondly, there is no doubt that the proposed arrange ment will assist transport operations in practice by cut ting down the time it takes to cross frontiers, which is urgently needed. The administrative formalities involved in crossing a frontier will be reduced by this means, which will be warmly welcomed by the firms providing the transport services referred to. This meas ure will at the same time create the conditions for bet ter and more rational administration of occasional pas senger transport services, to the advantage of both the carriers and the passengers. As was pointed out by previous speakers, the arrange ment only applies to the occasional tranport of passengers and, along with Mr Seefeld, I should like to see it extended to line and shuttle services \u2014 which would be of interest, particularly in regard to transport problems in frontier areas, including the Community's internal frontiers. Might I remind the Commission in this connection that I put a question to it here in Par liament on 12 December 1978 asking if an effort would be made to eliminate discriminatory national rules so that barriers to the transport of goods and passengers by road in the EEC might thus be removed and, if so, what the Commission proposed to do? I said at the time that, unfortunately, it was impossible to list the many instances of distortion of competition present in our Member States, but I was not quite so delicate as Mr Seefeld was just now when he avoided mentioning names. On that occasion, I put to the Commission the concrete question whether it did not consider it unacceptable and a distortion of competi tion for a charge to be made, as is done in Germany, per passenger-kilometre for passengers transported by bus or coach, either in Germany or through Germany \u2014 an arrangement which thus applies to buses coming from countries other than Germany. The Commis sion's answer was a promise from Commissioner Gio- litti that something would be done on the matter. I have not seen anything on the subject since. I am, of course, pleased that the Commission has con cluded an agreement with a number of third countries which will bring about an improvement in customs problems vis-\u00e0-vis countries outside the Community, but I hope Commissioner Andriessen will forgive me for drawing the Commission's attention at the same time to the need for an improvement in regard to rules providing for dues and charges for tours within the Community. There is an old saying to the effect that you should put your own house in order before trying to put someone else's house in order! President. \u2014 I call the non-attached Members. Mr Eisma. \u2014 (NL) Our group welcomes the signing of this agreement on the international carriage of pas sengers by road by means of occasional coach and bus services (ASOR) and the reduction in delays at fron tier crossings which will result from it. An additional welcome measure would be the abolition of the obli gation, still in force in some European countries, to provide a passenger list to the relevant authorities, as with, for example, passenger traffic to and from France, Spain, Switzerland, Austria and several other countries. Most countries only require the communi cation of the total number of passengers carried; Article 10 of the ASOR makes provision for this to be effected on a bilateral basis as is the case, for example, between Austria and the Netherlands. It is of course ridiculous that such constraints should still exist between France and its EEC partners. Mr President, as commendable as are the Commission's efforts in removing barriers restricting trade with third coun tries, how much more disquieting is the continued existence of such barriers inside the Community against which no action has been taken to this very day. The rapporteur draws attention to this in section three of the introduction. Of even greater worry is the reinforcing of some of these restrictions as I intend to demonstrate. Non-Belgian coach and bus traffic travelling in Bel gium is legally subject to VAT on the amounts spent in that country. The administrative formalities concerned being so complex and costly, coach company oper ators prefer to pay the so-called 'fine' of BF 300 on arrival at the Belgian border and thus dispense with the whole paraphernalia. On entering the Federal Republic of Germany coach and bus traffic is subject to a sort of road tax calculated per passenger-kilo metre. This is shortly to be increased by 67%. The procedure involved here is also very time-consuming, often causing additional delays on the border. A third example in this area of just how far things can go within the Community is that both France and the Federal Republic have a tax and duty free maximum import quantity of 100 litres of fuel present in the vehicle. Quantities in excess of this are subject to addi tional excise duty. This is also time-consuming as additional fuel-stops must be allowed for in the vehi cles' itinerary. A final example: the United Kingdom still maintains such entry formalities for coach and bus traffic that most Continental coach operators are obliged to fit their vehicles with special equipment, more often than not British, to qualify for entry to the U.K. I must say, and not without a little national pride, that occasional international passenger traffic by road in the Netherlands is entirely free of restrictions. We would like to hear when the Commission intends to deal with these and other impediments among the Member States. Like the rapporteur and Mr Seefeld and a lot of other speakers we are also uneasy about the difficulties that have recently arisen with Yugosla via, in particular as this could have serious conse quences for one of our Member States, namely ",

I would ask the Commission to provide a more detailed answer and to state whether any progress has been made in the meantime in the search for a solution to the con flict with Yugoslavia. We hope that the Commission will deal fully with the questions and comments of the Members of the House. On a previous occasion I had reason to express my displeasure at the answers given by the then Commissioner responsible for transport policy and I trust that, after Commissioner Andries- sen's answer, such a measure on my part will not be called for again. President. \u2014 I call the Commission. Mr Andriessen, Member of the Commission. \u2014 (NL) Mr President, first a few remarks on the resolu tion under discussion and then one sole remark on the introduction by Members of matters not formally part of the agenda, that is, which are unrelated to passen ger traffic within the Community. On the first point, the Commission is heartened at Parliament's positive reception, as seen from today's debate, of the agreement on the international carriage of passengers by road by means of occasional coach and bus services (ASOR). This agreement represents a first step towards a closer cooperation between the Community and other European States and is also the first international agreement of its kind. It furthers the development of tourist traffic and, as such, of the economic expansion of a number of Member States and other countries and is, as a number of speakers noted, the first application of the Community's exclu sive powers concerning external relations in transport matters. The Commission shares the wish expressed in the resolution that this is but a first step in a much longer process. I can also inform the House that the Commis sion has very recently approved a motion for a resolu tion by the Council which authorized the Commission to begin negotiations on an agreement between the EEC and third countries concerning the regulation of international road passenger traffic by commuter bus services and special forms of regular transport. This second dossier has been presented to the Council and we are currently awaiting a decision on it. Mr President, as most Members of the House, the Commission regrets Yugoslavia's inability at present to comply with the terms of the ASOR agreement despite its participation at the negotiations. The problems are compounded by Yugoslavia's desire to be involved in the transport of Yugoslavians from the Community States in which they work to Yugoslavia for periods as short as several days. This gave rise to a number of technical problems which I am at present unable to clarify for the House, but I can assure the Members that my fellow Commissioner who is responsible for transport will provide the House with details. I can assure the House that the Commission has done every thing within its power and is still continuing its efforts to prevail upon Yugoslavia to ratify the ASOR agree ment. The Commission does not rule out success and Yugoslavia has reaffirmed its desire to find an interim solution for the flow of traffic to and from Greece via Yugoslavia until the latter's adhesion to the ASOR agreement. This is a point of some relevance to the remarks made earlier by Mr Kazazis. Then, Mr President, as expected, most of the Mem bers raised the issue of passenger traffic within the Community, in some instances, as with Mr Eisma, illustrating their comments with examples of existing anomalies. I am afraid I have no answer to the ques tion as to whether the Commission, following the questions put to it on 12 December 1978 by Mr Nyborg, had resolved to take action on the matter and, if so, what action they have taken. I fear that going into this matter will not take us very much fur ther as regards resolving the aforementioned anomal ies. It would be of more practical value if I reassure the House that my fellow Commissioner in charge of transport policy will hold discussions in the near future with the House Committee on Transport on the meas ures he envisages to combat the problems existing on this point in various Member States and the realistic chances of reaching a solution in the near future. I fully support the comments already made. One must not limit the measures in this sphere to the Com munity/third countries context but rather one should, as Mr Nyborg expressed it so colourfully, first put one's own house in order before attempting to win over others to one's point of view. Consequently I feel that, as far as this is concerned, the pressure the House is bringing to bear can be no more than an inducement to the Commission to take action on this matter. I shall do my best to persuade the Council to look favourably upon the request for action. Mr President, on the second subject I would like to reassure the House that the Commission is pursuing its endeavours and hopes to be in a position to discuss the relevant details with the Committee in the near future. President. \u2014 The debate is closed. The vote will be taken at the next voting time. 7. System of air traffic President. \u2014 The next item is the report (Doc. 1-211/ 82), by Mr Albers, on behalf of the Committee on Transport, on the improvement of the European sys tem of air traffic control. ",
        "No 1-286/22 Debates of the European Parliament 14.6.82 President I call the rapporteur. Mr Albers, rapporteur. \u2014 (NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one may very well ask oneself whether it is really necessary to present yet another report on the improvement of the European system of air traffic control, given the fact that Parliament has given ample consideration to this subject over the past years. I am thinking of the public hearings organized by the Com mittee on Transport following the reports of our for mer colleague Mr No\u00e8 in 1978 and 1979, and that by Mr Janssen van Raay which was dealt with by the directly-elected Parliament in 1980. Notwithstanding this, Mr Janssen van Raay deemed it necessary, and rightly so, to present a further draft resolution the fol lowing year (1981), for it appears that despite political pressure from Parliament and despite unfavourable reception given to the various proposed measures by individual national parliaments such as the Lower Houses of the Netherlands Parliament, and of the Federal Republic, there is little readiness to harmonize air traffic control and air traffic Europe-wide. On the contrary there is a clear tendency to renationalize despite the commitments referred to above and the wishes of those most affected \u2014 air passengers, air lines, IATA and the military authorities. The publication in the summer of 1981 of the results of a feasibility study commissioned by Eurocontrol's Standing Committee showed a positive reception of the idea of extending the Maastricht centre. This led to immediate outcries from various national govern ments which resulted in the Standing Committee coni 1 - missioning a futher report, this time from a consulta tive working party comprising experts from the three Benelux countries and the Federal Republic, with the addition of some military personnel as observers. Their findings, although published some time between the end of April and early May, were not made available to us until later. It outlines five possibilities: the third can be called the maintenance of the status quo which distinguishes between high- and low-flying aircraft. The fourth is a variation on the same theme. The second would mean a total concentration of air traffic control including that of approach traffic while the fifth would involve a resumption by national au thorities of responsibility for air traffic, that is a \u00abna tionalization. Finally the first possibility proceeds from the continuation of the Maastricht Control Centre with, in addition, the entire ongoing air traffic control back-up services and would entail transferral of cer tain services from Amsterdam to Maastricht. It is partic ularly heartening that the Dutch Secretary of State in a letter to the Lower House of the Netherlands Parlia ment of 27 May 1982 opted for the first of the five aforementioned possibilities as being the most merito rious. This followed consultations he had on the mat ter with his European counterparts on 18 May 1982. In the case of Belgium and Luxembourg it is regretta ble that, although giving the edge to concept one, they have made no final commitment in view of the Federal Republic's reticence regarding concept one and its evi dent preference for either concept four or five. The latter would involve transferral of current services from Maastricht to Bremen, D\u00fcsseldorf and Brussels. In the choice of a site it is obvious that investment costs play only a secondary role to that of personnel costs and personnel ramifications. The latter may be summarized as follows: concept one involves a work force which would be 700 less than concept four and 400 less than concept five. But upon examination a number of question become apparent regarding the juggling of the figures and one wonders if the report does not even contain demonstrable errors, in parti cular whether the phenomenon of natural wastage has been fully taken into account. After all, we are talking of a scheme which will be spread over a period of 10 to 15 years and air traffic controllers work on average to 55 years. In the opinion of the Committee on Transport it is vitally important that the way to a European solution must be kept open and this has led us in our report to strongly oppose the disintegration of the Eurocontrol centre in Maastricht. Generally speaking one can say that air traffic control and regulation is clearly of a dimension which, as such, should be consolidated and not parcelled out. Security and regulation of air traffic should be coordinated and integrated as is the case in the United States. This would result in spin-offs for the European electronic and computer industry. Eurocontrol has the know-how, experience and the very finest equipment imaginable. On this coming 29 June 1982 the Standing Committee reconvenes. The Committee on Transport's report is therefore a timely one given that we may not realisti cally expect a final decision to emerge from that meet ing which will undoubtedly delve further into the aforementioned five possibilities. One should keep in mind that the participants, as ministers responsible for transport matters in the Community have a responsi bility, under the Treaty of Rome, for the development of a Community transport policy. The Committee on Transport considers air traffic to come under this heading. Consequently, in section three of our report we appeal to the Standing Committee of Eurocontrol to affirm the future of the Maastricht Control Centre. In section seven we exhort the Council of Ministers to counter any tendency towards \u00abnationalization of air traffic control and in section eight we ask the Council to empower the Commission to develop an integrated Community-wide air traffic system and in like manner to stimulate open negotiations for cooperation with third countries. As matters are now entering a crucial stage it would be judicious for the House in its turn to empower the Committee on Transport to continue its efforts in col laboration with the relevant bodies and with our col- ",
        "14.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/23 Albers leagues of the national parliaments, to find an optimal solution. Mr President, I would like to mention that the report bearing my name was adopted unanimously by the Committee on Transport. I can only hope that the House follows the example of the Committee on Transport in its vote on the report. President. \u2014 I call the Committee on Transport. Mr Seefeld, chairman of the Committee on Transport. \u2014 (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am really very sorry to have to speak yet again in a debate on Eurocontrol. 1978, 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982 \u2014year in, year out, this Parliament has raised its voice and called for the continuation of Eurocontrol, but the sword of Damocles still hangs over this important European organization. For me the fact that we are again having to discuss Eurocontrol today is proof that there is still no cohe sive European transport policy. If there were, major importance would have to be attached to air transport policy, and an air transport policy without air safety would be absolutely inconceivable. The Commission and the Council of Ministers have made a start. The Council has looked into the question of noise pollu tion caused by aircraft. But no one has yet taken any interest in the question of how safety in the air is to be ensured and how existing organizations should be completely integrated into a concept of this kind. Years ago the European Parliament's Committee on Transport organized a hearing at which experts, pilots' and military representatives, IATA and air traffic con trollers spoke, experts from every sector therefore, and they told us about the growing number of aircraft in the air, the ever higher speeds at which they fly, the rate at which air space was becoming limited and the need to try to achieve the highest possible level of safety in the smallest possible space. What they had to say about Eurocontrol was positive. But what do the governments concerned do? They ignore all that. Some who were involved have the great idea of nationalizing certain things. Others, who are members of Eurocontrol, make no use of it all because they are afraid of disclosing various national secrets. One of the most atrocious answers I have ever heard was given to me by a former French Minister of Transport. In a letter, which I have before me, he said he could not imagine French air space being controlled by other than French air traffic controllers. The man should have asked for his tuition fees back. He could have found out very quickly that, for example, the Eurocontrol centre in Karlsruhe, which is unfortun ately not responsible for the place at which we are meeting today, could very easily monitor any aircraft over Strasbourg on its radar screens. But no, it must not be done from there, a separate organization has to be set up. Someone said recently that even after 25 years of the European Community we still unfortunately have the nonsense of air space frontiers in Europe. I therefore feel we should take Mr Albers's report as an opportun ity to urge this Parliament once again to be untiring in raising its voice and protesting against the unwilling ness to allow an organization that operates so magnifi cently to continue to exist in its present form. On behalf of my group I wish to say that we fully agree with the contents of Mr Albers's report. But we also endorse the view of the trade union representa tives of the Eurocontrol staff that the application of the convention and the work of the organization should be subject to permanent parliamentary control, a kind of political supervision, as it were. I feel we are best suited to this task, since our national colleagues are unfortunately often entangled in national consi derations. The Eurocontrol agency is a European institution which works. Eurocontrol is an instituion which is capable of doing more. Eurocontrol is an agency which should not be destroyed out of hand, and I therefore take this opportunity to appeal to the Mem ber States which do not make use of Eurocontrol to overcome their national egoism and to let it become fully active for them, the signatories. I appeal to the new Member States to join Eurocon trol, as some have already done, and I appeal to those who now refer to national considerations to support Eurocontrol, not to neglect it. Eurocontrol should be expanded, not demolished. President. \u2014 I call the Group of the European Peo ple's Party (Christian-Democratic Group). Mr Janssen van Raay. \u2014 (NT) Mr President, col leagues, the Janssen van Raay resolution could not have had a better rapporteur than my colleague and friend Mr Albers. The Group of the European Peo ple's Party is pleased to give full and unanimous sup port to his report. That is the first point. Secondly, the moment is an opportune one for an oral debate on ex-Secretary of State, Mr Van den Doef's letter of 27 May 1982, to which Mr Albers has already referred, is scheduled for tomorrow in the Lower House of Parliament of the Netherlands. A timely moment indeed for this House to take up the matter once again. ",
        "No 1\u00ad286/24 Debates of the European Parliament 14.6.82 Janssen van Raay After years of reticence by the Dutch Government in complying with the Eurocontrol convention's decision on the transferral of air traffic control responsibilities from Schiphol to Beek ex\u00adSecretary of State, Mr Van den Doef, gave the first positive signals from a Dutch Government. Let me repeat: for years Dutch Govern\u00ad ments steadfastly refused to comply with a contractual commitment; in a letter of 6 May 1982, Mr Van den Doef came out for the first time in favour of Beek. Given the long delay in getting round to the matter it should come as no surprise that when a vote was even\u00ad tually taken on it in the Lower House of Parliament in the Netherlands it received all\u00adparty support, embrac\u00ad ing such differing ideologies as those of the Socialists, Christian Democrats, Democrats 66 and the Liberals. Quasi\u00adunanimity in no way detracts from the work of ex\u00adSecretary of State Van den Doef. The Group of the European People's Party still considers the optimal solution to lie in the integration and consolidation of all air traffic control in Beek whilst accepting that this is somewhat difficult at present. We welcome the fact that the Secretary of State has come out in favour of option one, which foresees the complete integration and consolidation in Beek of air traffic control with the exception of the approach control. Just a word on the Germans' evident preference for option four, that is, an integrated air traffic control for traffic above flight level 300. For numerous reasons we find this unacceptable. Here are two of them. An example of military/civilian cooperation takes place under flight level 300. This would be squandered if we approved option four. Secondly it would involve resti\u00ad tuting present responsibilities for air traffic control to the national governments and national authorities. Mr Seefeld correctly pointed out that we should expand rather than restrict Eurocontrol. faced, I think, with a very disturbing situation as has already been said by a number of speakers, because the proposed new convention on Eurocontrol appears to go right against the best interests of the European air traveller and of the airlines which carry them. Air transport costs in Europe are already higher than in the United States and there is absolutely no justifica\u00ad tion for further penalizing the air transport sector. It is doubly disturbing that the new proposed convention appears to go right away from the conclusions we our\u00ad selves have reached on the basis of the excellent Jans\u00ad sen van Raay report of two years ago. And then again, the new convention runs contrary to the whole spirit of the common transport policy and in particular of the new Community air transport policy that is begin\u00ad ning to take shape at this very time. Now how can this be? Is it a triumph of the bureau\u00ad crats over democracy? For certainly the powers\u00adthat\u00ad be seem very impervious to the voice of this Parlia\u00ad ment or, indeed, of any other and indeed they seem anxious to avoid overmuch debate. Now the facts of the situation are that under the pres\u00ad ent system it is a penalty on the airlines insofar as they are obliged to fly far greater distances than they need to and I very much doubt whether the proposed new convention would obviate that. We have also the fur\u00ad \u25a0 ther problem that there are long delays, we had, as you know sir, only today a delay of 50 minutes at Heathrow, so I think we can hardly say that the situ\u00ad ation is satisfactory. Therefore we would contend that we cannot really allow the authorities to get away with this without further debate and we would therefore argue strongly for a fresh look at this situation, and I hope that we shall get a robust reply from the Com\u00ad mission. I promised to keep it short but may I just end with a remark for Dutch ears? Mr Van Zeil, Minister in charge of Middle Class Affairs in Prime Minister Van Agt's second government, has just been given the Social Affairs portfolio in addition, in Van Agt's third government formation. My advice to the new Dutch Government would be to give Mr Van Zeil, preemi\u00ad nent in aviation matters, a third portfolio by naming him Secretary of State for Traffic and Waterways and Drainage with a brief to assure the completion of the Dutch Government's official policy study on the choice of air traffic option. This must be done between now and the formation of a new cabinet in the after\u00ad math of the forthcoming parliamentary elections in the Netherlands and they must choose option one. President. \u2014 I call the European Democratic Group. Mr Moorhouse. \u2014 Mr President, Mr Albers can cer\u00ad tainly count on our full support and we are extremely grateful to him for his continued efforts to keep the concept of Eurocontrol alive. Now we are certainly President. \u2014 I call the Liberal and Democratic Group. Mr Berkhouwer. \u2014 (NL) Mr President, I too would welcome a robust answer from the Commission for a change but I have my doubts that anything will come of it. The man with the responsibility in question is anything but robust. We are confronted here with one of the most striking examples of our national States taking retrograde steps by doing exactly the opposite of that which technology demands of politicians \u2014 in so far as the latter could be said to be really bent on creating political dimensions, in an age of planetariza\u00ad tion, namely, that which complies with the dimensions imposed upon us by technology. I hope Commissioner Andriessen understands my remark. It is almost a Catholic People's Party refrain from Romme's time and I hope that the Commission, just for this once, will desist from the usual nonsensensical answers they provide us with. For there exists here for all true representatives of the people of Europe a duty to tell the national political instances that they are blind with their eyes open and deaf in one ear; in other words, that they run about with blinkers. ",
        "14.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/25 Berkhouwer Mr President, that is the political point I wished to make and all these technical details are beyond me. The whole drama around a European air traffic con trol has, in these days, taken on more the appearance of a sort of Black Peter game in which the participat ing countries take turns in accusing the others while completely ignoring the crying necessity for a real international European solution. Once it seemed as though the Netherlands was the naughty boy; now it would seem that it has passed on the dubious distinc tion in an easterly direction but the essential point is this : the real control of the air above 9 500 meters rev erts to national hands; in other words, Eurocontrol as an institute would be kept on but it would be stripped of its most important task and Maastricht is in danger of being closed down. Mr President, I can only repeat the sentiments of the speaker who preceded me. I should now like nothing better than for the Commission, the existing European Commission, to summon up its courage and give us for once a robust reply and in so doing to prove that it is a European institute rather than a group of ambassa dors from national governments. President. \u2014 I call the non-attached Members. Mr Buttafuoco. \u2014 (IT) I simply wish to support very rapidly the protests which have been made here which stress the lack of a common transport policy and, on my own behalf and on behalf of my colleagues, express our full support for Mr Albers's report. President. \u2014 I call the Commission. Mr Andriessen, Member of the Commission. \u2014 (NL) Hoping that in the eyes and ears of the honour able Member, Mr Berkhouwer, I refrain from speak ing rubbish this time, I too, should like to keep my contribution to this debate very short. As the House is well aware the Commission has, in the past, always had the same attitude to air traffic as that expressed by so many speakers today, and in particular to the arguments so convincingly expressed in the Committee on Transport's resolution. That is not the problem and, unfortunately, Mr President, it is less a problem of robust replies from the Commission than one of political willingness of the Member States, that is of the Member States' parliaments. If one has felt it necessary to stress in this House tonight the import ance of tomorrow's debate in the Dutch parliament then the robust answers should be emanating from national parliaments and governments in this area. The views of this House and those of the Commission are very clear. I feel therefore that as far as this goes my answer can be very short and very vigorous. I totally agree with the manner in which the problem is presented in Mr Albers's report, a sober, clear but, in my opinion, scarcely convincing manner. I subscribe to the view that a lasting appeal must be made to those who, in the final analysis, have the decision-making responsibility, and I can assure the House that where the Commission can be of any help it is not blind to aviation problems. Mr President, this should be clear from the fact that discussions are currently taking place on a wide range of Commission proposals in other areas. Mr Moorehouse rightly pointed this out. From this it should be clear that the Commission, for its part, will do everything possible to contribute to the solution which it also esteems to be the only justifiable one. President. \u2014 The debate is closed. The vote will be taken at the next voting time. (The sitting was closedat 8p.m.) 1 Agenda for next sitting: see Minutes. ",

        "No 1-286/30 Debates of the European Parliament 15.6.82 Mr Maffre-Baug\u00e9, rapporteur. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, as with regions, so with countries, continents and peo ple: there are those that are rich and those that are poor. Where agriculture is concerned, the Mediterranean producing areas count among the poor ones. Devotion to human interests, which purportedly was the doc trine on which the economic Community was founded, had it not been so shamefully disregarded, should have led to an attenuation of social and eco nomic inequalities. The initial policy as conveyed by the spirit of the Rome Treaty has in fact been quickly blown off course and all too often today seems to fall short of expectations. For a great many agricultural workers the desired objective has not been attained. Their situation has in many cases deteriorated and the various attempts to rectify it have proved to be of no avail. It is a fact that numerous regions in the United Kingdom, Italy, Ger many, Greece, Ireland, or wherever, are experiencing the same sense of disenchantment. The disparities have grown worse and the number of anxious, dismayed and bitter farm workers continues to grow also. They do not know what to make of this common agricul tural policy which they had been given to understand would be like a horn of plenty to them; they are won dering what good it is doing them. Because Com munity agriculture has been such a disappointment, disaffection is liable to spread from the economic or social field to the political field. It is time, in other words, for Parliament to stop and rethink. If the CAP as a whole has been a disappoint ment, you can imagine what the feelings are about cer tain product lines in certain regions of Europe, like fruit and vegetables. Not only do you have the usual problems due to the peculiarity of these sectors, but on top of them you also have the imbalance between the North and the South. Community regulations have been botched, guarantees varying according to prod uct line. Some producers get their price, whilst others can only hope for a theoretical support, fixed on the basis of target prices. Some of them do not benefit from any guarantees or market support at all. In addition, the mechanisms are so complex that inter vention frequently comes too late. It is astounding with what lack of thought regulations have been drawn up, so much so that one might be forgiven for imputing some political motive. One can lose oneself in the maze of regulations and intervention mecha nisms: a cat couldn't find its kittens in such a maze . . . I have tried on many occasions to fathom the policy in this area, but I might as well batter my head against a brick wall because there is nothing consistent or rational about these regulations. We started off with an ill-conceived legislation which we keep patching and papering over cracks as they appear. The building is a mess. Rather than starting it again from scratch we have those who delude themselves that they are strengthening it. What dismal architects! But the worst of it is that the walls are falling in not on them but on the farm workers. Let us consider the importance of the fruit and vegeta ble sector for producers and consumers. In the case of fruit we are talking of 1 100 000 hectares with a total production of 20 million tonnes a year, in the case of vegetables it is 900 000 hectares and 28 million tonnes a year. Two million people are involved, 8 million tonnes of produce are processed. But on it also depend the equilibrium of trade balances, employment in the producing Member States and the social and regional future of the Community's least-favoured areas. What is more, these products suffer from extremely variable harvests due to their susceptibility to the weather. It is difficult to guarantee the Community's self-sufficiency without certain reserves provided by surpluses which are essential if we are to avoid short-term production imbalances, which would be disastrous. And with such diversified and highly fickle markets exposed to the full force of King's law, any indiscrimi nate imports tend to upset the precarious balances resulting from the rather indifferent set of intervention measures that we have at present. However, it is not this production sector that is draining the financial resources of the EAGGF. It accounts for no more than 4 to 6% of total market support expenditure. And, incidentally, 70% of this goes on processed products. One could go so far as to talk of a shambles that regu larly has the producers up in arms. What are the Commission's proposals? The Commis sion is thinking along two lines: strengthening pro ducers' organizations and changing the way the mar kets are organized. We support the system of aid to groups of producers but we ask that no decision on extending standards to producers, as the Commission is proposing, be taken until after the people in the region concerned have been consulted. The Commis sion's proposals regarding the activation of the so-called 'grave crisis' procedure, that is to say the one to be applied in the event of a slump in market prices, constitutes an improvement over the regulations that we have at present but still do not go far enough. It is true that they offer the Commission the possibility of implementing a procedure allowing purchases to be made on the open market; one cannot but regret, howeyer, that these are applicable to only a limited number of products. Moreover, they cannot take place until the crisis situation has already made itself felt at the level of the wholesale trade. It is in the area of pro tection against imports that the Commission's propos als are most limited. To take into account the Com munity product price in calculating the entry price is a positive move, but it only applies to three products. We are particularly concerned at the Commission's intention to abolish the imports timetable in exchange for an extension of the reference price system. We are very much against this and urge it to abandon any ",
        "15.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/31 Maffre-Baug\u00e9 such plans. The improvements envisaged by the Com mission would entail an annual increase in the EAGGF of 10 million ECU. This is very little, not to say deri sory, when you consider that this figure was put for ward simply to take account of Spain and Portugal's entry into the Community and not with any thought of adjustment for a hitherto backward sector. With this report, Mr President, I have sought to flesh out and adjust the Commission's proposals so as to make them more acceptable to our producers. We feel it is better to suggest than to criticize. This report tries to take a responsible attitude. These suggestions are a platform where each one of you can add his own con tribution, tighten or loosen a few bolts. To propose is not to impose. Flint will naturally become sharper through being rubbed against other flints. It is for this reason, Mr President, that I thought it expedient, in accordance with Rule 100(4) of the Rules of Procedure, to introduce into the explanatory statement the principal minority views which the Com mittee on Agriculture did not adopt. I am conscious of the fact that I am rapporteur for the Committee on Agriculture and not rapporteur simply for the regions or the country that I represent here. You will appre ciate that I can but hope that all or part of the propos als put forward will be listened to with an attentive ear, although I do not of course expect them to be received uncritically. The Council of Ministers, meet ing in London, looked at the question of Mediterra nean production and was supposed to have put solu tions forward by the end of March. Here we are now in June and nothing has been done. I urge the Commission to give consideration to the proposals of the Committee on Agriculture, as they will help the Council in reaching its decision. These proposals concentrate on certain priorities: to guaran tee producers a respectable income, to ensure the coherent and balanced development of the sector as a whole, to prevent marketing crises, to keep consumers supplied with products of good quality and at reason able prices, to ensure the uniform application of pro duction rules and constraints throughout the Member States, to respect the principle of Community prefer ence and to achieve better control over imports, espe cially by the strict observance of timetables, and finally to promote the sale of our products. Market management can be improved by reinforcing the withdrawal mechanism, that is to say by bringing it into play sooner, and by extending it to a greater num ber of products. But one thing is sure, namely that any measures taken to improve market management will be compromised unless Community preference is rein forced. Community preference must be more strictly observed, primarily by extending the reference price system to all fruit and vegetables and by maintaining and introducing import timetables. The Committee on Agriculture has also drawn attention to the problems that enlargement would undoubtedly pose both for the Community producers and for the export trade of the countries of the Mediterranean and the ACP coun tries. In conclusion, Mr President, I want to say that I have tried to show how far matters have fallen behind and the need for a degree of adjustment and I have accordingly put together certain proposals designed to improve the situation. I could not end this speech without reference to what seems to me to be essential: where people figure in all this. It would be inconceiv able for us to debate economic matters without placing them in their proper context: a fair wage for the worker, in this case farm worker, protection of the rural environment and the chance for the individual to derive job satisfaction. Europe as we imagined it in the beginning was to devote itself to human interests. This cannot be achieved by words alone. Actions speak louder than words. So much is said about the North- South balance. It is high time appropriate measures were taken to achieve it. There is still time to save the fruit and vegetable sector, which provides so much employment. Today, this report goes beyond the usual strictly technical proposals. It is in the nature of an appeal and a witness. I am confident, Mr President, that it will not go unheard. President. \u2014 I call the Socialist Group. Mr Wettig. \u2014 (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentle men, I have a few comments to make on behalf of a minority of the Committee on Agriculture. The Commission has obviously been prompted by the criticism of the present organization of the market in fruit and vegetables and of insufficient support for Mediterranean products 'to put forward a package of proposals for a substantial improvement of the posi tion of producers in the Mediterranean area. As I see it, the Commission has adopted the wrong course with its proposals. It has included precisely those elements which have been criticized for years and, as a result of their inflexibility, have resulted in other sectors in our having to contend with considerable structural sur pluses, which place an undue burden on the Com munity's budget. I am not opposed to a proper Mediterranean policy, an accusation that is repeatedly levelled at anyone who expresses such criticism. We are simply opposed to measures which it is known from the outset cannot produce the desired result and will leave the Com munity's agricultural policy in an impasse. The propos als which have been submitted to us and have been underlined by Mr Maffre-Baug\u00e9 do not, in my view, take account of certain peculiarities of Mediterranean agriculture, one of which is the extremely small size of holdings in that area. This makes it impossible to start thinking about improving production. ",
        "No 1-286/32 Debates of the European Parliament 15.6.82 Wettig Another important point is that Mediterranean prod ucts are such that it is impossible, for example, to have fixed arrangements for intervention, since these prod ucts go bad so quickly that intervention would result in their landing on the rubbish heap. This is something which has attracted a great deal of criticism recently. The proposal the Commission makes here will even tually lead to an increase in intervention. It extends intervention to include two other products, and there is no denying that the tendency is undoubtedly towards all fruit and vegetables being subject to inter vention in the next few years. This is also explicitly proposed by the Maffre-Baug\u00e9 report. It should be realized that the additional cost the Community will have to bear will be far more than the figure the Commission quotes in its report. Its figures in this respect are extremely unrealistic. Even next year we shall see that costs cannot be kept down to this level. Criticism must also be levelled at the arrangements for producers' organizations, a subject which I cannot go into in great detail. Here again, an inflexible system has been chosen, one about which countries importing these products in particular must have considerable doubts, because this inflexible system for producers' organizations will certainly increase prices to the con sumer. The Commission must unfortunately accept the criticism \u2014 and this also applies to other sectors \u2014 that it has not taken sufficient account of consumer interests in its policy. This is also true if the extension of the reference price system and particularly of its proposals on tomatoes. Again, this can only increase the burden on the consumer and is hardly likely to improve the Community's reputation. At this juncture it must also be said that the proposed external economic arrangements \u2014 on which the Maffre-Baug\u00e9 report also dwells \u2014 are unwise, since they are not commensurate with the external policies of the Community's Member States. Important coun tries in the Mediterranean area have aligned their production with the Community market, and it would be utterly unreasonable of the Community to remove them from this market with very strict external eco nomic arrangements. All in all, this proposal by the Community and particu larly what the Maffre-Baug\u00e9 report has to say about it will aggravate a tendency which we consider disas trous. We have therefore tabled quite a number of amendments to the report, and we hope they will change the report sufficiently for us to be able to approve it. Should this not be the case, we shall not be able to endorse it. President. \u2014 I call the Group of the European Peo ple's Party (Christian-Democratic Group). Mr Kaloyiannis. \u2014 Mr President, in intervening I would like to comment that the rapporteur has pro duced a report which, though it may be based on the interests of fruit and vegetable producers, does not neglect the position of the consumer. He has also not omitted to mention that an improvement of the Com munity's policy in relation to each of the three chap ters of the report will serve the more general interests of the Community as well. It is indeed right that we should try to devote some attention to the needs of this production sector, in which several million agri cultural workers are engaged, and though it would still be possible to add a great deal to what has been said, let us for the moment be content with the follow ing: as a Greek, and therefore a native of a country very much involved in the fruit and vegetable growing sector, perhaps more so than any other in relation to our population as a whole, I have a particular sensitiv ity to, and understanding of the matter because have many times shared the agony of these producers when, sometimes because of weather conditions, at other times because of an unfavourable turn in the market, and sometimes because of the misguided Community or national policy, they have been reduced to real despair. The burying of citrus fruit is by no means a rare phenomenon in Greece, as elsewhere. For all these reasons I agree with the general lines of the report under discussion, and also because I have the impression that if the measures it proposes are finally adopted and applied correctly by the executive organs of the EEC, this will bring about an improvement in the sensitive area of fruit production, though I still hold certain views concerning the integration of these effective measures. In the short time available to me, I think it essential to recall certain well known statistics that might perhaps serve to assist the planning of more particular meas ures. In 1980 the production of fruit within the Com munity increased by 1% compared to 1979. The pro duction of apples and pears was slightly down, in contrast that of peaches and eating grapes increased by 3% and by 4% respectively, the production of vegeta bles remained at the same level as in 1979, in other words amounting to 28-5 million tonnes, Italy remained the main producer of soft fruit with 49%, and of vegetables with 42% of the total production within the Community, and the consumption of fruit in the Community during the year 1979-1980 increased by 0-7% to 19-1 million tonnes. The total internal consumption of vegetables increased by 1-9%, namely to 33-7 million tonnes. The market prices fluctuated considerably during the year, and in many cases they were based on temporary measures, such as equalizing subsidies of imports, and occasion ally on preservational measures. The quantities with drawn from the market were smaller in 1980-1981 (in the case of apples, peaches, cauliflowers and tomatoes) than in 1979-1980, but larger than in the case of other products such as pears. In trading, the imports of soft fruit to the Community excluding Greece were, in the case of most fruit and vegetable products, about the same in 1980 as in 1979, in other words about 4-5 mil lion tonnes. ",
        "15.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/33 Kaloyiannis In conclusion Mr President, with reference to another matter raised by the rapporteur, I would like to add that while Greece is not in principle opposed to Spain's joining the Community, in my humble opinion we would like to ensure that the final negotiations with Spain will include all the measures necessary to prevent a deterioration in the position of producers in this category in the Mediterranean States that are already members of the Community. I refer to this point because the rapporteur is clearly opposed to any enlargement of the European Community in the direc tion of Spain. President. \u2014 I call the Group of European Progressive Democrats. Mr Hord. \u2014 Mr President, my group is not en amoured with the Commission's proposals and it is very much against Mr Maffre-Baug\u00e9's report. We think that it is not only a long report but a bad report. We believe it to be something of a protectionist's charter. It is narrow, blinkered, self-centred, and I think its whole approach to the important sector of Mediterranean trade is totally unrealistic. In fact, Mr President, it poses very serious problems for Third World trade. It ignores the situation of Mediterranean countries with associated status vis-\u00e0-vis the Com munity. It ignores the vital trade links with many of the Lom\u00e9 countries who are interested in promoting agricultural trade themselves. I believe that Mr Maffre-Baug\u00e9's approach is wholly contrary to the liberalization of trade and therefore has to be condemned. It is so inwardlooking in fact, Mr President, that is goes almost to the point of saying we should not contemplate enlargement of the Com munity by taking in Spain and Portugal. I think it was only due to the fact that the Committee on Agriculture voted down an amendment to that effect that such a proposal is not in the report today. I would submit, Mr President, that in future the com mon agricultural policy will tend to be less interven tionist and not more interventionist, as Mr Maffre- Baug\u00e9 is insisting. The taxpayers of Europe are fed up with giving blank cheques for European agriculture. It is time to reduce the financial support for agriculture and give it to those areas in very real need, urgent need. On that basis, Mr President, my group will not be supporting the report in its present shape. President. \u2014 I call the Communist and Allies Group. Mr Vitale. \u2014 (IT) Mr President, we are glad that the Commission has at last expressed some ideas for the improvement of the market in fruits and vegetables. These products are fundamental for the Mediterra nean countries, and up to now they have been of only marginal cost to the Community, whatever may be said by Mr Hord, who goes so far as to consider an increase of expenditure in this sector as catastrophic. I must say, however, that the Commission's text unfortunately contains ideas which belong to an out dated way of thinking, that is\u00bf the policy of price sup ports on the one hand and the policy on structures on the other. In our amendment we stress instead the advisability of a connection \u2014 and this is the crux of my argument \u2014 between the two aspects. We ask that the mechanism of intervention be a selective one \u2014 this is the way to approach a serious policy on fruit \" and vegetable products \u2014 so that the types and quali ties in demand on the market may be favoured and the unwanted ones discouraged. With this, the very with drawal of the products would itself become the instru ment, not of an aid policy such as was being criticized a moment ago, but rather of a true restructuring in this sector. We therefore agree with the need felt by the Commis sion to strengthen the market mechanisms in this sec tor, but we do not approve of the contents of the Commission's document, because of the complete separation that exists between the factor of price sup ports and that of the reorientation of production. For this reason we will abstain from the final vote on the Commission's text, and \u2014 I regret to say, considering the excellent work done by Mr Maffre-Baug\u00e9 \u2014 we will also abstain on the text approved by the Com mittee on Agriculture, both because we do not agree that private businessmen as well as producers' associa tions should take part in the withdrawal operations \u2014 Mr Maffre-Baug\u00e9 did not agree on this point, but he was obliged to yield to a vote of the Committee on Agriculture \u2014 thus weakening the role of the pro ducers' associations, and because we feel that the approach is too exclusive \\ \u2014 here I agree with some of the preceding speakers \u2014 in regard to the products of other countries, the Mediterranean countries, and in particular the developing countries. We feel that in the fruit and vegetable sector, as perhaps in no other, it is necessary to take an overall view which is lacking in the text of the Committee on Agriculture, and this prevents us from giving it our support. President \u2014 I call the Liberal and Democratic Group. Mr Delatte. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, the volume of fruit and vegetable production in Europe is so great that it is imperative to have a regulation which will ensure both better use of our produce and a decent income for the growers. I would remind you that the Committee on Agricul ture in its report on the mandate of 30 May expressed the view that to develop regional policy in a way that would assist the Mediterranean regions would have only limited impact unless a complete set of regula tions was adopted for the fruit and vegetable sector. ",
        "No 1-286/34 Debates of the European Parliament 15.6.82 Delatte Agriculture is in effect vital to these areas and regional measures by themselves cannot guarantee the sort of decent income that a good regulation can. To this extent the process of European integration contains a serious flaw and something must be done to ensure that the benefits derived from a better organization of the Community markets are more equally shared between the producing areas in the North and the South of Europe. That is not to say, of course, as some of the amendments propose, that we shall find our selves tomorrow having to take from some to give to others. Our budget enables us to avoid that. My group accepts the report presented by Mr Maffre-Baug\u00e9 on behalf of the Committee on Agricul ture, with the reservations expressed in our amend ments. I must say, however, that a policy of economic recovery based on increasing the purchasing power of households can, in my opinion, have only an insignifi cant impact as regards any increase in the consump tion of fruit and vegetables and to suggest as much, as the report does, seems to me to be expecting the impossible. I would also point out to Mr Maffre- Baug\u00e9 the drawbacks of a policy of boosting consump tion by means of piecemeal decisions, and may I remind him that the French Government which he supports has just recently decided on a freeze on wages and prices, which invalidates this proposal so far as France is concerned. French workers will now no doubt be seeing a fall in their purchasing power and French producers are going to be penalized when it comes to exports by the introduction of new nega tive compensatory amounts. Furthermore, the rappor teur quite rightly stressed the need, to observe Com munity preference, which must be scrupulously re spected, but it would be a serious mistake to scrap the system of timetables as the Commission is proposing and on this point we are at one with the rapporteur. Just as prompt intervention before sectoral crises have a chance to spread, it can be very effective in preserv ing the equilibrium of the markets, given that we are dealing here with extremely sensitive products, both from the point of view of the uncertain volume of production and the difficulty of keeping produce for any length of time. It is perhaps regrettable in this con nection that the Commission has not adopted a mini mum price system in relation to trade within the Com munity. I would add that the organization of the markets justifies special attention being given to pro cessed products. The Commission has not offered any proposals on this point, or at any rate its proposals are rather imprecise, and here again I have to point out the principle of Community preference must be scru pulously observed for these products as well. Our trade with countries outside the Community can only benefit from a proper market organization that takes account of the vital complementarity of certain prod ucts. Mr President, I have conveyed to you the views of the Liberal Group. Fruit and vegetable production repre sents 12% of European agricultural production as a whole; a sound market organization is imperative. In voting for this report we believe we are making a posi tive contribution to filling an existing gap in the com mon agricultural policy. (Applause) President. \u2014 I call Mr Vernimmen. Mr Vernimmen. \u2014 (NL) Mr President, Mr Maffre- Baug\u00e9's report is undoubtedly a serious attempt to attain a better organization of the market in fruit and vegetables. To me at least this report will be acceptable only if certain amendments tabled by Socialist col leagues are adopted. It is all too easy and all too sim ple to imagine that glass-house cultivation in the North wastes energy and to pursue a policy aimed at progressively dismantling this industry. This reasoning is false for various reasons. The first of these reasons is social. In the Netherlands and Belgium alone 80 000 people are employed in this sector. Secondly, these crops are usually grown in very densely populated areas where the demand for quality products is constantly expanding and, as certain stu dies have shown, consumers are prepared to pay quite a reasonable price. Thirdly, British studies have revealed that the energy input, which at present is at a ratio of 20:1, can quickly be reduced to 3:1 through the application of new technologies, on which work is proceeding apace. In general, I can therefore say that the support they will receive for the reorientation and above all the rationalization of production will be a very important factor for all market-gardeners in the Community. In some countries this support is very well organized, while in others market-gardeners are very largely left to their own devices. There is also a need to consider how reasonable is the alternative of changing to other and, more specifically, smaller vegetable crops, and also the possibility of changing to flowers and, depending on market prospects, pot plants as a means of making the most efficient use pos sible of the area under glass. Something which certainly must not be overlooked, but to which too little attention is paid, is that crops grown under glass are far less dependent on weather conditions than crops grown outdoors, and that sup plies to the consumer in the Community must be ensured in the event of a poor harvest or poor weather. For all these reasons it seems to me realistic to set aside part of production for cultivation under glass today and tomorrow. It satisfies a real need, and I believe that this must be made clear in connection with this report. President. \u2014 I call Mrs Poirier. ",
        "15.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/35 Mrs Poirier. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, fruit and vegeta ble growers in our regions invest a great deal, run up heavy debts and work hard. But they are often forced to sell their produce at a loss or to destroy it. Faced with such a shambles, is it surprising that their discon tent at times explodes into violence? The initial meas ures taken by the French Government \u2014 tighter import controls, particularly in regard to Spanish pears and strawberries, a planned product office \u2014 are a hopeful sign, but the fundamental problems remain. We shall be talking about it today, but the malaise is deep-seated. Thus in my country the total area under orchards has fallen by 18% since 1970, whilst the number of growers has fallen by 22%. In the first four months of the year our trade deficit in fruit and vege tables has almost doubled compared to 1981, rising from 875 to 1 556 million francs, basically as a result of higher imports. At Community level, fruit and vegetable prices fell by 17% between February 1981 and Februar}' 1982. So, what is to be done? The first thing that is required is a substantial improvement in Community regulations, Let us bear in mind that the EAGGF has set aside only 4 to 6% of its expenditure for fruit and vegetable growers even though, as Mr Delatte has pointed out, their production represents 11 to 12% of the total. This injustice must be rectified as a matter of urgency. The Commission must without delay take up the proposals contained in the Maffre- Baug\u00e9 report to enable the Council to come to a final decision by the end of October 1982, in accordance with its undertaking. I note with satisfaction that the Committee on Agriculture is insisting on the need to tighten import controls, without which any improve ments in market management would be thrown into jeopardy. But we should see to it that these essential protective measures keep pace with enlargement of the Community, which is the justification for the amend ment we are tabling in this debate. Our action in the field with the growers has succeeded in putting back the date of enlargement. We are delighted by that but we shall continue the struggle with them. Enlargement of the common market means simply the enlargement of the war of the poor, which benefits no one but the big wholesalers and the consumer countries of the North. At any rate that is what they are doing already today in trying to make maximum capital out of crises on the Community markets without any of the benefit being passed on to the consumer. These periodic crises are damaging to the interests of the growers, whether they be French, Italian or Greek. To remedy this it is necessary to prevent the crisis spreading from one country to another. That is why, in another amend ment, we are proposing to regularize trade within the Community by establishing the concept of a minimum price, thereby respecting the principle of market unity, together with import timetables based on seasonal complementarity. We say yes to freedom of movement but not for the benefit of big business and at the expense of the growers. In my country, the govern ment is setting up product offices intended particularly to cover fruit and vegetables. They should constitute an effective means of revitalizing our production, rais ing the incomes of the growers and protecting them more effectively against imports, but we cannot allow their activities and their scope to be restricted arbitrar ily by Brussels. That is why we are pressing for Com munity regulations relating to fruit and vegetables to be amended and improved along the lines of our pro posals, so that our product offices are not prevented from performing their role. President. \u2014 I call Mr Adamou. Mr Adamou. \u2014 Mr President, though the report by the Committee for Agriculture has its positive aspects it still does not suffice to protect the interests of the producers, particularly now that the situation in rela tion to fruit and vegetables is to become more acute with the entry of Spain and Portugal. If Greek fruit and vegetable products are to be viable within the framework of a common organization of the market for these products, they will first all have to be brought into the system of pricing and intervention, and secondly, the mechanism in question will have to be effective. So far as Greece is concerned the mechanism of mar ket organization must become the exclusive concern of the cooperatives, and should in no case be left to pro ducer groups. Nearly all agricultural workers are organized into such cooperatives and only when the administration of the production, packaging and marketing of fruit and vegetable products is in the hands of the cooperatives are their interests assured. In contrast, producer groups operate in favour of the large landowners and their reinforcement will lead to the disappearance of the smallholders. Moreover, if all this administration is taken over by the cooperatives this will protect both the producers and the consumers from savage exploitation by mid dlemen. President. \u2014 I call Mr Sutra. Mr Sutra. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, as my group's speak ing time this morning is extremely difficult to share out, I shall say tomorrow, when we come to the explanations of vote, why the French members fo the Socialist Group support the report of my friend Emmanuel Maffre-Baug\u00e9, who did adopt our amend ments in the Committee on Agriculture. President. \u2014 I call the Commission. Mr Dalsager, Member of the Commission. \u2014 (DA) Mr President, the Commission has noted with great ",
        "No 1-286/36 Debates of the European Parliament 15.6.82 Dalsager interest Mr Maffre-Baug\u00e9's report on two proposals for a regulation amending the basic Regulation for fruit and vegetables, and I should like to express my appreciation of the impressive work which has been accomplished. Nevertheless, the Commission has to note that the report goes far beyond the proposals to amend the rules in that, practically speaking, it analyses the entire fruit and vegetables sector and, in that respect, to some extent covers the same ground as the own-initia tive report of Mr Sutra de Germa. The Commission will therefore limit itself to dealing in the first instance with those amendments proposed by the Committee on Agriculture which are concerned with linking the rules on groupings of producers to those firms bound by contractual arrangements. An amendment such as this is not easy to understand. If the producers' organi zations act as middlemen this addition is not necessary and, if on the contrary, sales are effected outside the producers' organization, there is no reason to take that production into account in the calculation of the launching aid paid to the producers' organizations. With regard to the amendment requiring consultations with representatives from the industry before any extension of the regulations is imposed, we hesitate first and foremost on purely practical grounds to go along with this, because what shall we do if the indus try lodges objections or comes out in complete opposi tion to any extension of the rules? Should we then simply not follow the views put forward by the indus try and, if so, what was the point of consulting it? Or should we follow those views and thereby run the risk of never being able to put into effect an arrangement which we feel would promote the stabilization of the fruit and vegetable market? Article 19b, which the Commission proposes should be added to Regulation No 1035/72, contains a number of provisions which may stabilize the market in certain sensitive products. The proposed amendments weaken if not nullify the effect aimed at in that, if they adopted, it will no longer be possible to allow a Mem ber State engaging in public purchases because there is a monetary production surplus to apply measures for the temporary limitation of quantities made available from that production for sale. If we drop Article 19c, as proposed in the report, we shall continue to allow products \u2014 and this applies exclusively to eating apples \u2014 to be stored over and above reasonable levels. For if they are not sold at the beginning of the following harvest season, they may be taken into intervention stores with the consequence that these products' will burden the market for the new harvest and distort it. The Commission does not think it very desirable at all events. On the other hand, we do not think it possible to extend the terms of Article 24(4), which provide that the prices of EEC products be taken into account in the calculation of entry prices for imported products compared with the reference price, to cover all prod ucts falling within the scope of the reference price arrangements. Leaving aside the three products arising in the Commission's proposal \u2014 eating grapes, peaches and tomatoes \u2014 the duty on all these prod ucts is linked to GATT, and the suspension of the obligation which the Community has entered into, for example, by the introduction of a countervailing duty, would not be justified on the basis of a fall in prices quoted for EEC products, which could simply be due to temporarily overabundant EEC production and not to excessive import levels. Finally, I would point out that the reason why the Commission has only proposed the addition of auber gines and apricots to the list of products covered by the intervention rules is that we are concerned more with typical Mediterranean products than, for exam ple, with green beans and artichokes and that this change in the EEC rules which we are proposing as a whole is designed to take into account the fact \u2014 it should not be forgotten \u2014 that Spain will soon be joining. Others have also referred to the problems of the Mediterranean in this context. I can inform the House that the Commission has a study in progress on these very problems and that this will soon be available to provide further information on the overall situation of these products in the Mediterranean, also in con junction with Spain's accession to the Community. IN THE CHAIR: MR VANDEWIELE Vice-President President. \u2014 I call the rapporteur. Mr Maffre-Baug\u00e9, rapporteur. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, my first duty is to thank all those who took part in the debate, each one expressing his own point of view and each one equally convinced that his point of view is right. As for myself, Mr President, I had to submerge my own feelings as a native of the Mediterranean when I agreed to be rapporteur for the Committee of Agriculture. As I said earlier, I took my role as rappor teur for the committee seriously and I hope I can clear the air somewhat by repeating it. Dealing with the remarks made by my colleagues point by point, I would say to Mr Wettig, who raised the worrying question of the surcharge, that this involves no more than 4 to 6% of total expenditure. In point of fact, therefore, the fruit and vegetable sector is one of those that has received least from the EAGGF, even though it is also one of the sectors experiencing the greatest difficulties. ",
        "15.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/37 Maffre 1 Baug\u00e9 I believe that on this question, which appears to be the essential point raised by Mr Wettig, we have tried to adopt a reasonable attitude. We have chosen to steer clear of demagoguery in our report because, Mr Dal sager, we have followed in your footsteps. All I will say, if you will allow me, is that we are endeavouring to go further. For if we Members of the European Parliament are expected to go along with the Commission on everything, well, I think we should know right away. If that is the case, there is no need for us to be elected by universal suffrage. We are here to express points of view, in an advisory capacity, which we in no way seek to impose, the power of deci sion in any case resting with the Council of Ministers. We merely wished to broaden these horizons. I thank Mr Kaloyannis for his praise of the Committee on Agriculture's report. I have to say that many people had a hand in its preparation. He brought up the ques tion of the negotiations with Spain, saying that it was in the interest of the Greeks to be very cautious in their approach to this. I do not wish to dwell on this point today, Mr President, because I am rapporteur and I have to keep to my task of rapporteur. Mr Hord, whilst I may have come here dressed ready for jousting, you have come equipped with a breast plate. And what a breastplate! A breastplate with which you are capable of demolishing everything that might be in any way constructive. Whereas I came armed with a wooden sword, you fought me with God knows what kind of missile. Believe me, Mr Hord, although I have a profound respect. .. President. \u2014 Mr Maffre-Baug\u00e9, I would point out that it is only because we have plenty of time now that the president is letting you speak in this way. This can not create a precedent for the future as the rapporteur may not answer each speaker. But since you are addressing a colleague, I fear I may be asked for per mission to reply. Please be brief, allow yourself two minutes, but do not open debate. Otherwise the presi dent will be sharply criticized. Mr Maffre-Baug\u00e9, rapporteur. \u2014 (FR) ... Thank you, Mr President, for bringing this point to my attention, I shall bear it in mind. I shall not quote anyone else. All I want to say is that, through this report \u2014 and I shall be as brief as possible \u2014 we have sought to make provision for the future for those producers who are going to find themselves in extreme difficulties in the coming years \u2014 you are not unaware of this and the Commission knows it very well. Every day, as someone has pointed out, some of our producers go to the wall. It is on their behalf and in the interest of a North-South balance, Mr President \u2014 and here I know what I am talking about because this is the theme of the report \u2014 that we have to give a demon stration, show proof of determination. It is not enough always to say that we agree to the restoration of the balance between the North and the South, and then, as soon as the South demands certains advantages, to refuse it them. Mr President, it is on that basis that we shall judge tomorrow's vote. President. \u2014 The debate is closed. The motion for a resolution will be put to the vote at the next voting time. 3. Agricultural structures President. \u2014 The next item is the report by Mr Dal sass, drawn up on behalf of the Committee on Agri culture, on the proposal from the Commission of the European Communities to the Council (Doc. 1-1089/ 81-COM(81) Final) for a directive amending Directive 72/159/EEC, 72/160/EEC and 72/161/EEC in rela tion to agricultural structures (Doc. 1-184/82). The following oral questions will be included in this debate: \u2014 oral question with debate by Mrs Barbarella and others to the Commission (Doc. 1-256/82): Subject: Advisory committees on agriculture With reference to the renewal of the advisory commit tees on agriculture will the Commission state: 1. When it intends to take a decision on the compo sition of these committees as this is long overdue? 2. Whether it does not believe it to be in its best interests to ensure that the relevant professional organizations are properly respected? 3. Whether it does not feel that the Italian Coopera tive Movement should have a suitable part to play in these committees, particularly a major organ ization such as the League of Cooperatives, which has so far been inexplicably excluded? \u2014 oral question with debate by Mr Papaefstratiou to the Commission (Doc. 1-337/82): Subject: Improvements in agricultural structures in Greece What special structural measures from among those proposed by Greece (and compared with those adopted by the other Member States) has the Commis sion submitted to the Council of Ministers since Greek accession to date, and what measures does it intend to propose to cope successfully and in good time with the problems that will otherwise affect Greek agriculture after the accession of Spain and Portugal? ",
        "No 1-286/38 Debates of the European Parliament 15.6.82 President. \u2014 I call the rapporteur. Mr Dalsass, rapporteur. \u2014 (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what we are'concerned with here is the proposal from the Commission of the European Communities to the Council for a directive amending Directives 72/159, 72/160 and 72/161 in relation to agricultural structures. When the Community was contemplating the intro duction of a common agricultural policy, its goal was to increase the productivity of agriculture in all the Member States by encouraging technical progress, rationalizing agricultural production and ensuring the optimal use of the means of production and of labour in particular. In other words, the aim was to produce more and more cheaply with a smaller input of capital and labour. This was designed not least to give the farming population a reasonable living by increasing the per capita incomes of those engaged in agriculture. This was intended to ensure that an appropriate number of jobs would be retained in agriculture and that the sub stantial difference between agricultural and non-agri cultural incomes would gradually be reduced. A further goal of the common agricultural policy was to stabilize markets and to ensure the supply of agri cultural products to the people at reasonable prices. It was clear from the outset that such ambitious goals would be achieved only if the organization of the mar ket was near-perfect. It is not enough to ensure free trade and the free movement of farm products within the Community. It is not enough to remove certain barriers to trade within the Community or even to re spect the Community preference. Nor is it enough to agree on a fine package of prices, although I should like to make it quite clear that prices are a very impor tant factor for the agricultural producer. But it is not enough to adopt a fine package of prices. It has always been necessary to think of the places of production, the agricultural holdings and their quanti tative and qualitative improvement. A better arrange ment must be provided for them, one that takes account of their size and makes for better rationaliza tion so that they can earn higher incomes at less expense. To permit this to be done uniformly in all the Member States, without some being given preference and others placed at a disadvantage, Directives 159, 160 and 161 on agricultural structures were adopted in 1972. They were followed in 1975 by the structural directives on hill farming. It was right and necessary, as I said, that these struc tural directives should be adopted: they could ensure that agriculture in one country was not encouraged to the detriment of agriculture in another and farmers in one country were not better off than farmers in another. If there was to be a fair balance, such directives had to be adopted and enforced. They were then incorporated by the various Member States into their legislation, and it can indeed be said that they have borne fruit after being in force for ten years. In some countries they were applied soon after their adoption in others \u2014 my own, for example \u2014 it was six or seven years before they were incorporated into national legislation. Nevertheless, I must say that they have borne fruit. The original directives expired in mid-April. To avoid a vacuum, the proposal now before the house seeks to extend the period of application from April 1982 pro visionally until the end of 1983. My report contains a number of statements which should be taken into account when the directives are reformulated. In particular, when the common agri cultural policy is reformed, or rather adjusted, the need for directives and measures concerning agricul tural structures should be emphasized, and this not only for the past but also for the future. The formula tion or reformulation, the rewording of the structural directives for the future, using the available monetary resources, should above all make it easier for young people to take up farming \u2014 and I stress this in my report and I should like to put it to the Commission as a proposal. In other words, young farmers should be given the opportunity of staying in agriculture or find ing a job in agriculture. We must try to get more young people into agriculture in the future because, if the average age of the farming population should become too high, we shall run the risk of seeing farms abandoned here and there \u2014 with, of course, all the negative consequences that can have. To make it easier for young people to take up farm ing, we must certainly try to ensure they receive pro per vocational training. This is another point my report emphasizes. In future, we must also pay parti cular attention to family farms, the nucleus of our agricultural policy, and take special account of them in measures to assist farmers. Priority must also be given in future to the weaker regions, the underdeveloped areas and the mountain ous areas in the use of monetary resources so as to reduce the gap between those who are better off. This has unfortunately not been achieved in the last ten years, and as a result the weak have often become a great deal weaker and the strong even stronger. In future, therefore, we must formulate the structural measures in such a way that a better, a fairer balance among the various regions and various countries is struck. Greater care must be taken to ensure that the low incomes of hill farmers, who are exposed to natural and structural disadvantages, are raised by means of higher compensatory payments or grants. I advocate ",
        "15.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/39 Dalsass this for hill farmers, although I am in fact inclined to be against making it a rule for lower incomes in agri culture to be improved with direct payments, because as a rule it must be totally rejected. Agriculture is an economic activity like any other, and it should be assisted according to its performance. But in areas in which we are all interested in seeing farm ing continue, such as mountainous areas, where the environment can be damaged by erosion and ava lanches, for example, if farming ceases, in areas, there fore, where the farmer preserves the beauty and recreational function of the countryside specifically for the non-agricultural population, we must make direct payments to farmers to assure them of a reason able income. These are a number of the suggestions I have made in my report. Many more could, of course, be made, but it is now for the Commission to draw up a practical proposal and to submit it to Parliament so that we may then consider it carefully. I cannot avoid criticizing the Commission for the delay that has occurred. It could have acted earlier and more quickly. We ought really to be considering the amended structural directives today and not to have to wait another eighteen months. After all, we had an extensive debate on the rewording and reformulation of the structural directives two years ago. Unfortunately, the Commission has acted too slowly. I cannot avoid criticizing it for this. I call on the Commission, or the appropriate Commissioner, Mr Dalsager, to submit the amended structural direc tives to Parliament no later than the end of this year or the beginning of 1983. That would enable the Com mittee on Agriculture and Parliament to consider the new proposals without any pressure and then to deliver an opinion. The new directives could then enter into force promptly on 1 January 1984. What I am saying is: act quickly so that Parliament is not again forced to rush its consideration of the matter. I should also like to see rather more understanding in future for structural improvements, on which very lit tle has been spent in recent years in relation to the agricultural expenditure. In other words, rather more resources should be made available for this purpose. This could help us to remove the inequalities among the various countries and regions and at last achieve the goals we have set ourselves in the Community Treaties. (Applause) President. \u2014 I call the Socialist Group. Mr Eyraud. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, Europe is an unfinished structure and this is due to a faltering polit ical will. It can and must find new inspiration, but it is certainly not by whatever problems arise being put off from one year to the next that the structure will come to be completed. It is an inescapable fact that a policy of free trade favours certain regions and certain producers. The majority of Socialists would like to correct these dif ferences by means of an adjustment in prices. As this method does not yet have majority support we have to concentrate our attention on the structures. To that extent we believe, like the rapporteur, that the Com mission must show a degree of imagination and come up with some measures before next spring, in time for them to replace or supplement those already in exist ence. Its first objective should be to provide an answer to the following question: what kind of agriculture are we looking to have at the end of the twentieth century? Do we want the sort of family-run farms that we see in the vast majority of the Community countries, ena bling particularly the young people, who are the farm ers of tomorrow, to make a decent living from the land? To answer this it is necessary first to define the status of the farmer, not condemn out of hand those that simultaneously engage in activities not related to farming if that will enable the agricultural holding to adapt to its environment and if that is the only effec tive means of combating the desertification which threatens so many regions of the Community. Second objective: any realistic structural policy must be accompanied by a regional economic development programme. In order to ensure a sufficient number of farmers it is necessary to offer them a decent income, which can be secured through a policy of guiding production and often through a policy of rational intensification based on three criteria: number of working persons per hectare, income per hectare and income per family holding. The third idea that needs exploring concerns measures to encourage the release of agricultural holdings, at the same time ensuring their continuing survival. Accordingly the payment of farmers' pensions should be dependent on their ceasing to farm. This ought moreover to apply not just to farmers but to all sectors of activity, which would undoubtedly help to ease the employment situation. There is a fourth possibility the Commission might consider, namely laying down a Community outline plan for structural changes which would coordinate parallel regional and provincial plans. I am thinking in particular of development areas which would need to be designated in an effort to do something about the increasing precariousness of numerous regions and agricultural holdings, regions where desertification has reached a point of no return, regions dependent on a single product, where farming has become over-spe cialized. It is with the aid of the law governing real ",
        "No 1-286/40 Debates of the European Parliament 15.6.82 Eyraud estate offices that France believes it can in the very near future give itself the necessary means to develop farming. These will offer more widespread opportuni ties for rental to young people without the financial resources to buy their own farms, they will permit control of agricultural structures and the determina tion, region by region, of the minimum viable acreage. But if one really wants the freed land to go to budding farmers, one needs to ban throughout the Community the breaking up of small farms, the establishment or expansion on what are in principle separate holdings by two members of a couple \u2014 each being able to farm without authorization so long as he or she does not go over the threshold beyond which controls apply \u2014 accumulation of holdings by inheritance, and the possibility for people holding down other jobs and having a minimum knowledge of farming to expand or establish themselves up to the limits laid down by com mon law. At the same time one would need as a matter of course to insist on a prior declaration in relation to every instance of establishment of expansion so that the structures commissions and offices can perform their task of verification as effectively as possible. In short, every possible measure relating to restructur ing, relief from real estate charges, adjustment of charges at premium rates to investment financing and the liquidity of the agricultural holding, must be looked into and introduced through development plans drawn up on a regional basis, for European agri culture differs widely from the Shetlands to Greece. To conclude, I should like to say how eager I am to see a revision of the texts setting out the criteria for defining less-favoured regions and mountain regions, simply to prevent the sort of gross injustices suffered by the department where' I come from, injustices which have been denounced for years by professional organizations and by the electorate and which never theless still persist. And so the Socialist Group will vote for the Dalsass report, although I hope, Mr Commissioner, that my suggestions and observations will be taken into consid eration. agricultural organization, because apart from defining the prices of agricultural products there are very ser ious material problems in various parts of the Com munity, particularly in the Mediterranean countries, and unless these are faced quickly and effectively I fear that in the future we will encounter many more matters and problems in connection with the inclusion of Spain and Portugal in the EEC, even though this is a matter concerning whose political expendience we are all in agreement. Having thanked and congratulated our colleague Mr Dalsass for the comprehensiveness of his report, I hope I will be allowed to propose certain specific measures. Firstly, special measures should be enacted for the economic relief of farmers in the EEC countries who unfortunately suffer the burden of above-average inflation. Secondly, and I ask the Commissioner to take special note of this, the principle of Community preference should be applied rigorously so that the Community's agricultural products should be absorbed by the mar kets within our Community, as would indeed be possi ble. Thirdly, Mediterranean products receive some support in order to reduce the differences in income that undoubtedly exist between the producers in the South and those in the North. Please allow me, further, to propose the adoption of the following measures designed to help Greek agri culture in particular, since because the lots are small and of poor quality and the production costs are high, it is clearly at a disadvantage compared with other countries in the Community from the standpoint of incomes. First of all, it will be necessary to equalize the prices determined for Greek products with the common agri cultural prices as soon as possible, by curtailing the period of transition. President. \u2014 I call the Group of the European Peo ple's Party (Christian-Democratic Group). Mr Papaefstratiou. \u2014 (GR) Mr President, fellow Members, now that we have reached a decision con cerning the determination of agricultural prices, which we know about and which, because of our notorious inability to arrive at a common agreement over a long period of time, led to the overthrow of the existing system of unanimity \u2014 a fact which is of course very significant and whose consequences for the relations between the Member States we do not yet know \u2014 we must indeed examine, and are quite rightly discussing in the Assembly today, the more general subject of Secondly, we ask that the rate of approach of the level of economic support towards that granted to the other countries in the Community should be accelerated, for example in relation to the subsidies granted for the production of olive oil, for the penetration of citrus fruit, for hard grain, etc. Thirdly, the EEC should subsidize the interest rates on short-term loans to Greek farmers, and indeed to farmers in other countries whose incomes are very low. Fourthly, it is also necessary to subsidize the means of production, such as fertilizers, plant medications, ani mal feedstuffs, and olive-gathering nets. ",
        "15.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/41 Papaefstratiou Fifthly, proper concern must be shown for those farm ers who are unfortunate enough to be cultivating under very difficult conditions, in mountainous or otherwise problematic areas. Sixthly, we should contemplate a programme of finance and technical assistance by the Community for land-improvement works in Greece, for the develop ment and modernization of fishing, for developing the lagoons and the large bays in the country, and for sup porting the foundation and organization of agricul tural manufacturing complexes. Mr President, we all desire to maintain cohesion within our Community, but we must bear in mind this depends largely on our willingness to make generous and just decisions in favour of the poorer farmers in the Community, who very often work under inhuman and extremely harsh conditions and who look to all the producers in the Community to secure for them incomes that provide them with some degree of dign ity. Fellow Members, let us not forget that they are the real backbone of our great European Community and that this is the light in which we should see them. (Applause) sary because it is in those areas that are less productive that we need really to give greater added-value to the products that come out of those areas. If we can increase the amount of money that those areas get for their production, that is the best thing we can do. We need a pump-priming exercise to do that. All structural money should, therefore, I believe, go to these areas and we should not be promoting the flow of finance into the areas of the Community which are agriculturally better off. For long enough we have seen our grants being given, for instance, for giving up dairying, and five years later some of these people have been re-applying to go back to dairying and getting money again from EAGGF funds so set up new dairies with new equip ment. Now that is totally wrong: I would have thought that if the Community is going to mean any thing where structural policy is concerned it should be concentrating on the less-favoured areas and at the same time it should be saying to national governments that if there are capital requirements in the Member States it should be up to the Member States themselves to finance the better-off areas under Community cri teria. With that, Mr President, we welcome the report. President. \u2014 I call the European Democratic Group. President. \u2014 I call the Communist and Allies Group. Mr Provan. \u2014 Firstly, let me say, Mr President, that I welcome this report that Mr Dalsass has put before us this morning. I think the whole tone of the report, as I said in committee, makes it a very satisfactory way of going about reporting on the Commission's proposal to extend these regulations. I think there is a slight difference, however, between Mr Dalsass' reason for extending the proposal and, perhaps, the reason I would like to see it extended. If I understand him correctly, he feels that the programme has not had sufficient time in which to bear fruit. I believe, perhaps slightly differently, that the reason that the scheme has not been totally successful so far is that the amount of money available in the budget for carrying out these structural changes has not been suf ficient. I would have thought that if the scheme had been more attractive, we would have seen a quicker take-up of the suggestions. However, we do welcome the extensions and hope that they will be seen to be successful as time goes on. But one would, I think, welcome the report mainly because of the emphasis that I see in it on trying to suggest to the Commission that in the longer term we want to see structural money from the EAGGF going to the less-favoured areas. I think that is the really important point that is stressed in Mr Dalsass' report. There is no doubt in my mind that this new doctrine of putting money into the less-favoured areas is neces- Mr Kyrkos. \u2014 Mr President, we believe that the time allowed for applying the measures designed to improve the organization of agriculture should be extended beyond two years in the case of some regions and for the Mediterranean countries in the Com munity. For example, Greece, the most recent member of the Community, has derived hardly any benefit, even though as is known she has extremely acute organiza tional problems, a low proportion of arable land, a low rate of industrial transformation, weak forms of coop erative organizations, high production costs, etc. In contrast, the highly-developed countries in the EEC, those with firm infrastructures, administrative mechanisms adequate for the task of planning pro grammes, and advanced agriculture, have derived great benefit. These are mainly the countries whose political representatives, with their conservative ten dencies, object so strongly even in this House when, in the name of the common interests of the peoples in the Community, we of the southern part of Europe ask for increased concern and improved support for a reor ganization of agriculture to the benefit of our farmers and not aimed at their ruin. And in this connection I support, without repeating them, the proposals put by my colleague Mr Papaefstratiou. I would now like to ask those colleagues who have demanded with some fury that we should stop issuing ",
        "No 1-286/42 Debates of the European Parliament 15.6.82 Kyrkos blank cheques to the benefit of the producers, whether they would prefer us to flood the squares of their cities with our unsold agricultural products, fruit, vegetables and others, so that they may become aware that the problem is not just ours but theirs as well? We therefore ask that the Community should face up to the need to offer support, by means of immediate additional measures extended for the requisite period of time and certainly for much longer than two years, to countries with very acute organizational problems, such as Greece, Ireland, southern Italy, and possibly others like Spain and Portugal, and that powerful incentives should at once be created for the develop ment of productive associations as proposed by Mr Dalsass, which in Greece consist mainly of cooperative organizations. President. \u2014 I call the Group of European Progressive Democrats. Mrs Ewing. \u2014 Mr President, my group supports Mr Dalsass. I am sure it will not be any surprise to any Member of this House that I, of course, do represent an extremely peripheral, less-favoured and mountain ous area. I wish when people were throwing out the list of these areas \u2014 perhaps I could appeal to my Greek colleagues here, who mention Ireland \u2014 that they please add the Highlands of Scotland. Whatever criterion you adopt we must be able, I think, to meet it, and even stand comparison with arid parts on the periphery of Greece. So my area certainly owes Mr Dalsass a vote of thanks for his efforts here and natur ally, along with my group, I support the period being extended as suggested. There are one or two things I would like to say quite quickly \u2014 we support the Committee on Agriculture's view that there should be increased monitoring of national-aid measures. These get a lot of publicity in the press when there is something that one State believes another State is doing unfairly and I would suggest that these, above all, bring the Community into disrepute in the mind of the man in the street. I do feel we should all take these things very seriously and try to eliminate national-aid measures where they are clearly unfair. I would like to support some of the general proposi tions here, for instance assisting young farmers \u2014 now I throw out the only experience I have at first hand. In my area it is virtually impossible for a young farmer to acquire a farm in any sense of ownership and very dif ficult to acquire a farm even as a tenant. That is the situation that we have come to; there is a land hunger, although there is plenty of land lying fallow. That can not be in the interest of anyone. Someone mentioned the fact that farmers are getting older. They cannot even by tax structures, in my area, easily pass on the farm to members of their family unless they arrange to do so many, many years in ad vance of the time they would really want to do it. So I would suggest that we have to look at the problem of young men acquiring farms one way or another. Someone also mentioned soft-interest arrangements. Well, that obviously is at the crux of it but there is more to it in some cases. There is the problem of the land and the way it is used as a tax structure in some States. I suggest that there must be some land-bank arrangement for looking specifically at the need to get young men to farm the land because they have the energy, they have the new ideas, and I feel it is to the advantage of us all. Mention has been made of lower incomes. People like myself have often been on our feet talking about the amazing drop in real terms of farmers' incomes in areas like mine, particularly in the more remote parts, and anything that can be done to treat such areas as areas of priority I think we should all support. What ever variety we have in our farming in our Member States, I think we are all united in agreeing that the rush to the cities cannot be a good thing; that the overconcentration of population, the overurbanization of our Community, cannot be a good thing. That creates social problems in itself. Rural communities tend to be remarkably free of social problems, rural communities tend to be stable and we should be encouraging people to stay on the land, however diffi cult it may be to farm certain types of area. Instead of punishing them by the costs involved of distance and peripheries, tax systems, we should be saying, well done, if you wish to farm in a mountain area, or an island, or a faraway place, do that, we will try and find policies that will help you. And if that means it will cost more of the cake I think you will have to look at it, because who wants a Community with peripheries turned into deserts with no people and I assure you that is the situation I am in with already only eight people per square kilometre, and many dead villages, and more and more coming along all the time. Now, someone mentioned fishing and I must say I speak often enough about that, so I do not think I will bring it in, save to say that to some extent it is indigen ous and in some areas fishing is the complement to agriculture. We still lack a common fisheries policy and there is the incredible fact that this Parliament passed in the month of April a resolution condemning the Council for not having discussed this; yet since December the Council still have not met, although I believe they may actually be meeting today or tomor row. Let us hope that it is not one of the other meet ings they cancel. I think that this report, in giving priority to areas that have been mentioned and listed, must be deserving of unanimous support here. Lastly, I wonder if I could ask the Parliament to cast, its mind back to my unfortunate resolution which had ",
        "15.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/43 Ewing the support of the Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on Budgets for an agricultural develop ment programme for the Highlands and Islands of Scotland. It was one of those few amendments that lost out because of our coffee break when the ma chinery broke down. Now I had all the support that was needed of the House but I just failed, because of this rather curious freak situation, to get the support. However, I am happy to say that following a resolu tion, the Committee on Agriculture is now appointing a rapporteur on this, who is in the House here, who just spoke, and I am hoping that he will come along with a proposal to support this area. My area should be regarded as precious because places with few people are so valuable in a Community which is so densely populated. The whole Community should be caring about the survival and the economy of the really remote pans. At the same time, while remote ness is attractive to the tourist, it is not attractive if there are no people there and if land lies fallow which could quite well be in use. This report talks of support ing cooperatives. That is a very good proposal because in remote areas self-help can improve the situation. Farmers get together, buy in bulk, and reduce their costs. This is being done. I am not asking you to help farmers who do not help themselves. These coopera tives are taking off all over my area, as I am sure they are in other parts of the Community, and they are deserving of your help. A final word. I know it may be a matter of translation here, but some of the speakers have referred to 'peas ants'. Well, we do not have any peasants in Scotland. The peasant, as you call him, is liable to have a son who is a professor at Edinburgh University, as my son is, and really and truly every time I here the word it makes me very upset. I suppose it is only a matter of translation and it may be that the word in another lan guage does not have the same connotation. So for these non-peasants, I ask for the support of Mr Dal sass. President. \u2014 I call Mr Bocklet. Mr Bocklet. \u2014 (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentle men, at first glance the extension of the three socio- structural Directives Nos 159, 160 and 161 adopted in 1972, which is the subject of the Dalsass report, is no more than a formal procedure. However, the exten sion of the implementing deadline until 31 December 1982 is designed to give the Commission the oppor tunity to take account of past experience before sub mitting suitable proposals for the amendment of these directives. The Committee on Agriculture therefore has some clear ideas on the future form of the policy on agricul tural structures. All future deliberations must be based on the realization that in practice these directives have not had the effect hoped for, as the European Court of Auditors put it, or have even had the opposite effect. Regional disparities have grown further, and selective support on the basis of the support threshold has had extremely undesirable structural results. We therefore call for agricultural structural fund resources to be concentrated on regional programmes, on measures not related to specific farms, in future with the aim of improving the infrastructural conditions of competi tion in the economically weakest regions of the Com munity, thus making a more effective contribution to the removal of regional imbalances in the Community than in the past. Our most important demand, however, is for the replacement of the support threshold with more differ entiated and more suitable assessment criteria. As a result of the bias towards larger agricultural holdings in the structurally more favourable regions, the con cept of the programme for the promotion of individual farms has turned against agriculture run by small farmers and resulted in disadvantaged regions falling even further behind. This concept today represents a considerable obstacle to the efforts being made to safeguard jobs because it forces the individual to choose between increasing production and getting out of farming, and this largely in structurally weak areas where there are not enough alternative, non-agricultural opportunities for earning a living. Selective support also distorts competition among farms, places the weaker at a disadvantage and conflicts with the demand for equality of opportunity. Nor is the fixing of an average non-agricultural income as a condition to be met before support is granted hardly a suitable economic criterion for the assessment of an investment. Furthermore, the support threshold has in some cases resulted in excessive investments, with the farms receiving support conse quently going heavily into debt. The support threshold also forces agriculture to increase productivity further, which, with farmland and the labour input remaining unchanged, further aggravates the present situation of surplus production. For all these reasons, the support threshold must be abolished as soon as possible. The Commission now has an opportunity to do this. (Applause) President. \u2014 I call Mr McCartin. Mr McCartin. \u2014 Mr President, I want to thank Mr Dalsass and the Committee on Agriculture for this report and to welcome the emphasis it places on the problems of disadvantaged areas and regions in the Community. This directive is not just about agricul- ",
        "No 1-286/44 Debates of the European Parliament 15.6.82 McCartin ture: it is about regional problems: it is about the very survival of people in areas where the numbers we are able to maintain on the land can in the end determine whether those areas will survive as habitable regions, whether there are schools and churches and the infra structures that are needed. So this is not solely a ques tion of agriculture: it is a problem of the survival of cultures and regions and communities. At price-fixing time in this Parliament, all the attention of journalists, agriculturalists and politicians is concen trated on that day, but to a majority of farmers and their families in the Mediterranean regions and in the west of Ireland, where 65% of the people in my own constituency are in agriculture, the structural assist ance that is provided by governments and by this Community is of greater interest and importance, because their agricultural production is so low that the result of a 5%, 8% or 10% price-increase means very little in monetary terms. I am disappointed first of all because the region that I represent joined this Community at a time when Directives 159 and 160 were already in existence and we had to seek to accommodate ourselves to them. Those two directives in particular have never worked in my part of the Community: for different reasons, they have not been successful. It is a matter of great frustration to ordinary farmers in a region of this Community that they can recognize the d\u00e9ficiences of a directive for six years past now and find that over that period of six years nothing has been done to adjust that instrument to their particular requirements. Most people think that a review is under way, and it is regrettable that at this stage that review has not been completed. I would ask the Commission to speed it up. I would ask them to make it more applicable to the special conditions obtaining in the region that I repre sent. Directive 160 has never been used, principally because it has got confused with social-welfare ben efits and entitlements in Ireland and the Irish Govern ment has insisted on deducting the amount of money received under Directive 160 or including it in a per son's income for the purposes of social-welfare com putations. In my view, the Commission should not have allowed that to happen: if that directive is there and it is made available to Irish farmers, then national legislation should not be allowed to cancel its effects. Furthermore, I would say that 'the vast majority of farmers in the part of the Community that I represent can never become what are known as 'classified development' farmers. Whatever hopes existed in 1975, 1976 and 1977 that more of them might fit into that category, today it is increasingly obvious that very few, if any, of them will be able to do so, and there fore they are denied all assistance in a region where this directive is specifically intended to help restructure holdings. It is of absolutely no use. President. \u2014 I call the Commission. Mr Dalsager, Member of the Commission. \u2014 (DA) Mr President, I should like to say first of all that we note with satisfaction the resolution of the Committee on Agriculture recommending approval of the Commis sion's proposal to extend the agricultural structure Directives until 31 December 1983. I think this is very important because by this means continuity can be maintained in the Community's agricultural structure policy. I can promise you that the proposals put for ward for the improvement of agricultural structures will be examined very carefully. I can inform you now that in recent years we have supplemented the basic arrangements by specific or integrated programmes for the regions which suffer from special structural defi ciencies and that we shall continue this development in the future too. A remark might perhaps be made for the benefit of the last speaker, who represents one of these regions in the Community, since we have made a special effort to accommodate the farmers in these areas with especially difficult situations. In answer to the two Greek speakers, who referred to the special difficulties of Greek agriculture, I should like to take this opportunity to announce that the Council of Ministers yesterday adopted the special support programme for the development of Greek agriculture which takes into account forests, drainage problems and a number of other agricultural problems which Greece's agriculture has put before the Com mission. The Commission has put forward a proposal which will cost a total of 200 million units of account over five years for the support and development of agriculture in the regions of Greece experiencing special difficulty. Thus, even if certain of our struc tural directives, as is known, are not working in cer tain areas of the Community, the Community has nevertheless been able to take other initiatives in these regions, so that it has been possible to give support to agriculture in these less-favoured areas in other ways. I would also inform you that, in 1981, the Council also adopted amendments to Directive 72/159 on the modernization of agricultural holdings with the aim of adjusting the conditions for approval of a holding's development plan. We are of course aware that there are certain problems in this area. I cannot at present really see any criterion which can replace the compa rable income which we refer to, since it must be possi ble for any alternative criterion to be differentiated regionally, in view of the great discrepancies in the Community in this area. Might I also say to Mr Dalsass, who has asked for these proposals to be presented by the Commission at a very early date, that the Commission has an obliga tion to put the proposals before the Council by the end of the year, and that means that they will be sent to Parliament by the beginning of 1983 at the latest. I should like to add to what I have said my thanks for the many ideas which have been presented in the course of this debate. I can assure the rapporteur, the ",
        "15.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/45 Dalsager chairman of the Committee and the various speakers that the comments made regarding the development of agricultural structure policy, which I also consider to be one of the Community's most important policies, will be taken up in the discussions we shall be holding in the Commission on the proposals, which will be put forward in good time, so that they can be subjected to the thorough treatment they deserve. The motion for a resolution will be put to the vote at the next voting time. (The sitting, suspended at 10.55 a.m., was resumed at 11 a.m.) President. \u2014 I call the rapporteur. Mr Dalsass, rapporteur. \u2014 (DE) Mr President, I should like to thank Commissioner Dalsager for his assurance that the Commission's proposals will be sub mitted to the Council this year, as this will enable the Committee on Agriculture and Parliament to consider them in early 1983. This is what everyone wants. I also thank him for emphasizing the significance, the importance of these structural measures. The approval of special programmes for certain underdeveloped regions, certain disadvantaged areas such as Southern Italy, Southern France, Ireland and, as we heard yes terday, Greece fits in with the concept we endorse and shall continue to endorse, that greater attention must be paid to the weak areas so that they too may enjoy the benefits of a common agricultural policy. I should also like to thank all the speakers for the suggestions they have made to me and to the Commis sion for the establishment of the new structural direc tives. I also feel that everything must be done to enable the farmer to make the best of his farm and so to earn a living from his work. This would also prevent, as has been said here, the continuing depopulation of certain areas, which would be unacceptable. But I should perhaps give one piece of advice in this respect. We are, after all, talking about structural measures, structural directives. These structural mea sures should not include everything that has, let us say, been mentioned here, for example, the fight against inflation, the need to take greater account of Com munity preference or special measures for fisheries. They should stick to structures. If other measures are needed \u2014 and I count myself among those who main tain that these measures are not sufficient for a com mon agricultural policy and that many other measures are required to make that policy complete \u2014 they should be taken in the appropriate areas, but not form part of these structural measures. With this recommendation or request I conclude this brief statement. I can only hope that, as promised, the structural measures will be submitted to the House soon for our consideration. President. \u2014 The debate is closed. IN THE CHAIR: MR DANKERT President 4. The Belgian presidency and related matters President. \u2014 The next item is the joint debate on : The statement by the Council on the activity of the Belgian presidency; The statement by the Commission on the changes in the European Monetary System; A report by Mr Isra\u00ebl, drawn up on behalf of the Political Affairs Committee, on the situation in Afghanistan (Doc. 1-296/82); The report by Mr Haagerup, drawn up on behalf of the Political Affairs Committee, on the visit by a European Parliament delegation to Pakistan (Doc. 1-201/82); The statement by the Commission President on the outcome of the Versailles Summit Conference. I call the Council. Mr Tindemans, President-in-Office of the Council. \u2014 (NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, two weeks before the Belgian Presidency comes to an end, I should like to follow the tradition of this Parliament and to outline what can already be said about the last six months. What I have to say will not be an inven tory or a series of non-committal statements, since you yourselves keep a very close watch on European affairs. Furthermore, there will be quite a few Council meetings before the Presidency passes to Denmark. These meetings will discuss the accession of new Member States, the Genscher-Colombo proposals, the reform of the consultation procedure and the budget ary procedure. Thanks to the close cooperation among the Presidents of the European Parliament, the Com mission and the Council, a solution has been put for ward to the last of these problems. Meetings will also have to be held to discuss matters to do with fisheries, the environment, development and research. It is therefore possible that quite a number of decisions will be taken. But it is right that at this part-session of the European Parliament stock should be taken of what has been done. ",
        "No 1-286/46 Debates of the European Parliament 15.6.82 Tindemans These have been eventful months. Before a start could be made on a real programme or the Community's continuing problems could be tackled, we were over taken by tragic international events : Poland, the Falk land Islands, Lebanon. The crisis over the mandate, which had been on the agenda since 1980, threatened to grow into a Com munity crisis. This resulted in endless negotiations in various capitals. This all happened against a background of economic uncertainty, at a time of recession which threatens to turn into depression, both in the European Com munity and in the world as a whole. The question of the mandate degenerated into the constant dissatisfaction of one Member State over its contribution to the Community budget. This dissatis faction persists because agreement has still not been reached on a multiannual concession to the United Kingdom. The dissatisfaction of one Member State is infectious, as other Member States also beginning to question their own contributions. A disease of this kind threatens to set the whole system of the Com munity's own resources on a downward path. The crisis occurred when this multiannual concession was unfortunately linked to the annual round of talks on farm prices. The Treaty requires a decision to be taken on farm prices by 1 April, and it is a decision that cannot be postponed indefinitely without causing irreparable damage to the common agricultural policy. Once the crisis had broken, the Community was very quick to find the means to get itself out of trouble. Most Member States realized that the Treaty offered the only way out. The Council thus in fact agreed to your recommenda tions of 13 May 1982 almost to the letter. This was not all. During the night of 24/25 May a solution was found to the problem of the British con tribution to the budget, or at least to the 1982 budget. A crisis, Mr President, can also serve as a catalyst, and this has been true of political cooperation. Particularly close attention has been paid to the dialogue between the Ten and the European Parliament, both in the Pol itical Affairs Committee and during urgent debates on topical problems. The Council asked me to go to Tur key to convey the Ten's feelings on developments in that country and to receive answers expected to a number of questions. As President, I have also been in contact with such candidate Member States as Portu gal and Spain and also with Norway. The Presidency also gathered information during visits to Washington and Tokyo. In view of the situation in the Middle East, invitations from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Israel were accepted. Other visits were on the agenda, but there was simply not enough time for them to be under taken. The plan is to forward a report to the Ten on the situation in the Middle East so that there may be a debate leading ultimately to the more accurate defini tion of the European position. Events in Lebanon have delayed this plan to some extent. The Ten's appraisal of the situation and their condemnation of the attack on Lebanon followed immediately upon these events. Again, where oppression in Poland and the occupation of the Falkland Islands were concerned, there was no delay in condemning the violation of the Helsinki Final Act and of international law. Aid to the Polish people was quickly set in motion. Early expression was also given to practical solidarity with the United King dom. Meeting in Bonn on 9 June, the Ten strongly con demned the invasion of Lebanon by the Israeli armed forces as a violation of international law, involving the danger of escalation into a general conflict. The politi cal leaders and the ambassadors of the Ten had pre viously considered the situation at the United Nations. The Community intends to use all the resources at its disposal to help to alleviate the suffering of the victims. We are living in dangerous times, Mr President. There are major challenges to our safety, and we are rightly concerned about world peace. The failures that have recently emerged are untenable in the longer term and therefore unacceptable. They also reveal the urgent need for an in-depth and cohesive view of the Com munity's external relations. The Community has been through a few difficult phases. But there is a continuing need for further pro gress towards integration. The Community is not unaware of certain obstacles to enlargement, but there has been some progress on the accession negotiations with Portugal and Spain. I therefore hope these negotiations will continue and be brought to a successful conclusion. The Community has also strengthened its ties with the Third World. In Libreville, new financial resources were injected into the Lom\u00e9 Convention's STABEX system. This very week the Council of Development Ministers will be giving its initial reaction to the ori ginal and sorely needed proposals from Commissioner Pisani concerning the food strategy which, if properly implemented, could change the food balance of devel oping countries. Genuine and improved cooperation under the Lom\u00e9 Convention will give the Community the legitimacy it needs to join in the North-South dialogue with authority. During the Versailles summit meeting the Community succeeded in persuading the United States to adopt a more open approach towards international, global negotiations in this respect. ",
        "15.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/47 Tindemans To the considerable satisfaction of the ACP countries it was also possible to settle a dispute over the price of sugar that had gone on far too long. The European Council discussed economic and social problems at length at its meeting in late March. Special attention was paid to monetary problems and the dis turbing increase in unemployment. The anti-crisis policy was the central issue of the debate, which proceeded from the supposition that there is no one straightforward and simple way of solving today's social and economic problems. The Council did agree that the Community should be tough and courageous in its efforts to achieve indus trial and technological restructuring, that support must be given to an improved investment policy, that it was essential for these adjustments to be accompanied by social measures and that there was a need in this con text for greater monetary stability and greater cohe sion in the economic policy pursued. This can only be done, however, in close consultation with our major industrial partners and an improved dialogue with the Third World if a wave of protectionism and a return to autarchy are to be avoided. Various matters of concern to the European Council led to the adoption of practical measures by the Coun cil of Social Ministers in May. I hope that the same approach will be adopted at the forthcoming meeting of the Jumbo Council. I had hoped this meeting of the Jumbo Council would take place in June, but the Commission's preparations have not been completed, and the meeting is now planned for the end of the year. A few weeks after the Standing Employment Committee had discussed prob lems connected with the fight against unemployment, the Council of Social Ministers adopted a resolution designed to enable the Commission to take practical initiatives in this area. These initiatives will form the basis of Community action to combat unemployment. The Community can and must tackle this social and economic scourge, and it will soon be in a position to do so. The Council of Social Ministers also approved a reso lution designed to help strengthen the present move ment to achieve equality for men and women at work in the Community. The Council has similarly adopted the directive on the protection of workers against the effects of lead. This directive is creditable in itself, but it will also enable analogous decisions to be taken to protect workers against other dangerous substances. The Education Ministers have examined the same problem by consid ering how schools can help to increase employment opportunities and how the transition from school to working life can be improved. In the textile sector, the Council has been able to adopt a position on its participation in the Multi-fibre Arrangement. This will form the basis of our trade relations with the low-price countries over the next five years. Account has been taken both of our own important textile sector and of the interests of the developing countries. The Commission was given a mandate to conclude numerous bilateral agreements designed to give shape to the outline agreement. This whole business must be completed in the next few months. I find it difficult to discuss fisheries, since the Minis ters concerned are meeting in Luxembourg at this very moment. A satisfactory meeting in the autumn of 1981 raised the hope that a solution might still be found. It is now expected that agreement can be reached on the ele ments that will eventually lead to the adoption of Community policy in this sector. There is not only an urgent need for this policy, it is also imperative that it be adopted. It is generally agreed that this is the case, and this, I am convinced, will enable considerable pro gress to be made. The Community has also made some progress with regard to transport policy. The report drawn up by Mr Carossino strongly criticizes the Council's activities in this area, in which there has been no integration despite the provisions of the Treaty. At its last meeting, the Council of Transport Ministers took a large number of decisions concerning the rail ways, combined transport and inland waterways. Considerable progress was made with regard to infra structure, the weights and dimensions of vehicles and interregional transport. The members of this Council felt it had been an excellent meeting. A meeting of this kind allows one to hope that there will be a great revi val in the transport sector. I would also remind you of the signing, on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome and of the meeting of the European Council in Brussels, of the convention establishing a European Foundation. Its real aim is to strengthen the feeling of belonging together in Europe, to enable each to learn to understand the other's problems and to appreciate his characteristics and to make Europe better known in the world. This attempt to explain to you everything that has happened in Europe in the past five months and two weeks is, of course, doomed to failure. But I will not conceal from you a degree of disappointment at the absence of real, global progress in Community policy to combat the economic crisis. I certainly do not, of course, underestimate various Community investment instruments. Nor do I wish to ",
        "No 1-286/48 Debates of the European Parliament 15.6.82 Tindemans belittle the importance of some sectoral decisions such as those concerning the new steel policy and the policy on textile imports. But I feel these results are insuffi cient. It was, after all, the great hope of so many Euro peans that we would never again have a situation like that in the 1930s and that, if there should nevertheless be another economic crisis, we would tackle it force fully at European level. I would add that there is only one answer to the ques tion of how we are to inspire the citizens of Europe for the next European elections, and that is with an effective, European anti-crisis policy. Anyone who takes stock of recent developments in the Community will conclude that certain problems, some of them very difficult, can indeed be solved, that there can be an intelligent reaction in a spirit of solidarity to some foreign developments and that dangerous inter nal obstacles can be removed. On the other hand, it is hard to deny that many ques tions concerning what is in some cases a precarious situation and the development of the Community remain unanswered. It is clear that, in the absence of a strong Community approach, the Member States will be increasingly in clined to take action individually at national level. The more national measures taken, the more difficult will it become to establish Community rules of conduct. This leads me to comment on the situation on the Com munity. Mr President, recent months have shown that some progress can always be made. The essential problem, however, is whether the results obtained correspond to the needs of the hour and on this point I cannot con ceal my anxiety. It is true that the Community's past record has been extremely good. However, I am concerned about pro jects that have been started but never finished and in very many areas the Community has adopted rather a dilettante approach. With the developing countries the Community has entered into a novel kind of relation ship in signing the Convention of Lom\u00e9. This arrange ment is of only limited scope and covers essentially economic and financial cooperation. One cannot at this stage talk of a global perception of the problems of the Third World even if at the Versailles Summit a step forward has been taken with the opening of global negotiations under the auspices of the United Nations. We have put together a common agricultural policy guaranteeing freedom of movement and based on Community preference and financial solidarity. We have not however succeeded in adapting its operation to the new situation, characterized by economic crisis, which would presuppose a tighter control over the costs which it engenders. We have created a common market but we have still to establish a genuinely uni fied internal market. In those areas where the Treaties have not spelt out commitments in such precise terms the Community has time and again produced long- term plans and set the course to steer by. What is the position at the present time with the plan for economic and monetary union? True, we do have the European Monetary System, which has so far weathered every storm. But of a dynamic development there is now hardly any chance. The same could be said with regard to energy problems, where, despite certain achievements, the major joint action pro grammes still remain on the drawing-board. A great deal is talked about a genuine industrial policy, but for all the talk little has come out of it, even if \u2014 and I have in mind the recent decisions in the iron and steel sector \u2014 the Community does now and again, in spite of everything, succeed in coming up with a package of measures which matches the gravity of the situation. For many years the development of the Community has relied essentially on voluntary action. This approach, at the outset, set its sights on some ambi tious achievements. It has now come down to a policy of one step at a time. I wonder if we should not adopt a more enterprising course. For a real recovery to take place there has to be a political will backed by a broad measure of public support. I would not wish to condemn Europe's tech nocrats and diplomats, but the fact remains that they are not capable of providing solutions to the problems of today. For that, Europe has to be helped to find its way again. The fundamental problem is how to give the European venture a new significance. Should we not pause and consider why the man in the street has lost interest in the Communities? The European Com munities for all that affect his everyday life without, for the most part, his even being aware of it. Only as we find answers to the questions that out fellow citi zens are asking themselves will we be able to recapture the spirit needed to make further progress. In my view the problem is a threefold one. In the first place, the Communities must deal with the problems which concern each one of us. You may be sure that the farm worker is fully aware of the import ance to him of the decisions of the Council of Agricul ture Ministers on prices. Perhaps the steelworker also is aware that, last week, the Iron and Steel Council extended for a period of one year the state of manifest crisis which has helped to prevent a slump in prices. The bulk of the decisions affecting our everyday lives pass unnoticed. Nearly all one hears about Europe has to do with crises and rivalry between the Member States. This brings me to the second point, that is to say the growing misgivings about the European Communities. ",
        "15.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/49 Tindemans I am struck by the disenchantment, but also by the deep scepticism which many people have about every thing to do with Europe. It was pointed out that at Versailles the Community was treated as a poor rela tion, whereas in contrast, at the last Western Summit, the influence of the Ten made itself felt perhaps un usually strongly in key areas like the present economic crisis, monetary policy, trade and the North-South dialogue. Europeans will never believe in Europe unless it is able to assert itself and play a decisive role. The problem is one of will and not solely or primarily of the way our institutions operate. I firmly believe in the need to apply the rules laid down in the Treaties. I am equally firmly convinced of the need for a better dialogue between the institutions. However, this will not be enough unless we also have the will to work together towards common objectives. After all, Europe cannot stay confined within its own limited domain. At a time like this Europe cannot remain a Europe of the 1%. It must be able to come to grips with all those problems which can be resolved more effectively at European level than at national level, given that we are dealing with matters of major importance for all our fellow countrymen. (Applause) It is necessary therefore to get public opinion back on our side. I, for my part, am persuaded that the forth coming direct elections will, in this respect, constitute both a formidable challenge and also a unique oppor tunity. It would be extremely serious for the future of the European venture if the next elections should result in the disenchantment of the people. Whereas, in point of fact, the intended aim was to generate a renewed enthusiasm that would succeed in overcom ing the resistance traditionally met with at national level. Secondly, careful consideration must be given to the objectives we wish to work for together. I have no faith in the formula of a Europe \u00e0 la carte. Such substi tutions do no more than give an illusion of progress because they do not ensure the necessary cohesion and will never be seen as a tangible political reality capable of satisfying the aspirations of the people. We cannot continue wanting and at one and the same time seek ing to dismantle the common agricultural policy; expressing our attachment to the idea of own resources while allowing exceptions to multiply to the point where they become the rule. Neither can we continue to affirm the need for monetary, industrial and energy solidarity without translating this into act ion. We cannot continue to discuss the problems of unemployment without putting our conclusions into practice. We need, in fact, to recreate the legal com munity as it was envisaged by the pioneers of Europe. The institutional framework and ground rules are vital to the smooth functioning of the Community. This is not to deny that a pragmatic approach is often neces sary. Compromises have to be struck to enable the most difficult obstacles to be overcome and more often than not diplomacy has to be given preference over confrontation. A legal community nevertheless remains an essential element and observance of the rules is still a necessary condition for guaranteeing smooth functioning. Let us not forget that these prin ciples are at the very basis of our democratic society. Mr President, I hope that this presidency will prove to have succeeded in improving relations between Parlia ment and Council in the highly complex area of the budget. I cannot understand why we should always have this conflict when it comes to the exercise of budgetary powers. As you probably know, the dia logue which has been established on this subject between the President of Parliament, the President of the Commission and myself has resulted in a draft agreement being drawn up. Apart from the adjust ments it provides for in the classification of expendi ture, I think it should be possible to ensure that the budgetary procedure will proceed more smoothly and tie in better with the legislative process. It also gives Parliament greater powers to take political initiatives. I, for my part, shall do all I can to persuade my col leagues to accept it at the next meeting of the Council. I hope that Parliament will seize this opportunity to push our Community forward. I honestly think the draft agreement is a balanced one. It will not work in favour of any one institution at the expense of the others, but it will benefit the Communi ties, which at present expend their energies in internal wrangles when they should be devoting them to deal ing with the crisis and furthering the process of inte gration. Besides, the best remedy lies precisely in accelerating and improving the process of European integration. I appreciate the fact that this is a difficult task and the economic crisis will only aggravate the problems unless we are prepared to embark resolutely on a pro cess of enlargement, consolidation and completion. After all, the Member States must know what they want. I should like, last of all, to express my satisfaction with the numerous contacts I have had with Parliament as President of the Council. They have always been parti cularly agreeable, instructive and fruitful. I say this also on ^ehalf of my colleagues, ministers and Council Presidents who have been impressed by the dialogue they have been able to hold with you in the various parliamentary committees. I welcome this kind of con structive cooperation, despite one or two problems of an institutional nature. My confidence in this Assem bly remains unshaken. My experience as a member of this Parliament and now as President of the Council strengthens my conviction that this Parliament is vital for anyone who believes in the unification of Europe and works actively in its service. ",
        "No 1-286/50 Debates of the European Parliament 15.6.82 Tindemans The difficulties of the present situation, some people's lack of judgment and the discouragement of others are not enough to quell the spirit of those who have made European integration their political ideal. Jean Monnet said it all: 'There is no other solution for our countries and for our future'. Let those who understand and accept this point of view persevere and not allow themselves to be diverted from this goal, nor dissuaded from pursuing it by negative and outdated attitudes. Parliament must and can point the way to a Europe which, confident in its own identity, seeks to live in peace and understanding with its partners. (Applause) President. \u2014 Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it is not my role to intervene in the debate. However, since the Belgian presidency is now drawing to a close, I should like to say just a few words. As you have already pointed out, the last few months have seen intensive consultations between the Presi dents of the three institutions aimed at reaching agree ment on the budget conflict which broke out last year and at devising guidelines and Community rules to avoid such conflicts in the future. I think that the Bel gian presidency and you in particular, Mr President, deserve a special thanks for your efforts to find new procedures \u2014 and these we have found \u2014 to give genuine content to the dialogue between the Council and Parliament. I hope your reward will be that, before the end of the Belgian presidency, we shall have reached an agreement between the 'two arms' of the budget authority. (Applause) I call the Commission. Mr Ortoli, Vice-President of the Commission. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, before proceeding to tell you about the adjustment in exchange rates which took place last Saturday, I wanted to pass on Mr Thorn's apologies for his absence here this morning. He has been detained in Luxembourg by an important Coun cil meeting on fisheries policy, but he will be here this afternoon to discuss the broader aspects of Com munity integration that have come up in your various debates. Mr President, on 12 June 1982 the monetary author ities of the countries of the Community decided by mutual agreement to go ahead with a realignment of parities within the European Monetary System. The success of the operation, which took place without long meetings and under satisfactory technical condi tions, can be put down to certain supporting policies announced by the governments concerned which are designed to bring about closer convergence. Four currencies have had their bilateral central rates changed. The mark and the guilder have been revalued by 4-25% in relation to the Belgian franc, the Luxem bourg franc, the Danish krone and the Irish punt, whereas the French franc and the Italian lira have been devalued respectively by 5-75% and 2-75% in rela tion to the same currencies. The previous bilateral cen tral rates between the Belgian and Luxembourg franc and the Irish punt have not been affected by the realignment of 12 June. The greatest bilateral movement has occurred between the French franc and the German mark, the rate of exchange between these two currencies having been altered by around 10%. The decision to realign was based primarily on the fact that divergent trends had been detected in regard to prices and competitiveness, principally between France and Germany, and also on the contrasting trends as regards the balance of pay ments on current account in the two countries, this phenomenon being particularly marked where their bilateral trade is concerned. The difficulties arising from these factors have been amplified by the fact that the French economy is out of step with the economies of its partners and also by international monetary instability. The guilder has fol lowed the mark in being revalued. This decision is explained by the similarity in the trends observed in the Netherlands and in Germany in relation to prices and balance of payments, and also by the particularly close trade relations the two countries have with each other. The realignment of the lira, on the other hand, was decided upon in order to limit the rise in value of this currency against the French franc. The changes in the bilateral central rates are necessarily accompanied by a change in the central rates expressed in ECU for all the currencies in the basket. Furthermore, the new ECU parities in the various European currencies will necessitate adjustment of monetary compensatory amounts in order to preserve the unity of the agricul tural market. In anticipation of this, all advance-fixing has been suspended for those countries whose parity changes are fairly significant, namely France, Ger many, the Netherlands and Italy. In order to ensure the success of the realignment it is absolutely vital to have supporting policies, and in this connection the following points are worth underlin ing: In France, the government's supporting policy covers essentially three areas: strict control of growth, the money supply and credit containment, a temporary freeze on prices and incomes with certain exceptions with regard to the SMIC, on the one hand, and energy on the other, especially since certain farm prices are also excluded from the freeze; keeping down the budget deficit in 1982 and 1983 to 3% of the GDP, or about 120 000 million francs in 1983, with the welfare budget being brought into balance and unemployment insurance back into balance, while maintaining public investment at existing levels. ",
        "15.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/51 Ortoli Where Italy is concerned, ministers were satisfied that the adjustment of the Italian lira fits in well with the programme for restoring public finances and for reviv ing the economy as a whole which the Italian govern ment is proposing to implement and which will be looked at in great detail over the next few days. We are, in other words, actively engaged in mapping out such a programme and you will understand that I obviously cannot comment on that which has yet to be decided. In Germany and the Netherlands realignment could, hopefully, contribute to a further cut in interest rates, thereby underpinning the renewed economic growth which they are experiencing at present. Such a development would certainly stimulate domestic demand, which would have a favourable effect on the balance of payments situation of Germany's European partners. The realignment of 12 June enables us boldly to reaf firm certain facts or objectives relative to European economic and monetary policy. Above all, economic and monetary solidarity between the countries of the Community has been firmly re-established. Adjust ments have been made by common accord and in a spirit of cooperation so as to avoid having to alter the central rate beyond what is required by the underlying factors and to shield the Member States from the vicious circle of devaluation and inflation. Secondly, the governments of the Member States have proved their loyalty to the European Monetary System and their will to regard it as an anchor, a point of reference, in the definition and conduct of their economic policies. Finally, and this is the major lesson, the realignment of 12 June has demonstrated that the governments are convinced of the need to work towards closer con vergence between the economic policies and perform ance of the Member States, essential for the smooth operation of the monetary system, and without which one of its raisons d'\u00eatre and a condition of its success could possibly be lost. That is the main conclusion I should like to draw. As. we have pointed out time and again \u2014 and when I say 'we', I mean Parliament and the Commission \u2014 the European Monetary System is not simply an exchange agreement, any imperfections in which can be easily corrected by successive realignments, having as its aim the establishment of an area of economic and mone tary stability. Guaranteeing the development of a sin gle market, it presupposes convergence of economic performance, on the basis of jointly-agreed policies. The Commission and Parliament have been pressing this point unremiuii\u00eegly and have called on the Mem ber States to recognize this need for convergence and to implement the measures necessary to achieve it. Similarly, we have been calling all along for some kind of formal cooperation in the monetary area with our major partners, the United States and Japan. The con ditions of the recent realignment and the drafting at Versailles of an outline proposal for some form of international monetary cooperation are proof of the correctness of our analysis and show that it is now coming to be accepted. All this tends to confirm our resolve to pursue the course we have adopted with a view to strengthening the European Monetary System, and thereby the economy of the Community. (Applause) President. \u2014 I call Mr Isra\u00ebl. Mr Isra\u00ebl, rapporteur. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, I should like first of all to thank Mr Van Miert and Mr Glinne, Chairman of the Socialist Group, who, in taking the initiative of tabling a motion for a resolution on Afghanistan, have helped to awaken this House to an extremely serious matter that is preying on all our minds. The armed invasion by the Soviet Union of Afghanistan is indeed a very serious matter. This is the first time since the Second World War that the USSR has stepped beyond its frontiers ^\u2014 or, to be more pre cise, beyond the frontiers of the Warsaw Pact. This is not a case of indirect intervention but of naked aggression, the Soviet flag flying at the head of the column so to speak. The question is, is this interven tion, is this occupation going to last? There are good reasons for thinking that it will last for a long time, because at present it is not costing the Soviet Union very much. It is what I might call a cheap occupation. It is an occupation which has no foundation in law and which creates no real stir within the international com munity, only very transiently. In short, the West is growing used to this war, is getting accustomed to this occupation. And yet, not only is there a guerrilla-type war going on there, but we are also receiving detailed and consistent reports of chemical weapons being used in Afghanistan. This is the first time that the interna tional community has unanimously condemned this occupation. The UN and the whole of the Third World have passed a resolution condemning this occu pation. The same goes for the Islamic Conference, the countries belonging to ASEAN and indeed the Euro pean Community. In other words, for the first time the Soviet Union finds itself universally condemned. The resolution before you, which I am presenting on behalf of the Political Affairs Committee, is based essentially on one event. We had no wish to put before you a purely conscience-salving resolution. We wanted our resolution to have some political force and the first step we are proposing to the House is the recognition of Afghan resistance as a popular movement for national liberation, as a legitimate movement for national liberation. The difficulties that your rappor teur had to face up to are numerous. Afghan resistance may have the appearance of being fragmented and uncoordinated, and yet your rapporteur was able to meet in Europe, and unfortunately only in Europe, a ",
        "No 1-286/52 Debates of the European Parliament 15.6.82 Israel number of Afghan resistance fighters grouped around two major movements. The first is the Islamic Alliance of Afghan Fighters, which has an Islamic and funda mentalist outlook on things. Incidentally, it is worth bearing in mind that when Afghans tell you they are fundamentalists and Islamic, it does not mean they are reactionaries. It is just their way of expressing their nationalism and their national ity. The second movement it was my privilege to encoun ter is the Unified National Front, which is a com pletely secular modernist movement and is altogether quite acceptable. What has come out of these contacts with the leaders of the Afghan resistance? The first thing to come out is that the people I spoke with are resolved never to resort to international terrorism as a way of publiciz ing their struggle for liberation. This is an extremely important fact. Secondly, they are determined that human rights, and in particular the rights of prisoners of war, should be regarded as absolutely sacred. You will no doubt have noted, with interest and satisfac tion, that three Soviet prisoners of war who found their way into the hands of Afghan resistance fighters have been handed over the International Red Cross and these three prisoners have been interned on neu tral territory in Switzerland. This marks a significant change for the good by comparison with the Second World War. I had to emphasize this point to back up my opinion that Afghan resistance has at the moment a real credibility, a fact that needs to be recognized. The other measure proposed in this motion for a reso lution, Mr President, is the scaling down of our diplomatic relations with the Kabul regime to a mini mum level. It is not right that in the European Com munity today we should have ambassadors officially representing the Kabul regime when everyone knows that these people do not represent anything, or at any rate they do not represent the people in Afghanistan. The political consequences of this occupation of Afghanistan have been somewhat underestimated by the West. We are at present in an extremely serious situation. How can we conduct with confidence our relations, our negotiations on European security, knowing that the USSR is pursuing a policy of armed aggression in Asia. These negotiations must go on, that goes without saying. World peace is at stake. But everything has been made more difficult and the West has become much more wary since the occupation of Afghanistan. At any rate, and this point is made in the Political Affairs Committee's resolution, there can be no Helsinki-type accord that would sanction the occu pation of Afghanistan in exchange for I know not what other advantage. There are certain retaliatory measures that the West could take, such as cutting back on new technology supplied to the USSR so long as Afghanistan remains under occupation. We natur ally must try \u2014 and this is exactly what the resolution is proposing \u2014 to bring about some sort of agreement on the basis of a commitment to non-interference in Afghanistan. Soviet withdrawal, freedom for the Afghan people to express their will, these two condi tions we must insist on. But, in any event, the Euro pean Community must continue and step up its aid to Afghan refugees. Much depends on Pakistan, which has shown such courage in taking in close on three million Afghan refugees. The State of Pakistan has a policy which we have to try to understand, but never losing sight of the fact that in the eyes of the European Community human rights are a vital concern. Pakistan has taken the initiative of convening in Geneva, this very day, or this week at least, a tripartite conference which brings together representatives of the regime in Kabul, Iran and Pakistan. I have no idea what will come out of this conference, which has been organ ized on the initiative of the United Nations. All I know is that it seems to be giving priority to the solution of the refugee problem. Now, I do not see how this prob lem can be resolved, that is to say how the refugees can return to their country, unless the Soviet troops withdraw from Afghanistan. To conclude, Mr President, I want to say that the resolution which the Political Affairs Committee is laying before Parliament is not content simply to deplore the situation in Afghanistan and to make an emotional protest. It proposes a concrete political act, the recognition of Afghan resistance, an act of justice, the reduction in the level of diplomatic relations with Kabul, and emphasizes the effect of this situation on East-West relations. None can remain indifferent to the fate of a mountain people fighting with their bare hands against a blind and inhuman war machine served by imperialists. (Applause) President. \u2014 I call Mr Haagerup. Mr Haagerup, rapporteur. \u2014 (DA) Mr President, I will not subject Parliament to a long historical expos\u00e9 of this affair. It is deplorable from any point of view. The government of Pakistan has refused to meet a delegation from Parliament which was to collect infor mation on the Afghan refugees in Pakistan, for the unacceptable reason that one of the members of the delegation \u2014 its chairman, moreover \u2014 is our Mem ber, Mr Isra\u00ebl, who has just spoken. Since this rejec tion, there has been an exchange of views between the Community authorities and the government of Paki stan, and I should like to express my appreciation of the prompt action of the Belgian presidency in this matter. Regardless of the fact that we unreservedly deplore the action of the Pakistani government, we should of course very much like to see a conclusion to this ",
        "15.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1\u00ad286/53 Haagerup regrettable affair, and we have noted that the Pakistani government will not admit to having acted in a racial\u00ad ist manner, but regards Mr Israel's presence in Paki\u00ad stan as a security risk and considers his visit to the country to be undesirable or inopportune. But, in prin\u00ad ciple, they had no objection to a visit by a delegation from Parliament. I would simply add that it is of course Parliament itself which should decide on the composition of its delega\u00ad tion and that on the basis of this position of principle and of rejection of any form of discrimination, I ask Parliament unanimously to adopt this short resolution in the hope of and in pursuit of a satisfactory conclu\u00ad sion to this affair. This can only happen, Mr President, if Mr Isra\u00ebl is appointed or accepted as a matter of course and is free, as a member and the chairman of the delegation, to make the journey to Pakistan as planned in order to accomplish his and the delega\u00ad tion's mission there. It is no more and no less than the principle for which Parliament stands and for which I, as acting chairman of the Political Affairs Committee and as rapporteur on this affair, ask Parliament's full support. IN THE CHAIR: LADY ELLES Vice-President President. \u2014 I call the Socialist Group. Mr Glinne. \u2014 (FR) Madam President, Mr President of the Council, Mr Commissioner, it is with obvious satisfaction that I am able to say that the record of the Belgian presidency has been a positive one. Positive to the extent that a solution has finally been found to the problem of the British budget contribu\u00ad tion and the fixing of farm prices. Positive also in that at the Versailles Summit, at which the Community was represented by the President of the Council, agree\u00ad ment was reached on tighter coordination of economic policies and policies to combat unemployment. Another positive aspect is the understanding reached between the Presidents of the three institutions of the EEC as regards classification of expenditure and other budget\u00adrelated problems. It is unfortunate, however, that no satisfactory solu\u00ad tion has been found to the crucial problem of interest rates. It really is vital to have a cut in interest rates if we are to revive t^e economy through new job\u00adcreat\u00ad ing investment. In this connection, the Socialist Group has occasion once again to express its dismay at the lack, above all, of positive and immediate measures to combat unemployment. What has happened to that wonderful European social area advocated months ago by President Mitterrand? Mr President of the Council, we were both of us in Paris at the end of last week, Friday to be exact, and we heard \u2014 and I do not believe I am doing any harm by saying this publicly, since so many people know about it already \u2014 we heard the Prime Minister Mr Mauroy arguing vigorously in favour of Community measures which would ensure that nowhere in the \u25a0 Community would we still have unemployed young people under the age of 18. This would be a partial and temporary solution. Why can we not do that much, at least until we are in a position to introduce other, more potent measures? The real question we have to ask ourselves, as we see it, is whether over the past two years we have not placed too much emphasis on the fight against infla\u00ad tion at the expense of the crucial problem of underem\u00ad ployment in the Community. It is, after all, on its social and employment policies that workers and the ten million rather sceptical unemployed people are going to judge the Community. That is why we must stress the point that for the Community to achieve its necessary recovery it must first tackle this essential problem. Let me finally say a word or two on my own behalf. In the discussions on the achievements of individual pres\u00ad idencies, it occasionally happens that disputes of a national character intervene somewhere in the back\u00ad ground. Now, I have no wish at all for a Belgo\u00adBel\u00ad gian dispute on this occasion. As a European, it was a profound sense of satisfaction that I felt on learning of the position of the Belgian presidency, namely that, in the present circumstances, the Community is needed more, not less. It is very important that the Belgian presidency should have made the point that, given that there are insufficient resources to go round, there is at this moment a great temptation for each Member State to adopt the attitude of 'everyone for himself', which would be a serious mistake. You spoke a few moments ago about 'the European of the 1%' and how derisory it was; we believe that this figure of 1% can be exceeded by combining this renewed political will with the introduction of new common policies, because in our view, to exceed the 1% figure depends entirely on a simultaneous decision on new common policies. As I say, therefore, Mr President, for my own part \u2014 mor\u00e9 so even than as chairman of my group \u2014 I am delighted that the Belgian presidency should have understood that and also clearly demonstrated it in large measure. (Applause) President. \u2014 I call the Group of the European Peo\u00ad ple's Party (Christian Democratic Group). ",
        "No 1-286/54 Debates of the European Parliament 15.6.82 Mr Barbi. \u2014 (IT) Madam President, the Group of the European People's Party as well expresses a favourable judgment on the presidency of Mr Tindemans. It is favourable especially because of the shrewd and decided use of the majority vote: first in the case of the events in Poland, when Greece found itself in the minority, and then in the case of the economic sanc tions against Argentina, when Italy and Ireland were in the minority; on the issue of agricultural prices, when the United Kingdom was in the minority, and finally concerning the measures for the steel industry, when Italy was in the minority. I, as an Italian and especially as a citizen of Naples, can feel a certain anx iety at this, but as a member of the European Parlia ment I feel considerable satisfaction. The Group of the European People's Party has no doubt that the princi pal obstacle to the normal development of the Com munity is precisely the paralysis resulting from the use of the unanimous vote, that is, the abuse of the so-called 'Luxembourg compromise'. The concrete demonstration that it is possible to avoid such abuse, and therefore that the Community can proceed normally in the application of the policies already decided upon, is extremely important, even decisive. Only in this way was a correct and reasonable interpretation of the so-called 'compromise' supplied: that is, that a unanimous vote can be demanded by one of the Member States only when its vital interests are affected, but certainly not when it is a question of decisions which concern the implementation of Com munity policies already agreed upon in principle and in effect for several years. Moreover, we concur with the President-in-Office of the Council in considering the 'Luxembourg compromise' only as a political agreement of circumstantial utility, without any sort of legal basis: it does not constitute an amendment to the Treaty! President Tindemans himself told us that in addition to this small progress \u2014 and I h'old that the return to the majority vote is, despite its importance, only a small step forward \u2014 it is necessary to seek a more ambitious route. We fully agree with him. When we reflect upon the disappointment and dissatisfaction with which he stressed the lack of overall progress by the Community, its weaknesses, its lacks, its inability to deal with the serious problems posed by the economic crisis and principally by unemployment and inflation, we are necessarily brought to consider the need to correct and improve the institutions which govern the decisions and operative action of the Community. It is certainly very important that an open dialogue should be instituted between the Council and Parlia ment within the framework of the Treaty of Rome, and that through the amplification of the system of conciliation Parliament should be increasingly asso ciated with the Council's legislative function, with a concomitant extension of its effective powers. But how can we not be aware that today the treaty in force contains actual obstacles to Community activity? These obstacles must be removed if the Community is to become the effective instrument of common pro gress for our peoples. We are faced with distortions of an essentially anti-democratic nature: among these we note especially the concentration of legislative power in the hands of the Council, which is not answerable to any political body representing the democratic power of the citizens. This distortion must be cor rected if we are not to move towards a dangerous degeneration. President Tindemans has said that in the present situa tion a Community anti-crisis policy is needed, and that the work of the Community, and therefore of this Par liament, will be judged on this basis at the coming European elections. He is perfectly right. But why is this Community anti-crisis policy not applied? Not because the Commission lacks the will or the ability to formulate it; not because this Parliament is not able to evaluate and support it. It is not applied because the power to decide upon it is solely and entirely in the hands of the Council, which functions as an intergov ernmental body within which it is impossible to launch a Community economic policy: national interests, conceived of from an egotistic and short-sighted view point, are continually in conflict. The ministers who sit on the Council represent frag mentary positions conceived by national bureaucracies and linked to outdated and unproductive ways of thinking which nevertheless still predominate. On this basis it is erroneously believed that today's dramatic problems can be solved by purely national means and that everything supranational and Communitarian is to be regarded with suspicion. Despite the positive and fruitful results obtained during these twenty-five years, there are still those today who thought to bring about an economic recovery in their countries through the reconquest of the internal market, that is, through a return to the dreams of economic self-sufficiency which remind us Italians of the time of Mussolini. There are others who thought they could improve the workers' standard of living by applying provisions for wages, social security, and the reduction of working time without reference to the wider European context. The bitter disappointment which soon followed should serve to teach all of us that the right approach to an anti-crisis policy cannot be that of nationalistic self- containment but, on the contrary, that of enlightened, balanced, and concerted Community action. Why are we not able to see this immediately, clearly, without making new and unsuccessful experiments in nationalistic self-sufficiency? Why are we not able to join together in the elaboration and firm implementa tion of such a Community anti-crisis policy? I think it is above all because we do not have a Community organ suitable for democratic decision in this area. A deliberating body which is not politically responsible is instinctively distrusted by everyone. For this reason, within this body itself \u2014 the Council \u2014 the members tend more towards the defence of their own particular ",
        "15.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/55 Barbi interests than towards the discussion and deliberation of general interests. Nevertheless, particular interests are substantially dependent on the general ones: whether we will or no, the two groups form an inte grated whole. The need for European unity has also been evident in relation to the recent monetary events. In spite of the far-seeing and courageous decisions made in Bremen, the Council, ignoring the political pressures exerted by this Parliament, did practically nothing to bring about the vital convergence of our economies, nor was it able \u2014 or willing \u2014 to carry out the last steps planned for the implementation and revitalization of the Euro pean Monetary System. President Tindemans is right: what is left of the plan for economic and monetary unification? As a result, the absence of a common European policy towards the dollar has made it necessary to make no fewer than six readjustments of the parities within the EMS over the last three years. How can this system be successfully developed if there is no unified leadership for Community economic policy, if there is no Com munity control or Parliamentary supervision? Even the question of economic collaboration between the free countries of Western Europe and those of the Soviet bloc cannot be favourably resolved if there is no uni fied leadership for European economic policy. How can one fail to see that in the present dispersion of our interests in nationalism and particularism the Soviet Union is able to play our various countries off one against the other, and then all the countries together against the United States? How can one fail to see that a Europe with united leadership would have a far different contractual capability and an increased freedom of action in relation to both our North Amer ican ally and our Eastern economic partners? Further more, the worsening of the international situation, the continual rumblings from the Middle Eastern powder keg and even the regrettable Falkland Island affair make a closer European understanding urgently necessary, especially in the area of foreign policy. European solidarity with the United Kingdom would have been of quite another sort if the preceding phases of the South Atlantic affair, which has been going on for at least seventeen years, had been under Com munity guidance and management. Immediately after the last war it seemed natural to the founding fathers of the European Community that the forces of the free and democratic nations should be joined in a supra-national policy in response to the threat of Soviet expansionism. Later the relaxing of tensions which followed the death of Stalin seemed to make this process of unification unnecessary, or at least possible to postpone. Now, the present threats of war and the enormous economic difficulties besetting us should make us realize that this decisive step towards unity \u2014 decisive for the security, the free dom, and the well-being of each of us and of all our peoples \u2014 is indispensable and extremely urgent. Technocratic and diplomatic Europe \u2014 President Tindemans has said \u2014 is unable to provide an ade quate response to the current problems. We fully agree: we need political Europe, a Europe capable of making decisions, of asserting itself. In it, and in it alone, will Europeans believe! (Applause) President. \u2014 I call the European Democratic Group. Mr Fergusson. \u2014 Madam President, in the course of today's debate my colleagues will be dealing with the details of the Belgian presidency, the extent to which the machinery of the Community has been overhauled and adapted \u2014 or not \u2014 to meet the problems ahead or the problems already overwhelming us. They will present our views on the mandate, on the matter of decision making, on the Versailles Summit, and on the supreme need at this time of unemployment for the Community at last to get its economic game together. For myself, and because of last night's news, I wish to concentrate on the events in the South Atlantic. These events, all of them of historical importance, have marked the tenure in office of a president who has unfailingly and with our deep admiration and grati tude endeavoured to pull the Community out of the mud in which it has long been stuck while pursuing, for example towards the Lom\u00e9 States, policies nonetheless of very great substance. The events in the South Atlantic have undoubtedly preoccupied UK minds almost exclusively for ten weeks and contri buted to the frictions between the Community part ners in May. And, as Members will understand, to the edginess of my country in the Community's dealings. We do hope that this month, when the Foreign Minis ters meet again to discuss political progress, the dissat isfaction, about whose infectiousness Mr Tindemans very rightly warned, will subside. Fulfilment of the mandate remains as urgent today as it was in 1980. Now the Falklands war has produced new thinking about the security of Europe and the West and awak ened us to broader dangers than the Soviet threat. The Falklands war, both in its origin and prosecution and probable consequences, has contrasted signally with the parallel dangers to peace of the wars in other parts of the Middle East, in Afghanistan \u2014 about which Mr Israel has spoken \u2014 in the Gulf and in the Lebanon. All of which make our own peace initiative of 18 months ago look sadder than ever. As to the Falklands, its was in this case an associated territory of the Community that was invaded. Last April the Community immediately closed its ranks behind the United Kingdom. The solidarity from that ",
        "No 1-286/56 Debates of the European Parliament 15.6.82 Fergusson date to this, not least in this Parliament, and the deter mination, shown by almost every one of our partners and allies, that military aggression must be resolutely resisted marked, I think, a new benchmark of political cooperation which will stand the Community in good stead again. Whoever harms one of us harms us all and will have to answer to us all. We shall never know what peace, what resistance to future aggression, this action has bought for the world. It is easier to specu late what weakness might have led to. Now the battle of Port Stanley is clearly over. But peace is not yet sure. No doubt my country and its government, and especially its Prime Minister, will immediately be given a great deal of very friendly advice by very many people whose forces' blood has not been spilled and whose relations, national terri tory, interests and honour were not involved in a peculiarly unpleasant, uncomfortable and, at times, tragic military episode. I am sure that that advice will be noted, and it will be noted by a country fully aware of the driving need to restore Europe's good relations with Latin America and fully aware that the Falkland Islanders will need long-term security which does not depend everlastingly on a huge military garrison designed to inhibit a new war between two peoples who have always been friends. Both these peoples are still in a state of shock, tinged, I suppose, with euphoria, relief and some pride on one side and with injured self-esteem, grief and anger on the other. Is the Argentinian junta really going to carry on the war from the mainland? Will the Argenti nian people allow a regime to survive which so miscal culated the outcome and so consistently misled them as to the true course of that military disaster? We must wait and see. No one today is in any condition to be rushed into new negotiations. Tempers must cool. What I think we all know now is that at no point in the last ten weeks was the junta genuinely prepared to negotiate, except on the basis of the transfer of the Falklands to Argentine sovereignty. No one here can now believe that the junta which sent battalions of teenage soldiers into war alongside its other troops, which imprisoned the islanders and violated their pro perty, would have obeyed Resolution 502, except, as now, at the point of a gun. It is up to the Community to help us today to ensure that the battle does not break out again, not with advice about magnanimity \u2014 we can handle that ourselves \u2014 but with continued support for the cause of freedom and of peaceful set tlement. It is up to the Community and up to Spain, as it prepares to join us, to help repair the broken trust and strained relations that come between us and South America. As for those who still entertain some doubt about whom the Falklands belong to \u2014 a matter that has not really been discussed here \u2014 let them persuade Argen tina to take the matter to the International Court or to some forum where it belongs. This course of action has always been open to her. In conclusion I would ask the Commission and the Presidency what steps are now proposed to enhance or modify the successful measures that have so far been so admirably provided by the Community. I would also ask the retiring President-in-Office what steps he will commend to his own successor with a view to turning today's ceasefire and the repatriation of Argentina's forces into a lasting peace for tomorrow. President. \u2014 I call the Communist and Allies Group. Mr Bonaccini. \u2014 (IT) Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it can certainly not be said that the popularity and pres tige of the Community have increased during the last six months. Quite the contrary! We note this also on the solemn occasion of the celebration of the 25th anniversary of the Treaties of Rome. Headlines and articles of various political leanings discussing the impotence or even the impending dissolution of the Community have become very frequent. Mr Tindemans cannot be angry with the journalists alone; he himself, in speaking to us here, chose to say more about what must be done in the future than about what has been done in the past six months. Everything is contributing towards the tarnishing of the European image, and this justifies the disaffection and scepticism to which the President of the Council referred. The tendency on the part of some Member States to provide a doubtless illusory solution to the serious problems of the moment must be considered as both cause and effect of the 'blockage' now experi enced by the Community. During the last six months as well there has been no departure from this logic. We certainly do not intend to make a personal issue of this with President Tinde mans, but this is a matter which links an entire series of presidencies of the Council of Ministers; in fact, by coming last the Belgian experience inevitably felt the effects of a negative accumulation of events, beginning with the process of improvement and development of Union and the relationship among the Institutions. The rumors issuing from the debate of the so-called 'Genscher-Colombo Act' are alarming, and they con flict with the work of the institutional committee in advancing reductive interpretations of an Act which we already criticized for its inadequacy. This work of reduction and regression is allowed to proceed, and up to now no authoritative political will has opposed it. We considered the practice, initiated by Lord Carring- ton, of meeting with the parliamentary Bureau as posi tive and promising; we are obliged to note, however, ",
        "15.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/57 Bonaccini that it was not followed up over the six months in question. Concerning the budgetary issues on which President Tindemans spoke at length, we consider them improper from a legislative viewpoint; they con stitute a usurpation of the rights and expectations of the European Parliament. At the beginning of the new Middle East initiative decided upon at the Venice summit, the coherent sequence of actions and commitments then projected was not in evidence. President Tindemans said that there was no time to carry out certain missions and investigations. Now, as he said, it is a question of opening a debate on this and other matters. Our politi cal group will speak tomorrow; but permit me to observe today that there has been and still is a lack of any initiative able to express the great and mortal dan gers which threaten Europe's southern maritime fron tier and involve the destinies of a large portion of humanity. Mr Barbi consoles himself \u2014 although he is mistaken, in my opinion \u2014 by saying that d\u00e9tente and coexist ence are not all that necessary for the development of the European process. Historical facts and newspaper accounts tell us exactly the opposite. In any case, we firmly believe that it will be very difficult to build a political Europe if the process of d\u00e9tente and coexist ence is not effectively resumed. The blockage and the retrogression affecting the pro cess of integration must be more strongly criticized. Fundamentally, the connection recognized by Presi dent Tindemans between the policy on agricultural prices and the budget has in fact been made, despite its rejection in theory. Every problem whose solution was called for in the so-called Mandate of 30 May, by vir tue of a decision by the Council itself, is still to be dealt with, and perhaps no one has yet been found to do this. The issue of agricultural prices is still alive: it has nearly caused the ruin of the common agricultural policy, since the solution found is basically inadequate and far too late in coming. It also represents a dra matic loss of prestige, even in sectors of public opinion which have long been accustomed to evaluate prob lems from a European standpoint. The areas of smallest merit, where there has been the most serious loss in the European credibility so pain fully built up over a quarter of a century, are without doubt the financial problem posed by the refund of the United Kingdom's contribution, the failure \u2014 and I am amazed that some of my colleagues can take a dif ferent view of this \u2014 of the Versailles Summit, a fail ure now openly admitted by various sectors of public opinion, and the question of the European Monetary System. In regard to the first question, after the decision of 24 May there are ample grounds to fear that a spirit completely opposed to a Community approach to budget problems will gain acceptance. The weakest economies should be the ones to pay. It is said \u2014 if certain information is correct \u2014 that the Commission itself is preparing to carry out an operation on the VAT. We express as of now our strong reservations about this action, for it would constitute an attack on the prerogatives of Parliament, which, in any case \u2014 and we warn both the Council and the Commission \u2014 has the right to discuss and to be heard on legislation before it is adopted. Concerning the second question, there is nothing that can be considered really positive, either in connection with the system of external relations and the problems raised here and mentioned by President Tindemans himself, or in connection with cooperation on a broader basis, including all the countries of the indus trialized West, or in connection with the monetary war and its different aspects. Various Members have already spoken of this problem, which has been dis cussed in Parliament several times. I will therefore refer to this topic only briefly. The third and last question is that of the EMS. Com missioner Ortoli, whose belief in the European idea and ability in presenting his arguments I appreciate, will permit me to say that today he spoke without a great deal of conviction. Parliament was certainly not responsible for preventing the completion of the EMS. If the EMS collapses, the hopes for a stable economic and monetary union will collapse with it. In reality no work is being done either to improve the System and its stringent rules or to develop the policies for econo mic convergence. The programme to extend the use of the ECU should be considered as already buried, if what has been said here is true. We hear that the President of the Bundes bank is opposed to the programme. What monstrous power is this in the hands of a man who, without being in himself either a European or a German institution, can obstruct the process of the construction of Europe? Possible ways of getting out of the EMS are also being explored. This as well is consistently denied, but we know how these things are likely to go. Mean while unemployment, social malaise, and the deterior ation of the living conditions of the people are becom ing more pronounced. President Tindemans went so far as to evoke the 30's, an epoch so dramatic in Euro pean history. In the face of this situation the Member States and the Community show signs of obvious impotence. I must say that I agree with President Tindemans' three final observations: that is, that one cannot envisage a Europe with the 1%, and one cannot envisage a Europe \u00e0 la carte; it is necessary to provide a positive solution to the problems of the working masses. Par liament has expressed ideas, made appeals, and pro posed action in these areas. This is the problem. ",
        "No 1-286/58 Debates of the European Parliament 15.6.82 Bonaccini We ask that the great design of Europe not be allowed to die or 'bog down'. We do not resign ourselves to the notion that a Europe desired by the workers and the great masses of our continent can be miserably ended by an administration incapable of providing an adequate space for the ideals and political require ments of our continent. (Applause from the Communist and Allies Group) , President. \u2014 I call the Liberal and Democratie Group. Mr Bangemann. \u2014 (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Tindemans, I find myself in a very pleasant and in fact an unusual position when I think of reports on past presidencies. I can begin by congra tulating the President-in-Office of the Council with out reservation and with a clear conscience on the suc cesses he has made possible during his presidency. I believe that must be made absolutely clear, particu larly when we remember that we have not on the whole been very satisfied with past presidencies. We have been very satisfied with this Belgian president. I would almost say that we would have no objection to his retaining the presidency for another six months. We should, however, consider the background and the reasons for this praise, and this is not intended as criti cism of the future presidency, I must make that clear. Our praise is due to President Tindemans' success in leading the Council back to the path of legality, to some extent at least. In other words, we are praising him because he has managed to persuade the Council to drop an attitude that has no foundation in the Treaty and to take majority decisions on at least three or four occasions. Majority decisions are, after all, the rule laid down in the Treaty. I should therefore like to stress once again that the Council should bear in mind that in all its votes in the past it has not acted in accordance with the Treaty but, to put it very bluntly, illegally and that any attempt to apply such a procedure in future will undoubtedly meet with greater resistance in Parlia ment than has been the case in the past. This is very cleat from the solution to the problem of the UK contribution. I can understand \u2014 and my group was always in favour \u2014 that we must find a fairer solution for a Member State which has obviously not been able to derive the same benefits from membership as other Member States. But this solution must also abide by the rules as they stand. The present solution is in fact an emergency solution. It is not what Parliament would like to see happening. We naturally want the United Kingdom to enjoy ben efits, to which it has every right, but these things must be done within the framework of the European budget and in accordance with the rules of the policy which we ourselves establish with the Council. This has not been the case. Once again a cash refund has been agreed. That is not the right procedure in our view. You are quite right, Mr Tindemans, to say that the diplomats and bureaucrats have not succeeded in solving Europe's political problems. You also referred to the difficulty there will be in the future in finding basic solutions to the Community's major problems. Although our best wishes accompany you for the future, we must therefore consider why this is so. This leads me to what Mr Ortoli said. Mr Bonaccini was quite right to say that his statement today was not very convincing. But someone who is not convinced finds it hard to be convincing. I would have liked to hear Mr Ortoli saying rather more, for example, about the factors which we have all read about in the news papers and which led to the realignment of parities between the Deutschmark and the French franc, the lira and the guilder. Is all our talk about the conver gence of European policies not just a pious hope, never to be fulfilled, as long as a national government, that of your own country, Mr Ortoli, continues to pursue a policy which is completely separate from the Community's general economic policy? Is what you see here today not in itself confirmation of what we have repeatedly said to the French Govern ment: you cannot leave the convoy, do something completely different and expect to achieve productive results. It would perhaps have been appropriate for the Commission to make this statement even if it is a criti cism of a Member State's policy. But what is the main problem? I believe we can com pare the European Community to an aircraft that is travelling down the runway at such a speed that it can no longer be brought to a halt. Someone should now be operating the controls for take-off, but everyone is afraid of flying. The Germans are afraid of flying because they believe it will cost more than staying on the ground. The Danes are afraid of flying because they do not know whether they will have precisely the same political influence as they do on the ground. The French want to pursue their own policy. The Italians would be quite willing to take part, but they want others to solve too many of their problems. So everyone has his own problem. No one has the courage to say, let us now solve these problems together. Mr Bonaccini was quite right to ask who is in fact entitled to decide on the transition to the second stage of the European Monetary System? Is it not everyone \u2014 we the Community \u2014 who has begun this good work? Ought we not to be saying to the Federal Ger man Government and the Governer of the Bundes bank: what you have done is anti-European and is in fact in conflict with your own policy? Because an anti-inflationary policy cannot be pursued unless it is pursued throughout the Community. Otherwise you are bound to fail. That is the basic problem, and is why ",
        "15.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/59 Bangemann I believe in one respect you are right, Mr Tindemans, when you say there is a lack of political will. But I do not think you are right to say that this is not an institu tional question, but I may have misunderstood you. Political will forms only when the right conditions exist. Political will depends on political institutions. And the Liberals, the members of my group, therefore regard the debate we are having about the future insti tutional structure of the Community as an important precondition for the emergence of this political will. It must come. If it does not come in the next few years, if we do not accomplish a fundamental reform of the institutional conditions underlying the political action taken by this Community, we shall lose the bat tle for Europe in the next few years. This is why it is so important for us to see this in context. Political will is needed, but we also need the appropriate institutions to enable this political will to emerge. (Applause) President. \u2014 I call the Group of European Progressive Democrats. Mr de la Mal\u00e8ne. \u2014 (FR) Madam President, Mr President of the Council, I have only ten minutes in which to talk to you about your activities over the past six months, and a very full six months they have been in every respect. We have seen the deepening of exter nal crises, those that have been with us for a long time, but in addition we have seen the development of new and bitter conflicts. At the same time, we have had the usual internal crises, ones which, sadly, come up year after year. These six months have been characterized by a series of important summit meetings aimed at finding solu tions to both the internal and the external crises. And I use the words 'aimed' advisedly. It does not seem to me\u00b7 at the present moment as if we are anywhere near finding any solutions, at least as regards the external I will concentrate the remarks I wish to make on behalf of my group on the internal crises. There, I am happy to say, the achievements of the Belgian presi dency have been very positive. We have been beset by two principal crises: the fixing of farm prices and the development in the European Monetary System. Let me deal first with the problem of farm prices. We have obtained basically a rather indifferent result; indifferent, because the divergence of our economies that we have been witnessing for some time has resulted in our giving too much to some and not enough to others. I should add that the recent deval uation is going to make this indifferent result even worse for some farmers by removing export opportun ities which the devaluation could have created. But along with this indifferent result there is a very positive result: a serious crisis was successfully averted, and all credit for that to you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council. I am referring to what has come to be known as the 'Luxembourg compromise'. Curiously enough, the Luxembourg compromise came about as a result of art attempted abuse of procedure. The Commission at the time was seeking to force the hand of a particular Member State of the Community over an agricultural matter. This led to a crisis, fol lowed by the Luxembourg compromise, an abuse of procedure by the Commission. Last spring there was another case of abuse of proce dure but this time in an attempt to use the Luxem bourg compromise to get a result that was irrelevant to the subject under discussion. We are grateful to you for having done the right thing and insisted on the proper procedure being followed. In the Community, on certain matters there is no veto, but there is a com mon sense rule, which is that, taking into account the situation in the various Member States, decisions are then taken jointly. This common sense rule must be kept if the Community is to survive. However, it is not a mandatory law that applies at all times and means, in particular, that the procedure can be abused as it was in this instance. One must not make a mockery of a common sense rule and we are deeply grateful to you for having averted a really serious crisis. I should also like to say a few words about economic convergence and the European Monetary System. We did have grave fears for the European Monetary Sys tem. We knew very well that it was not enough on its own and that if at the same time there were significant divergences between the economies the European economic framework would collapse. Well, these di vergencies did occur. We saw .differentials between the rates of inflation first appear and then grow, and we did not have long to wait to see the result: monetary realignment. We are grateful to you for authorizing this operation and thus, for the moment, saving the European Monetary System. Perhaps the lesson will have been learned and we shall now see, if we are to believe the information we were given a few days ago, a much closer convergence between economic policies. If that is indeed the case, then the European Monetary System will be able to survive. Those are the two points I wanted to make on behalf of my group. Before I finish, I wish to return to the external crises I mentioned at the beginning. Europe is confronted with external crises which keep on developing. The threat which hangs over us, our democracies, our peace, our living standards today may not be the same threat that hung over us twenty or thirty years ago, in the early ",
        "No 1-286/60 Debates of the European Parliament 15.6.82 de la Mal\u00e8ne days of European integration, but if it has changed it is nevertheless no less serious. We fully appreciate that Our governments' room for manoeuvre is limited and we do not hold that against them: we know it is diffi cult for them to adopt more common measures. But they must realize, as we do, that if we wish to preserve this little island of peace, democracy and relative pros perity, then truly, for them as for us, time is running out. President. \u2014 I call the Group for the Technical Coor dination and Defence of Independent Groups and Members. Mr Vandemeulebroucke. \u2014 (NL) Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, when the Belgian presidency began, the Community was quite definitely in an impasse. Six months later, we can say that the Belgian presidency has left its mark on a number of important events. On the other hand, various problems have not been tack led. There is, for example, the absurd situation as regards the seats of the institutions. Nor has a great deal been done about introducing a uniform proce dure for the 1984 elections. The Arf\u00e9 report on minor ity languages and cultures was shelved, and nothing came of the Jumbo Council. Parliament has already expressed its disappointment at the outcome of the Brussels summit. The Community remained powerless to do anything about the vital questions of economic revival and unemployment. The Belgian presidency did, however, succeed in finding solutions to two serious problems: the British contri bution and the adjustment of farm prices, two prob lems which, though different, are linked. The average 10% increase in farm prices was a good result. Bel gium's farmers, who had suffered serious losses because the green currency was not devalued at the same time as the Belgian franc, were well satisfied with the price adjustment. What was very important was that this adjustment was made on the basis of a major ity decision. This is undeniably a step towards a more effective decision-making process in the Community. It remains to be seen, however, to what extent this decision can be regarded as historical and even as pointing the way for the future. A satisfactory solution was also found to the problem of the British contribution. The Community can breathe again. But in fact the problem of the British contribution has merely been put back for six months. In November the crisis will occur again, twice as ser ious, unless a long-term solution is found and unless th\u00e9 European Community widens the range of its activities and pursues an integrated economic, social and regional policy once and for all. The reaction to the Malvinas crisis was not institution ally unimportant for the Community either. Initially, the Community imposed an embargo and took trade policy measures to achieve a foreign policy objective. This was done quickly and unanimously, but there is no denying that relations between the Community and Latin America have deteriorated as a result of this war and the embargo. It was also expected that the Third World would regard Britain's action and thus Com munity solidarity as a bitter North-South conflict with post-colonial undertones. The question is, further more, whether the Community will now be found will ing to apply the same standards and to react in the same way to similar situations in the world. This brings me, Mr President, to a few less favourable aspects of the Belgian presidency. For example, the declaration on Turkey was completely unsatisfactory considering the gravity of the repression and the obvious violation of human rights in that country. The visit did not in the end produce anything. It is also clear that the whole problem of the Kurdish minority was not discussed during Mr Tindemans' visit to President Evren. I have even greater difficulty with the attitude towards Israel, because during his visit to Israel the President of the Council turned from the traditional policy on the Middle East by speaking appreciatively of the Camp David accord and the negotiations on Pales tinian autonomy. The Venice declaration nevertheless stated that lasting solutions could not be found in the Middle East until the Palestinians were granted the right of self-determi nation and the PLO was actually involved in the peace process. The events in Lebanon are tragic proof that Israel's approach was a sham. To what extent does this change of course reflect the Council's view? The European Community must have an original foreign policy of its own if it wants to stop being looked upon as a satellite of the United States, which prefers all consultations to take place within NATO or, as recently happened, thinks it can dictate to us how far the European Community's trade rela tions with the Eastern Bloc countries may go. We are thus still far from having a genuine European policy, and the President-in-Office has once again emphas ized how many gaps there are. All in all, the Belgian presidency has had its bright spots and its drawbacks, but it must be stressed that the bright spots have clearly dominated. President. \u2014 I call the non-attached Members. Mr Pesmazoglou. \u2014 Madam President, fellow Mem bers, I want to emphasize the great importance of the achievement in the field of European Political Colla boration with which the Belgian presidency was asso ciated in the first six months of 1982, and I also want to commend the persistence, the devotion to the Trea- ",
        "15.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/61 Pesmazoglou ties, but also the imaginative and systematic way in which the President and the Prime Minister of Bel gium dealt with the various matters arising during those first six months. dition for demonstrating the consequence and credi bility of the Community in its international influence. (Applause) European political collaboration is a basic aim of the European Community. I think that by now it has become generally accepted and it means an evolution towards a common foreign policy and European soli darity in relation to security and the defence of our peoples. However, the Belgian presidency in the first six months of 1982 was also associated with certain specific events. The solidarity of the Community with Great Britain in the vital matter of the conflict with Argentina over the Falkland Isles was a categorically positive development and now, only hours after the ceasefire, I think that while recognizing the import ance of this solidarity we must express our sorrow for the victims of this conflict, and also echo what was said a little while ago by our British colleague who emphasized the importance of handling the matter in a way that will underline our common desire to main tain a steady friendship and collaboration with the peoples of Latin America. It was also impressive to see the immediate reaction of the European Community in condemning Israel's incursion into the Lebanon and its expression of sympathy and solidarity with the vic tims of this invasion, both Palestinian and Lebanese. At this time I would like to emphasize the need for the continued involvement of the European Community in matters relating to the Middle East, to bring to an end the vicious circle of violence and to restore the faith of all the Middle Eastern peoples, both of the Palestini ans and other Arab nations and of the people of Israel, in Europe's involvement and in the need to secure the preconditions for survival and progress of all the nations in the Middle East. However, these positive achievements were associated with one serious negative experience, in which the pic ture presented was one of passivity, or rather I would say indifference to a critical matter that concerns the whole of the European Community. The President of the Council, Mr Tindemans, said that he had visited Turkey and referred to the possibility that democracy might be restored in that country. This is a very important matter, but it is not the only such matter. Turkey is guilty of an invasion of Cyprus, and when the position adopted by the European Community is one of condemnation for any invasion, a position which was maintained consistently over both the Falk land Isles and the Israeli invasion of the Lebanon, it is inconceivable and unacceptable for there not to be a corresponding condemnation of the invasion of Cyprus in 1974 and of the prolonged occupation of the island by the Turkish forces which are equipped with more than 200 tanks obtained from the West and supplied for the purpose of serving NATO. This atti tude is unacceptable and the restoration of a position of responsible policy is vitally necessary. It is a precon- President. \u2014 I call Mr Moreau. Mr Moreau. \u2014 (FR) Madam President, I have but a few minutes in which to talk about the realignment of the European Monetary System. Parliament should certainly have had a more extensive debate on this problem. Unfortunately, our agenda has been so arranged that only a very few of us can speak and'we can cover only a few points. The first point I should like to stress is that the recent realignment of the central rates proves, if proof were still needed, that despite the tensions and difficulties we encounter, Europeans can \u2014 but for how long? \u2014 work together with a common sense of purpose. Each individual is still able to take the necessary steps to safeguard the essential but, looking beyond the actual realignment, we have now to give careful considera tion to the underlying reasons for the decisions that had to be taken. There seems to me to be no point in talking about convergence of economic policies unless we are prepared to deal with the fundamental prob lems with which Europe is beset; one or two speakers just now attacked some of the policies. I believe we really need to see exactly what problems we have to face. Europe, as every one of us keeps repeating, is suffering from the diseases of inflation and unemploy ment. Any European strategy today must concentrate on combating these two evils which are undermining the construction of our Community as well as the bond that unites our peoples. We cannot combat one of these evils without being aware of the effects on the other and we hope that what you, Mr Commissioner, said about the German and Dutch revaluation leading to a lowering of interest rates and thus stimulating the internal economy will prove correct. But should one not go further and call on these two countries to adopt controlled recovery measures, seeing that their external balance is in equilibrium? We are aware of the magnitude of the difficulties and we fear that the calm on the monetary front will remain precarious unless the United States, in particular, assume its responsibilities. Everyone is convinced that, regardless of any short- term economic measures that may be taken, in the long term it would be fatal for interest rates to remain at their present level. The responsibility of the United States is today very much involved and there are one or two signs which suggest that they have decided to give a little. We still have to wait and see what deci sions are to be taken and what happens before we shall ",
        "No 1-286/62 Debates of the European Parliament 15.6.82 Moreau know whether Versailles marks something of a turning point or the continuation of anarchy and the policy of 'everyone for himself'. In conclusion, Madam President, Europe has to show proof of a genuine solidarity, but it is vital that we come to some decisions on how to proceed with the development of the European Monetary System \u2014 and I hope, for my part, that the Commission's propos als will be looked at and expanded by the Council. We must, moreover, give proof of real unity if we are to be able to deal in particular with the United States. Fin ally, it seems to me that the measures that have been taken under the Belgian presidency with regard to employment problems will need to be stepped up under future presidencies, for we cannot today talk simply about inflation without seeing the damage being done to our countries by the growth in unem ployment. It is only to the extent that our policies are able to maintain a balance between these two poles that we shall succeed in stabilizing the European Monetary System and at the same time allow our Community to grow in strength. (Applause) President. \u2014 I think, before adjourning the sitting, that it would be natural for a British Vice-President to take this opportunity to express to Mr Tindemans per sonally great gratitude for the leadership he has shown during his presidency and the solidarity that has come out of his presidency on behalf of my country, and to say how thankful we are that it looks that, before the termination of his presidency, the conflict in which we have been engaged will have been brought to a peace ful conclusion.

It is inaccurate in a number of parts. No Member of Parliaments is named or alluded to as being responsible for the sentiments expressed in the article. Mr President, the by-line on this article indicating authorship is Tony Robinson. There is a Press Officer employed by the Socialist Group of this Parliament called Tony Robinson. I have been unable to discover the existence of any other regular journalist reporting on the European Community called Tony Robinson. I call upon you, Mr President, to refer this article, of which, I understand, the President of Parliament already has a copy, to the enlarged Bureau. I call for an inquiry to be carried out as to whether the Tony Robinson who is a Press Officer for the Socialist Group wrote the article in question or had anything to do with it. Furthermore, without prejudice to the answer to these two questions, I call upon the enlarged Bureau to lay down guidelines for staff employed by groups, and hence paid out of public funds and directly or indi rectly servants of Parliament, so as to avoid them get ting into any situation where they would make mock of the institution which employs them and its Mem bers, or where they would pass judgment in their own name in public on the work of Parliament. I call upon the enlarged Bureau to lay down rules regarding any payments that might be offered by newspapers in such circumstances. Finally, Mr President, I call upon the enlarged Bureau to report to Parliament on the conclusions which it comes to after considering these matters. (Applause) IN THE CHAIR: MR KLEPSCH Vice-President President. \u2014 I call Mr Pearce. Mr Pearce. \u2014 Mr President, I wish to refer to an article which appeared in a British newspaper, the Daily Star, on 18 May 1982. I wish it to be referred to the enlarged Bureau. The article is derogatory and mocking of Parliament. It is entitled 'Euro-Gravy Train Takes the Strain'. It begins: 'The days of wine and roses may be numbered in exclusive canteens used by Euro MPs.' It refers to President. \u2014 I shall instruct the Bureau in this connec tion. We shall arrange for the appropriate examination when we have the text to which you refer. I call Mr Beumer. Mr Beumer. \u2014 (NL) Mr President, the Committee on Youth, Culture, Education, Information and Sport met last week and it was asked that this item should also be placed on the agenda. It will therefore be sub mitted to the Committee. I just wanted you to know that. President. \u2014 Thank you for that information, Mr Beumer, but I think we should leave things as I have just indicated. ",
        "15.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/63 President The next item is the continuation of the joint debate on the report of the President-in-Office of the Coun cil. I call Mr Croux. Mr Croux. \u2014 (NL) Mr President, ladies and gentle men, the Belgian Presidency has not yet ended. There is to be another important meeting, and we await an important decision on the conciliation procedure. That is what we hope at least. We also hope that some use ful measures can still be taken with regard to the inter nal market and that progress can be made in the economic sphere and with the new industrial policy to which President Tindemans referred at the beginning of the Belgian presidency. It can already be said that this Parliament is well pleased with the Belgian presidency. Many observers have not hesitated to say that this v Belgian presidency has been of historical importance. I will not dwell on the various points that have been made. I merely want to put forward two ideas as a summary. The Belgian presidency has been important primarily because of the circumstances and the results which have been achieved in these difficult circumstances. President Tindemans gave a brief but dramatic outline: a crisis in the Community, a fresh outbreak of violence abroad, in Poland, the Falklands and Lebanon in particular. In the institutional field the Belgian presidency has achieved major results especially as regards farm prices, the British contribution, conciliation, the Euro pean Foundation, the enlargement of the Community and the renewed negotiations on this subject. In the economic sphere a new European start has been made. In the political sphere there has been cooperation with respect to the three major conflicts I have mentioned : a united reaction with a dual basis, respect for the international legal order, concern for peace and, fin ally, in Libreville and Versailles, new signs of a better approach to our relations with the Third World. That is an impressive list, and now I come to my second objection, Mr President. It is a pity that the presidency has not lasted long enough to raise the objection that should now be raised. Perhaps there will be an opportunity in the next few weeks at the level of the Council, at the level of the Commission and at the level of the European Parliament. If we consider the circumstances on the one hand and the results on the other, we must once again review the internal situation on the Community and its position in the world, a world that is tortured by conflicts, war and the threat of new conflicts, a world that is also tortured by hun ger and poverty, something we shall be discussing fur ther tomorrow. I feel this has been a very good opportunity for the Community to think about these things. Jean Monnet said that we must organize our actions and adopt a pragmatic approach, but with certain objections in mind. We now have new objectives, which we must translate into political action, while taking account of the present situation. President Tindemans, we very much appreciate what you have done for the European Community. We are sure that you and this Parliament will continue to de liberate, because there are fresh signs of hope. President. \u2014 I call Mr Wurtz. Mr Wurtz. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, Mr Tindemans this morning painted a picture of the present state of the European Community that was, to say the least, depressing. I am not surprised. The French members of the Communist and Allies Group believe in fact that presidencies may come and go, but their records, sadly, are the same: a deepening crisis, with all its attendant difficulties and sufferings for our peoples and our countries. The period just coming to an end is no exception. Fall ing production, continuing high inflation and above all unemployment at well over the six million mark. How can we avoid seeing in this abysmal record proof of the fact that the policies pursued hitherto by the Euro pean Community, of which the Davignon plan is a particular example, far from helping to extricate our countries from the crisis, are plunging them ever deeper into it? At the risk of repeating ourselves, we are bound to say again that if Europe genuinely wants to realize the ambition it claims to be pursuing, that is, to find the beginnings of a solution to the fundamental problems affecting our countries, or to put it another way, if we do not want to face the prospect in six months' time of finding ourselves in an even worse situation than the one we have today, it is necessary for the measures we shall be called upon to take jointly to be based on a radically different approach to the Community's role, in which the political and economic independence of each country is respected. This new approach, as we French members of the Communist and Allies Group visualize it, still con forms to the Treaty of Rome. We have in mind, for example, a policy of harmonizing social welfare condi tions in the Europe of Ten on the basis of the highest standards. Whether in the field of working conditions or social insurance or problems of poverty, there is broad scope for positive and constructive Community directives. The same can be said, to take another example, in regard to the use of European social funds. In our view these social funds should no longer be regarded as a sort of salve to be applied to the worst sores, opened up by the ravages of the strategy adopted by the multinationals. One could, indeed one ought to, look upon the Euro pean social funds as socio-economic funds closely ",
        "No 1-286/64 Debates of the European Parliament 15.6.82 Wurtz linking the solution of social problems to the competi tiveness of undertakings, to the development of a healthy and viable economy, and to the creation of stable jobs. We believe that Europe can play a part in providing a positive stimulus to the gradual solution of the employment problem, so long as it combines techno logical progress with vocational training and a reduc tion in working hours without a corresponding cut in wages \u2014 as the French General Confederation of Labour is proposing to the European Trade Union Confederation itself \u2014 in order thereby to create new job opportunities. Do you not think, Mr President of the Council, that the Community would cease to have this unfortunate image in the eyes of public opinion that you men tioned if it were to take the course we are advocating? Clearly this original approach that we are proposing and which would constitute an important step forward along the road to this 'European social area' to which the new French Government is committed, requires, among other things, a very much firmer attitude to international constraints, in particular to the economic and monetary policy of the United States. These fac tors have contributed in no small measure to the need for monetary realignment within the European Mone tary System. Just to conclude \u2014 since I am being asked to wind up my speech \u2014 I should like, Mr President, to put to you two questions. The first is: What concrete decisions does the Com munity propose to take to develop monetary coopera tion among the Ten, in line with the undertaking given at the Versailles Summit to, and I quote, 'work towards a constructive and ordered development of the international monetary system'? And the second is: How does the Community propose to fulfil that other undertaking at Versailles, that is, finally to open global North-South negotiations under the aegis of the United Nations on the basis of the resolution tabled by the Group of 77} President. \u2014 I call Mr Haagerup. Mr Haagerup. \u2014 (DA) Mr President, I should like to begin by saying that, in my Group and also in the Po litical Affairs Committee, we value the will to con structive cooperation shown by Council President Tindemans during the Belgian presidency. It has been all the more gratifying in view of the many serious international crises we have witnessed in recent months, in which the Community's unity and capacity for action have been put to the test. Nevertheless, we should not now simply congratulate ourselves \u2014 and I am sure that Mr Tindemans would agree with me that we should not waste our time that way \u2014 but instead seriously consider the demands imposed on our Com munity by the world about us with its many dangers and threats to peace. One of these demands is that there must be close coor dination between what is decided in the framework of European political cooperation and what is decided within the framework of cooperation based on the Treaty. My Group has long stressed the need for the Community and the ten Member States to act in the face of common external dangers on the basis of a common strategy and not to allow themselves to be paralysed by institutional difficulties or political reser vations at home with regard to the further develop ment of European cooperation. Let me say this as an aside for the special attention not so much of the incumbent presidency as of the presidency to come. We are fully aware that it is not only through institu tional changes or revisions of the Treaty that the necessary basis for common action will be found, however important my Group may consider these institutional innovations to be. The basis should on the contrary be sought in the first instance in the indivi dual Member States, and my Group regards the events of recent months \u2014 the Falklands conflict, the conflict in the Lebanon and the long-standing crises, such as the occupation of Afghanistan and oppression in Poland \u2014 as clear proof that our ten countries can only exert an influence on events by common, resolute action. There will be a greater need for such action in the time to come, and what Mr Tindemans has said here today merits putting into some relief. As Mem bers of Parliament, we must play our part in seeking to spread the necessary understanding of this need in our own countries for, without that understanding, our Community will not be able to show itself strong enough to meet the challenges both of the present and of the future. President. \u2014 I call Mr Romualdi. Mr Romualdi. \u2014 (IT) Mr President, ladies and gen tlemen, in the few minutes at my disposal it is not easy even to list the issues under discussion, stressing their importance, much less express a responsible judgment on them, as ought to be done. Is this a responsible way to deal with the vital problems of our Community? Can we seriously sum up in a few sentences the six months of the Belgian presidency, which coincided with so many economic events of immeasurable signif icance? There was the steel crisis and the resulting unemployment, the energy crisis, the crisis in agricul ture; there was a series of manoeuvers within the EMS which some \u2014 among them Mr Ortoli, speaking for the Commission \u2014 believe will strengthen the System. Others think that such manoeuvers are on the contrary a sign of new and insuperable difficulties which will ",
        "15.6. 82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/65 Romualdi make it even harder to overcome the divergencies existing among the various currencies and economies of the Community. During the Belgian presidency weighty and painful political events took place: the Falkland Islands conflict in the South Atlantic, the dramatic and tragic clashes in the Middle East and the Persian Gulf, the prolongation of the tragic situation in Poland, the occupation of Afghanistan. Are we acting responsibly in trying to discuss all this? And \u2014 as if it were not enough \u2014 in completing our agenda with the examination of the situation illus trated in the Haagerup document or the study of the results of the Versailles Summit? What sort of discus sions can give prestige to the work of our Parliament, or strengthen the interdependent relationship among the Community institutions called for by our President here this morning? What sort of discussions can res pond positively to the expectations of the millions of Europeans who elected us so that we could treat their problems responsibly, attempting here to find the solu tions that our individual countries are no longer able to find? As for the Falklands, we have already said three times that it was a deplorable coup deforce followed by a dis proportionate reaction, with very serious political con sequences. As for the European Council of Brussels, we had already declared its failure last month, and if solutions were later found to break out of the impasse presented by agricultural prices and the now historic problem the British contribution, this does not mean that we have moved in the direction of stable solutions for these fundamental questions. As for the Versailles meeting, its results were negli gible, whether on the level of a common fight against inflation and recession, and thereby against unemploy ment, or on the issue of East-West economic relations. Interest rates have remained unchanged, and so have trade relations with the East. The difficulties in the realization of a common economic order in the indus trialized nations and the role, unfortunately a minimal one, which Community Europe can play are only too clear. Someone wrote that in the competition between the United States and Europe, Japan has been the vic tor. We do not know if this is true, but the very fact that it has been said is already significant. As for the Middle East, the failure of our various peace efforts and attempts at mediation can have no more dramatic and painful confirmation. President Tindemans said that, on the level of the economy, our hopes have been shipwrecked in the whirlpool of a crisis v.-hich is no longer circumstantial but structural and endemic, from which there can be no escape without radical changes in our policies. This is the only statement that affirms, as President Tinde mans rightly said, that a diplomatic Europe is no longer enough. We need a political Europe, capable of political initiatives and willing to use the political instruments at its disposal with greater firmness and independence. President. \u2014 I should like to welcome the members of the Belgian Provincial Government of Limburg, who are present in the Visitors' Gallery. (Applause) We are glad they take so much interest in our work. I call Mr Ripa di Meana. Mr Ripa di Meana. \u2014 (IT) Mr President, public opi nion in our countries is justifiably anxious these days concerning the war in the Falklands, the invasion of Lebanon, and the intermittent war between Iran und Iraq; however, a forgotten war, or at least one fol lowed without equal attention in Europe, has been going on for two and a half years in the heart of cen tral Asia, where the Soviet Union, which invaded Afghanistan in December of 1979, is vainly trying to subdue the people of that country. The war in Afghanistan has already caused the death of tens of thousands of soldiers and patriots, old peo ple, women, and children; it has caused the destruc tion of towns and. villages; it has caused famine in entire regions and, in the wake of unspeakable cruel ties and privations, it has led to the forced exodus of more than three and a half million human beings, ou.t of an entire population of about sixteen million. If today this Parliament can discuss and make concrete decisions on solidarity, it is only because a people has fought and continues to fight, with heroic courage, against the military might of a superpower, maintain ing before the world the problem of those who refuse to disappear from the stage of history. The principal merit of the rapporteur, Mr Isra\u00ebl, lies in the fact that he explained, with extreme precision and a particular personal commitment, the central objec tive of the resolution that will be voted upon tomor row: the political and diplomatic recognition of the Afghan resistance; a recognition prepared and justi fied, before the incredulous eyes of the entire world, by the battle of the patriots and the support of the entire people, who in this way have been able to keep more than threequarters of the national territory free. This point is clear and convincing in the report and in the text of the resolution. For the Socialist Group, the promoters \u2014 as Mr Isra\u00ebl kindly mentioned \u2014 of this resolution, which follows the original Van Miert and Glinne proposal, this recognition is due because it has been earned by the resistance, and it is necessary for a diplomatic and po- ",
        "No 1-286/66 Debates of the European Parliament 15.6.82 Ripa di Meana liticai solution. Indeed, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand \u2014 then leader of the French Socialists \u2014 proposed it in the spring of 1980, amid widespread indifference both within the country and beyond, as an urgent necessity for the resolution of the crisis, adhering to an ideal continuity with what was done in the preceding decades, at the time of the Algerian and Vietnamese resistance. The presence of the Afghan resistance appears as an indispensable element in the search for a way to resolve the crisis. The absence of this real force from the table in Geneva \u2014 where an initial contact is now being attempted, under the auspices of the United Nations \u2014 leads this effort to be regarded with justifi able scepticism. Without the sole authentic and legiti mate representatives of the Afghan people \u2014 that is, the resistance movement \u2014 no lasting solution for Afghanistan will be found. The withdrawal of the Soviet troops and the return of Afghanistan to the ranks of the non-aligned nations must be guaranteed, first of all, by those who have resisted and still resist Soviet arms, and by those for whom a return to non- alignment is a central objective. For its part the Socialist Group has drawn up several amendments, most of which have already been pre sented in the Political Affairs Committee. These amendments, without undermining the central points of the resolution \u2014 the recognition of the resistance and the increase of aid \u2014 tend to make it more suc cinct, eliminating the passages which are not founded on adequate international documentation \u2014 I am thinking of the use of chemical weapons in Afghani stan \u2014 or which are redundant because of the obvious relationship between cause and effect which exists between the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the crisis of d\u00e9tente in the world and, therefore, also in Europe. We hope Parliament will adopt them. (Applause) President. \u2014 I call Mr Bournias. Mr Bournias. \u2014 (GR) Mr President, ladies and gen tlemen, the Greek European parliamentarians belong ing to the European People's Party have observed with satisfaction the activity of the Council of\u00b7 Ministers during the period of the Belgian presidency under dis cussion, a period marked by many difficult and unforeseen problems. Even before we joined the European Community we were familiar with the personality and the great auth ority of Leo Tindemans. Indeed, during the course of his six months of service as President of the Council, he demonstrated his forcefulness and his faith in the European ideal which, realistically stated, aims to unite Europeans by closely allying their countries. Under the Tindemans presidency the attempt to develop the EEC is continuing, as was discussed at the previous session of the European Council in London concerning the main themes, namely improving the way in which the statutes operate and developing the political collaboration from which the achievements in the economic sector stem. Unfortunately, in his speech today Mr Tindemans has expressed concern about this area and told us that the Member States are trying to act at a national and not at a Community level. For tunately, during the period under discussion the close collaboration between the Council and the Assembly called for by the direct choice of the representatives of the EEC nations was continued. However, the thing that above all characterizes the Belgian presidency is what I would call the revolution ary innovation in the statutory sector, concerning the determination of the prices for agricultural products in the period 1982-1983 by majority vote in spite of the 1969 Luxembourg agreements and the vigorous opposition of Great Britain. Of course, the solution found is a temporary one but the practical gain is that we have overcome a major crisis all over the world. In other words the Initiative of President Tindemans, which we first saw on 26 January 1982, and by which our commercial policy towards Poland and the Soviet Union was decided by majority vote, has been repeated. A further achievement of the presidency just lapsed was the signing, on 29 March 1982, of the agreement between the Ministers or Foreign Affairs of the Mem ber States concerning the establishment of the Euro pean Foundation, which as Mr Tindemans emphasized in his speech on the occasion of celebrating the 25th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome, and as he has repeated today in our Assembly, will bring Europe closer to its citizens and will develop Euro pean solidarity. Of course, there are detractors and I myself will not find it difficult to agree with the vigorous protest of my colleague Mr Beumer about a number of matters, chiefly about why the European Assembly was not consulted beforehand. This last fact is not to the credit of the Tindemans presidency, and the same applies in my opinion, which I made so bold as to express to him in person, to the optimism with which he regarded the situation in Turkey during his visit to Ankara, follow ing which he invited us to support the ruling junta in spite of all that is happening in that country to the cost of individual freedom, democracy and human rights, because the military dictators and the academics sur rounding them promise a return to parliamentary democracy by 1984. You were optimistic Mr President, as I also told you on the Political Committee, when you were describing to us the results of your journey, but your optimism is inexcusable after the barbarous, and I repeat, barba rous invasion of Cyprus by the hordes of Attila, which ",
        "15.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/67 Bournias has continued for almost eight years. You gave me no answer then, and I hope you will give me one now fol lowing the commendable stance of the EEC over the invasion by Israel and the invasion of the Falkland Isles. President. \u2014 I call Mr Ephremidis. Mr Ephremidis. \u2014 (GR) Mr President, for us the Bel gian presidency \"has been negative from start to finish, and in all its aspects. Unfortunately, time does not allow me to refute, one by one, each and every point claimed as positive by Mr Tindemans. However, I can not avoid mentioning that in this contrived discussion many and various matters have become mixed up together and that among these subjects we almost got as far as talking about the World Cup to divert atten tion from the main problems that preoccupy the peo ples of the Community, the burning problems that are with us right now, so that policies might slip through which go against the interests of the people and of peace. Among all the other matters, Mr Tindemans has aeen fit to refer to the barbarous invasion of the Lebanon, and with excessive self-righteousness, said that the statement by the Council of Ministers was made to condemn the invasion. But, Mr President, whereas for some days before the invasion Israel was announcing its intention to invade, Mr Tindemans was uninformed and what did he do in reply to deter the announced invasion? And what did the French presi dent do when he visited Jerusalem a short while ago? What did the Versailles Conference achieve when this barbarous invasion erupted while it was in session? What did the NATO Conference achieve while the invasion was beginning and continuing? President. \u2014 I call Mrs Spaak. tifie policy. And I cannot forbear to mention the com pl\u00e8te absence of Council representatives at the debate on the Commission's new programme concerning equality of opportunity between men and women. Mr Minister, Europe is sick. It is suffering from a sort of general debility. Politicians at the highest level \u2014 like yourself and your colleagues \u2014 keep giving it small doses of medicine when really major surgery is called for. Is it not high time, in other words, that we moved on from proceedings to procedures? Do you think, for instance, that this diplomatic exer cise of starting every six months with a tour of the capitals is pointless? This feast of fine words, cour teous welcomes and declarations of good intentions does nothing to mask Europe's lack of political weight. Your visit to Israel is a distressing example of what I mean. It is said that, in contrast to the United States which forms a unit without complexity, Europe is a complex without unity. It is time we found our true European dimension. The French moralist Pascal, in one of his discourses on the condition of the great, described admirably the differ ence between 'extrinsic greatness' and 'intrinsic great ness'. ' Europe, today, exists, and as such it is heeded. Its min isters are received with interest, it holds ostentatious summits, it has acquired 'extrinsic greatness'. The day when it is consulted and its opinions are respected, when solutions it might propose are taken into consid eration, the day, finally, when it has hit on a new and better way of living, on that day it will have acquired 'intrinsic greatness'. (Applause) Mrs Spaak. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, the Belgian presi dency is coming to an end and no one will deny that it will have been a first-rate one, thanks to you, Mr Min ister, and thanks also to the cooperation which has been established between the Council and the Com mission. It is precisely the high standard of this presi dency that reveals more clearly the inadequacy of the system and its chaotic side. What is the record of the Belgian presidency? Positive as regards the regulation on farm prices. The problem of the British budget contribution has been put off for six months: that is a partial success. Little has been achieved as regards a more coherent social policy, an industrial policy or a renewed scien- President. \u2014 I call Mr De Goede. Mr De Goede. \u2014 (NL) Mr President, when the Bel gian presidency began, a number of major problems still existed : the fixing of farm prices and a provisional settlement of the question of the British contribution. Both these problems, which paralysed the Community for so long, have now been settled. I should like to thank Mr Tindemans and Mr De Keersmaeker for their not insignificant efforts in this respect. Where progress has been limited is in the question of the mandate of 30 May. The new version of the Hop per report is on today's agenda. I have already expressed my opinion on this on two previous occa sions and as I have very little speaking time, I should like to say straight away that I fully endorse the rejec- ",
        "No 1-286/68 Debates of the European Parliament 15.6.82 De Goede tion of the idea o\u00ed juste retour. After all, a purely budg etary approach does not take account of the Com munity's many achievements, and especially the enor mous expansion of trade among the Member States. The rate at which the Commission and particularly the Council are dealing with the mandate of 30 May gives cause for concern. We have now been deliberating for about two years, and we have little to show for it. I should like to hear from the President of the Council whether he expects this matter to be settled before it is Belgium's turn to take over the presidency again. Is there a timetable which might make us feel more optimistic? To conclude, I have two comments to make. Firstly, if we do not succeed in improving and, of course, speed ing up our decision-making processes, there will be no further integration of development and what has already been achieved will be at risk. There is now some hope that the decision-making process in the Council \u2014 I am thinking now of the recent fixing of farm prices \u2014 will receive a new impulse. What is the view of the President of the Council on this? Secondly, one of the causes of the stagnation of Euro pean integration is the repeated enlargement of the Community. The decisions taken in the Council are an indication of this, since, in the short term at least, the two objectives scarcely seem compatible: on the one hand, progressive integration, particularly in the economic and monetary spheres, on the other, the equally desirable enlargement of the Community to include such countries as Spain and Portugal. The question is whether we can go on much longer with out a two-speed systeem. I know there are major objections to this: it would weaken, perhaps even destroy the foundations of the Community. On the other hand, it would have the advantage of allowing certain countries, the stronger ones, to press ahead, rather than being held up by the weaker ones. An extremely difficult choice. This choice might be made easier if the stronger countries assumed greater res ponsibility for the weaker ones. But the establishment of this position will undoubtedly give rise to major problems and renewed polarities. I should also like to hear what the outgoing President of the Council feels about this. And finally, the changes in parities. If I am not mis taken, last weekend's adjustment was the sixth since the introduction of the EMS in 1976. Furthermore, the time elapsing between adjustments is becoming shorter and shorter, which is a bad sign. The convergence of the various economies requires urgent agreements on balance-of-payments positions, government financing deficits and rates of inflation. Such balance can be achieved if the economic policies of the Member States have something like the same premises, objec tives and instruments. We are still far removed from that, as regards inflation rates, for example. Mr Presi dent, I will conclude by expressing my satisfaction at the fact that consultations within the framework of European political cooperation have continued to operate reasonably well in the last year. Poland, the Falklands crisis, the Middle East and Turkey \u2014 these are four examples which show that a joint position carries more weight than each of the Ten taken on its President. \u2014 I call the Commission. Mr Thorn, President of the Commission. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, allow me to begin my brief statement on the Versailles Summit of the industrialized countries with the general remark that the organization of this sum mit was, in every respect, outstanding. The representa tives of the European Communities, be it Mr Martens, Mr Tindemans or myself, were present throughout and, whether from the point of view of protocol or speeches or discussions, we participated on an equal footing with the representatives of the invited coun tries. Versailles has thus confirmed the position of the Community in world affairs. I believe I owed it to you to put that on record. As for the problems of substance, let us remind our selves first of all of the topics that were the main object of the summit talks: technology, employment and growth. These topics were introduced by the President of the French Republic himself, who presented a very full report to the summit. It is the first time at a West ern summit that a question has been broached which does not call for an immediate joint position from the partners and-raises instead problems of a medium- and long-term nature. The President of the Republic wanted to introduce this innovation and include these topics for two rea sons, I think: firstly, to give a little bit of depth, of scope, to the standard items on the agenda and to place present-day problems within a time perspective; secondly, because new technology is starting to assume an importance that will eventually change the face of the world, its consequences being not only of a commercial and economic nature, but also of a cul tural and structural nature. In other words, the theme of technology actually overlapped the principal topics discussed at the summit: growth and employment, North-South cooperation and trade. Each delegation gave its initial reaction to the report presented by Mr Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and in the light of this we decided to set up, for an indefinite period, a working party consisting of representatives of the seven governments and the European Communities whose task is to submit concrete proposals based on the objectives and guidelines jointly laid down. This working party, Mr President, will be submitting its report by 31 December of this year. The next summit, as you no doubt know, is due to be held in the United States in 1983 and will study this report. The actual discussions were taken up by four topics: macroeconomic policy, international trade, the ",
        "15.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/69 Thorn North-South Dialogue and East-West relations. I should say, in passing, that the subject of energy scarcely came up, since virtually all the participants hold similar views. If you consider the four topics I have just mentioned, you will find that they are the same ones that came up in Ottawa. Three of them were explicitly linked throughout the whole conference, especially by the American delega tion, which intended if you like to make their conces sions on certain points dependent on the reaction of its partners on other topics. Needless to say, it was the question of East-West relations which presented the greatest difficulties, as everyone said it would. Let us begin with the economic policies. The priority objective of the European Council of March 1982 essentially became the priority objective of this Coun cil of industrialized countries. Growth and employ ment must be re-established, it was said at Versailles, as we for our part had already said. This objective must be attained without any relaxation at all in the fight against inflation, primarily through policies that encourage productive investment and technological progress. Mr President, that is almost word for word the main concern expressed by the last European Council. In order to revive investment it is essential \u2014 and here I quote from the communiqu\u00e9 \u2014 to bring down interest rates, which at present are intolerably high, and secure more stable exchange rates. That is what it says in the Versailles communiqu\u00e9. In this res pect I feel we made some progress at Versailles by comparison with the Ottawa Summit or, if you wish, and to use a more cautious formula, the conditions for progress to be made were fulfilled at Versailles, thanks to the monetary undertaking which was agreed and appended to the communiqu\u00e9. This undertaking, Mr President, constitutes progress or, to put it more pre cisely because more simply, makes way for progress to be made on two counts: firstly, by the very existence of the undertaking and by virtue of the measures which must be taken quickly with a view to its actual implementation. Secondly, by virtue of its contents, which reveal that the United States has accepted, if not to change its philosophy, at least to abandon the rig idly doctrinaire policy it has followed hitherto, in particular by agreeing to the possibility, if necessary, of intervening on the foreign exchange market. For the markets and for the dealers, who, up to now, have worked on the firm basis that intervention by the fed eral government could be totally discounted, this is a new factor which may influence attitudes, even though we know that such intervention will take place only in exceptional circumstances. We can now say that the Federal Reserve Board's intervention yesterday undoubtedly represents an ini tial application of this change in attitude. We shall in any event have an opportunity over the coming months to check on the true impact of this undertak ing and on the degree to which the views of the United States and Europe have converged. You will not have failed to observe that the undertaking imposes a special duty to cooperate which includes the European Communities and makes specific reference to the European Monetary System. In the area of trade, we were all of us agreed in under lining that it is absolutely essential and vital to safe guard the open system of international trade and to resist protectionist pressures, so as not to repeat the tragic error committed in the 1930s which helped to turn recession into depression. In this connection, we expressed our desire to take an active part at the GATT ministerial conference, the first for almost ten years, and to make this crucial meeting a success. As regards more specific problems concerning trade, I felt obliged to point out to our partners that the success of this GATT conference would be made more certain if, between now and November, we could devote our selves more single-mindedly to finding a solution to the following three problems: first, the problem of the worsening commercial tensions between the Com munity and the United States; second, the problem of the unprecedented surpluses that Japan is running up vis-\u00e0-vis its partners, ourselves in particular; third, the problem of the support to be given without delay to growth and to import capacity in the developing coun tries, which are sinking dangerously deeper and deeper into recession and debt, especially since last year. As regards Japan, I took the liberty of telling its Prime Minister, Mr Suzuki, that the Community regarded the Japanese measures announced shortly before the summit as a significant move and an indication of his country's awareness of the need to open up its market further. I added, however, that the Community felt that these measures did not come up to the needs and expectations of the Community, which expects Japan to show political determination and adopt a package of coordinated measures corresponding more closely to the realities of the situation and, above all, to the scale of the imbalance. As for the United States, I particularly drew President Reagan's attention to the dangers of numerous com plaints being filed against European steel exporters on the basis of American legislation, as well as against our exports of farm produce within the framwork of GATT, not to mention the repeated public attacks on the CAP launched by members of the American administration. I have told our American partners that such an attitude could snowball and get out of control. To my very great regret, Mr President, I cannot say that this appeal, which had the advantage of being very clear, elicited a positive response from our Ameri can counterparts. It is damaging to the credibility of these summits and to the cohesion of the Atlantic part nership that, five days after Versailles, the American Government unilaterally adopted protectionist meas ures against European steel exports, thus creating a serious political situation between the United States and the Community. The Community cannot accept ",
        "No 1-286/70 Debates of the European Parliament 15.6.82 Thorn either the complaints made to it regarding the condi tions in which it exports to the United States, or any measure that would unjustly penalize our exports. The present attitude of the American administration does not seem to me to be consistent with the spirit of the Versailles discussions and guidelines. I should like to recall, Mr President, that the Community has embarked on a programme to restructure its steel industry which entails considerable sacrifices in terms of jobs and production capacity. The aids that are granted are intended for investment with a view to rationalizing and modernizing the production process. They are regulated at Community level by the code on aids which ensures both their transparency and their consistency. In no way do they constitute export subsi dies. The Community is ready to enter into a dialogue to overcome these difficulties but it cannot accept a fait accompli. It intends to present its case in accord ance with the relevant procedures and before the appropriate international bodies. It will act with deter mination, concerned to see preserved a just balance between the rights and obligations of protagonists in international trade. As for the East-West question, it was, as I told you earlier, the most difficult because the most complex, politically the most sensitive, the one on which diver gences of views and divergences of interests stood out most sharply. After long discussions, which took place in restricted session and also in plenary session, we finally came up with a compromise text which identifies three areas for concerted action and provides for periodic joint review of developments. This text was judged by all to be suitably moderate and balanced, suggesting as it does that our approach in relations with the USSR and the countries of Eastern Europe should remain cautious, compatible with our political and security interests, and flexible. This means no doubt that the guidelines laid down at the summit can be applied differently, depending on the specific situations of individual part ners, but on the basis that such application is in keep ing with the agreed formula counselling caution, sound business management and compatibility with our interests. Finally we come to the North-South Dialogue, the last topic of discussion. Two results deserve to be high lighted because they offer the prospect of some pro gress in relation to the Ottawa Summit. The first con cerns the global negotiations. The participants in the summit are now agreed on the conditions for the opening of global negotiations, an understanding hav ing been reached on certain amendments proposed to the draft resolution tabled by the Group of 77. Given that the amendments are of relatively minor signific ance, it is to be hoped that an agreement may quickly follow. In that event, it would no longer be unreas onable to expect at least the preliminary phase of the global negotiations to begin before the end of the year. This would after all be an important step forward because this matter has been blocked for over two years now and is liable to become a potentially explo sive element in the North-South situation. I am happy to say that the Communities, and the Commission in particular, have played an essential role in reconciling the various points of view in this area. The second point concerns the real desire expressed by all to make progress at the annual meeting of the IMF and the World Bank with a view to improving the financing of the balance-of-payments deficits of the developing countries. This expressed desire comes at just the right time and leads one to hope that we shall see the launching of a short-term programme of assist ance to the developing countries, especially the Afri can countries. In conclusion, if you were to ask me, Mr President, to sum up in a few words my verdict on this summit, I would not tell you that Versailles saw the emergence of a united front firmly resolved to tackle all the prob lems and the crisis, following the same policies and with the same sense of urgency\u00b7. However, I do believe that on the three main topics on which the outline of a compromise was mapped out \u2014 economic policy, North-South Dialogue, East-West relations \u2014 we at least saw evidence at Versailles of a better mutual understanding of individual positions and a partial reconciliation between points of view or, if you prefer, a lessening of differences which could produce results in the months immediately ahead. To go any further than that would be to run the risk of misleading you, and that I refuse to do. Let us wait and see if the inten tions expressed at Versailles will stand the test of time, between now and the end of the year, and then we shall have a better idea. Mr President, allow me to say just one more thing concerning the order of business here today. I under stand that the House will now be considering in open debate questions relating more specifically to the Community's internal activities. Mr Hopper's report on the response of the Commission of the European Communities to the mandate of 30 May 1980 will be considered in this context. I will therefore, if I may, come back to that in the light of what Members may have to say in that connection. (Applause) President. \u2014 The first part of the joint debate is closed. The vote will take place at the next voting time. The next item is part two of the joint debate on \u2014 the report (Doc. 1-307/82) by Mr Hopper, drawn up on behalf of the Committee on Economic and ",
        "15.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/71 President Monetary Affairs, on the Commission's response to the mandate of 30 May 1980; \u2014 the oral question with debate (Doc. 1-156/82) to the Council by Mr Beumer, drawn up on behalf of the Committee on Youth, Culture, Education, Information and Sport: Subject: European Foundation (a) On 29 March 1982 the Foreign Ministers of the Member States of the Community signed the Agreement establishing the European Foundation (th\u00e9 creation of which was originally recom mended by Mr Tindemans in his report on Euro pean Union), thus implementing the agreement of principle adopted by the European Council in December 1977. (b) By virtue of its legal status this Foundation is an instrument of inter-governmental cooperation and as such prevents the Community institutions from exercising the powers and responsibilities laid down by the Treaties. ' In the light of the provisions of the Agreement and the Final Act, the Committee on Youth, Culture, Educa tion, Information and Sport puts the following ques tions to the Council: 1. Why was the Foundation not set up by a regula tion based on Article 235 of the EEC Treaty, as suggested by the Commission of the European Communities in its 1977 report to the European\" Council, especially when one considers the advan tages of such an arrangement of the financing of the Foundation? 2. Why was the European Parliament not informed or consulted on the provisions governing this Foundation as it had requested in its resolution of 18 April 1978 (Doc. 575-77)? 3. Is it true that in order to finance the Foundation it has been agreed that the Community budget should contribute 4 million ECU, spread out over the first three years as follows: \u2014 1 million for the first year, 1 \u00b7 5 million for the second and 1 -5 million for the third? 4. As this contribution would have to be charged against non-compulsory expenditure \u2014 on which the European Parliament has the final say \u2014 is it intended that there should be a 'political agree ment' between the competent Community institu tions so that a presumption in favour of the re newal of the subsidy for the following years might, at least partially, guarantee the implemen tation of the programme, as deemed necessary by the Commission in the abovementioned report? 5. Does the Council consider that it should be the responsibility of the Commission of the European Communities to nominate the 10 Community members on the Council of the Foundation and that Parliament, whose opinion would be binding on the Commission, should first be consulted thereupon? 6. Does the Council find it satisfactory that the links between the Foundation and the Community institutions are confined to financial control by the Court of Auditors and to the forwarding of the annual general report, for information, to the institutions of the Community? Does it not think it would be useful to provide for closer contact with the European Parliament in the form of, for example, an annual 'colloquy' between its Com mittee on Culture and the Council of the Founda tion, along the lines of the mechanisms governing European political cooperation? 7. As the activities of the Foundation are supposed to complement those of other institutions and bodies, how will the Council be able to ensure that there is no duplication of activities already organized by the Community (exchanges between young peo ple, language learning, etc.) and by the Council of Europe? 8. Does not the Council agree that there is a real danger that the European Foundation may, not only by its indirect activities but in particular by the activities it may carry out directly, ultimately have the effect of curtailing the powers hitherto acquired by the Community or preventing the extension thereof to other areas? \u2014 the oral question with debate (Doc. 1-157/82) to the Commission, drawn up by Mr Beumer on behalf of the Committee on Youth, Culture, Edu cation, Information and Sport: Subject: European Foundation (a) On 29 March 1982 the Foreign Ministers of the Member States of the Community signed the Agreement establishing the European Foundation \u2014 recommended by Mr Tindemans in his report on European Union \u2014 thereby implementing the agreement reached in principle at the European Council of December 1977. (b) The European Foundation is based on an inter governmental agreement between the Member States of the Community contrary to the Euro pean Parliament's opinion expressed in its resolu tion of 18 April 1978 (Doc. 575/77) calling for Article 235 of the Treaty to be taken as the legal basis. (c) Since the legal basis of the Foundation makes it an instrument of inter-governmental cooperation, the Community institutions are prevented from exer cizing the powers and responsibilities laid down in the Treaties. (d) According to the terms of the agreement, the Foundation's financial resources are provided pri marily by a contribution from the Community, in ",
        "No 1-286/72 Debates of the European Parliament 15.6.82 President addition to which it may receive contributions from charitable, public or private bodies. (e) The Community is required to appoint to the Foundation's decision-making body, the Council, 10 members in addition to the 20 members desig nated by the Member States, while the remaining 10 members are co-opted. In view of this : 1. What appropriations does the Commission intend to enter in its 1983 draft preliminary budget for the Foundation? 2. Does the Commission consider that the require ment on Parliament to approve the necessary funds to allow this Foundation to operate can be reconciled with the fact that it is not able to exer cize political control over the Foundation's plans or programme? 3. In the Commission's view, which body should nominate the 10 members that the Community is required to appoint to the Foundation's Council and does it not consider that, while this task falls to the Commission, it should consult Parliament in advance and be bound by its opinion? 4. As the activities of the Foundation are supposed to complement those of other institutions and bodies, to what extent can the Commission as 'guardian of the Treaties' ensure that there is no duplication with the activities currently being carried out by the Community and the Council of Europe (youth exchanges, language learning, etc.) ? 5. Since the Foundation may also take direct action at its own initiative, does the Commission not consider that this may prevent the Community, and the European Parliament in particular, from taking any initiatives in the field of cultural coop eration leaving this entirely in the hands of the Foundation? 6. Finally, does not the Commission consider that there is a real danger that the European Founda tion may eventually become a privileged body directly empowered either to take or to propose action to the Member States, thereby curtailing the responsibilities already vested in the Com munity and preventing their extension to new sec tors? \u2014 the oral question with debate (Doc. 1-341/82) by Mr M\u00f8ller and others, to the Commission: Subject: Basis for decisions in the Council In its capacity as guardian of the Treaties, will the Commission answer the following questions: 1. On what legal basis were the Community regula tions on agricultural prices for 1982 and the trade sanctions against Argentina adopted? 2. In taking these decisions, has the Council com plied with the provisions of the Treaty? 3. What is the Commission's attitude towards the so-called Luxembourg compromise? I call the rapporteur. Mr Hopper, rapporteur. \u2014 Mr President, two years ago the Council of Ministers drew up its mandate of 30 May and entrusted it to the European Commission. It is a document that has been much criticized, and rightly so. It called for the prevention of unacceptable situations but did not tell us what an unacceptable situation was. The most extraordinary aspect of this document was that it expected new policies to be introduced and all policies to be reformed in time to prevent unacceptable situations arising in the year 1982. I quote the actual document. For 1982, the Community is pledged to resolve the problem by means of structural change. Its authors took an unbe lievably sanguine view of the decision-making capacity of the European Community, and one which very few in this House will share. There has also been criticism of the European Com mission for the way it executed the mandate. The Commission's response appeared on 24 June 1981, one year after the mandate was issued. The delay in publi cation was excusable: the Commission was awaiting the outcome of the French elections. What I find inex cusable is that this long delay was not put to good use. It surely provided an opportunity for the leisured production of well thought-out draft papers on all rele vant subjects. I support the Commission in its general approach to the mandate exercise \u2014 and would be grateful if the President of the Commission could give me a little attention, since I am addressing him through you, Mr President. The Commission interpreted the mandate as an opportunity of a badly-needed review of all the Community policies and for putting forward broad- based ideas for reform. The budgetary deficit of one Member State was the excuse and the starting-point for the exercise; but the scope of the documents pre pared by the Commission went far beyond the prob lems of that Member State. I regret, and the Com mittee on Economic and Monetary Affairs regrets, that these documents were not sufficiently specific and that taken as a whole, in our opinion, they lacked a clear sense of direction. I now turn to the three chapters of the mandate and shall discuss some of the priorities for each chapter as seen by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. The first chapter concerned non-agricultural policies. The committee believed that in the long term the answer to the problem of budgetary imbalance was the development of new Community policies and the reform of existing policies. It called for social policy to have the highest priority. It strongly s'upported the ",
        "15.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/73 Hopper emphasis in the Commission's paper on job creation. It also called for a strengthened regional policy endowed with more resources and with much better coordina tion between Community and national objectives. It called for the development of a proper Community industrial strategy and the completion of the common market by, for example, removing obstacles to the provision of services. On all these questions, the com mittee asked for more specific proposals on which the Council would be obliged to take a position. With regard to agriculture, the committee was divided between those who thought that reforms were required and those who thought that the policy merely required amelioration. The entire committee believed ' that there was a need to improve the organization of production in order to permit structural surpluses to be brought under greater control. It also believed that there was a need to eliminate disparities between more and less-favoured countries. With regard to the budgetary chapter, the committee reiterated the views expressed on many occasions by this Parliament on the need for a new, general and permanent financial mechanism. I refer in particular to the excellent reports by Mr Lange and by Mr Pfennig on this subject. A general mechanism set up in 1976 certainly exists, but quite simply, it has not worked. The committee warned of the harmful effects of repeated annual negotiations about the deficits of one Member State. Mr President, I regret to say that there are some Members of this House who feel that the mandate exercise is over. Indeed, there are those who question whether we should be debating it all today. If you take the narrowest possible view of the mandate exercise, that it is about the budgetary problems of one Member State, then clearly it is not over. Nothing has been decided, not even the arrangements for 1982: they may be resolved at the ministerial Council meeting next week. For 1983 and later, the arrangements are supposed to be resolved by the end of November. I hope they are. The problems of budgetary imbalance between Mem ber States will be much more acute next year than they have been in 1981 and 1982. In those years, the decline in real prices for agricultural products within the Community, taken with the rise in world prices, helped contain the Community's agricultural expendi ture. This relieved the burden on those Member States which are net contributors to the Community budget. I am sorry to say that this situation is now reversing itself. Domestic prices in the Community will rise sharply with the new harvest, and at the same time world prices are falling sharply. In 1983, we are likely to see increasing food surpluses once again and an increase \u2014 a sharp increase \u2014 in restitution payments. Budgetary imbalance between Member States will become much more serious, and the problem will be exarcerbated the following year by enlargement. On the wider view of the mandate which has been espoused by the Commission and strongly supported by this Parliament \u2014 that is, the view that it is an opportunity for the relaunching of the Community \u2014 the exercise is most certainly not over. Indeed, in an important sense, it is only beginning. Up to now we have had a dialogue between the Commission and the Council, with an occasional doleful commentary by us in the Parliament \u2014 like a Greek chorus, if my Greek friends will forgive the metaphor \u2014 but problems of real and lasting importance have been discussed and interesting proposals for reform have been put for ward. We now reach the second phase of the mandate, the phase of implementation. It is a legislative phase; it is the phase when Parliament comes into its own. It will be up to us to examine the draft directives as they come before us, and I hope we shall see them not as isolated draft laws but as part of a cohesive whole. We should keep the idea of the mandate permanently before us. Without it, our activity will become Balkan- ized. We shall lose our sense of purpose and of mis sion. Mr President, I accept the view that the mandate is an opportunity to relaunch the Community. If we do not seize this opportunity, it will be a very long time before another one presents itself. (Applause) President. \u2014 I call Mr Beumer. Mr Beumer. \u2014 (NL) Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on Youth, Culture, Education, Informa tion and Sport I should like to say, how happy we are that the European Foundation has at last been estab lished, albeit with some delay, and I believe that we owe this partly to the personal efforts of the President of the Council. A few doubts and questions neverthe less come to mind. The first Tindemans report refers to the need to bring Europe closer to the people. If we compare this with the agreement and final act of 25 March, we do not find any reference to the Parlia ment of the people. The Commission's report of 17 November 1977 called for a working party which would consist of a cross-section of the population, scientists, trade unionists, educators and would pro duce an opinion. Little has been done about this either. The conclusions contained in the report say that the tasks of the foundation must be performed in such a way that the people understand the situation better and are also more closely involved. In 1978 Parliament expressed its satisfaction at the idea of setting up a European Foundation and hoped this would be done on the basis of Article 235 so that it might be actively involved. Reference was made, for example, to the situation in the United States, where ",
        "No 1-286/74 Debates of the European Parliament 15.6.82 Beumer there is close cooperation between the Congress and independent foundations. But what do we now see? I find that this Parliament of the people has not been formally involved in the establishment of this founda tion for the people. That is the reason why we have asked question after question on this subject. What a contrast with the 1978 Copenhagen declaration on democracy! But an inter-governmental basis is then chosen. Does this not conflict with the importance that was attached to the direct election of the European Parliament? And then we must ask ourselves whether the situation in Copenhagen in 1978 was not more favourable than it is now. I also find that Annex (e) to the Council's document says: There is no mention of this in the present act, even though the Commission's working document of 8 May 1979 also said that appointments should be made after the European Parliament had been consulted. My question is therefore: how is Parliament to be involved in these appointments? The original Article 21 states that the annual report will be forwarded to the Com mission and the Member States. And what doe's it say now? It says that it will be forwarded to the Commis sion for its information, and that is quite a difference. And I should also like to ask: will Parliament also be receiving this annual report like any other passive reci pient? Why is this unfavourable distinction made? A preparatory committee has also been set up. It will be listing all the institutions active in the same areas as the foundation and also examining the activities and aims of these institutions. My question is whether Par liament will also be involved in the definition of tasks. The European Parliament is also concerned with this area, and I am reminded of two recent reports, the Hahn report on the cultural heritage and the Viehoff report on illiteracy. I think I can say that our attitude as a budgetary partner will ultimately depend to a very great extent on the answer we receive to this question. And I have also heard, not officially but through Agence Europe, that the details of Article 16 have been discussed. My question is: when will matters concern ing the financing be submitted to Parliament for its opinion? And if provision is made for the settlement of disputes among the Member States, can the same provision not be made for disputes between, say, the Community and the foundation? I will conclude, Mr President, by saying that we support the contents and the intention, but our final opinion will, of course, depend on the answers we receive to these questions, and the principal criterion will be: what role can Par liament play in this? President. \u2014 I call Mr M\u00f8ller. Mr M\u00f8ller. \u2014 (DK) Mr President, it is no secret that there has been a fair amount of confusion in several of. the Member States during the past month with regard to the interpretation of the facility for majority voting in the Council. It is also generally known that many believed that the Luxembourg settlement was a bind ing agreement supplementing the Treaty of Rome, such that Council decisions now not only required majority decisions \u2014 qualified majority \u2014 but also unanimity. I do not share that view, but I can say that, up to the level of the Danish Foreign Minister, who takes over on 1 July as President of the Council, the view is held that the Luxembourg settlement was a binding agreement. Since it was the Council which reached the decision, I must assume that it shares my view that the Luxem bourg settlement does not form part of the Treaty leg islation which is binding on our Community, and I should therefore like to put the following questions to the Commission, because it has a duty to ensure that the Council adheres to the legal basis of our Com munity: with the adoption of the farm price arrange ments for 1982, did the Council adhere to the rules which are applicable to our Community, in other words was it possible by a majority vote to set aside the Luxembourg settlement? Is the view correct which has been put forward in Danish legal circles, for exam ple, by my humble self, that the Luxembourg settle ment was a political declaration of intent which says that the parties shall strive for unanimity but does not impose unanimity, so that decisions can be taken by a majority where necessary? It is essential, in my opinion, for us to achieve com plete clarification of this problem, if we are not to be bogged down in this legal debate as to the extent to which we have infringed the Treaty by the action taken in the fixing of farm prices for 1982. For this reason I felt prompted to put that question to the Commission, as the guardian of the Treaty. I hope we shall be able to get an answer from the Commission today on the lines of my own view of the matter, namely that the Council has acted within the Com munity's binding legislation. President. \u2014 I call the Council. Mr Tindemans, President-in-Office of the Council. \u2014 (NL) Mr President, with your approval I will first answer Mr Beumer's questions and then the questions put by other speakers. Mr President, the Council would remind the House that the European Council decided at its meeting in Copenhagen on 7 and 8 April 1978 to establish the European Foundation under agreements concluded by the governments of the Member States. Consequently, the Council never received a proposal from the Com mission for a regulation based on Article 235 as called for in the European Parliament's resolution and referred to by the honourable Member. There has therefore never been any question of consulting Par- ",
        "15.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/75 Tindemans liament. However, the Council has published reports on current activities on several occassions in the past. Thus the President of the Council referred to these activities in the annex to the speech he made during the plenary sitting on 21 January 1982. As a result of the signing of the convention setting up the foundation, the Council empowered the Commis sion to negotiate by means of an exchange of letters between the European Economic Community and the foundation as soon as the latter was actually estab lished. The negotiating mandate given to the Commis sion requires the Community to appoint ten members of the foundation's board for a period of four years and to make a financial contribution of 4 million u.a. to the foundation for a period of three years. This contribution will be divided up into 1 million in the first year and 1 \u00b7 5 million in the second and third years. As soon as these negotiations are concluded, the Council will be requested to take a decision on the basis of Article 235 to wind up the exchange of letters. This procedure includes the consultation of the Euro pean Parliament. It is for the Commission to propose to the Council in due course the procedure for the nomination of the members of the foundation board to be appointed by the Community. The agreement on the establishment of the foundation guarantees it complete indepen dence in its activities. It is for the foundation board, its executive body, to ensure there is close cooperation with the European Parliament. The Council could well imagine this cooperation taking the form, for example, of annual colloquies. The foundation is completely independent in its activities, but it must ensure that they do not duplicate what is being done under the Community's programmes. The presence on the foundation's board of persons appointed by the Community will ensure satisfatory and constant coordination of the foundation's and Community's activities. It also goes without saying that the foundation will be subject not only to the financial control of the Court of Auditors but also to the supervision of the Commission pursuant to the appropriate provisons of the Financial Regulation. Futhermore, the foundation must cooperate with other institutions and organizations, including the Council of Europe, whose activities run parallel to or have the same aims as its own activities: President. \u2014 We shall accede to your proposal. I call the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. Mr J. Moreau, Chairman of the Committee. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to use the few minutes at my disposal to draw the atten tion of the Assembly to the importance and implica tions of Mr Hopper's report. This report has suffered a great many vicissitudes; despite last-minute difficulties we are now able to dis cuss its content. I wish to pay tribute, and this is no mere formality on my part, to the'stubborn endeavours and hard work of the rapporteur. The text, which was almost unanimously adopted by our Committee, reaf firms the positions subscribed to by Parliament. This was of course a difficult exercise because the substance of Parliament's position like that of the Commission had already been defined following the report by Mr Giavazzi and the Commission's own text. The exercise of the mandate of 30 May gave the Community and the Commission an opportunity to make proposals relating to various areas of activity of the European Community. I shall not dwell on the budgetary, financial and agri cultural aspects of the mandate because other Mem bers will probably do so. For my part, I wish to draw your attention to the problems which we in the Com mittee on Economic and Monetary Affairs consider essential. The Community cannot be content to act as a kind of hospital for sectors in difficulty. In our view the Com munity is only of interest to the extent that it now ena bles the European countries to take up the great chal lenges of our age i.e. the challenges of technology, competitivity, north-south relations and so on. That is the background against which the Commission's act ion must be judged. Europe will be of no interest to our citizens unless it meets these expectations in an effective and practical manner. Now we note \u2014 as we already pointed out this morning \u2014 that time is short. We are sometimes surprised by the Commission's pro posals just as we are surprised by the Council's deci sions. We must take bold action today in the area of research; in particular, everything possible must be done to facilitate the development of European com panies in sectors such as micro-electronics and tele matics. Mr President, in agreeing to discuss this report, our Assembly wishes to give a warning to the Commission and Council because we were surprised by the way in which we have been obliged to deal with these matters and by the fragmentation of the issues placed before us. I believe that in adopting the Hopper report our Assembly will be giving the Commission and, to some extent, the Council, authority to take a number of decisions enabling us to escape from the present state of mediocrity. (Applause) President. \u2014 I call the Group of the European Peo ple's Party (Christian Democratic Group). Mr Giavazzi. \u2014 (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentle men, first of all I would like to join in complimenting ",
        "No 1-286/76 Debates of the European Parliament 15.6.82 Giavazzi Mr Hopper for the complex and delicate work he per formed under difficult conditions. In speaking on behalf of the Group of the European Peoples' Party I will say immediately that the group will approve the resolution, and this even though the activity connected with the carrying out of the Man date of 30 May is being pursued in a far from satisfac tory manner. It is obvious that the content of the reso lution has also had an influence on this, but it is also obvious that the approval of the resolution cannot remove a deep sense of dissatisfaction with the way things are going in general. Parliament was immediately aware of the exceptional opportunity represented by the dispatch of the Man date, and it is a significant and politically noteworthy fact that with the two resolutions approved just a year ago at the June part-session Parliament provided the guidelines to make this opportunity what it had to be : that is, a revival of Community policies. We all know what happened. It is our duty to acknow ledge that the Commission made praiseworthy, and in some ways timely efforts of preparation, but then everything ran aground in the face of the exasperating negotiations, which allowed no provision directed at truly solving the Community's fundamental problems to be made. It is for this reason that the Group can feel only strong dissatisfaction at the inertia now existing in regard to the solution of essential problems, and especially in regard to the formulation of a coordinated, overall general policy of Community res tructuring and revitalization. This must be affirmed without diminishing the import ance of certain results obtained. We willingly acknow ledge the merit of these results to those who strove laboriously and intelligently to accomplish them. The resolution we are discussing today mentions prob lems and needs in detail; it outlines approaches for agricultural policy, for the budget \u2014 on which Mr Pfennig will speak at greater length \u2014 for social, pol itical, and industrial policy. It deals also with monetary policy, which has just recently received a further and distressing shock, another demonstration that the dif ficulties arising from the failure to carry through with the policy fully and courageously are steadily increas ing. What Commissioner Ortoli told us this morning is significant in this regard. Meanwhile, however, things go on as they did at the time when the Mandate was granted; not as well, indeed if only because of the effects of world events. It is for this reason that we wish to underline \u2014 for we cannot do more in the time allotted to us \u2014 three points in the resolution, points which concern the Member States, the Commission, and the Council. Point 37 \u2014 in reference to the States: we solemnly appeal to them to return to the Community model and rise above particularistic interests. Point 48 \u2014 in reference to the Commission: we ask the Commission, in the dissatisfaction resulting from the present state of the proposals, to respond to Parlia ment's request that it make use of the power of deci sion laid down for it in the Treaty to confront the Council with its political and legal responsibilities. Only if this request is acted upon \u2014 and we wish to believe it will be \u2014 will our Group be able to distin guish, in its political judgment on the inadequacy of the measures taken, the work of the Commission from that of the Council. Point 52 \u2014 in reference to the Council: it should ac knowledge the fact that the lack of decisions cannot be justified by pleading the difficulty of reaching a con sensus after the Council itself, in conferring the man date, recognized the urgent need of such a consensus. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in conclusion I cannot fail to stress two requests and a judgment. The first request is that the formulation of suggestions be immediately followed by the elaboration of operative proposals: only in this way can we measure the will that exists to bring the Community out of its present disturbing state of inertia. If this will really exists, nothing prevents it from being demonstrated in the immediate launching of those provisions which an attainable consensus already makes possible. The second request is that the role of Parliament \u2014 whose vision was correct and timely, as is borne out by the facts \u2014 be respected in this area as well. Parliament should be allowed to participate with opinions pre sented before, and not after, the necessary decisions are made, especially if these decisions \u2014 as is now being said \u2014 concern budget problems, like those hav ing to do with the VAT, where Parliament functions as budgetary authority. As for the judgment, I will say that we feel anxiety and dissatifaction at the ever more disturbing situation of the Community, especially in the area of social econ omics and in the area of cohesion, and at the lack of Community action in these fields. It is for this reason that in reiterating the urgent need to correct this state of things we reserve all future decisions, subordinating them to the positive or negative result of our new ini tiative. It is on this basis that we will make a political evalution of the situation and the behaviour of the Community bodies. President. \u2014 I call the Socialist Group. Mr Ruffolo. \u2014 (IT) Mr President, I wish to say at once that the motion for a resolution presented by Mr Hopper can be considered as an example of pessimism from the standpoint of reason, and of optimism from the standpoint of will. We Socialists particularly appreciate the objectivity and the commitment shown by the rapporteur in ",
        "15.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/77 Ruffolo attempting to fix a point of reference amid the great confusion of the present Community picture. He took advantage of a futile occasion \u2014 the attempt to cover up a dispute on the distribution of budget expenditures with a Community 'fig leaf' \u2014 to initiate a serious dis course. On this basis he made the correct decision to link the three themes of the Mandate \u2014 the reform of the agricultural policy, budget reform, and the intro duction of new common policies \u2014 and to deal with them from a broader viewpoint: the so-called problem of convergence, or, more properly, the problem of the economic coherence of this Community, which is now going through an identity crisis. The problem has two aspects: the coordination of the economic policies and the reduction of economic disparities between the par ticipating countries. It is a shame that the motion for a resolution, having begun with this correct premise; does not go on to develop it fully. All three themes of the Mandate, in fact, are reasonable and credible only by virtue of the way in which the problem of convergence is approached. Few words should be necessary to emphasize this concept in the face of the new turbul ence which is affecting the EMS. I must say that I envy the optimistic complacency dis played this morning by Mr Ortoli. It is a fact that this is the sixth time that we have fastened our seat belts, so to speak, and each time we are told that the System has withstood the impact. When the EMS was estab lished, we expressed the opinion that, in the absence of a basic understanding on political economy and cen tralized monetary instruments, this system of adjusta ble fixed exchange rates would be too 'adjustable', and therefore not very fixed. Today the frequency of the adjustments leads us to think that the system is becom ing an apparatus which records and follows the diver gencies instead of reducing or preventing them. The instability of the system reflects the economic incoherence of the Community, its structures, and its policies, but the incoherence of the policies is not the result \u2014 as many seem to believe \u2014 of the irresponsi bility of some and the wisdom of others; it is due rather to the diversity of economic and social struc tures and therefore to the degree to which the crisis can be socially and politically tolerated in each coun try. This is the knot of incoherence, the knot which it is necessary to cut. In its turn, the instability which derives from this incoherence, in the form of imbal ances in external payments and monetary disturbances, aggravates the crisis, because it involves restrictive pol icies which are constantly making economic recovery for all countries a more and more distant prospect. The only way to break out of this vicious circle is to make the crisis more tolerable for everyone by means of concerted policies aimed in two directions: that of a vast, organic action directed at dealing radically with the running sore of unemployment, and that of a coor dination of the policies on demand, particularly the monetary policies, which would define both the objec tives and the needs of development for each of the participating countries. Only on the basis of a funda mental agreement on these two questions will it be possible to build a foundation for the revitalization of the Community, the basic theme of this discussion of the Mandate. Frankly, it does not appear to me that, either on the level of the Council or on that of the Commission, this degree of political awareness has been reached. Here I will make a concluding observation on the role to be assumed by this Parliament in such a critical phase of Community existence. The Hopper report expresses pessimism concerning both the political will of the governments and the role of the Commission. Today we heard the melancholy adieu of Mr Tinde mans and his grave and sorrowful words on the ser iousness of the crisis now being experienced in Europe \u2014 this 'technocratic-diplomatic' Europe, as he defined it. We must recognize once again that the presidents of the Council, for some mysterious reason, come closer to striking the right note when they leave their mandate than when they exercise it. We, as a Parliament, should not follow this pattern. We have little time left to express our judgment on the behaviour of the other Community institutions and especially on the reform of the Community: the reform of its institutional powers and of its policies, two elements which are inextricably combined; a necessary and urgent reform if we want to overcome this paralysis of both reason and will. This, Mr President, is the true meaning of the man date \u2014 not the one the Commission received from the Council, but the one Parliament received from its elec tors. (Applause) President. \u2014 I call the European Democratic Group. Mr Purvis. \u2014 Mr President, I am glad to see that Mr Ortoli is still here with us. May I just briefly refer first to the currency realignments within the EMS, since the EMS is also a vital element in the mandate and the whole future of the Community. From this group's point of view, we would again reiterate our concern lest the flexibility of the EMS becomes its predominant characteristic rather than stability. But nevertheless we are greatly encouraged that the realignment has beeen effected smoothly and most important, that there is a commitment, we understand, by the governments of the countries concerned to take economic measures in support of their respective adjustments. This shows welcome signs of an effort towards con vergent economic policies, both by the weaker and the ",
        "No 1-286/78 Debates of the European Parliament 15.6.82 Purvis stronger currencies. If this is in fact a new Versailles spirit then certainly it was all woth-while. This group hopes that this trend towards convergence of econo mic policies will be pursued and be built upon; not just following realignments but also in order to avoid the very necessity for such adjustments. No doubt other colleagues will be quick to criticize the economic policies which cause this state of affairs, but I will be content to applaud the recognition that we all are now so intertwined economically that con vergence of economic policy is not just a bureaucratic abstract to support the EMS, but a very necessary prerequisite for the European economy and the econ omies of all our countries if they are to meet the chal lenges facing them. Although we welcome Mr Hopper's report in its over all impact and in very much of its detail, it is not everything this group would like to see. Indeed, there are certain points which would be best altered, and amendments from members of this group seek to do so. These relate to the following specific matters. Firstly, the reform \u2014 or improvement if you prefer \u2014 of the common agricultural policy. This is indeed an essential element in, or a condition for, the develop ment of other policies which we so earnestly desire, including an increase in own resources. We do not question the fundamental objectives or the principles of the CAP, but none of us would deny that with the improvements already made and the improvements that can still be made in its execution and its manage ment, substantial extra funds could be obtained from within the present ceiling. When these new guidelines and management techniques are in place and we have the range of new policies justified and ready to pro ceed, there is no doubt that we as part of the budget ary authority could justify our competence to be entrusted with additional own resources. At the very least these advances must proceed in parallel, but we must indeed be satisfied that progress on CAP reform is far enough advanced and strongly enough assured to justify any relaxation in the own resources ceiling. Futhermore, we must be sure that when such CAP reforms are agreed, they are in fact translated into act ion and not just posponed from one farm price fixing to the next. Secondly, we accept that there are special problems for mountain, hill and Mediterranean small farmers. This and related costs will be accentuated by further enlargement to include Spain and Portugal as it has done already with Greece. We cannot just hope that this problem will go away, because it will not. It will only become more acute. The Commission should be much more precise on the implications and on what it thinks should be done because it is vital that we do not just repeat the early errors of the CAP in dealing with this particular problem. Thirdly, paragraphs 19, 21 and 23 we find objection able if they insinuate that the budgetary contribution problem applies to only one Member State. This is not so now, and it will not be in the future unless we achieve a general financial mechanism which will deal with the problems of any Member State which finds itself in such a position. We had very much in mind the likely situation for Portugal, but it could happen to any Member State as we introduce new Community policies. It cannot be a criterion of such new policies that their financial implications are exactly equal for every Member State. We do not espouse juste retour either. If there is no general mechanism to make some measure of financial adjustment, the budgetary impli cations will be uppermost in every national Treasury Minister's mind. We will get nowhere. Stagnation will persist and the Community will die. It is essentially a way \u2014 the only way \u2014 of unlocking the door to fur ther Community developments. Certainly, no one wants to be continually returning to these financial hagglings. We need only a system that is fair and that is seen to be fair to all the Member States and all Community citizens. We have had temporary expedients; some have worked well, perhaps even too well, but only temporarily, others have certainly not worked at all. But now we need a permanent solution; Parliament has proposed such systems in the past, but we must be free to get on with building the European Community, not just moving the bricks around the building site. Lastly, we also have amendments down on some of the new policies, especially transport and energy, for which I recommend support from the House. These could certainly be given more bite by the Commission. But to conclude, the mandate will have been a useful exercise, perhaps a turning point for the Community, if it gives us all new heart to take the Community for ward, if it results in a new and positive spirit and if it gives a new sense of direction and purpose to all our institutions. President. \u2014 I would inform the House that I have received two motions for resolutions with request for an early vote, pursuant to Rule 42(5) of the Rules of Procedure: \u2014 from Mr Beumer, on behalf of the Committee on Youth, Culture, Education, Information and Sport, to wind up the debate on the oral question on the European Foundation \u2014 from Mr de la Mal\u00e8ne, on behalf of the Group of European Progressive Democrats, to wind up the debate on the oral question by Mr M\u00f8ller and others on the basis for deci sions in the Council. The vote on these requests for an early vote will take place at the end of the debate. ",

Mrs Boserup. \u2014 (DA) I speak, as usual, not on behalf of the Communist and Allies Group, but on my own account. I have chosen \u2014 and that may appear some what abrupt after all the economic verbiage \u2014 to speak on Mr Beumer's inquiry. Mr Beumer's text is very clear: he puts a question which cannot be difficult for the Commission or the Council to answer. Now I am neither the Council nor the Commission, and my party and our voters have only one way open to us, and that is to exert an influence on the Danish mem ber of the Council, but we need a lot of time for it, I can tell you. Mr Beumer asks why a regulation based on Article 235 of the Treaty was not used. Well, that's very easy to answer: Article 235 requires unanimity in the Council, and that is impossible to achieve. The Danish government can never agree to the use of Article 235 for this purpose. It is a political reality which Mr Beumer and others must understand and learn to live with. We have said it often enough, but it still has to be driven in. Why is Mr Beumer so dissatisfied though? The Euro pean Foundation has been brought to fruition on a very clear basis. The governments of the ten countries are inviting prominent and independent figures to work for mutual understanding between the peoples of our countries, that's marvellous! We shall all grow wiser by learning something from one another, but no good can come from dictating to people, and certainly not young people, what consequences they should draw from this learning. When all the activity being launched is to promote a greater understanding of European integration and to support efforts for the establishment of a union, it is unworthy and far removed from genuine cultural development, and it is a misuse of culture for political ends. Back home in Denmark, when this agreement is to be approved, our party will tell our Foreign Minister that he will have no popular support when he has put his name at the end of a piece of paper which, in spite of high-sounding phrases about culture and social and human understanding, is an agreement on a propa ganda machine for a union which the majority of Danes are against. This debate is exciting, but it is tak ing place far from here. Fortunately we shall have something to say there. President. \u2014 I call the Liberal and Democratic Group. Mr Delorozoy. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, ladies and gen tlemen, this morning Mr Bangemann paid tribute to the efforts of the Belgian Presidency. However, most of us share the disappointment felt by a large number of European citizens and, with Mr Hopper, I want to dwell on the shortcomings of the report drawn up by the Commission in response to the mandate of 30 May 1980 as well as the inadequacies in the guideline docu ments which accompany it. In the two years which have elapsed since May 1980 we have had time to measure the scale of the difficulty in arriving at even a minimum of convergence between the policies of the Member States and to see the wide gap which separates speeches from reality. Time is too short to remind you of all the divergences, disparities, controversies, hostilities and even confrontations which have occurred in the period that now lies behind us and with which you are all familiar. The Commission has been almost totally unable to formulate specific proposals capable of creating the new dynamic which the Community so badly needs and the Council has therefore not been in a position to take precise decisions; it is therefore not surprising that, apart from the agreements reached on agricul tural prices and the provisional agreement on the Bri tish contribution to the budget, no significant progress extending beyond the short term has been made on most of the other issues. On issues such as the strengthening of the European domestic market, the development of industrial prod uction through the definition of Community strategies for sectors hit by the crisis and for other sectors with a real future, the improvement of the common agricul tural policy which was one aspect of the mandate with particular reference to more effective budgetary man agement since we believe that the Commission is now putting forward new proposals for a different budget ary scale to restore the balance of the Community budget, and also on other issues such as new technol ogical research and innovation, raw material supplies and energy resources, economic revival to counter the spread of unemployment \u2014 on all these issues the Community countries are demonstrating to the whole world their inability to adopt a common strategy or, at the very least, convergent policies capable of facing up to the crisis and bringing about the necessary restruc turing. This grave lack of unity and of a common approach is now bringing in its train the risk of an even more last ing recession throughout the European economy. It is deeply disappointing to note that at a time like this both the Commission and the Council have been una ble to, as it were, change gear to respond to events. The Commission is drawing up reports to stress the need for economic revival and for a greater investment effort which may be followed by more specific propos als for the European Council meeting at the end of the year. That meeting will conclude with a soothing com munique or a solemn declaration on the need to adopt a new policy leading towards a genuine European union; then, sterile discussions will continue for month after month while the economic and social situation deteriorates further in the absence of any real desire by certain Member States to resolutely implement the ",
        "No 1-286/80 Debates of the European Parliament 15.6.82 Delorozoy necessary policies within the Community and in rela tion to the outside world. In this context it is inadmissible for one Member State, instead of leaving the European Monetary System, to make use of it to correct the consequences of its own laxist economic, social and budgetary policies by effecting parity readjustments twice in a single year. Solidarity then appears to take the form of a rescue operation rather than that of monetary convergence. Under these circumstances, Commissioner Ortoli, how can we consolidate the credibility of the ECU? The answer is obvious in the parity level reached by the dollar yesterday. How, under these conditions, can we move on to the new institutional phase of the EMS allowing the creation of the European Monetary Fund and the floating of loans in ECU capable of contribut ing to a lasting revitalization of investment which is the only possible solution today? It has become imperative and urgently necessary for the institutions of the European Community to estab lish a genuine European union in which they would have the resources and the resolve to pursue a Euro pean strategy through combined action at national and Community level. We must restore the necessary capa city for further progress towards the construction of a strong and united Europe capable of meeting all the challenges and assuming its rightful role in the world of tomorrow: that is what the citizens of Europe are hoping for. (Applause) President. \u2014 I call the Group for the Technical Coor dination and Defence of Independent Groups and Members. Mr B\u00f8gh. \u2014 (DA) When one looks at the agenda for this afternoon, one is inclined to wonder a little at the system by which these problems have been strung together \u2014 the Mandate of 30 May and the European Foundation. I see the explanation in the third docu ment in the bag, the question by M\u00f8ller and others on the decision-making basis for the measures adopted by the Council. I treat this as a debate, a general debate, on the course of action taken in the decision-making process for a number of questions settled in recent months. I refer to the pre-empting of the 30 May Mandate require ment of a more forceful and more effective decision making process, which took place when the right of veto was set aside in the farm price settlement. I refer to the Community sanctions first against the Soviet Union, then against Argentina, which were put through despite Danish misgivings. I refer to the triumphant assertion of high-ranking Commission officials that a precedent has now been created for for eign policy action under Community auspices, so that the detour via the institutions of European political cooperation can now be avoided. And I refer to the parallel action on cultural policy under Community auspices, which has been brought about by letting the European Foundation get its money from the Com munity and by involing Article 235 to determine that it shall be a Community institution instead of an inter- Member State cooperation venture. Mr President, I am well aware that these things are laughable formalities to the big powers in the Euro pean Community. But they are formalities which are there to secure the independence of the small coun tries amid the union mania which prevails at this time and in this Chamber. At the time when there was a majority in Denmark in favour of joining the Com munity, i.e. at the time of the referendum in 1972, the politicians, including Mr M\u00f8ller's party, handed out precious guarantees in abundance. All this has gone. Now we have reached the stage where the legal basis for the participation of the Danish State is no longer present. It may in a way be a relief that we can talk openly of these things and that the Community is now showing its true face, that of one aspiring to big power and superpower status. We should only bear in mind that it is this sort of development which stiffens oppo sition among the Danish people. President. \u2014 I call the Non-attached Members. Mr Pesmazoglou. \u2014 Mr President, I do not believe that the general orientation of the Community's policy can lead to a successful fight against unemployment and inflation. A new strategy is needed by the Com munity, basically directed towards the activation and the development mainly of the developing regions and particularly the Mediterranean South. The President of the Commission, Mr Thorn, propose*? certain solu tions along these lines to the European Council and these solutions were also supported by the Belgian Prime Minister. I am sorry that the requiste decisions were not taken. It is necessary for an initiative of this kind to be taken up at the Community level. At the same time it is impossible for the budget to remain 'at the level of 1%' as Mr Tindemans very correctly pointed out. The need to face the problem of Great Britain's contribution, and indeed the more general problem of the Community's resources as a whole, begins with the proposals submitted last year by Par liament following the most noteworthy report pre sented by Mr Spinelly on behalf of the Committee on Budgets. My final comment is that control can be exercised over both the interest rates and the exchange rates. The recent reports by the 'Committee of 30' and by the Management Committee of the International Monetary Fund have proved this. However, we need to make progress towards the unification of our cur rency system, in other words towards the establish ment of a true European Monetary Union within ",

IN THE CHAIR: MR GONELLA Vice-President Finally, we agree with the reference in the resolution to the formation of a Mediterranean programme designed to benefit the Mediterranean countries that already belong to, or that are to join the Community. However, Mr President, there are also points in the resolution concerning which the Greek Socialists have reservations. President. \u2014 I call Mr Papantoniou. Mr Papantoniou. \u2014 (GR) Mr President, Mr Hop per's proposed resolution envisages applying pressure on the Commission and the Council to achieve a final integration of the Mandate of 30 May. As we know, the temporary agreement concerning Great Britain's contribution for this year to the Com munity's budget leaves open the long-term problem of the budget, while existing proposals for the reorgani zation of the CAP and the development of new Com munity policies remain outstanding. The Hopper report contains many points with which the Greek Socialists are in agreement. Such points include the reference to promoting the convergence of the economies of the Member States and to the need to reduce economic inequalities, as central principles that must govern the implementation of the mandate. There is also condemnation for the Commission's fail ure to take into account the consequences of enlarging the Community, particularly in relation to problems connected with the applications of the new and future members from Southern Europe. Here, I should point out that the problems connected with Greece's adapta tion have been set out in the memorandum submitted by the Greek Government concerning which the Com mission has only recently adopted a position. How ever, some of the problems mentioned in the Greek memorandum can be met in a more general and a more simple way written within the framework of the mandate of May 30th. We also subscribe to the distaste expressed by the resolution for the vagueness of many of the Commis sion's proposals relating to the reorganization of the CAP and the development of new Community poli cies, particularly as regards the means of financing these new policies. We also agree with the emphasis placed on the need to reduce inequalities in agriculture within the Com munity, with effective protection for smallholders, support for the social and organizational policy in disadvantaged areas, particularly in mountainous and hilly regions and in areas of the Mediterranean, and the elimination of the negative attitude that exists Specifically, we believe that paragraph 4, which deals with the procedure for taking decisions, serves no pur pose since the main cause of the difficulties that are hindering the implementation of the mandate is the inadequacy of the Commission's proposals and the lack of any firm political will within the Council. The paragraph dealing with the general mechanism for financing is far too general and timid, and while it acknowledges that the new mechanism should pro mote the convergence of the economies, it does not refer to the essential need to introduce the principle of progressiveness in the collection of the Community's resources, which would link the size of the budget contributions to the per-capita income and the econo mic strength of each country. Finally, the Greek Socialists believe that further pro gress in the direction of economic and monetary union is meaningless while the economic structures and per formances of the Member States continue to show such large differences. Mr President, the reservations I have expressed are important, but they do not negate our general appre ciation of the fact that the proposed resolution con forms to our basic aims. For this reason, unless it becomes distorted during the voting stage we shall vote in favour of it. President. \u2014 I call the Committee on Budgets. Mr Pfennig, draftsman of an opinion. \u2014 (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a few weeks ago the Community had reached an extremely dangerous stage. It had to take five decisions simultaneously in important areas: a foreign policy decision on the Falk lands crisis, a monetary decision on an adjustment of parities within the EMS, a budgetary decision on fur ther compensation in favour of the United Kingdom, an economic decision on the new farm prices and an institutional decision on a method of overcoming the block on decision-making caused by one Member State threatening to abuse the veto. In all five areas the Community managed to take acceptable decisions, thanks to the leadership of the ",
        "No 1-286/82 Debates of the European Parliament 15.6.82 Pfennig Belgian Presidency. Everyone here has welcomed this. We must nevertheless bear in mind that all the Com munity has done with these monetary, budgetary and economic decisions is give itself some breathing space. The basic problems referred to in the mandate of 30 May 1980 remain no nearer solution today than they were two years ago. A major effort must there fore be made in 1982. This is particularly true of the Commission. It must at last come forward with proposals for solutions to the problems raised by the imbalances in the Community. We have stated often enough what we except of the Commission where the budget is concerned. We expect, firstly, practical proposals for Council direc tives, decisions and regulations, accompanied by state ments on the financial resources that will be required. This goes for the social and regional policies, includ ing the Mediterranean policy, harmonization of the market, support for high-technology industries, the energy and transport policies and development aid. We also expect, secondly, the budget to be reorgan ized under a financial agreement among the Member States which shares tasks and expenditure between the Member States and the Community on the principles of subsidiarity and effectiveness, ensures that the Community has the necessary financial resources and introduces a general system for the financial compen sation of the Member States, as the European Parlia ment has proposed in its resolution on the future of the Community budget. On the Commission's activities so far I should like to say the following: it was obviously glad that the Coun cil was compelled to take rapid decisions in the five areas I have mentioned, since this distracted attention from its own indecision in the question of the man date. All that the Commission has so far put forward has consisted of communications and vague statements of principle with various guidelines and priorities. As regards the financial mechanism, in fact, the Commis sion has done no more than submit a progress report on its application in the past, although everyone must realize that the problem has to be solved by the time Spain and Portugal accede. This makes me suspect that the Commission was hop ing that, as happened when the Community was enlarged in the 1970s, one or more Member States would make their agreement to enlargement to include Spain and Portugal conditional on the adop tion of a new financial constitution and that all the decisions could then be quickly taken by the Council and the Member States. If that is so, the Commission is playing a dangerous game that could go wrong as early as the time of the 1983 budget. I feel that the Commission's activities hitherto as regards finance and the budget reveal that it has been incompetent, when it is remembered that the Commission is supposed to be the Community's prime mover. It proves once again that we should not expect too much, as was the case after the Commission's first report on the mandate of 30 May. It remains to be seen whether the Commission can show us that it is capable of better things. President. \u2014 I call Mr Prag. Mr Prag. \u2014 Yesterday in the Falklands a battle was won for the rule of law in international relations. A battle against aggression. It was also a battle, however, for freedom and democracy. Even a land of 1 800 peo ple has the right to live under the regime that it pre fers. You may think that a curious introduction to my sub ject which is the problem of decision-making in the Community. Not so. The effectiveness of this Com munity is crucial to our future. This Community is not only crucial to peace, it is a bulwark of freedom and democracy in our own lands and in the world as a whole. That is why we must make it work effectively. It is also why in my group we wish the Council of Ministers success in improving its decision-making procedures. We hope that the ad hoc committee on the Genscher-Colombo proposals for European union will produce proposals that the Ministers will be able to accept unanimously when they meet on 30 June. We congratulate Mr Tindernans on the urgency and skill with which he has pushed forward with work on the Genscher-Colombo proposals and the truly European spirit which has motivated the Belgian Presidency under his able guidance. In my group we believe that far too many minor and technical matters which are not of vital interest to any Member State go on being discussed ad infinitum without a vote being taken. As our deputy Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, said in the Commons debate last month, and I quote: 'It is absurd that Min isters of Foreign Affairs 'and governments should argue for hour after hour on immensely complicated matters of detail. For some time it has been in the national (and he meant British) as well as in the Euro pean interest that decision-taking should be improved.' Earlier in this Parliament Britain's then Foreign Secre tary, Lord Carrington, welcomed that Genscher-Co lombo proposals. I hope the Parliament will forgive me, Mr President, if I now become more controversial. As a Briton, and as a convinced and active European, I feel it is a pity at a time when the whole question of decision-making in the Community, and in the Council of Ministers in particular, is under examination in the Council itself, that views in my own country should have been clouded by the vote on the farm-price review. The Community cannot function effectively except in a cli mate of trust between its Member States and this cli mate of trust cannot exist unless all the Member States ",
        "15.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/83 Prag can have confidence in agreed procedures. We must know where we stand; we must know what can be done and what cannot be done. There are many cases of divergence of interest of course, but one which inevitably occupies our minds is Britain's budgetary contribution. All I want to say about that is that it is unthinkable in any grouping, whether a federation or a confedera tion, a grouping sui generis like our own Community or any other, that transfers of wealth should be made from the less wealthy to the more wealthy. There is no state or grouping of any kind in the world where such a process would be defended. The operation of the Community must be such as to remove such diver gences and such sources of perennial conflict. Now I turn again to the Luxembourg Communiqu\u00e9 of January 1966. It was no compromise \u2014 merely a state ment of two diametrically opposed views. On matters considered by a Member State to be of great import ance to it, France wanted no decision until and unless unanimity could be reached. The other five wanted a vote after discussion had continued for a reasonable time. Today the immediate problem is not whether we are in favour of some supposed and indeed mythical compromise in Luxembourg. If we could actually get back to the French thesis in the Luxembourg Commu niqu\u00e9, the veto would only be used in matters consid ered by a Member State to be of great importance to it. And less important matters could be voted on in accordance with the Treaty rules. That in itself would be an enormous step forward and one which would be even more necessary when we have twelve Member States, instead of ten, trying to reach agreement. I believe if we could do that we would electrify the deci sion-making process and, indeed, electrify the minis ters themselves at Council meetings. And I hope I may,,before I conclude, remind my fel low-countrymen that the EEC Treaty with its full legal weight already provides each Member State with a veto on 26 important matters, such as accession of new members and even changes in customs duties and tax harmonization. And we know that it has always been a rule of the Community that a majority vote would never be forced against a Member State on a matter which it considered to be of vital importance. May I also remind both the House and my fellow- countrymen that many matters of great interest and importance to the United Kingdom, such as greater freedom of establishment and freedom to supply ser vices in insurance and banking, are held up by the vetoes of other countries. So I hope we will not pose any false problems. The real problem is to stop the endless discussions in the Council about everything, regardless of its importance. We must make the Com munity once again what it was always supposed to be : a Community able to take decisions and to act; a Community able to resolve differences between Mem ber States; a Community able \u2014 and this is crucial \u2014 to develop new policies; a Community able to help meet the urgent and justified needs of its 270 million people. (Applause) President. \u00b7 Mr Arndt. I call Mrs Viehoff, who is deputizing for Mrs Viehoff. \u2014 (NL) Mr President, four years ago this Parliament expressed its views on the Council's decision to establish a European Foundation. For var ious reasons my group was at that time opposed to the foundation. Speaking on behalf of the Socialist Group, Mr Seefeld suspected that the members of the Council felt they must make a friendly gesture to Mr Tinde mans because none of the plans in his document on European Union had been put into effect and, by establishing the European Foundation, they would at least create the impression that something was being done. Is it a coincidence that four years later the min isters have signed the agreement while Mr Tindemans is President of the Council? Mr President, the Socialist Group still has doubts about the foundation. It still believes that the Com munity cannot be brought closer to the people by add ing all kinds of organizations to those that already exist. Another strange thing about the foundation is that most of the activities it is to undertake are covered by the Committee on Youth, Culture, Education, Information and Sport and that every year this com mittee has to fight to see that the items needed for these activities remain in the budget, items which the Council constantly cuts. But now, it seems, the Coun cil thinks these activities are important after all. Mr President, over a million EUA must be set aside for the foundation in the budget. Parenthetically, but with a great deal of emphasis, I would point out that the budget is intended for Community tasks, not for intergovernmental matters. But how will this million be spent? How much will be left after salaries have been paid to the staff and travel and subsistence expenses to the members of the Foundation, how much will be left for the actual activities of the foun dation? Those are our objections, in 1978 the majority of Par liament gave its approval, and as good democrats we shall not contest that decision. However, this undoubtedly gives us Socialists the right to expect the same of the Council. An intergovernmental institution was never what was intended when Parliament expressed its approval of the Council's decision in 1978. It is incredible that,the Council should ignore Parliament in this way. Mr Tindemans said this morn ing that the foundation's foremost aim will be to strengthen the feeling of belonging together. Well, any feeling the Council and Parliament may have of ",
        "No 1-286/84 Debates of the European Parliament 15.6.82 Viehoff belonging together is certainly not strengthened by this Council decision. Mr Tindemans also made two other comments this morning. The institution's doubts cause him concern, but why then a decision which undermines Parliament's powers? His second com ment was that it had been his aim to strengthen rela tions between the Council and Parliament, but he can hardly believe that the establishment of the European Foundation in this form will improve relations. Mr President, the Socialist Group will support the resolution tabled by Mr Beumer on behalf of the Committee on Youth, Culture, Education, Informa tion and Sport, but without any great enthusiasm because it does not really see what use the foundation will be. But if there has to be a foundation, then it should at least comply with the conditions laid down in the resolution. President. \u2014 I call Mr Estgen. Mr Estgen. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentle men, we have heard it said repeatedly on previous occasions and again today that we must show the pol itical determination and courage to embark upon the measures necessary to ensure the development of Community policies, to reform our agricultural policy and restructure the Community budget. I interpret the mandate given by the Council to the Commission as an obligation, as a form of authority given to achieve a certain result. But a mandate also implies clear instructions from the body which has given it and I feel sorry for Mr Thorn and his Com mission in that they have received such an imprecise mandate. I pay tribute to their efforts to achieve tangi ble results in spite of it all. Nevertheless, the docu ments submitted to us are far from satisfactory; the gaps are too numerous and the practical guidelines, indicating instruments and means of action, much too few and far between. This is particularly apparent in the social sector. It must be admitted that while we are confronted with a very serious economic crisis, the social crisis and accompanying moral crisis are no less severe and this generalized crisis may wll become, as the President- in-Office of the Council, Mr Tindemans, so aptly pointed out this morning, the crisis of the Community. We shall never succeed in dissipating the doubts and scepticism of the younger generation, in other words of tomorrow's Europeans, if we fail to address our selves to their everyday problems. Their principal problem is that of unemployment which is already affecting more than ten million European citizens and we are moving with giant strides towards a figure of 20 million unemployed, half of whom will be young people! It is on this point that we must show our resolve to act together and, in this area more than any other, a policy of slow progress is not sufficient. This idea of slow progress in the Community reminds me of the Echternach procession in my own Grand Duchy: two small steps forward followed by two large steps back. Ladies and gentlemen, let us stop talking about unem ployment. Our debates will be no more than a sinister farce if we do not succeed in defeating the scourge of our modern era. What we need is an anti-crisis policy in this Community with effective common policies in the areas of technology, energy and industrial development and with especial attention to the steel industry. We are in still greater need of a dynamic policy in the monetary sector. Without these precondi tions there can be no further social progress. Another imperative today is to make the Ministers of Educa tion of our Member States realise that it is no longer sufficient for our educational systems, and above all our professional training systems, to follow the development of technology; on the contrary they must keep in step with the inherent dynamic of modern technology. President Tindemans pointed out that all these objec tives must be attained through an ambitious policy and that we can no longer be content with a Europe of one per cent and so on. But you were speaking to the con verted, Mr President! Our Parliament has been con vinced of this for a long time. You should talk instead to your colleagues in the Council of Ministers. You have always been of great service to Europe and you will have a great deal of work to do even after relin quishing the presidency. President. \u2014 I call the Council. Mr Tindemans, President-in-Office of the Council. \u2014 (NL) Mr President, I believe that I shall not witness what has happened today too often in my political ca reer. I should therefore like to thank sincerely all the Members of the European Parliament who have expressed their appreciation of the Belgian Presidency. I cannot name them all individually. You are all famil iar with the vicissitudes of political life. I also express my sincere thanks to all my colleagues who have also presided over Councils and to all our staff for the efforts they have made. By way of introduction I would draw your attention to three points. Firstly, what is the Presidency? In Janu ary, when I explained the programme of the Belgian Presidency here, I tried to make it clear that the coun try which has the Presidency cannot impose the policy it wishes to pursue. At best, it can encourage the other countries to put certain items on the agenda. Further more, there must be deliberations in the Council and, of course, consultations with the Commission and Parliament. Secondly, I would point out once again that, if a posi tion is to be adopted or a decision taken on political ",
        "15.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/85 Tindemans cooperation, unanimity is required. I believe this also needs to be emphasized once again on this occasion. And thirdly, a presidency lasts only six months. Con sequently, however hard you may work, six months is a very short period to propose a new policy, to get it approved and to implement it. I entirely agree with you, Mr von Bismarck. If you want to see the fruits of your labours, six months is too short, but I can assure you that, after working for six months as we have done, you wonder if a human being could continue for twelve months. I am not complaining, but I would like my successors to note what I have said. As regards political cooperation I should also like to say this: some speakers welcomed the recent develop ments within the framework of European Political Cooperation. I would summarize these development as three points. Firstly, European Political Cooperation has become distinctly operational in recent months, since it has kept up with political events. We need only think of Poland, the Falkland Islands and Lebanon. This is a new development which has enabled the Ten to grow in stature on the world stage. Secondly, European Political Cooperation and actual Community activities joined in tackling the same prob lems. For Poland, the Falklands and Lebanon Euro pean Political Cooperation has created a political framework in which it has been possible for trade policy and other measures to be taken in the Com munity's organs. We thus have here numerous exam ples of the convergence of Europe Political Coopera tion and Community activities, a form of cooperation which can be regarded as a basis for European Union. In this context, it should also be said that the Ministers have already translated the idea of 'le centre de d\u00e9cision unique'\u00ecnto practice during one and the same meeting, both within the framework of political cooperation and in their deliberations on Community matters. In my opinion, this is a second important development. I should like to emphasize that the Belgian Presidency has attached particular importance to the relationship between political cooperation and this Parliament. I have myself agreed to attend an urgent discussion on Poland in the Political Affairs Committee. The Presi dency has also attended two urgent plenary debates on the Falklands crisis. These are new forms of dialogue between Parliament and those engaged in political cooperation, which have been used to give expression to the willingness to involve Parliament more closely in European Political Cooperation. I said earlier on in my statement that I regretted the fact the Community cannot pursue or is not pursuing a better anti-crisis policy. This is, of course, due to some extent to the situation in the Member States, the view taken of economic policy and of monetary policy, inflation and the budgetary situation in the Member States. All this has an effect and often prevents us from adopting a united policy at European level. And yet positive results have been achieved. In the European Council, for example, decisions have been taken on youth unemployment and investments, and at the Western summit in Versailles, thanks largely to the position adopted by the European Com munity, decisions were also taken on methods of com bating the crisis, monetary measures, investments and measures to the benefit of the young unemployed. At European level, as I said this morning, although I was not perhaps emphatic enough, the Council of Social Ministers had taken a number of important decisions in the last few days. Thus those who claim we do not pay enough attention to such issues are mistaken. These social measures supplement the economic mea sures approved by the European Council. I will not go into what has been said about the European Monetary System. I assume the Commission will be discussing this point. I would merely point out that it is not the Community but usually the Member States who are resisting the further development of the European Monetary System, the second phase which should really have begun in March of last year, the further strengthening of the system. Secondly, two Member States, Belgium and France, have indeed taken supplementary measures when the value of their currencies was adjusted. I would also say that we have not forgotten that last year Lord Car- rington succeeded in bringing the ten Foreign Minis ters to Strasbourg, where they had a meeting with the enlarged Bureau. We intended to do the same, but it was agreed last year that such meetings should be held only once a year. This year's meeting will therefore be held under the Danish Presidency. Mr Bangemann raised a particularly interesting point. Is the lack of political will the only cause of the stag nation in the Community, or is this political will also connected with the institutions? In other words, can the difficulties be overcome if there are better institu tions? This is an extremely interesting point, and I am myself an institutionalist. Jean Monnet convinced me that no community can work without good institu tions. But as things stand today and as a famous man once said, 'les choses \u00e9tant ce qu'elles sont', it is not pos sible to change the institutions at the moment. Re sponsibility must at present be ascribed entirely to the political will of the leaders of the Member States of the Community. I would also point out that during the meeting between the European Community and the ACP countries in Libreville a result was achieved to which insufficient attention has been paid. We suc ceeded in putting forward proposals for the injection of 208 million units of account, and the developing countries did not therefore go home disappointed. In Versailles we succeeded, once again principally as a result of Community action, in persuading the Ameri can leaders to join in global negotiations in the United Nations as part of the North-South dialogue. You will ",
        "No 1-286/86 Debates of the European Parliament 15.6.82 Tindemans recall that the special session of the United Nations devoted to the North-South dialogue last year was a failure and that the Community did not speak with one voice. But we now have the chance to adopt a united front with the United States as our ally, and to begin global negotiations. I was asked this question, and you have now heard my answer. I was also asked about the importance of what the Versailles communiqu\u00e9 says about these global nego tiations and monetary problems. What the commu niqu\u00e9 says is very good, but its weakness is that it does not provide for any compulsory mechanisms for put ting these good ideas into practive. Further negotia tions must therefore be held, and these ideas must assume definite shape. It has been said that I have not referred to the next elections, or rather the election procedure for the next elections to the European Par liament. Mr President, under the Belgian Presidency a com mittee has been set up, chaired by a Belgian official who is a specialist in matters connected with elections, and each Member State has appointed a specialist to examine the European Parliament's proposals and to see whether the Council can come to a conclusion. This committee has already met once and will be meeting twice in June. Here again, the Council is at present complying with the European Parliament's suggestions. As regards the Genscher-Colombo propos als, a working party has, as you know, been set up under the chairmanship of a Belgian specialist, and this working party has worked very satisfactorily. At the moment there are still four problems. The first con cerns security. How can we discuss this in the Euro pean context? Secondly, there is the relationship between political cooperation and the Community and integration. Thirdly, relations with the European Par liament. Fourthly, the method of voting: majority, unanimity, simple majority and so on. But at 5 p.m. on Sunday, 20 June, the Ten will be meeting to discuss these Genscher-Colombo proposals. That has been agreed. I hope \u2014 I dare not express my views today \u2014 I hope that the Council will draw positive conclusions. Mr Tindemans. \u2014 (FR) I should also like to say a word about the Hopper report. I want to thank all those Members who have made their opinions known in this debate because the matter is of great import ance. The discussions surrounding what has become known as the Mandate of 30 May 1980 and the ques tions pertaining to it which have been under consider ation for two years now, formed one of the central features of Community activity during the 6 months in which I have had the honour to preside over the Council. If we go back to the origins of the debate which opened on 30 May 1980 we will see that more than 2 years of the life of our Community have been marked in one way or another by this subject. I should like to take this opportunity to say how interested I was to read Mr Hopper's report. For my part I shall confine myself to three considerations. One of the first questions raised in your report is that of determining whether the mandate should be interpreted in an extensive or a restrictive sense. On this vital point I am able to assure you that the Council has not resigned itself to viewing the mandate as a mere answer to a budgetary problem. With reference to the budget, the Foreign Ministers agreed on 24 and 25 May last to the principle of an arrangement for the year 1982 only which provides, under certain conditions, for compensation amounting to 850 million ECU to the United Kingdom. The detailed procedures for this arrangement are to be adopted by the Council on 20 and 21 June next. At the same time the Ministers have undertaken to find a definitive solution for the period beginning after 1982 by the end of November this year. This is of course a partial agreement which does not entirely correspond to the objective of the mandate and therefore does not allow the other aspects of the mandate to be consid ered closed in accordance with the guidelines drawn up by the European Council in London in November 1981. I want to stress the fact that this agreement has had the undeniable merit of breaking a political dead lock which was alarming in many respects; without prejudice to the future, it evidences in the clearest terms the Council's desire to reach a definitive solu tion at the earliest opportunity. In the areas of social policy and employment, follow ing the London commitment, the European Council meeting in March 1982 placed particular emphasis on professional training for young people which is one of the keys to the problem of unemployment. In the same vein, the Council of Social Ministers meeting on 27 May last adopted a very detailed resolution on Community action to combat unemployment. At Community level, specific decisions have been taken to this end including the new Euratom loan amounting to 1 000 million ECU and the assignment of a further 1 000 million ECU to the new Community instrument (NCI). I might add that the Commission has recently announced that it would be proposing a further increase in the NCI endowment to 3 000 mil lion ECU. The Council will be considering this propo sal at the earliest opportunity. Finally, the European Council meeting in June will have on its agenda a very detailed study by the Com mission on investment policy. Regional policy is a third example. The Commission has put forward a substantive proposal and the Coun cil already held an extremely detailed debate in April on the various options open to us. My fourth and last example will be that of research and development policy. The Commission submitted a communication on a global research and development strategy which was discussed in detail last March and ",
        "15.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/87 Tindemans is due to be re-examined at the end of the month with a view to the adoption of precise guidelines. In parallel with this, extremely concrete decisions have been taken in certain areas such as the fusion programme or the raw materials programme adopted last March. Fin ally, in the area of agricultural policy which is the third aspect of the mandate, I might simply point out that some of the guidelines contained in the provi sional London conclusions were already implemented when farm prices were fixed for the 1982/83 market ing year. I should like to comment briefly on the third point which is perhaps the most important since it relates to the future. It is true that the London conclusions on Chapters one and two, i.e. new policies and agricul tural policy, have not yet been formally adopted. I am sure that the next Presidency will use its best endea vours to see to it that there is no loss of momentum. The Commission shares this conviction since its Presi dent, Mr Thorn, stressed his view that there was no longer any obstacle to the implementation of the com mitments entered into last November; he said that the Commission would be putting forward the necessary proposals for this purpose. Mr President, I should like now to say a word about the Middle East. In my capacity as President-in-Office of the Council, I was invited to visit Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Israel. I did not take with me any proposals to put to the leaders of those countries. Wherever I went I was asked immediately whether the Community remained faithful to the Venice declara tion. My answer always was that the Venice declara tion is the only and therefore the latest text adopted by the Ten in political cooperation and that no other document exists although many things have happened in the Middle East since the declaration was approved in 1980. And I went on to list some of the events. First of all, there have been elections in three countries directly concerned by the events in the Middle East, the United States, France and Israel; secondly, there has been and still is a war between Iraq and Iran; thirdly, there have been certain incidents in Isreal; fourthly, the Sinai has been evacuated and I could continue this list of events which have occurred in the Middle East and are liable to influence the situation in this explosive part of the world. My conclusion was that the time had come to reassess the situation. I shall be reporting to my colleagues, and, on the basis of that report, a discussion will take place between the Ten; following that discussion it will be possible to decide whether to confirm the Ven ice declaration, to amend it or whether the Ten might adopt a new declaration. I think that you would have done the same thing if you had been in my place. This was the only possible explanation to justify my visit to these countries of the Middle East. Almost everywhere I was asked whether the Com munity or the Ten \u2014 because these decisions are always taken in the context of political cooperation \u2014 were for or against the Camp David agreements. I always answered that this was not a question for the Ten. These agreements were signed by Israel, Egypt and the United States. But I observed during my visit that the evacuation of the Sinai had everywhere a rather favourable influence on attitudes. Another question always followed immediately: are the Ten for or against the idea of Palestinian auton omy provided for in the second phase of the Camp David agreements? My answer was always that since the basis of that autonomy had not yet been defined, it presupposed new negotiations since, if I have under stood things rightly, Egypt, Israel and the United States do not have the same concept of the autonomy to be granted to the West Bank and the Gaza region. Well now, since negotiations will have to take place \u2014 although let me stress that I made no proposals \u2014 why should the opportunity not be taken to extend the framework of discussion and see how dynamic pro gress might be made in action for peace in this part of the world? That is all I said. I made no proposals. I tried to obtain answers to my questions to be able to draw up the report for my colleagues in the Ten to which I referred just now. Any other reports about my visit to these countries are therefore erroneous or do not reflect the precise truth. I have still not submitted my report since it has been held up \u2014 as you will readily understand \u2014 by events in the Lebanon. But I am still intending to do so, so that the necessary reassessment can take place and to enable measures to be proposed which will inspire greater confidence in this stricken region. Then Europe will have to adopt its own attitude and define its policy to the Middle East. Finally, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we must adopt a method to ensure the continuity of European policy towards the Middle East. I agree with those Members who have stated during this debate that it is inconceivable for each President in office to embark upon similar visits to the Middle East. We must find a method which will ensure continuity in the European attitude. What form will it take? I have some ideas on this subject which I shall be submitting to my colleagues, again in the context of political cooperation. I do not know whether my colleagues will accept them but, at all events, I think we have a duty to examine ways of ensuring the necessary con tinuity. I say this because people in this area \u2014 I hope you will bear with me if I speak of this, Mr President \u2014 still remember the visit by Mr Thorn when he was President-in-Office, by Mr Van der Klauw and by Lord Carrington. I hope they will also remember my visit but there is no point in effecting identical visits followed by a report which is then shelved. Let me stress again that we must therefore find a method of ensuring greater continuity of the European attitude towards this explosive region. ",
        "No 1-286/88 Debates of the European Parliament 15.6.82 Tindemans On the subject of the Lebanon, I would say that when I came back from Israel I stated during my press-con ferences in Jerusalem and Belgium that it was vital to prevent the outbreak of a new war in this area either inside Lebanon or on its frontiers. Some journalists were even rather sarcastic and asked me whether I had special information to suggest that a war might break out \u2014 even experts and diplomats put that question to me. Again in Versailles, Mr President, on Sunday morning I tried to draw the attention of all the partici pants to the explosive situation in Lebanon. Nobody was prepared to believe me. But in the afternoon we learnt that two brigades had invaded the country. That was the climate which prevailed. I did my duty. We did everything possible at European level; the political directors met immediately at my request, I travelled to New York on Monday, the ambassadors of the Ten met in New York to examine the situation, the Ten met on Wednesday and published the communiqu\u00e9 about Lebanon with which you are now familiar and which I was able to quote this morning. We now wel come the ceasefire which has entered into force and hope that resolutions 508 and 509 will be implemented so that Lebanon can at long last enjoy its own sover eignty, territorial integrity and the unity which this sorely tried country so richly deserves. But I do want to put one question: why did Europe and other world forces not make a greater effort to save Lebanon from the tragic situation confronting it today? Communiqu\u00e9s have been published but nothing at all has been done to improve the situation in this poor country. Turing to the Falklands you are already familiar with the attitude of the Ten: condemnation of the violation of international law, implementation of resolution 502 and pressure on Argentina through economic mea sures to persuade it to agree to political negotiations. I must repeat the fact that these measures were in no way directed against the people of Argentina or against Latin America and I welcome the latest reports to the effect that a ceasefire has been agreed. I hope this will enable us to find a solution to the problem, that international law will be respected again thus ena bling us to pursue a lasting policy of peace. I also owe you a reply about Turkey. I can only say that the Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr Turkman, has indicated that the referendum on the new constitution will definitely be held in November. I know no more than this but official notification of the referendum has been given. That is therefore a new element to be added now to our dossier on Turkey. I should like to say a word to Mr Croux while apologiz ing for not mentioning other Members by name. You are quite right, Mr Croux, that fresh reflection is necessary on the Community, on the aims of the Com munity and on European union. I agree with you entirely that it is unacceptable for ten Member States to have ten different interpretations of the Treaties. It is unacceptable for the basis of our Community's structures which have been approved by our parlia ments, in other words the text of the Treaties and preambles to them, simply to be disregarded; it is unacceptable for some Member States to remain faith ful to the text while others wish to place a new inter pretation on it. We must decide what can be done about this. I listened with close attention to Mr De Goede who spoke about a two-speed Europe. I personally have never advocated such an arrangement. But if the situa tion continues like this, and I am weighing my words carefully, and if the Member States do not all place the same interpretation on the Treaties, we shall inevitably reach a stage when it will be necessary to consider how progress can be made on the basis of respect for the Treaties. I hope that such a situation will not arise because it might breach the Community in its present form. In answer to Mrs Spaak I would say this: 'Yes, Madam, you are quite right, we need strong medi cine.' In my speech this morning I myself condemned the policy of small steps forward. But the fact is that the Ten do not all want this strong medicine; they do not all have the same ideal or the same objectives. Addressing Mr Croux just now, I explained my view of things and how I interpret the threats hanging over the Community. You are aware of the obligations incumbent on the Council President and I must be extremely cautions; we have another extremely impor tant Council meeting on 20, 21 and 22 June but I very often wonder whether we still have the same consep- tion of the Treaties and of their ultimate objectives. As yet I have no answer to that question. I feel sure, Madam, that we shall soon inevitably have to face that question. I welcome today's debate on the occasion of the report on the achievements of the Bel gian Presidency. The time has come for determined action by all those who believe that the European ideal is the only possible solution for our countries and for our future. We must all place our trust in the Treaties. If that trust can be imparted by this Parliament as the expression of the will of the people, I face the future without anxiety. (Applause) President. \u2014 I call the Commission. Mr Thorn, President of the Commission. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, I shall be very brief because I know that the time set aside for this debate has already elapsed and that my friend, Mr Tindemans, has already made the essential points. First of all, I should like to answer Mr Beumer about the European Foundation. The Commission is intend ing to enter in its preliminary draft budget for 1983 an ",
        "15.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/89 Thorn appropriation of 1 million ECU on budget line 676. We believe that this appropriation should be sufficient to cover the operating costs of the Foundation during its first year of activity. The constituent act granted the Foundation complete independence in establishing its programme and administering its activities. Nevertheless, ladies and gentlemen, that independence in no way precludes the possibility of the Council of the Foundation establish ing close cooperation with the European Parliament. We hope that will take place and we shall make the suggestion. The Commission will look favourably on the establishment of closer links between the Founda tion and all the Community institutions, for example through a colloquy between your Assembly, between your Committee on Youth, Culture, Education, Infor mation and Sport and the Council of the Foundation. The Commission believes that the ten Members of the Foundation's Council allocated to the Community should be appointed by the Council on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the Euro pean Parliament. The Commission intends to include provision for this procedure in the proposal based on Article 235 which it will be submitting in due course with a view to the conclusion of an agreement between the Community and the Foundation. The constituent act also requires the Foundation to avoid all duplica tion of Community action in its own activities. The presence on the Council of the Foundation of mem bers appointed by the Community will constitute a guarantee in this respect and permit close coordination between the activities of the Foundation and those of the Community. Moreover, it is understood that the Foundation will have to accept not only financial control by the Court of Auditors, but also control by the Commission under the provisions of the financial regulation. Express provision has also been made for appropriate cooperation between the Foundation and the Council of Europe. The Commission understands the concern voiced by Parliament; however, it believes that suffi cient guarantees exist to avoid any risk of the Founda tion encroaching upon the responsibilities of the Com munity. Moreover, the Commission will have no objection if in future the European Foundation accepts responsibility for certain cultural initiatives whose implementation would be impossible at Community level. The Com mission is of the opinion that the Foundation could be an important instrument for the dissemination of the idea of Europe among the peoples of the Community. I now wish to answer Mr M\u00f8ller's question. The Council regulations on agricultural prices for the year 1982 are based on Article 43 of the Treaty or on pro visions deriving therefrom. The Council regulation adopting trade sanctions on Argentina is based on Article 113 of the Treaty. These provisions stipulate that the Council must act by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament in the case of Article 43 of the Treaty. These rules were respected when the regu lations to which I referred were adopted. The possibil ity that a Member State may invoke what is termed a right of veto in order to defend a vital interest is men tioned nowhere in the Treaties \u2014 I think Mr de la Mal\u00e8ne referred to this point just now. The text of the Treaties merely indicates the cases in which unanimity is required and those in which, on the other hand, a simple or qualified majority will be sufficient. That, Mr President, is the juridical situation to which I have nothing to add except to repeat yet again that the Commission is not a party to the Luxembourg dis agreement or agreement and is required to respect the Treaty, the whole Treaty and nothing but the Treaty. Following those two answers, may I now say a word about Mr Hopper's report. This seems to me a good time to assess the results achieved through the exercise of the mandate but I do not want to return yet again to all that has been said during the year and I am afraid that we shall unfortunately have several more opportunities to consider various aspects of the man date, particularly, as Mr Hopper pointed out, the budgetary problem. I should just like to highlight the most salient features of the rapporteur's remarkable report. At the same time I wish to extend my sincere congratulations and thanks to him. As regards the purpose of the mandate, the Commis sion refused to embark upon a purely book-keeping exercise and I am grateful to my compatriot, Mr Est gen, who commiserated with the fate of the Commis sion in taking up this mandate. The Commission chose the path of development of Community policies to strengthen Community cohesion and help to answer the challenge of the economic crisis. Ladies and gentlemen, if you have followed the p\u00e9ri p\u00e9ties of this budgetary dispute you will be more con vinced than ever that there is only one possible answer to the budgetary question: we need a more effective Community and more effective Community policies for the benefit of all concerned, otherwise we shall find no solution in the medium and long term. (Applause) The Commission therefore sought parallel progress on the three aspects of the mandate: structural policy, agricultural policy and budgetary policy. We never felt it appropriate to make progress in one area conditional on progress in the others. You may remember my words to you here some months ago: 'Let us not link the problems or take hostages in our Community.' We must continue our day-to-day work and I think that that is the lesson to be drawn from the events of recent weeks. Difficulties over one dossier should never be allowed to block progress in any other essential area regardless of the national interests at stake. ",
        "No 1-286/90 Debates of the European Parliament 15.6.82 Thorn Let us move on to the instruments proposed by the Commission. The Commission chose first of all to propose major options in the main areas of activity: energy, agriculture and industry before going on to more operational proposals. In answer to the remark able criticism contained in Mr Hopper's report who calls upon the Commission to move 'resolutely on from the stage of general remarks to the presentation of more specific proposals' I would say that the Com mission has already made a broad start on the opera- . tional part of its action. That answer is also intended for Mr Giavazzi, Mr Delorozoy and Mr Pfennig. Allow me to remind you of a few examples: the development of the NCI to which President Tinde mans referred just now, our farm price proposals which, ladies and gentlemen, reflect the guidelines of the mandate even if many people apparently do not recognize that fact, our preliminary draft budget for 1983 which is characterized by a substantial develop ment of the structural funds, our proposed directives for the internal market etc. We shall have occasion to return to all these subjects. I would add that the Com mission has tried to make progress in all the areas which it considers to be of crucial importance in the fight against the economic crisis and to strengthen the Community's economic structures. There remains the question of the budget. That was and still is the most difficult problem facing us. Every one knows that many difficulties still lie ahead. It is true that we have only arrived at a temporary solution and I made this proposal because I realized that the gap could not be bridged and that we were facing a major crisis. It was necessary to gain time. You know that, in agreement with the whole Commission, I sub mitted various compromise proposals to the Council; the last of them dated 16 May 1982 provided the basis for the solution which the United Kingdom accepted for the year 1982 alone; this possibility was offered by the decision of 30 May should it prove impossible to reach an agreement for the medium term. This proposal providing ad hoc compensation for 1982, calculated on a flat-rate basis, is accompanied by a commitment to pursue efforts to settle the longer term problems by the end of this year. It was on that basis that the agreement of 25 May was reached, ena bling us to hope that in a new and, we hope, more calm and collected approach an adequate solution will be found for the longer term; we are in fact looking for a multi-year solution. We must not seek to hide the fact that the solution found for the United Kingdom problem in subsequent years confronts us with a fundamental problem. This problem relates to the role which you and I wish the Community budget to play. I would remind you that the Commission has always refused to make its policy proposals conditional on budgetary objectives. It can not therefore subscribe to a logic which would tend to make the Community budget a kind of instrument to balance the financial burdens of the Member States. At the present juncture not one Member State is free from problems in this area. Once again, we believe it is imperative for a better budgetary balance to result from the natural play of effective Community policies of the kind which we are endeavouring to define with your assistance. I refer now to the question by Mr Jackson on this subject. He himself recalled Mr Lange's 1979 proposal to intro duce a mechanism for financial compensation in the budget. I personally have strong hesitations about going as far as that. The Community budget cannot effect significant transfers of resources. I am afraid that it is not large enough except as far as the smallest Member States are concerned. Moreover, in my view a compensatory mechanism would lessen the feeling of responsibility on the part of the Member States vis-\u00e0- vis the budgetary consequences of their own policies since those consequences would be corrected in each individual case by the application of such criteria as might be adopted for the purpose. I personally do not believe this to be a sound principle of budgetary man agement but we could return to the subject later. The objective of more determined budgetary interven tion in certain Member States must be attained, let me repeat this yet again, through the development of poli cies of joint interest rather than through machinery for automatic re-distribution. Nevertheless, I appreciate the idea contained in the proposal by Mr Lange, of which Mr Jackson reminded us, to base new own resources on budgetary revenue better adopted to the ability of States, regions and even individuals to pay. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, that was my ini tial reaction to the report by Mr Hopper. May I add a word to certain representatives of the Mediterranean countries like Mr Papantoniou, who put questions concerning our policy towards those countries. I would point out that we are currently trying to foresee the consequences of a possible fur ther enlargement in the near future and we have recently given a first reply to the memorandum on Portugal. I believe that this reply was favourably received in Athens, as press reports today confirm. It is true to say that the Commission has already begun its Mediterranean action. In the decision on farm-prices, particularly favourable treatment was given to Mediterranean products. We introduced measures for wine, fruit, vegetables and olive oil in response to requests from the Mediterra nean countries. Soon we shall be in a position to pro pose integrated programmes for the Mediterranean countries. That is my last answer on a specific point. Honourable Members may rest assured that we are respecting the undertakings given by us in this area. (Applause) ",
        "15.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/91 IN THE CHAIR: LADY ELLES Vice-President President. \u2014 The debate is closed. The vote will be taken at the next voting time. 1 5. Question Time President. \u2014 The next item on the agenda is the first part of Question Time (Doc. 1-330/82). We begin with questions to the Commission. Question No 1, by Mr Coust\u00e9, for whom Mr Paulhan is substituting (H-42/82): The Commission has announced that priority should be given to intensifying convergence in practical terms rather than to introducing new regulations. Can it explain how it intends to achieve this aim? Mr Ortoli, Vice-President of the Commission. \u2014 (FR) This question brings us back to today's debate on convergence and I would remind you that in mak ing the declaration referred to by Mr Coust\u00e9, the Commission indicated that convergence was an essen tial feature of the EMS since the persistence of the present divergencies was jeopardizing the basis of the system. We felt that it was possible through existing mechan isms to make substantial progress in a number of areas, firstly, by defining monetary objectives and discussing problems of interest rates in order to seek a measure of compatibility between the different policies. Secondly, by refraining from using certain instruments of economic and monetary policy which are incompa tible with the proper operation of the system. Thirdly, by establishing the principle of the free move ment of capital which is also one way of organizing genuine convergence as the basis of economic policy. Fourthly, by keeping a much closer watch on the poli cies pursued and on their results, for example, by establishing a set of comparative indicators and fixing by joint agreement a number of targets; in the event of deviation from these targets discussions would have to take place with a possible obligation on the Commis sion to make full use of its responsibility to hold con sultations and make recommendations. Similarly, the 1 Request for early votes: see Minutes. Council would have to be courageous enough to open a debate when it felt that divergence was setting in within the Community. Finally, by establishing a procedure for mutual infor mation and surveillance of the balance of payments and external debt situation of the Member States. This group of measures based on active development of contacts through existing councils and committees should enable us to make specific and, after all, bind ing progress towards closer convergence. Mr Enright. \u2014 On a point of order, Madam Presi dent. At the time I tried to make this point, there was and indeed there still is a tremendous amount of chat tering going on in the benches opposite. Admittedly some of it seems to be caused by European Democrats talking to Mr Bangemann and so on, but it is not help ful during Question Time. President. \u2014 Mr Enright, I heartily endorse your comments and I hope those to whom they apply will have taken notice of what has been said. Question No 2, by Mr Nyborg (H-53/82) : On 19 June 1981 the European Parliament debated a report on coastal erosion in the Com munity; in the course of the debate Mr Narjes, Member of the Commission, stated that in 1982 the Commission would be submitting a proposal concerning coastal protection. How is this work progressing, and when can we expect to see defi nite proposals? Mr Richard, Member of the Commission. \u2014 At the plenary part-session of 19 June 1981 my colleague, Commissioner Narjes, indicated to Parliament that the Commission was following up its work on ecological mapping with a view to submitting to the Council, at the end of 1982 or the beginning of 1983, a propos al for the progressive creation of a European informa tion system on the state of the environment, which also concerns natural risks and especially coastal ero sion. I am happy to tell Parliament that the Commis sion has set up an inter-service working group to iden tify the actions to be undertaken at Community level in the field of coastal erosion and to define a strategy for their implementation. I think Members will agree that this is a difficult, deli cate and somewhat complicated matter, involving as it does environmental, economic, regional and indeed social considerations. I think it would therefore be unwise for me to give a specific date on which the Commission's ideas could be expected. I can only say that the Commission is pursuing its work with all due diligence and that we will report as soon as possible. Mr Nyborg. \u2014 (DA) I should like to say to the Com mission that I feel the answer we have been given is ",
        "No 1-286/92 Debates of the European Parliament 15.6.82 Nyborg very vague and incomplete. It is perhaps understanda ble that a date cannot be set, but it should at least be possible to assure us that the work has been started and to give us some information on what progress has been made. I therefore greatly regret that Mr Narjes is not present. I had supplementary questions to put to him, but I have the feeling that I shall not get an answer to them, at least not today. I shall therefore put my questions in writing. Mr Richard. \u2014 I am sorry if the honourable parlia mentarian thought the answer was diffuse. If was not meant to be. It was meant to be fairly informative. The inter-service working group consists of representatives of DG V, DG VI, DG XI, DG XII and DG XVI. As I told Parliament, work is being pursued, as I under stand it, with due diligence. I am afraid I cannot go very much further that that. Mrs Ewing. \u2014 In connection with the mapping that has been mentioned, will the Commission take into account that in some cases if it were to provide plans for spending money to protect the taking away of land by the sea, it would have the additional bonus of reclaiming an extensive acreage of land? I do not know about other parts of the Community, but in South Uist, for example, to recover land from the sea would mean at the same time that many thousands of acres would be reclaimed for a land-hungry crofting community. Mr Richard. \u2014 I am sure the honourable parliamen tarian is right. I can only say that the question I am asked is about coastal erosion and protection rather than land acquisition. On the other hand they are obviously connected in the sense that each involves both sea and land. To that extent I am sure that Com missioner Narjes will be very interested in what the honourable lady has had to say. Mr Hume. \u2014 Could I ask Commissioner Richard once again to remind Commissioner Narjes, who I understand has responsibility for this subject, of the promise he made to me, as rapporteur on this subject, in the debate in June 1981 and to let him know that Parliament is concerned about this matter? I under stand, of course, that the Commission's resources in this area are limited, but could the Commissioner ask that interdepartmental committee to examine the ques tion of resources as well? Mr Richard. \u2014 I think I can give an affirmative answer to both questions raised by the honourable gentleman. I will indeed draw Mr Narjes' attention both to the undertaking that he gave to the honoura ble gentlemen and also to the fact that adequate resources, in the view of the honourable gentleman, should be devoted to this task. Mr Purvis. \u2014 The Commissioner will be aware that this has been going on for exactly a year now. The way these things go, with all these DGs involved, it looks as if it will be a further year before much further progress is made. Is he aware that my constituency, Mid-Scotland and Fife, is gradually being reduced in size and that the castle and cathedral at St Andrews and the old golf course there, the world-famous Old Course at St Andrews, are slowly disappearing? Does he not think that a bit more speed and determination could be brought to bear on this project? Mr Richard. \u2014 I will certainly draw Mr Narjes' atten tion to the extreme urgency of this position in the honourable gentleman's constituency. None of us would wish to see St Andrews sinking under the sea. I dont't think, however that he should be quite so defeatist about the prospect of progress. As I say, I think it is right that the Commission should take some time in order to try and get the right answer to this question. The obvious way in which we should do it is to consult the various directorates-general concerned, which we are doing. Mr Griffiths. \u2014 Does Commissioner Richard have any opinion about the resources which are likely to be made available to deal with problems of coastal ero sion and furthermore, could he tell me whether any of this money is likely to be spent on the very serious problems at Whitely Bay, which is not in my constitu ency? Mr Richard. \u2014 I am asked whether I have any opinion on the resources likely to be made available. My only comment is that I should have thought in general that they will probably be insufficient for the task which is demanded of them by Parliament and the Council. President. \u2014 Question No 3, by Mrs Dury (H-70/ 82): On 25 July 1978 the Council agreed to a 5-year experimental programme called FAST, the aim of which was to define long-term objectives and priorities for the Community's research and development policy. Why did the Commission not consult the Euro pean Trade Union Confederation on the formula tion of the FAST programme? Mr Richard, Member of the Commission. \u2014 The FAST programme, which was decided on by the Council in July 1978, is a programme of forecasting and assess ment in the field of science and technology. This pro gramme results from and is a follow-up to the action programme on forecasting, evaluation and methodol ogy called 'Europe + 30' launched by the Commis sion in 1974. Within the framework of information ",
        "15.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/93 Richard meetings on Community research policy, the Euro pean Trade Union Confederation was informed on the carrying out and the conclusions of the study 'Europe + 30'. Within the framework of the consultation of the Economic and Social Committee in 1978 on the proposal for FAST, the opinion of the trade union movement was also sought. Now among the three priority research projects in progress, that on work and employment, the time hor izon for which is ten years, is evidently of particular interest to trade unions. For this purpose contacts have been made between FAST and on the one side the European Trade Union Institute and on the other the research centres of trade unions in the different mem ber countries. Furthermore, representatives of trade union organizations have participated in certain con ferences and working seminars organized within the framework of the FAST programme. Mrs Dury. \u2014 (FR) I welcome Commissioner Richard's answer concerning the FAST programme but I was astonished to note the difference between the conclusions of this programme and the action taken. In the conclusions and criteria which will determine our choices in the area of research and development, I believe that the image and prestige of the Community are at stake, as well as the independence of Europe and our ability to respond flexibly to the uncertainties of the future. May I ask whether these objectives have been determined after consulting the trade unions or by the Commission alone? Mr Richard. \u2014 I am not absolutely certain that I entirely follow the nuances of the question that Mrs Dury has just asked. The question itself really deals with the extent of consultation with the trade union movement. As far as the Commission is concerned, we are anxious to consult, we are willing to consult and indeed we have consulted. I don't think that there is any great divergence between the objectives of the Commission in relation to FAST and the objectives of trade unions that we have in fact consulted, but if there is a major problem here, well then certainly, as far as the Commission is concerned, we would be an xious to hear about it and to try to put it right. President. \u2014 Question No 4, by Mr Pesmazoglou (H-101/82): The EEC is aiming to safeguard supplies of minerals essential to its economy. In this context, existing Community reserves should be fully used. Obviously, this matter is of particular interest to Member States that possess such reserves. Can the Commission state what progress has been made in drawing up measures on this matter, what they are designed to achieve and what special regulations are proposed? Mr Tugendhat, Vice-President of the Commission. \u2014 The Commission is well aware of the problems of security of supply of raw materials for the Com munity's economy and of the importance of properly exploiting the resources on its own territory. As far back as 1975 it expressed its concern in a communica tion to the Council. Since then the Commission has developed extensive research programmes designed to reduce its dependence on outside sources. The latest programme for 1982-85 was adopted by the Council on 17 May 1982 for a total amount of 54 million ECU. Commission staff, together with experts from the rel evant ministries in the Member States and the indus tries concerned, have studied the possibility of setting up a scheme to encourage exploration of Community territory by granting loans for prospecting by industry, which would be repayable unless the exploration pro gramme did not lead to commercial production. As the Commission indicated in its answer to Written Question No 2122/80 by Mr Lalor, it did not think it advisable to take any decision on funding exploration until the debate on Mrs Moreau's report on current and future supplies of mineral and vegetable raw materials in the European Community was concluded. Following the adoption of the relevant resolution by the European Parliament on 9 March 1982 the Com mission expects to forward a communication to the Council soon. Mr Pesmazoglou. \u2014 The whole issue is linked with dumping operations by a number of producers, espe cially in the Far East. Is the Commissioner aware of any specific action taken by the Commission in rela tion to anti-dumping measures, specifically in connec tion with the complaints submitted by producers of deadburn and caustic magnesite who have been exporting exclusively to the Community for a long period of years and who are now faced with very seri ous dumping operations by China and North Korea, for example? Does the Commission intend taking act ion to combat such dumping operations? Mr Tugendhat. \u2014 I thought I had covered all the pos sible supplementaries that might have been asked on this question, but I have, I must confess, been taken completely unawares by the honourable Member. I can only say to him that I must look into the matter and ensure that he receives a reply as soon as possible. This is a problem of which I had not previously been aware, and I will convey it to my colleague, Mr Dav- ignon. Mrs Ewing. \u2014 May I take it from the Commissioner's answer there has been no departure today from the assurances given by previous Commissioners that there ",
        "No 1-286/94 Debates of the European Parliament 15.6.82 Ewing will be no exploration or boring for uranium in the Orkneys against the wishes of the people of these islands? Mr Tugendhat. \u2014 I do not believe that that assump tion flows naturally from what I said a moment ago to Mr Pesmazoglou, but there has been no change in the Commission's position. President. 82): Question No 5, by Mr Lalor (H-104/ Will the Commission give due reason as to why it has failed to implement the common organization of the market in potatoes, the lack of which con tinues to seriously threaten this sector of the agri cultural market in Ireland? Mr Dalsager, Member of the Commission. \u2014 (DA) The Commission put a proposal on the common organ ization of the market in potatoes before the Council in 1976. The Council has not been able to reach agree ment in the meantime. Some Member States want the market arrangement for potatoes to comprise a large number of provisions which really have nothing to do with it. Other Member States are against an extension of the market arrangements in this way. It is expected that the question will be discussed again in the near future. I might perhaps add that I was a member of the Council for many years, and I discussed the question of market arrangements for potatoes on various occa sions without at any time managing to achieve any thing resembling unity. Of course, Parliament is fully entitled to put this question, but the Member States have not so far been prepared to implement the arrangements on potatoes which the Commission feels we need and which we have been proposing for many years. However, it has not been possible to get a deci sion on the matter. Mr Lalor. \u2014 I am surprised and, of course, I need not say disappointed by the non-reply I have received from the Commissioner. The Commissioner has, in fact, said that he has been talking potatoes for a long time but is in a position to come up with nothing. I have to say that that is a most unsatisfactory reply. He did not tell the House that nothing has been done by the Commission since Document 512 of 1976 was approved by this Parliament on 15 September 1976 \u2014 six years ago. He did say that he has difficulty in get ting a decision from the committee, but he has not gone out of his way to say why the Commission has not been in a position to modify its proposals, as it has done on numerous occasions in the past with regard to other areas of agriculture. Can the Commission not introduce a modified proposal in order to enable the Council to come to some kind of conclusion \u2014 a satis factory one, one hopes \u2014 on potato regulations? Furthermore, will the Commission now give an under taking that such a modified proposal will be forthcom ing and that it will report to this Parliament by, say, next part-session with a timetable for such a modified proposal? Can the Commissioner make any promise of that nature with a view to making progress regarding potatoes? Mr Dalsager. \u2014 (DA) I cannot give any such promise. The truth is that the Member States do not want any organization of the potato market, so we have not got one. The Commission has done all it could over the years. Parliament has done its duty. The Member States have at no time been prepared to adopt mea sures to regulate the potato market and, while we remain in that situation, we shall be forced to accept that we can do no more, until there is a greater degree of will in the Member States to enter into serious dis cussions on the proposal which has been on the Coun cil table for many years. Mr J. D. Taylor. \u2014 Is the Commissioner aware of the potential danger to seed-potato producers in both the Netherlands and Northern Ireland, as a result of the recent refusal of the Southern Irish authorities to accept potatoes from Cyprus, in contravention of the Community's Association Agreement with Cyprus? Will the Commissioner investigate this matter urgently and, where necessary, make representations to the Southern Irish authorities to ensure that our Associa tion Agreement with Cyprus is fulfilled? Mr Dalsager. \u2014 (DA) The Commission is aware of all the problems surrounding seed potatoes, new potatoes and ordinary potatoes. Time and again, the Commis sion has been in a situation in which, because of the absence of a market organization for potatoes, it has been impossible to \u2014 shall .we say \u2014 manage this mar ket in the most effective and satisfactory way. The Commission greatly regrets this. We hope that the Member States will quickly achieve a result in their deliberations, so that it will be possible to achieve a real market organization for potatoes which, of course, are a farm product like all other farm products in this Community. Mr Clinton. \u2014 No doubt the Commissioner is aware that ten years ago the question of a common organ ization of the market in potatoes was being actively pushed by certain Member States. I would ask the Commissioner, is it right to say that in fact the main opposition to a common organization of the market in potatoes is coming from two Member States who have the European market in potatoes to themselves, and for that reason do not want to see a common organ ization of the market in potatoes? Would he indicate the Member States that are really opposing a common organization, and would he also tell Mr Taylor that ",
        "15.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/95 Clinton the only solution to his problem is to remove the bor der? (Cries of'Hear, Hear!') President. \u2014 Commissioner Dalsager, I think the last part of the question .is irrelevant to the basic question. (Laughter) Mr Dalsager. \u2014 (DA) I do not think I am under any obligation here in Question Time to answer the last question, which has been put by a former President of the Council and who very well knows the answer to the question. Mr Clinton, who was a member of the Council for a long time and who knows all the answers to his questions, should not put me into a pos ition in which I am to say which countries are not pre pared to adopt the measures for the regulation of the potato market, which have been on the Council table for so long. Mr Newton Dunn. \u2014 If the Commissioner is unwill ing to say which Member States are holding it up, will he at least explain to us what are the principal objec tions which thev have? Mr Dalsager. \u2014 (DA) The measures to regulate the potato market were put before Parliament and the Council many years ago. I do not think the time is right to discuss the technical details of a proposal which we should all be familiar with. If there is a wish to discuss this proposal once more in Parliament, the Commission is of course willing to do so, but I do not think that Question Time is the right forum of discus sion. President. \u2014 As the author is not present, Question No 6 will be answered in writing. Question No 7, by Mr Flanagan (H-107/82): What action can the Commission undertake for the workforce in the North of Ireland in view of the unprecedented loss of 1 150 jobs in the British Enkalon factory in Antrim, the loss of 1 100 jobs at the De Lorean car factory (both in the month of March) and the possible loss of a further 2 500 jobs at the Harland and Wolf shipyard in Belfast? Mr Giolitti, Member of the Commission. \u2014 (IT) As Parliament is aware, the Commission is giving the greatest attention to the serious economic and social problems of Northern Ireland, among them those mentioned as examples by the honourable Member. The Commission is dedicating all the means at its dis posal to the improvement of this situation, particularly through contributing to the creation and preservation of jobs, which is after all still the principal objective. The European Social Fund provides, for Northern Ire land, for intervention rates which have been increased by 10%. Furthermore, at the beginning of 1982 the Commission approved a pilot programme relative to a new type of training and development at Carrickfer- gus, intending to create new jobs through training and consultation activities in small and medium-sized com panies. In addition to the aid granted from the 'quota' section of the Regional Fund, in 1982 specific actions for regional development were adopted in the framework of the so-called 'non-quota' section. These measures are of great significance for the improvement of economic and social conditions in the frontier zones between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ire land. Also in preparation is a so-called 'integrated operation' in favour of Belfast. In this context, in No vember of 1981, the Commission proposed to the Council a specific measure in favour of this region. This measure as well should have a positive effect on employment. The European Investment Bank, for its part, is acting in Northern Ireland through the granting of loans, particularly for the financing of investments that have positive effects on the employment situation. Similarly, the New Community Instrument, with its endowment of a billion ECU, permits the granting of loans in favour of projects for productive investments by small and medium-sized undertakings in that region. Furthermore, a whole series of measures was adopted by the Guidance Section of the Agricultural Fund in favour of Northern Ireland. It should also be remembered that, in the application of the so-called 'supplementary measures' in favour of the United Kingdom, adopted on 27 October 1980, a ~ y part of the financial contribution was earmarked for the funding of programmes in Northern Ireland. Finally, I should mention that the Commission, besides the 'aid for readaptation' provided for in the ECSC Treaty, has no other possibilities for direct aid to workers who have been dismissed. Mr J. D. Taylor. \u2014 Could the Commissioner say when the Commission will be in a position to respond to Parliament's request of June last year that the Com mission should examine the effect of Community membership on Northern Ireland and how the Com munity could further assist Northern Ireland? Mr Giolitti. \u2014 (IT) I believed I had already answered that question. I furnished a list of the measures that the Commission has not only proposed, but also set in ",
        "No 1-286/96 Debates of the European Parliament 15.6.82 Giolitti operation for Northern Ireland. The list could be more detailed, but the time at my disposal obliged me to summarize the information I gave Parliament in response to the last question raised by the honourable Member. Mrs Boot. \u2014 (NL) As there is a list of the measures taken by the Commission, I should like to ask the Commissioner what decision was actually taken in the Council to enable the measures that have been taken this year, because the Fund regulation expired on 1 January and we have not received a replacement proposal from you yet. Mr Giolitti. \u2014 (IT) I must say that I don't understand which Fund you are referring to. If you are referring to the Regional Fund, then the Commssion, \u00e0s you know, has presented proposals for the modification of the regulation governing the Fund itself. These proposals as well certainly favour Northern Ire land, because they provide for a concentration of resources, distributed in quotas, in the most disadvan taged regions, among which Northern Ireland is also included. The Commission's proposals are now before the Council. Parliament has discussed this matter recently, giving the proposals themselves its full support. Mr Hume. \u2014 Could I say to the Commissioner that there is widespread appreciation within Northern Ire land of the Commission's sympathy and interest in the problems, as instanced not only by the actions that you have outlined but also by the fact that so many Com missioners have taken time to come and visit Northern Ireland and see the problem at first hand themselves. Would the Commissioner agree with me that the Commission's job would be a great deal easier if the government authorities in Northern Ireland itself had a regional development programme for tackling the basic and serious economic problems of that region? Mr Giolitti. \u2014 (IT) I am grateful to the honourable Member for mentioning the visits made by members of the Commission. I myself have been to Northern Ire land more than once but, in addition to the physical presence of various Commissioners in Northern Ire land, there are also the interventions and funds pro posed by the Commission and approved by the Coun cil. Certainly, a more intensive effort can be made, which is what we intend to do, but all the measures and interventions of which I have spoken have been agreed \u2014 as laid down in the regulations governing the oper ation of the financial instruments \u2014 among the Com munity institutions and, in particular, between the Commission and its departments and the relevant government authorities, not only at central level but also at the level of the regions. I believe that this type of collaboration can continue successfully. President. \u2014 I think it was clear from the answer the Commissioner gave to Mrs Boot that he did not quite understand the question and the way she put it. I would therefore ask her put her question again refer ring to the Fund on which she wished to put a ques tion. Mrs Boot. \u2014 (NL) I shall try to put it as clearly as possible. The Commissioner says that we have a whole list of measures taken this year. I would like to know what Council decision has formed the basis for the measures that have been taken this year, because the Fund regulation expired on 1 January of this year and, to my knowledge, there has not been an extension for this year. Mr Giolitti. \u2014 (IT) There has evidently been a misun derstanding. The Regional Fund will not be discontin ued. It is the regulation for the Fund which is subject to revision. The Commission has submitted the perti nent modifications to the Council. Until the Council has made a decision, the preceding regulation remains in force. Therefore, the Regional Fund carries on its entire activity on the basis of the regulation which has not yet been modified, since \u2014 I repeat \u2014 only the Commission's proposals as yet exist. For now, the absence of a decision by the Council on this matter has no influence on the regular functioning of the Fund. Mr McCartin. \u2014 Bearing in mind the crushing unem ployment and economic problems that Northern Ire land has at this moment and at the same time that that region has had over a period of years the best package of regional aids and incentives that was available in all Europe, will the Commission undertake to do a study of how assistance from the European Community has been integrated with assistance already there to ascer tain to what extent assistance given by the Community is replacing rather than additional to the incentives and assistances that were there before? Mr Giolitti. \u2014 (IT) The Commission regularly pro vides information concerning the functioning of the various financial instruments in its annual reports on the different funds, reports which are also presented to Parliament. These reports contain items of informa tion which are geographically differentiated in relation to the various regions where different instruments are used, particularly in regard to the Regional Fund. Special attention is given to particularly disadvantaged regions among which, as I said, Ireland is included, in view of the seriousness of the problems there. Mr Seligman. \u2014 On a point of order, Madame Presi dent. This is the second time that the Commissioner ",
        "15.6. 82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/97 Seligman for energy has not been present for Question Time, and I wonder whether the President would consider grouping questions by subject and being sure that the relevant Commissioner is present. In the meantime, could I withdraw my question until he is present because the supplementaries really lose any point? President. \u2014 You may of course withdraw your ques tion at any time, Mr Seligman, and I will call Commis sioner Tugendhat who wishes to make a comment on this. Mr Tugendhat, Vice-President of the Commission. \u2014 I know the feelings of the House, when Commissioners are unavoidably absent, but I am afraid that at the moment Mr Davignon is in China and it would have been impossible for him to have returned for Question Time. (Laughter) President. \u2014 Thank you very much, Commissioner, for that explanation. I am sure Mr Seligman will agree that it would be an excessive amount of Community funds. (Laughter) We will put this question on to next time and hope that possibly the relevant Commissioner will be here. Question No 9, by Mr Purvis (H-860/81) What Community action is being taken to provide work permits and social-security support for Pol ish nationals stranded in Member States because of imposition of martial law in Poland? Mr Richard, Member of the Commission. \u2014 The Com mission understands the difficulties which may be faced by Polish nationals stranded in Member States because of the imposition of martial law in their coun try. Providing social security benefits and issuing work permits, however, are 'matters entirely for the author ities of the Member States concerned. Their national legislation applies. The Treaty of Rome, indeed, con tains no provisions on which Community action in this area could be founded. The Commisson is glad to see however that some Member States \u2014 France, the Fed eral Republic of Germany and Belgium \u2014 have already taken special measures in favour of Polish refugees following the imposition of martial law in Poland. Mr Purvis. \u2014 The Commissioner is right that there is no particular basis for Community action by the Com mission but I feel that in view of the pathetic state of many of these people \u2014 some I have come across are litterally destitute and now wondering what on earth they are going to do \u2014 would it not be just nice ges ture on the part of the Commission to bring it up at a meeting with the Member States to see if they could not concert action so that work permits and social security could be provided to these (effectively) refu gees while they are stranded in the Community? It would hardly cost that much and would be a very wel come gesture, I would have thought, by all the citizens of the Community. Mr Richard. \u2014 The short answer to the honourable gentleman's question is yes. I think it would be worth bringing it to the attention of Member States and I am sure, indeed, that the fact that this question has been asked and the fact that I am answering it in this way will indeed bring it to their attention. President. \u2014 Since they deal with the same subject, I call Question No 10, which was tabled by Mr Pran- ch\u00e8re but has been taken over by Mr Martin (H-8/ 82): Can the Commission state whether the UK's net contribution to the Community budget in 1980 and 1981 will be smaller than provided for by the agreement of 30 May? Is the Commission resolved to ask the Council to remedy this situation and, if so, what remedies does it propose? and Question No 17, by Mr Clinton (H-l 12/82): Having regard to Annexe II to Council Regula tion 2 744 of 27 October 1980, on what basis did the Commission estimate that the net UK contri bution to the Community budget would be 1 784 million EUA for 1980 and 2 140 million EUA for 1981? When were these estimates made? What was the actual net UK contribution in respect of these years? What is the difference between the estimated and actual contribution in respect of each year, and what are the reasons for the differ ence, if any, in each case? Mr Tugendhat, Vice-President of the Commission. \u2014 For the reasons explained in the reply to Written Question No 1427/81 by Mr Schieler the net contri bution of the United Kingdom in 1980 and 1981 will be lower than the figures of May 30 1980. According to the most recent estimates the difference is around 270 million ECU for 1980 and some 720 million ECU for 1981. The text adopted by the Council on 30 May 1980 contains specific provisions for dealing with an increase in the British net contribution but not for a decrease. On 25 May 1982, after these questions were tabled, of course, the Ministers for Foreign Affairs agreed that corrections to be made for 1980 and 1981 in the light of the actual figures would be taken into account when negotiating the subsequent solution. ",
        "No 1-286/98 Debates of the European Parliament 15.6.82 Mr Martin. \u2014 (FR) Can the Commission give details of its proposals for the distribution between the Mem ber States of the compensation to the United Kingdom in respect of its budgetary contribution amounting to 850 million ECU in 1982, and how does the Council view these proposals? Mr Tugendhat. \u2014 At this stage I cannot do that because these matters are still being considered. The outlines of the agreement on May 25 are, of course, clear but the precise details have yet to be worked out and I hope that we are able to bring the negotiations to a successful conclusion at the council which will take place next week. Miss Quin. \u2014 As I read Mr Pranch\u00e8re's question, it seemed to me that the idea behind it was that it would somehow be shocking if the United Kingdom were to pay less as a contribution to the Community budget than had been envisaged. Does the Commissioner not agree with me that. Britain, as a State with a lower average level of prosperity in the EEC, should be in a position to benefit from, rather than be penalized by, the Common Market .budget? Perhaps the socialist principle 'from each according to his means, to each according to his needs' should be applied to EEC budgetary questions. (Laughter) Mr Tugendhat. \u2014 The Commission has throughout, I think, made clear that it believes that the way to tackle the Community's budgetary problems is by developing a fuller and more complete range of Community poli cies in order that the flows of funds from those poli cies may reflect more closely the needs not just of the Member States but of the Community as a whole and, of course, of individuals and regions within the Com munity. It is the way in which this matter has been looked at in exclusively national terms \u2014 on all sides of the argument, I hasten to add, and indeed in many quarters of this House \u2014 which has created the diffi culties. If we could think of developing the Com munity further, it might be possible to deal with this sort of problem a great deal more easily. Mr Rogalla. \u2014 (DE) The Vice-President's last answer makes it easier for me to so formulate the question that it goes beyond the purely British aspect. Apart from national considerations there are other than financial considerations in the evaluation of the Com munity budget. My question to the Commission is therefore as fol lows: have they yet considered the pros and cons of EEC membership for each Member State unconnected with the budget, is there any study in progress or has any relevant specialist institute in Europe been entrusted with such a study in which in addition to budgetary aspects all other political and economic aspects, advantages and disadvantages for each Mem ber State, arising out of Community membership, have been examined? Mr Tugendhat. \u2014 It is a pleasure to answer a question from Mr Rogalla, whom I used to know well in a dif ferent capacity. I am glad, too, that he has drawn attention to the fact that the benefits of Community membership cannot, of course, be measured purely in budgetary terms. Indeed, the budget is a small part of the whole picture, and important as it is, it needs to be understood that it is a small part. I can assure him that the wider issues to which he has drawn attention are very much on our minds, and indeed I spend a great deal of time travelling round the United Kingdom trying to drawn the attention of my compatriots of all parties and of none to the wider issues that are involved and to the wider considerations that ought to be taken into account. Mr Welsh. \u2014 I am sure that everyone would wish to pay tribute to Mr Tugendhat's determined efforts to get that point through to the United Kingdom. Does the Commission have any idea of what its time table will be for submitting its proposals to the Council for the follow-up to the settlement that has recently taken place, and would he agree with me that it is of the utmost urgency and importance that these matters are concluded in a satisfactory way as soon as possi ble? Mr Tugendhat. \u2014 The answer to the first part of the question was specified in the agreement itself \u2014 that is to say, November; and the answer to the second part of the question is yes. President. 136/82): 1 Question No 11, by Mr Simmonds (H- Having regard to Document COM (82) 24 final, Annex 7, page 4, in view of the Commission's interest in the rational use of energy, in the light of recent progress in the development of alterna tive lighting and heating controls using micro processors, and wishing to give greater publicity to this recommendation, will the Commission make proposals encouraging the Member States to offer tax incentives for the installation of such equipment and to exclude them from value-added tax? Mr Tugendhat, Vice-President of the Commission. \u2014 The Commission reaffirms the importance that it Former oral question without debate (0-5/82), converted into a question for Question Time. ",
        "15.6. 82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/99 Tugendhat attaches to all measures encouraging the rational use of energy and especially to those mentioned by the honourahle Member with respect to new electronic control systems for heating and lighting. The Commission recalls that in the draft recommenda tion attached to Doc. COM (82) 24, to which the honourable Member refers and which is at present being considered by the Council, the Commission made proposals for a series of administrative, tech nical, financial and fiscal measures to encourage investment in URE. One of these recommendations is that Member States should examine the possibility of using the lowest VAT rate in force in order to encourage consumers to purchase energy-efficient plant and equipment. This proposal is in line with the concerns expressed by the honourable Member. On VAT, the Commission considers that the applica tion of reduced rates is desirable in certain defined cases. However, the Commission also takes the view that the fundamental concept of VAT as a general tax on consumption is incompatible with the proliferation of sectoral exemptions, which would seriously impair the transparency of the tax structure and could not fail to give rise to demands for their extension to other sectors of the economy which are equally deserving of special attention. One of the objectives of the common VAT system is, in short, to avoid as far as possible all fiscal discrimina tion. It follows that an exemption in favour of energy-saving equipment would be necessarily discri minatory and could give rise to delicate technical problems. This policy on VAT exemption has been stated on sev eral occasions by the Commission, especially in replies to written and oral questions by Mrs Ewing and Mr Price. Mr Simmonds. \u2014 Will the Commissioner accept my apologies and my disassociation from some of the wording of my question? I think it has been translated through the six official languages and back again before it has go into this text. (Laughter) Further, will the Commissioner accept my assurance, that this is the nicest answer and the nicest way of say ing no that I have ever had to a question that I have tabled? But will the Commissioner further recognize that taxation is actually a direct disincentive to people to invest in energy-saving devices and therefore other incentives to encourage people to invest in them are in effect being nullified by his answer today? Mr Tugendhat. \u2014 I am grateful to the honourable Member for his kind words. I should also, in answer to the previous question, have thanked Mr Welsh for his, and I do so gladly now. I take the point which the honourable Member has made. As the Commissioner responsible for taxation, if not for energy, I would emphasize the point I made before, that VAT is supposed to be a general tax; there are a great many meritorious investments and other schemes deserving of support, and if one tried to oper ate through derogations from VAT one would make nonsense of the VAT itself. The Commission is, how ever, aware of the problems to which he drew atten tion and we have in fact analysed the obstacles that hinder the different Member States in adequately car rying out investments in the field of the rational use of energy. In Doc COM (82) 24 and in the tax recom mendation, we propose a series of national measures which, we believe, could help to overcome the difficul ties encountered. I would also like to point out that the Commission will be submitting to the Council in the near, future a pro posal for a decision authorizing a grant under the gen eral budget of the Community of supplementary incentives for Community loans accorded to four cate gories of investment in the field specifically mentioned in the question. These are the production of district heat from thermal industrial waste and solid residual fuels, the conversion to coal of combustion installa tions in industry using fuel-oil, the preparational oper ations from imported coal, and the use of urban, agri cultural and industrial waste. Loans concerning these investment categories could benefit from interest rate bonuses to the order of three financial points though the general financial budget, which is, of course, an additional form of assistance. Mrs Ewing. \u2014 Could I ask the Commissioner if he could for the moment ignore the part of the question about exclusion from VAT and look at the other part which was a suggestion that the Commission would make proposals to encourage Member States to offer tax incentives? Could I also ask him to look, as I did last week, at the windmill situation in Denmark where windmill owners can own an asset which is at the same time plugged into the grid \u2014 if as a layman I can use inexact language \u2014 to their own advantage so that they can end by doing what everyone wants to do: to use alternative energy? Could those of us with windy places who look with envy on Denmark, ask the Com mission whether he has any sympathy for the Danish Government's internal tax incentives so that we might in a treeless land end up with a forest of windmills? Mr Tugendhat. \u2014 I must say that as Question Time progresses I begin to feel that the interpreters might almost be sent home as it appears to be such an exclu sively anglophone activity. (Interruption by Mrs Ewing) ",
        "No 1-286/100 Debates of the European Parliament 15.6.82 Tugendhat I think 'anglophone'... I mean 'anglophone' are peo ple who speak English which I think is the language we are exchanging our remarks in at the moment. (Laughter) But, seriously, I think the points which the honourable Member has raised are certainly deserving of study. The questions of alternative energy in particular \u2014 such things as windmills and the sun and so forth \u2014 have received an increasing amount of attention in recent years. It must of course be remembered that their applicabil ity varies very considerably depending on the geogra phy and other physical characteristics of the areas in question and I am not quite sure whether what is applicable to Denmark in these circumstances would necessarily be applicable in the islands from which both of us come. However I will certainly convey her points to my colleagues. Mr Price. \u2014 In his original reply, the Commissioner seemed to acknowledge the value of this kind of sys tem in conserving energy. Can I ask him a question rather nearer his own portfolio as a result, whether the Commission themselves employ computer-controlled systems on their own buildings to conserve energy and reduce costs and, if not, whether they will be taking steps in this direction? Mr Tugendhat. \u2014 I must confess that I do not know precisely how the energy consumption of the Commis sion buildings is controlled, though I do recall that when we looked into this matter after the energy crisis in the late 1970s we were able at that time to reduce our electricity consumption by 25% and as the hon ourable Member will discover if he comes into the Commission buildings on Saturdays, even though a number of people work at those times, the heating is turned down, as it is indeed over the rest of the week end. President. \u2014 As the author is not present, Question No 12 will be answered in writing. Question No 13, by Mr Radoux (H-56/82): Subject: Resolutions tabled at Parliament's July 1981 part-session on the improvement of inter-institutional relations and their operation Will the Commission say what progress has been made on this matter, having regard to the fact that an answer should have been given by 31 Decem ber 1981? because it implies that the Commission has done nothing and has not reacted to what was said in Par liament since it adopted its resolutions. May I begin by pointing out that the Commission sub mitted to Parliament in October of last year a report which refers explicitly to the resolutions adopted by the Assembly and announces a number of practical proposals. May I also point out that I myself announced to the Assembly in December 1981 that the Commission would be putting forward a proposal for the improvement and extension of the conciliation procedure in the legislative area, and may I also say that, after this Parliament had adopted the Blumenfeld resolution, the Commission did forward a proposal to you some time ago \u2014 I think it was on 27 May \u2014 relating to an extension of concilation with respect to the conclusion of international agreements. We are somewhat surprised that Parliament has evi dently not yet found an opportunity to discuss these proposals. Mr Radoux. \u2014 (FR) Thank you, Commissioner, I do not wish to put a supplementary question. But I am no longer surprised now. President. \u2014 (H-156/82): 1 Question No 14, by Mr Enright 1. Is the Commission aware of the inadequacy of medical care facilities at European holiday resorts and that this constitutes grave risk to holidaymakers? 2. Is the Commission aware that where there may be many hotels but few and inadequate hospitals and clinics, it is common practice in cases of accident on holiday to repatriate the patient (at their own expense) before giving adequate treatment? 3. Is the Commission aware that there have been emergency cases in which this practice has led to unnecessary loss of life and serious perma nent injury? 4. Does the Commission know that harmonized Community social security services are not functioning in practice, and that patients are not always completely covered and may even have to pay much more for medicinal treat ment than in their own Member State? 5. Given that the Commission expresses concern about the need for Community action on environmental health and pollution problems at holiday resorts, what action is it proposing to take about the totally inadequate medical Mr Andriessen, Member of the Commission. \u2014 (NL) I must say that I am rather surprised by this question 1 Former oral question without debate (0-22/82), convened into a question for Question Time. ",
        "15.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/101 President care facilities available to European holiday- makers? Mr Richard, Member of the Commission. \u2014The hon ourable gentleman's question falls into five parts. As to parts 1, 2, 3 and 5, I have to tell him that the organization of health services and the establishment of medical care facilities are the responsibility of the national authorities and not the Commission. As far as part 4 of the question is concerned, Com munity regulations on social security for migrant workers did not set up a particular scheme harmoniz ing national legislations on social security but are con fined to the coordination of this legislation. Under the provisions of Community regulations, peo ple such as holidaymakers who are staying on the ter ritory of a Member State may receive benefits in kind, medical treatment, hospital services, drugs and medi cines, etc. in cases where there is an urgent need for such services as if they were insured under the social security legislation of the Member State in which they are staying. The sole condition being that they are entitled to the sickness insurance benefits of the Mem ber State in which they are resident, which I hope so far the honourable gentleman will agree is fair enough. They must submit the appropriate certificate, which I am told is Form E 111, to the institution of the place in which they are staying. Now, for this purpose, they should obtain the certificate before their departure from their country of residence. The Commission dis seminates this information as widely as possible in the form of press releases, circulated before the holiday season. I am therefore grateful to have the opportunity this afternoon to repeat this procedure. It is our view that the above mentioned provisions are on the whole properly applied and with reasonably satisfactory results. Where persons requiring medical services find they are paying more than necessary, in the Commission's experience it is usually because they do not go to the establishments or the doctors covered by contracts with the social security institutions. Mr Enright. \u2014 The Commissioner must surely be aware that he will have caused very severe disappoint ment by his reply to parts 1, 2, 3 and 5 of the question quite simply because the Commission appears able to pontificate on what colour water should be in resorts but not on how much medical provision there should be in a resort for it to be a holiday resort. That is within the competence of the Community. Will the Commissioner therefore please assure us that he will address himself to this problem, use his well-known Welsh ingenuity and come up with a reply which will be convincing to the ordinary members of the Com munity who judge the Community by this sort of non sense. Mr Richard. \u2014 I am sorry Mr Enright thinks that this is nonsense. I can only say that I thought his supple mentary was somewhat intemperate. No doubt when he has considered the matter, he would like to re-phrase it. I have to say this to him. It is not a question of sympa thy. It is a question of competence. If the Commission does not have competence in a certain matter then there is very little that we can do about it. With great respect, the type of remark that Mr Enright has made this afternoon would not serve to give the Commission competence in the area in which the Member States have not been prepared to give us competence and in which we at the moment do not have it. Having said all that, I am prepared to have a look at it and see if I can find a bit of competence somewhere which may help Mr Enright's constituents. Sir David Nicolson. \u2014 I must ask a supplementary question on this matter. I first raised it in January this year after a most dreadful accident to one of my con stituents and following a large number of letters from other sufferers indicating a terrific muddle and inade quacy in facilities when accidents occur in some areas. I have not really felt there has been a positive reply to the questions which I put down. I want to ask the Commission if they are aware that, because of the explosion of cheap air travel and tourist traffic which we experience today, we are facing a new situation and we must recognize this. If our member countries want the benefits of this huge tourist trade, then they must organize themselves adequately in terms of tour ist information, insurance and services. Some of the people who are suffering from accidents do not know how to go about getting repatriated after an accident. It may involve an air ambulance. Well here we are with the holiday season on us again. Must we expect a further series of terrible accident cases and muddles and inadequate facilities? Or is the Commis sion going to study this subject seriously now and see if some action can be taken soon? Mr Richard. \u2014 I am bound to say I really do not think that will do. As far as the Commission is concerned, we have gone as far as we can within the competence that we have and we are now in the situation where, if somebody goes abroad and he gets \u2014 as we say he should do and as everybody else says he should do \u2014 the appropriate form before he goes, showing that he is entitled to medical benefits in the country where he resides, then if there is an urgent need for hospital treatment in the country to which he is going, he is entitled to get it. Now, I am quite prepared to look at this again, but it would be quite wrong of me, frankly, to hold out any great hope for the Parliament or to the honourable gentleman who asked the supplementaries that there is ",

In the Commission's view there is not. mission decided to pursue the infringement proce dures. The legal opinions are now being drafted. President. \u2014 I think we cannot pursue this question any further now. (Mr Sherlock asked to speak) Mr Sherlock, I would like to point out that for some time now we have been following the procedure, which seems to have been accepted by all groups in this Parliament, of taking one member of the same nationality of the same group. I have done that as far as your group is concerned. If at any stage later on Members of this Parliament as a whole wish this pro cedure to be changed, we can of course do so. For the time being this has been accepted as a reasonable way of dealing with Question Time. Mr Sherlock. \u2014 Madam President, on a particular point of order. No one has yet acknowledged that my committee, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, has embarked upon some measures which could well embrace some of the topics which Sir David Nicolson, the Commissioner and Mr Enright have dealt with so faithfully and so well. I think that the fact that the committee has already taken the decision to appoint a rapporteur is something that the House should be informed of. President. \u2014 Thank you, Mr Sherlock, for that very interesting and very informative point of order. Question No 15, by Miss Hooper (H-66/82): The Commission has recently written to Member States expressing the opinion that in certain cir cumstances customs duty should be charged on goods of third country origin which are purchased by travellers who are making journeys to and from Community countries; in view of the widespread interest in this subject, will the Commission state what developments have taken place in this re spect? Mr Tugendhat, Vice-President of the Commission. \u2014 In its letter of 2 February 1982, the Commission asked the Member States to charge, from the 31 March 1982 at the latest, the customs duties and agricultural levies on products imported from third countries, sold in tax-free shops to persons travelling solely within the Community. The obligation to charge such customs duties and levies derives implicitly from the Court of Justice's judgment in the 'butterships' case. No action having been taken in response to the Com mission's request, it initiated infringement procedures against all the Member States. On 28 April the Corn- Miss Hooper. \u2014 I should like to thank the Commis sioner for his reply, but there does in fact seem to be a great deal of doubt and conjecture about this parti cular issue. In view of this, may I ask him if the ori ginal letter written by Commissioner Narjes to the Member States has actually been published so that people who are interested, which includes not only producers of duty-free goods but travel operators, air port operators as well as the travelling public, can be in no doubt as to the points that the Commissioner was pursuing. Indeed would the Commissioner be pre pared to say that the Commission is not in fact going to further interpret the decision to which he refers, which seems to be the cause of many of the problems? Mr Tugendhat. \u2014 I am very grateful to the honour able Member for her supplementary because she is quite right, there does seem to be a certain amount of uncertainty on this score and I am delighted to have a further opportunity, and I emphasize the word fur ther, to try to dispel it. The Commission has no inten tion whatsoever of further interpreting this judgment. We were obliged to act as we did because of the deci sion by the Court; we certainly do not wish to move any further than we have done. I myself have made a number of speeches in the United Kingdom pointing out that the overwhelming bulk of sales in duty-free shops, made up of goods of Community origin \u2014 whisky, brandy, gin, for instance \u2014 perfume, cigar ettes, etc. \u2014 all things made in the Community, are quite unaffected by this judgment and I have done everything possible, and I am sure that my colleagues have done the same, to draw the attention of the gen eral public to the fact that duty-free shopping will con tinue really pretty much unaffected by what has hap pened. Obviously if you want to buy a Japanese watch or something like Russian caviar, the price may be altered although the profit margins in these shops are so enormous that they could affort to shave them a lit tle. But all the things that are actually produced in the Community are unaffected by it. I only wish that the press in our own country as well as in others would devote as much attention to the kind of assurance that I am giving now as they have to some of the scare stories that have been put round and I only wish that the operators of the duty-free shops and the people who run the airports and the ports and the ferries and everything else would stop spreading alarm and despondency. We have given every sort of assurance that we can and I am doing so here and I have done so elsewhere and I am sure my colleague has as well. I am grateful to the honourable Member for giving me the opportunity to repeat what I have said before which will, I hope, bring solace to all those people who are going to the holiday resorts which Mr Enright mentioned a few moments ago.

        "15.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/103 President. \u2014 Question No 16, by Mr McCartin (H-lll/82): Land improvement grants of up to 70% of total costs are provided for in Regulation 1820/80. Is the Commission aware that, because of the method used by the Irish authorities in arriving at total costs, the grants actually paid often represent only half the grant level, and can the Commission take any action to rectify the position? Mr Dalsager, Member of the Commission. \u2014 (DA) Article 21 (2) of Council Regulation No 1820/ 80 on the promotion of agricultural development in the less-favoured areas of Western Ireland states only that support for land improvement pursuant to the Regulation may not exceed 70% of the cost of the measures in question. The detailed administrative provisions are the responsibility of the Member State concerned. Mr McCartin. \u2014 Can the Commission state when they sanctioned this scheme whether the Irish Govern ment in fact indicated to them the particular percen tage grant which they would be paying? Would it accept that the costing is two years old, or is it the cost of doing the job at the present time? Does the Com mission consider that this scheme is part of one of the instruments by which the European Community wishes to assist in underdeveloped regions, that this scheme is closely identified with the European Com munity, that the 70% which is being paid is not a per centage but an arbitrary figure fixed two years ago which is bringing a Community scheme into disrepute? Will the Minister consult with the Irish Government about the administration of this scheme and ask for clarification? Mr Dalsager. \u2014 (DA) The position with arrange ments of that kind is that the Member States must of course administer under their own responsibility vis- \u00e0-vis the Communities the rules adopted as Com munity regulations. I do not know whether the ques tioner wants us to change the degree to which these rules are administered by the national governments. We are of course doing this to a certain extent, but not radically. If there is anyone who has any complaint regarding the implementation of the regulations in Western Ireland, the Commission will of course look into the matter. I have not previously been aware of any complaints on the administration of these regula tions and I have not had an opportunity to ask my department about the matter. If there are such com plaints, obviously we shall take them up but, on the other hand, the regulation, in the form in which it was adopted, is an outline regulation under which the Irish government may provide aid which need not necessar ily be 70%. President. \u2014 Questions Nos 18 and 19 have been postponed until the next part-session. Question No 20 by Mr Dalziel (H-126/82): In view of the dissatisfaction felt by many individ ual householders in Scotland who have received inadequate compensation which does not fully take account of the severe damage done to their properties and their consequent hardship, will the Commission reconsider prior to the coming winter the manner of determining the amount of Com munity aid to householders affected by severe winter weather in order to give more satisfactory and just results? Mr Giolitti, Member of the Commission. \u2014 (IT) When on 22 January of this year the Commission decided to grant emergency aid to the amount of 1 250 000 ECUs in favour of the British people seriously affected by bad weather conditions between the end of 1981 and the 1982, it took as a basis, as is its custom, the esti mates available immediately after the disaster. Since emergency Community aid essentially constitutes an immediate and gratuitous demonstration of solidarity from the other peoples of the Community towards those stricken by disaster, the Commission cannot re open the discussion on the considerations which led to this decision. Mr Dalziel. \u2014 That is a slightly unsatisfactory answer. What I actually asked the Commissioner was whether he could see any ways in which they could reconsider how they actually arrive at the total allocation of funds and I would be grateful if the Commissioner could perhaps respond to that particular part of my question. Mr Giolitti. \u2014 (IT) The Commission has already replied that it cannot reconsider the question, because in this case as well we have followed the rules and cus toms which are usually applied in similar cases. Mr Beazley. \u2014 Might I ask the Commissioner if he is aware that the sums of money that it was possible to distribute in the form of aid during the winter were in fact so small that they caused not only difficulties for the fortunate recipients of that aid but very considera ble concern in those other parts of the country, includ ing that which I have the honour to represent, Bedfor- shire, which received nothing at all? My question therefore is, is the Commissioner satisfied that this form of distributing aid is really best continued in the form that it was; can more sums of money be made available or can they be distributed more equitably? Mr Giolitti. \u2014 (IT) I do not believe that the condi tions on the basis of which this aid was distributed can be considered unfair, and therefore I do not believe that the rules governing the distribution should be reviewed. ",
        "No 1-286/104 Debates of the European Parliament 15.6.82 Giolitti As for the total amount of this aid, it is certainly insuf ficient, especially to the extent that it has to do with particularly serious episodes. There is no doubt that the total amount of resources does not correspond to the needs, as is nearly always the case in circumstances of this nature. I undertake to call the Commission's attention to the question that has now been raised in Parliament, so that the amounts may better corre spond to the needs they are to meet. I call Mr Bournias. Mr Bournias. \u2014 (GR) Madam President, I ask that Question No 24 by Mr Gondikas should be held over until the next part-session. It relates to an ethical mat ter and as such we should have an opportunity to dis cuss it in this House. President. \u2014 The first part of Question Time is closed. 1 I think the House would wish me to acknowledge that we have had six Members of the Commission here this evening to answer our questions.

Mrs Gredal. \u2014 (DA) I rise on a point of order con cerning the report we debated on Monday on relations between the USA and the European Parliament. Because of a technical error on the part of Parlia ment's administration, the amendments approved by the Political Affairs Committee do not appear in the final edition of the report, and I would therefore ask the President to take steps to ensure that the final edi tion appears in the version approved by the Political Affairs Committee. It is the explanatory statement which is involved and not the resolution itself. The definitive explanatory statement was sent to the appro priate department of Parliament as early as 28 May, and the changes to be made concern pages 10, 11 and 12 of the report. I would ask you to ensure that these changes are made. President. \u2014 Mrs Gredal, your remarks have been noted, and the Minutes will be corrected accordingly. I call Mr Griffiths. Mr Griffiths. \u2014 Mr President, during yesterday's pro ceedings Mr Moreland brought up the question of a motion for a resolution to wind up a debate on an oral question. It says in the Minutes that Mr Moreland spoke but it says nothing at all about th\u00e9 ruling by the President. The President, on the basis of an interpreta tion of Rule 42 of the Rules of Procedure given by the Committee on the Rules of Procedure and Petitions on 5 May 1981, ruled that there could be no resolu tion to wind up the oral question with debate because it was included for debate with a report on the agenda of the Parliament for this week. Now that report deals with the nuclear aspects of an energy strategy for the Community whereas the oral question is on contracts to import coal from third countries. Now there is no way that amendments can be put down to the report on the nuclear aspects of energy strategy relating to an oral question concerning the import of coal from third countries. I think the President has placed the House in an impossible position. I would rather we had a new ruling which would allow a motion for a resolution to be tabled to wind up the debate on the oral question. President. \u2014 You are right, Mr Griffiths. No-one can table amendments to the report you mentioned. Your remarks have been noted by the House. 1 Mr Griffiths. \u2014 Mr President, I think you have possi bly misunderstood what I was saying. The point I was making about yesterday's ruling of the President was that a report on the nuclear aspects of energy was being coupled with a debate on an oral question about coal imports and that it was impossible to put amend ments about coal imports to a report on a nuclear- energy strategy for the Community. And that there fore the President ought to allow a resolution to be put to wind up the debate on the oral question. I was seeking a ruling about that particular matter. Other wise it will be impossible to put down amendments about coal imports to a report on nuclear-energy strategy. President. \u2014 Mr Griffiths, after consulting the Secre tariat I must inform you that you should have brought 1 Approval of minutes ment) : see Minutes.

        "16.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/107 President this matter up when the subject was raised yesterday. The agenda for today has been established in accord\u00ad ance with Rule 56, and we cannot change it. It is, however, proposed that the deadline for tabling amendments be extended to 6 p.m. this evening. Do you agree to this proposal by the Bureau? I call Mr Moreland. Mr Moreland. \u2014 Mr President, on a point of clarifica\u00ad tion: first of all, if I may say so, in relation to your previous comments, I did in fact raise this matter at the beginning of yesterday's sitting. Can we now take it that there is the right, as in fact the Rules suggest, for us to submit a motion for an early vote to wind up the oral question whith debate? Can we take it that that is now the situation? President. \u2014 Ladies and gentlemen, in accordance with Rule 87 of the Rules of Procedure, I have received from Mr De Pasquale, Chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy and Regional Planning a request for adjournment of the debate on the report (Doc. 1-295/82) by Mr Faure on urban concentration. This report is entered as Item 123 on the agenda for Thursday. I shall consult the House on this request at the start of Thursday's sitting. I call Mr Moreland. Mr Moreland. \u2014 Mr President, this may be a problem of translation, but it would appear to us, certainly in English, that you are giving contradictory answers to the points raised by Mr Griffiths and myself. As far as I can see, if an oral question with debate is tabled and accepted by the Bureau, as in fact happened, and it has not been changed into an oral question for Question Time or an oral question without debate, then there is the right, under the Rules, to submit a resolution for an early vote. I think that is what Mr Griffiths is get\u00ad ting at, and it is what I was trying to get at yesterday; and we would assume that we have the right to do that. President. \u2014 Mr Moreland, your question concerned the debate on the report by Mr Pintat. As I have already told you, all we can do is to extend the dead\u00ad line for tabling amendments to 6 p.m. I call Mr Forth. Mr Forth. \u2014 Mr President, about the announcement you have just made concerning the proposal or request by Mr De Pasquale to postpone dealing with the report from the Committee on Regional Policy and Regional Planning: could you please do us the cour\u00ad tesy of explaining why this is so? I think we are enti\u00ad tled to an explanation as to why something on the agenda has apparently been taken off it. Could we please know? President. \u2014 Mr Forth, I simply announced Mr De Pasquale's request. There was no explanation. The matter will be considered on Thursday morning, when Mr Faure's report was orginally supposed to be debated. I call Mrs Squarcialupi. Mrs Squarcialupi. \u2014 (IT) Mr President, would you kindly state the number and title of the report for which an adjournment has been requested, since the simultaneous interpreting would appear to indicate that this adjournment involves a report on which the Committee on the Environment has still to express its opinion President. \u2014 Gladly. It is Doc. 1-295/82 by Mr Faure. There was obviously a mistake in the interpreting. 1. Hunger in the world President. \u2014 The next item is the joint debate on the report (Doc. 1-281/82) by Mr Michel, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on hunger in the world, and on the following oral ques\u00ad tions : \u03c4- by Mr Pannella and others to the Commission (Doc. 1-257/82): Subject: The Nobel Prize Winners' manifesto and the EEC's contribution to the fight against world hunger Why has the Commission failed to take action on European Parliament Resolution No 1375/81 on the Nobel Prize Winners' manifesto and the EEC's contribution to the fight against world hunger, forwarded to the Community institutions on 9 October 1981? Is the Commission aware that what the Commis\u00ad sion has been asked and has repeatedly failed to do has nothing to do with the activities rightly described by Commissioner Pisani as absurd or harmful, but concerns an emergency plan and an operational funding project which should have been submitted to the Council 30 and 45 days res\u00ad pectively following the adoption of the resolution? Is it further aware that the European Parliament has never asked it to assume sole responsibility for implementing the emergency plan? Does the Commission realize that by acting in this manner it has in fact stood in the way of appro- ",
        "No 1-286/108 Debates of the European Parliament 16. 6. 82 President priate interinstitutional action and by preventing a Council decision in the matter, has obstructed the European Parliament's solemn appeal to save at least 5 million lives, this at a time when the highest representatives of the United Nations and the governments of the ten Member States had, acting with the utmost speed, agreed to the European Parliament's requests by declaring, for example, their readiness to contribute to the funding of the emergency plan? \u2014 by Mr Pannella and others to the Council (Doc. 1-258/82): Subject: The Nobel Prize Winners' manifesto and the EEC's contribution to the fight against world hunger Does not the Council consider that it should urgently request the Commission to provide it with the financial plans and the emergency aid programmes to combat world hunger which the Commission should have submitted to the Council between 9 and 24 November 1981 following European Parliament Resolution No 1-375/81 on the Nobel Prize Winners' manifesto and starva tion? Does not the President of the Council, who was one of the most influential signatories of the reso lution, consider that he should recognize the ear nestness of the stance adopted by the European Parliament and all the Members who signed the resolution by taking such steps as may still prevent starvation in 1982, saving the lives of at least 5 million people otherwise condemned to death by hunger, malnutrition and underdevelopment. \u2014 by Mr G. Fuchs and others to the Commission (Doc. 1-260/82): Subject: Results of EEC food aid Could the Commission give its assessment of the results of the food aid granted by the EEC to date? Would it regard increased efforts along lines identical to those followed in the past as a means of making progress towards its established objec tives, particularly if these efforts were to take the form of a plan with 5 000 m ECU to be spent in twelve months? Has any Member State already declared its willingness to pay the special contri bution corresponding to such a plan? If not, can the Commission inform Parliament how it intends to shape the proposals which are essential for the implementation of Community measures likely to bring about a genuine and last ing reduction of hunger and malnutrition? What short, medium and long-term timetable is it pro posing to this end? I call the rapporteur. Mr Michel, rapporteur. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I address you today as spokesman for the Committee on Cooperation and Development, and the report which I have the honour of submitting to you this morning is the result of teamwork. The resolution which is on the table before you today was approved almost unanimously by the members of the Committee: by 13 votes to 1 with 1 abstention. In order to help me set out as clearly as possible the scope, contents and aims of this report, as well as the follow-up action which it calls for, my group has agreed, Mr President, to grant me 10 minutes speak ing time which had been reserved for the members of the group so that they could discuss this report. I should like to thank them for this. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fight against world hunger is also a fight to overcome exploitation and under-development. As we approach the end of this century, this world of ours faces a multitude of challenges. Nearly a thousand million people who do not get enough to eat, more than a thousand million people who are illiterate, of which 380 million are children who do not attend school out of 750 million who should, a thousand million unemployed, nine tenths of whom receive no employment benefit, whilst, simultaneously, almost 200 million children aged less than 14 years are obliged to go out to work. Almost a billion dollars spent on arms and warfare, whilst actual war is being waged at this moment between Iraq and Iran, the Soviet Union and Afghanistan, Israel and Palestine and the United Kingdom and Argentina. The industrialized countries spend almost 800 million dollars a year on preparing for war and the developing countries spend a further 200 million dollars, whilst at the same time 25 million men, women and children die each year, victims of malnutrition and ignorance and wiped out in their thousands by epidemics. Ours is a world of intricately interrelated economic systems based on profit, speculation and warfare, a world in which man himself ultimately costs too much to keep alive. If the world were reduced in scale to the size of a vil lage of one thousand inhabitants, what would it be like? Its population would consist of 60 North Ameri cans, 80 South Americans, 86 Africans, 210 Europeans \u2014 from the Atlantic to the Urals, of course \u2014 and 564 Asiatics. The inequalities would be flagrant: 60 out of those one thousand inhabitants would receive one half of the total income, 240 persons would not get enough to eat and 700 would be illiterate, and therefore underdeveloped. This is the situation of our world today. Mr Pisani is in the habit of saying 'The world is capa ble of providing enough food for everyone, why does it not do so?' I, in turn, shall ask: the people of this world are also capable of living in peace, why do they ",
        "16.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/109 Michel not do so? And I am in the habit of repeating what a wise man, Frank Buckman, said long before me: 'there is enough wealth in the world to satisfy everyone's needs, but there is not enough to satisfy everyone's greed.' This is the present situation of our world, and particularly of our countries vis \u00e0 vis the South. The fact is that we import 55% of our energy require ments, 90% of our raw materials, and 36% of our foodstuffs, whilst we export 40% of our manufactured goods to the countries of the third world. Having noted these facts, however, we are also obliged to note that the present structures based on exploitation con tinue to widen a little further each day the gap between the North and the South. Faced with a situa tion of this kind, which is getting worse instead of get ting better, after two decades of development, what must we do to make progress, what must we do to change things? We are faced by four options : each one has its advo cates. The first consists in letting the situation worsen even further and in hoping that left-wing inspired revolutions will overthrow the existing regimes, will lead the hungry masses to revolt and will prepare for them a great social upheaval, so that they may then, perhaps, hope that things will change in the future. There is another possible option. This one also has its votaries, some of whom recommended it at Cancun. This option is to let things carry on as they are, to maintain absolute confidence in the market economy and to say that in the near future private enterprise and the investment that it will give rise to will produce the desired remedies. The third option, which is recommended by some people, consists in staging spectacular demonstrations, with the support of public opinion and the news media, in order to convince people that it is possible within one year to save five million persons from death. The fourth option, finally, is the one that we recom mend. This is to set out patiently and resolutely on a long journey with the populations of the developing countries to struggle with them on the basis of justice. Solidarity, equity and mutual respect and with a com mon sense of commitment. What is in the report that I am presenting to you? First of all, and above all, it contains an analysis of the reso lution that we voted on in this House in September 1980. This resolution, with its 57 paragraphs, is attached to my report and it analyses what the various institutions have done, beginning with Community institutions (the Council of Ministers and the Commis sion), and then the Member States and the European Parliament and the national parliaments, which have all devoted time to these problems. After this analysis, we go on to summarize a certain number of initiatives which have already been com pleted, and firstly the work that we have carried out \u2014 I was going to say 'hand-in-hand' \u2014 with our part ners in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific. After the debate we held here in September 1980, I suggested that the ACP/EEC Consultative Assembly should address itself to our resolution, should discuss it and should set up a working party, this was subsequently done and the working party consisted of representa tives of the ACP countries and of our parliament and together we have just adopted, in Havare (Salisbury), the report that constitutes the fruit of our cooperation. We must next submit it for approval to the Plenary Assembly and, once it has been adopted by the Plenary Assembly, we shall submit it to Parliament. I want to emphasize that this is quite clearly a very important step forward, because our intention was to collaborate in this area with those who are directly involved in finding workable solutions, and in our report we set out common, suitably adopted and convergent propos als. Meantime, four important events have taken place which I shall only summarize here. First of all, as far as aid is concerned, we have all the obligations we entered into under the terms of Lom\u00e9 II, concerning the fifth EDF Stabex, SYSMIN, the European Investment Bank investments and also the special emergency aid voted by Parliament on the recommendation of Mr Pisani and adopted by the Council, that is to say, food aid for which we voted the 40 million ECUs already mentioned, over and above the money voted for in the 1981 budget. This means that we can make available supplementary aid amounting to 330 000 tonnes of cereal. Next, the Commission proposed an action programme against hunger, which has been approved by the Council, first for the benefit of the poorest countries, but also for all countries that want to work towards the aim of establishing a strategy for food production which will be part of an overall development strategy. This action programme includes not only food aid to cope with emergencies, disasters and endemic famine, but also measures that will go hand in hand with the overall development programme under the terms of the strategy I have just mentioned. Thirdly, this action programme includes specific mea sures, that is to say projects designed to combat soil erosion, deforestation, desertification and a specific project to eliminate endemic disease. Finally, the fourth section of this action programme covers measures to strengthen security of food sup plies, that is to say, to provide for the building up of reserve stocks and regular contributions from all coun tries that are in a position to contribute to these reserves. The negotiations for a new agreement on wheat are meant tp serve the same end. As you are well aware, there are many reservations in this respect, particularly on the part of the Americans. These are all obstacles which we must attempt to overcome. ",
        "No 1-286/110 Debates of the European Parliament 16.6.82 Michel The third important aspect relates to the suggestions put forward by Mr Colombo, that it to say, the pre paration of a programme of cooperation involving all those countries that are genuinely interested in finding a solution to this distressing problem. Those con cerned by this are the Community itself, the Member States, the member countries of OPEC, and the spe cialized agencies set up by the United Nations and the World Food Council. It has been suggested that all these potential partners should meet in Rome in order to work out the terms of active and effective coordina tion work. Finally, a decision has been taken to reactivate the International Fund for Agricultural Development by providing it with an allocation of 1 350 million dollars, 620 million being provided by the industrialized coun tries, 450 million by the OPEC countries, 30 million by the developing countries themselves and, the final 250 million being the residue of the fund's, initial budgetary allocation. Originally 3 000 million was requested to reactivate this fund; to date, it has been guaranteed 1 350 million. Now, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to draw your attention to the background to this campaign against hunger in the world. And first of all, I should like to remind you of the Nobel Prize winners' manifesto of 25 June 1981; the aim of this manifesto was approved unanimously by the members of our Committee on Development and Co-operation. We believe that the objectives set out in this manifesto are excellent and that they must be supported, and we are very pleased at the emotional impact the manifesto has had amongst the people of our country. We hope that there will be a follow-up to all of this and we shall say what we think it should be. Then there is the resolu tion . .. President. \u2014 Mr Michel, I should like to point out to you that you have already exceeded your speaking time. Mr Michel, rapporteur. \u2014 (FR) I still have ten minutes left. President. \u2014 You have already spoken for 16 minutes. Mr Michel, rapporteur. \u2014 (FR) All right then, I shall conclude in five minutes' time. (Laughter) First, there is Resolution No 375/81, in which, as you are aware, Parliament asks for 5 thousand million units of account in order to save the lives of five mil lion persons before this year is out. We shall go into the details of this later, but, Mr President, I should like to say that we, for our part, do not think that a workable answer to these problems can be provided by spectacular demonstrations. Rather than provide food aid, in this case we should intervene actively in development programmes. People need to be taught to plant, to irrigate, to water, to hoe, to harvest, to improve, to select and market food crops; they must also learn crop rotation, and, particularly, they must succeed in creating more suitable market conditions than exist at present. Finally, I should like to conclude with four questions. The first question is for the Council. Mr President of the Council, you have adopted Resolution No 1/375/ 81.1 should like to ask you what steps, what represen tations, what action has been taken during the first six months of your presidency to induce the partner coun tries to allocate the five thousand million supplemen tary units of account which are asked for in this reso lution? I should also like to put a question to the Commission. You have launched a supplementary food aid programme of 40 million units of account. We have had budgetary surpluses; we have suggested that part of these budgetary surpluses should be allo cated to strengthening this programme. We believe that the 1983 budget is being prepared at this moment. We should like to know, Mr Pisani, what steps you intend to take to see that the strategy that is being developed right now with 14 other countries will be practicable and operational in the near future and how many million units of account you intend to devote to it. I also have a question for the Member States. They have committed themselves to devoting 0-7% of their gross national product to development aid. They were supposed to achieve this percentage during 1980. They have further committed themselves to granting 0\u00b7 15% of their GNP for aid to the poorest countries. How do things stand now? We should like to know whether they have committed themselves to respecting a time table that will make sense of these commitments, and we say that if that is the situation we shall indeed have the five thousand million units of account of which mention is made in pretty well all of these documents. Now I come to my last question, and this one is for Parliament itself. You showed generosity when you , voted in favour of Resolution 375/81 without a debate and by backing a recommendation that it should be taking into consideration with the signatures of 246 members. When, last year, I had to defend chapter 9 of the budget in this House, I asked for an increase of 258 million units of account in the form of commit ment, appropriations three-quarters of which you rejected. I should therefore like to know whether Par liament is prepared to be consistent in the attitudes it has adopted and whether a clear and precise answer to these questions may be expected for tomorrow. If the commitments that have been entered into at every level are honoured, we shall not be talking about an emer gency programme with five thousand millions for one year, but rather a permanent programme funded with ",

(Applause) President. \u2014 I should like to inform the House in passing that, following what Mr Griffiths and Mr Moreland said, the time limit for tabling amendments to the Pintat report (Doc. 1-303/82) is extended until 6 p.m.) I call the Council. Mr De Keersmaeker, President-in-Office of the Coun cil. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, Mr Pisani, ladies and gen tlemen, on behalf of the Council and of the Member States I would like first of all to express our warmest gratitude to Parliament and more particularly to cer tain of its members who have been and who are still playing a key role in seeking a solution to the appall ing problem of world hunger by drawing this problem to the attention of the general public and of politi- Nearly forty years after the end of the Second World War, and despite the staggering progress which man has made in science and technology, it is intolerable to think that the basic needs of a very large part of the world's population is in such dire need that hunger, suffering, disease and, all too often, death itself are the sad lot of thousands of human beings. The excellent reports by Mr Ferrer\u00f2 and Mr Michel, whom I congratulate on his introduction, the initia tives and observations of the members of this Parlia ment \u2014 and here I must mention, among many other admirable speeches, those of Messrs Willy Brandt, Pannella, Sabl\u00e9, Vergeer, Cohen, Poniatowski, War ner, Wawrzik, Bersani, Lezzi and Mrs Focke and Mrs Rabbethge \u2014 and the work of your parliamentary committee, in particular the Committee on Develop ment and Cooperation, or the work carried out with the ACP-EEC Consultative Assembly, have provided this House with a wealth of information on which to base their ideas and proposals. Thus, as a result of your admirable and constructive resolutions and with the prestigious help of certain speakers such as the Nobel prize winners, you have guided public opinion and encouraged political leaders to further their attempts to combat this appalling problem and find the means of remedying it. That is why the Council, specially in its meetings involving the ministers responsible for development, has for the past two years consistently given this prob lem the utmost priority and has tried to find an effec tive way of countering this tragic situation both in the immediate future and in the long term. But in view of the enormity of the problem, the measures we decide upon are crucial, since mistakes are paid for in human lives. The first solution which springs to mind is to send food to countries where famine is rife. This would seem fairly obvious, since the Community has food available resulting from its agricultural production. And yet, we are aware of our limitations, especially in terms of finance; we are becoming increasingly famil iar with the evil effects of such an approach, and today we are also more aware of the unfortunate conse quences which this may have as regards dietary habits, the imbalance between towns and rural areas and \u2014 though the importance of this should not be overstated \u2014 the abuses to which excessively largescale food aid can lead. Food aid should therefore serve only as an immediate and temporary remedy, and in any case its organ ization will have to be improved. On this point, I would remind Parliament that the Council has given its agreement to the first phase of the Community plan to combat hunger which provides for additional food aid of 40 million ECUs for the least developed countries in the context of the new substantial action programme adopted by the devel oped countries for the least developped countries. Furthermore, the Commission recently announced to the Council that these funds had been effectively and usefully disbursed within a satisfactory period. However, it is wrong to set out merely to remedy the causes of a problem without tackling its roots. For this reason the Council, acting on the basis of information from the Commission and in the light of the opinions and suggestions put forward by Parliament, has car ried out a detailed analysis from which it has con cluded that there is little point in making large amounts of money available to combat hunger if the means of using it are not first clearly defined and strictly coordinated. Otherwise, the sacrifices which taxpayers are asked to make could yield poor or even detrimental results; they could lead to misguided or indeed harmful policies towards the countries con cerned and could result in developments which may in some cases run counter to the objectives pursued. The Council has therefore concentrated on the second aspect of the Community plan to combat world hun ger. It has examined the nature and conditions of the measures to back up national food strategies and has tried to single out the characteristics whereby coun tries which could be supported under the strategy can be identified. Lastly, it has examined the arrangements for Community coordination in cooperating to estab lish food strategies. These seek to achieve greater con- ",
        "No 1-286/112 Debates of the European Parliament 16. 6. 82 De Keersmaeker sistency between the policies of the countries con cerned in their struggle against hunger and the meas ures relating to aid from the Community and the Member States and, possibly, other donors, the aim being to help the countries to apply the strategy which they would themselves have freely chosen to achieve greater self-sufficiency in their food supplies. Specialist working parties, in which recipient countries occupy a central place, are used to provide informa tion and detailed exchanges of ideas on the objectives of food strategies and the means of implementing them in order to allow the participants to decide on the measures they intend to apply in support of these strategies. As for the choice of the first countries to be approached with a view to cooperation of this kind, the Council agreed yesterday that the Community should attach particular importance to the ability and willingness of the country concerned to implement an effective food strategy itself. Account should also be taken of the extent of the food shortage and of the presence of the Member States and of the Community as aid donors in the country concerned. On this point the Council, like the Commission, is convinced that a firm political resolve on the part of the developing countries to combat hunger effectively is the main prerequisite for success; without this, the chances of outside help improving these countries' self-sufficiency in food would be slight and could even, in some cases, discourage local food production. Thus the Commissioner, Mr Pisani, informed the Council yesterday of the talks which he had recently had with the heads of state of Mali, Kenya and Zam bia, and of those which he intends to hold in the very near future in other developing countries in order to ensure that the assistance envisaged by the Community and its Member States (if possible also with other countries or organizations) accords with the objectives for combating hunger as defined by the countries affected, and that assistance is closely coordinated with these countries. Therefore, as the Council decided yesterday, the fact that Mali, Kenya and Zam bia have been chosen at this stage as the first benefi ciaries of the assistance offered by the Community and the Member States in applying their food strategies is due primarily to their clear commitment to such a pro ject. In those countries the prerequisites for success therefore appear to have been already fulfilled. The Council moreover intends to give similar Community backing to third countries in the future on the basis of the same commitments. The Council thus initiated a new development yester day, and I would like to emphasize its importance. It shows great promise both as a new means of combat ing hunger in the world and is a new addition to the various approaches which the Community can adopt in its development policy. The Commission has informed the Council of the time-table for launching these projects, and it is hoped that it will be possible to begin the initial phases before the end of the year. As regards the third aspect of the action plan concern ing measures in specific fields and regions, the Com mission has announced its intention to submit concrete proposals to the Council by the end of the year, but it has already mentioned \u2014 and this was also referred to by the rapporteur, Mr Michel \u2014 the control of soil erosion and the formation of deserts, the more rational use of wood as an energy source, afforesta tion, the improvement of agricultural research in trop ical regions and the control of endemic diseases affect ing livestock. As a result of these first three sections of the Com munity action plan, the Commission appears recently to have taken a new initiative \u2014 and this to some extent answers one of the questions put by Mr Michel \u2014 to grant 184 million ECUs from the supplementary budget for 1982, to combat hunger in the world by means of emergency measures for the benefit mainly of refugees and the homeless, measures in support of the food policies in countries with coherent develop ment policies, measures including a special programme for Central America, and measures in specific fields . aimed at protecting the rural environment. The Council will examine this Commission proposal very carefully; it was made as part of the gradual implementation of an action plan to combat world hunger, the general principles and overall balance of which were approved by the Council in November 1981. The budgetary aspects of this proposal will be examined under the normal budgetary procedure. (NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Pisani, the international action in the field of food supply and\u201e agriculture, which constitutes the fourth section of the Community action programme to combat hunger, have for years been a matter of the utmost concern to the Council. The Council will deal with this section as it receives information on the basis of which decisions can and must be made. I would like to take this oppor tunity of explaining what the Community has done at international level to combat world hunger. This is also in part by way of reply in another question put by the rapporteur. At the Council meeting of June 1981, which preceded the Ottawa summit and the Cancun conference, it was concluded that poverty and hunger, which are still rife in various parts of the developing countries, are intol erable. At Ottawa the major industrialized countries recognized the importance of greater food production in the third world and, above all, of better guarantees of food for all. At Cancun the clear objective was to eliminate hunger as quickly as possible, and long and detailed discussions were held on the means of achiev ing this and on preparations for a long-term pro gramme to wipe out hunger by the year 2000 both by ",
        "m 16.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1\u00ad286/113 De Keersmaeker means of national efforts and by international action and cooperation. At Versailles the prospects for global discussions became rather more distinct, and now that the consult\u00ad ative procedure has been completed we are approach\u00ad ing the stage of coordinated action at international level. More specifically, as a result of an important ini\u00ad tiative by the Italian Government, the Member States and the Commission took part in a meeting at the end of April in Rome which was devoted to the combating of world hunger and which will be followed in the autumn by another meeting, this time at ministerial level. Thanks to the Rome meetings the Community is in a position to take an even more active part in combating hunger, since in addition to food aid, which it has for years been granting to countries in need, it will hence\u00ad forth be active in fields which go beyond actual food aid and which at the same time will make such aid more effective, since its purpose is to eliminate the fundamental causes of this problem. I would also point out that agricultural and food prob\u00ad lems were matters of concern to the Community dele\u00ad gation and of course also of the other delegations at the United Nations conference on the least developed countries held last autumn in Paris. The Community's support for the establishment of a national food stra\u00ad tegy in the developing countries is in line with the commitments entered into as part of the new action programme adopted by the Paris conference on the least developed countries. It is obviously not possible to fully evaluate the results of this conference, but there is an undeniable link between poverty and the scourge of famine in the various countries. The Community believes that in order to solve the problem of world hunger it is essential that efforts to \u25a0 improve the reliability of world food supplies should be continued and intensified. Following the first meet\u00ad ing in Rome, at which questions relating to the safe\u00ad guarding of food supplies in the world were discussed in detail, the 8th meeting of the World Food Council, shortly to be held in Mexico, assumes very great importance. This meeting will discuss the proposals which were recently put forward by the executive body of that organization and which seek to improve the reliability of food supplies in the poorest develop\u00ad ing countries and take steps towards achieving greater stability on the world grain market. The Community sees these questions as an extremely important part of the North\u00adSouth dialogue and it wishes to take a constructive part in the activities of the World Food Council. It will also point out that it has always been, and still is, in favour of negotiations for a new grain agreement, and it will likewise make it known that it endorses the objectives which form the basis of the World Food Council's initiatives in this area. It will also affirm that it is willing to continue to examine this problem. In addition to the action plan itself and the commit\u00ad ments which it entails throughout the world, the Com\u00ad munity has continued its food aid programme in accordance with the new guidelines adopted by the Council. Like the previous programmes, the new food aid programmes for 1982 adopted by the Council on 26 April 1982 involve large quantities \u2014 927 000 t grain, to which must be added the Member States' own programmes, which bring the total to 1 650 000 t grain, 150 000 t skimmed milk powder and 45 000 t butter oil, in accordance with the total contribution provided for by the food aid agreement. It is now up to the Commission to implement these programmes, which are intended primarily for the least developed countries, as effectively as possible. I hardly need to remind you that the institutions hold somewhat differ\u00ad ing views on food aid appropriations in the 1982 budget, especially since attempts are now being made to resolve this issue, which is at present being dis\u00ad cussed by the institutions. In addition, the Council intends to examine very carefully the study to evaluate food aid as soon as this becomes available, probably in the next few months. This question is now also being examined by the Commission. A study of this kind will undoubtedly be very useful for working out new pro\u00ad posals for assisting the agriculture and food supplies of the developing countries so that we are able in future to ensure better and, above all, more rapid and effi\u00ad cient food aid. In a comment on the report by Mr Ferrer\u00f2 as part of the activities of the ACP\u00adEEC institutions, Mr Michel points out that the fight against hunger calls for the stimulation of development. I feel that this touches at the heart of the problem and places the fight against hunger in its proper context. Indeed, the Council's dis\u00ad cussions on the action plan and the conclusions of the Rome meeting clearly show that the aid offered by the Community and the Member States in measures which are now under way or being prepared provide an acceptable solution, and one which represents a suita\u00ad ble combination of two forms of aid which can always be adapted to different circumstances. Firstly, there is short\u00adterm emergency aid to supplement the yearly food aid programmes, and secondly there are longer term measures including support for food strategies in order to provide a better safeguard for the food sup\u00ad plies of the developing countries which wish to apply measures of this kind, thus helping them in their own fight against hunger. However, this fight can only succeed if the Com\u00ad munity and the Member States redouble their efforts to apply all the means at their disposal. Their willing\u00ad ness to do this was expressed in very detailed, precise and concrete terms in the second ACP\u00adEEC Lom\u00e9 Convention, title 6 of which is devoted entirely to cooperation in agriculture. This contains a whole ser\u00ad ies of measures in that sector, and one of its conse\u00ad ",
        "No 1-286/114 Debates of the European Parliament 16.6.82 De Keersmaeker quences is that under Lom\u00e9 II the Community is now supporting the development of agriculture more than under Lom\u00e9 I. Under Lom\u00e9 II a technical centre for cooperation in agriculture and rural development has also been set up. I would also point out here that the Community did all it could to make this centre opera tional by the time the Convention entered into force, and I deeply regret the delay, which was not in fact caused by the Community. While I am discussing relations between the ACP States and the Community, I would mention that Article 89 of the Convention clearly states that food aid is a temporary measure. The ultimate objective of the ACP states is to provide for their food require ments on the basis of their own production. Obviously, this affirmation also holds true for devel oping countries other than those which arc signatories of the ACP Convention and which are in the same situation, and it provides even more ample justification for the Community's approach to the combating of hunger. I think, Mr President, that I have thus answered the oral question put to the Council by Mr Pannella, Mrs Bonino, Messrs Vandemeulebroucke, Gendebien and Capanna concerning the manifesto of the Nobel prize winners and the Community's contri bution to the fight against hunger and also the ques tions concerning the reaction to Parliament's resolu tions concerning the fight against world hunger and the Community's attitude to North-South relations in that fight. Thus, of course, I have also answered the questions put by the rapporteur, Mr Michel, and have also referred specifically to two of them. I have not wanted to go into the political, economic, technical, demographic, financial and monetary com plications associated with a problem such as this, since you have already dealt with these in detail in your own comments. The real problem facing the Council is one of choice \u2014 choice both as concerns the appropriate ness of the resources to be deployed and of how to put the taxpayers' money to the best possible use. Such decisions are extremely difficult, as I am sure you all know, but the Council is aware of its great responsibil ity in this matter. If solidarity with the hundreds of millions of hungry people has any meaning, then it must find expression in practical programmes and ac tion; these should not be merely plans but should be made to work. This, with the Commission's help, is the Council's task. I am convinced that the decisions taken yesterday by the Council prove that the Coun cil's intentions are serious. (Applause) IN THE CHAIR: MR FRIEDRICH Vice-President President. \u2014 I call the Commission. Mr Pisani, Member of the Commission. \u2014 (FR) On the question of hunger the European Parliament has taken two different attitudes in the past, or rather it has adopted two different approaches. When, on 18 Sep tember 1980, it adopted the Ferrer\u00f2 report, it heard the rapporteur maintain that hunger is a permanent evil for mankind, which only a profound change of structures, behaviour, power and knowledge can hope to cure. When, in September 1981, it adopted by written pro cedure, and therefore without debate, Resolution No 375 'on the Nobel-Prize-winners' manifesto con cerning world hunger', Parliament expressed a desire for immediate action which was more in the nature of an attempt to make up for past omissions than to remedy the situation. The report presented to us today by Mr Victor Michel on behalf of the Committee on Cooperation and Development returns resolutely to the first approach, which is fundamentalist and structuralist, but which does not altogether reject the idea of emergency ac tion, though only as a supplement. The Commission, for its part, has very definitely adopted the Ferrero-Michel attitude, with the support of the Council of Ministers. It has deliberately refused to enter into the logic of the other approach because it considers that it is dangerous and, in many respects, superficial and shallow. To treat world hunger as a mere incident and not as an endemic disease is an easy way of salving one's conscience; it's like giving alms on Sunday in order to expunge the errors, the acts of negligence or even the crimes that one has been guilty of on the other days of the week. The Commission's view is that hunger is one of the permanent scars on the face of humanity and, all things considered, it believes that humanity would make unprecedented progress if, within one genera tion, by the year 2000 or 2010, we could finally say that we had exorcised the spectre of hunger which, relatively recently, \u2014 let us not forget this \u2014 only a generation ago, haunted the countryside and the cities of Europe. The Commission considers that hunger will not be vanquished by temporary expedients, but rather by a process of economic development, which will be slow and difficult, because development is not just building roads, dams, hospitals, schools, irrigation systems and factories: it is all those things, but it is first and fore most the mobilization and the organization of an entire nation which wishes finally to take in hand its economic and social destiny after it has taken its polit ical destiny in hand. Development is not simply trans ferring technology and technical assistance; it is the acquisition by the poorest countries of the ability to develop techniques suited to their own needs, to train men capable of governing them, of administering their ",
        "16.6. 82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/115 Pisani affairs, of managing their economy and of guiding their efforts. Any approach which does not connect, and even iden tify, the fight against hunger with indigenous efforts to promote overall development is a sham. The Commis sion of the European Communities asks Parliament to dissociate itself from such an approach and recom mends that it should reject it unambiguously and fol low instead the guidance of its rapporteur. By this the Commission means to say that Parliament would be guilty of a political failing if it were to allow itself to be carried away by the fascination for obtaining imme diate results from the approach to the problem which an analysis of the facts has suggested it ought to adopt. The Commission has committed itself with determina tion. This analysis, this programme and the prospects for it are the subject matter of what it has to say to you today. Firstly, the Commission wanted to collect and absorb the facts of the situation. The picture is not an encour aging one. The food supply situation, or rather the dependence of the poorest countries on food imports, has worsened over the last 20 years. It will worsen further if no deci sive steps are taken to reverse the trend. At present the developing countries import 90 million tonnes of cer eal; by the end of the century they will be importing 250 million tonnes. Apart from the fact that it inevitably involves waste, food aid, in spite of the allocation of counterpart funds, does not solve the main problems of agricul tural and rural development, it simply skirts around them. It undermines the systems of consumption and production. It creates dangerous illusions and absolves people from making the necessary effort. The solution \u2014 because there is a solution \u2014 lies in a rigorous linkage between the internal economic poli cies of the developing countries, food aid understood as a temporar)' corrective, and a move to promote overall development, giving special importance to food crop-raising and rural development. The solution also consists in altering international practices and interna tional equilibria, as well as in controlling excessive var iations in world prices. But this approach poses another question: can the poor countries of the world escape from their poverty if their populations continue to grow at a rate which is often in excess of 3-5% a year? The answer is clear: they cannot. There is a fatal contradiction in this dis crepancy between the rate of population growth and the possible rate of increase of food production, and mankind can only hope to overcome world hunger by dealing with both, by lowering the former and raising the latter. But, here, once again, we must understand what we are talking about. Population growth is the result of the continuation of a basic biological reaction beyond the point when it has ceased to be a vital necessity for the species. Families no longer need to be large in order to perpetuate the species. Nevertheless, they continue to be as prolifically productive of chil dren as in the past. The need to adapt the instinct for survival to the requirements of survival will simply have to be accepted: this is the price of development and satisfying countries' food needs. The entire pro cess of development depends on it. On the basis of these considerations and observations, the Commission has proposed, and the Council has adopted, a plan to combat hunger which is being grad ually set up, accompanied by considerable reflection on food aid, and which the supplementary budget which will shortly be submitted to you will help to make operational. In accordance with Parliament's wishes, a fundamental study has been carried out, the results of which will be made available to you in July, and the practical con clusions of which will be submitted to you shortly after that. They will help to make food aid more efficient and more orientated towards development. This food aid is intended to cope with emergencies, but it must contribute to its own abolition, for lack of which in the event that it should perpetuate itself, it will proba bly create new and intolerable relationships of depend ency. From this point of view, there arises a problem that we must solve, concerning the flexibility of our administrative and budgetary system and its capacity to redirect funds which at present are allocated for food aid to development. We are similarly faced by, and must solve, the problem of organizing our Com mon Agricultural Policy around the requirements of our development policy. An initial estimate has been made available to you today. It is worth some study and debate. If an effort is not made to look for and find solutions to these problems, the situation of whole continents and regions of the world will become uncontrollable. The developing countries will then be obliged to choose between importing foodstuffs and importing oil. Because they have not attended to the develop ment of their agricultural production and rural improvement they will have to put up with unplanned urban development which will be socially and politi cally intolerable because technically and financially beyond their capabilities. Development aid is continuing. For some years now it has been developing positively, and has been orien tated rather more towards the problems of agriculture and the rural world, towards project programmes and microprojects, towards the creation of a network of small and medium-sized companies which will consti tute the Iifeblood of the economic system. This trend must be broadened, it must be accompanied by other measures and it must be guided, bearing fully in mind that our aim is not the structure we are setting ",

Food aid, development aid \u2014 all those things have been implemented for some time now but appar ently without any success, because by an absurd kind of inevitability, we were prisoners of both unsuitable economic policies and of a certain logic of ineffi ciency. The aim of the approach based on a food strategy \u2014 and we are convinced that this will also be its result \u2014 is to overcome both the unsuitable economic policies and the logic of inefficiency. The notion of a food strategy was considered only yesterday a vague concept, only to be heard men tioned at meetings of international organizations. The dialogue which has been undertaken with the govern ments of Mali, Kenya and Zambia has helped to define the contents and the methods of the food stra tegy more precisely. I wish I had the time to recount to you in detail the conversations I have had with the members of the governments of these three countries. Those conversations have helped me, with them, on their behalf, in their countries, to a better understand ing of the very idea of which I was the bearer on behalf of the Community. A food strategy must start with the adoption by gov ernments of rigorous economic policies. This means that they must decide to give farmers, and the vast number of small farmers, even more than commercial undertakings, an incentive to produce foodstuffs by offering to buy them at prices which offer the prospect of a profit, and on that basis we can hope to guide production using the vast number of means open to us. But if we want to raise farm prices we must for a time pursue a policy of wage adjustment, for lack of which the rise in prices would become an intolerable burden for workers in administration, the army and industry, who are obliged to live in the capital. The government must be given assistance in this process of adjustment. And if, as all the evidence suggests, rising prices result in a corresponding increase in production, we must, on the one hand, see that we have the physical means of storing farm surpluses, in the villages and in the cities, and on the other hand, we must see that money is available to buy up the surplus produce that comes to market. We also need to see that there is a market ing system available, for lack of which the prices would not be maintained. To do that, the government in question needs budget ary support in order to build, or have built, silos, and to make seasonal loans to finance stocks, and it needs technical and financial support to see that the produce is marketed. If all that is accomplished \u2014 and it will be \u2014 farmers will have at their disposal more money than they have ever had before. They will be prepared to buy manure, pesticides and tools and to build them selves modest houses in which to live. They will need better equipped villages and paths to transport their products along. Very soon they will also need the help of competent advisory officers, present on the spot and ready to help them. How could governments hope to cope with the increase in their needs which develop ment itself presupposes without substantial assistance? How could they set up a system of loans to agriculture available to everyone, everywhere without our tech nical, and perhaps even financial, aid? Everyone can assess the logic of this approach. It bases overall development on developing the will to produce and it recommends providing support for growth by coping with the needs that growth creates whilst over coming the obstacles growth comes up against. Instead of providing aid in the form of food supplies and public works, we are implementing this policy in three countries. So food aid as such will disappear, and a structure will be set up in the right place and at the right time amongst a population which has been pre pared to make use of it. The Council of Ministers debated the problem of food strategies at some length yesterday and decided to give its support to the Commission for the implementation of these strategies in Mali, Kenya and Zambia. It said it was prepared to take three new countries into con sideration shortly. It invited the Member States to join in the Commission's efforts and to coordinate, through the agency of a Working Party, Community aid and bilateral aid, hoping, in addition, that other donors would join the Community to give support to the Community strategies, a propos of which, we must, however, repeat that they are first and foremost the work of the governments who draw them up and take on responsibility for them. A food strategy is a form of economic policy using the means for development of production. It is an attentive and flexible accompaniment to this development; it is the transformation of food aid into development aid; it is a pact agreed on between a developing country and other countries which have elected to aid it; a pact which, in return for a country's respecting the aims and disciplines set out in it, will support the country in question in the efforts it needs to make to overcome the difficulties it will inevitably encounter. A food strategy is a wager that the governments and the farmers of the Third World will have the will power to overcome hunger, and it is also a committ ment to support economic growth. It is the reverse of the traditional approach, which financed public works, accepting passively that they would be useless, and which supplied food aid well aware of the risk that it might have to continue supplying it. The whole busi ness is very difficult. But there is no other way because all the alternatives have failed. It requires a convergence of wills, it presupposes that the activity of the government which is being aided ",
        "16.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/117 Pisani and of those providing the aid will be closely coordinated. In the three countries mentioned above economic poli cies have been decided upon, a contact group has been set up which has the responsibility of defining the agreement and looking after the follow-up, projects have been worked out and reciprocal commitments will shortly be entered into. Let us note \u2014 and this is one of the most fascinating aspects of this business \u2014 that no two strategies are the same; they are strictly national ones, but let us note also that they require fewer financial resources than would appear, since they are based on the organ ization of the productive forces of the nation and not on gifts. The fact remains that food strategies and the imple mentation of a plan to combat hunger are both in need of some supplementary means. The proposal we are considering now is that these means should be mobil ized under the terms of the supplementary and amend ing budget for 1982 which has been submitted to you today. Before giving you a summary of it, I should like to provide justification for it. The merit of Community aid is that it is based on a contract and is programmed. The inconvenience of it is that, because of this very fact, it is relatively rigid. Consequently the flexibility needed to withdraw a part of the funds allocated to programmed projects and allocate them to food strate gies cannot be found in the EDF. Now it so happens that it is a matter of urgency that these strategies shou\u00edd be implemented, if only so that the lesson can be drawn from them when the future convention comes to be negotiated. The existence of available funds in the 1982 budget offers the exceptional advan tage of making possible the launching of a vital policy. In the draft which has been submitted to you by the Commission and which the budgetary authority will be called upon to debate and take a decision on, it is recommended that 184 million ECU should be allo cated to measures coming under the responsibility of the Development Commissioner. The President of the Council of Ministers was prepared to admit this a short while ago, which shows that he has given it sym pathetic consideration. 35 million ECU are allocated for support of the activities of the UN High Commis sion for Refugees, and, more generally, to provide aid to the populations of the Third World which have suf fered from disasters or exceptional occurrences. 65 million ECU are allocated to support measures for agrarian reform in the developing countries of Central America. 8 million ECU will be used to develop, broaden and diversify our contribution to the work of the NGO's. 76 million ECUs have been recommended to provide support for a special programme to combat hunger in the world. Without going into too much detail, I must just enu merate the principles and the main aspects of this special programme: rational use of firewood, measures to halt the process of desertification, village water engineering, control of endemic cattle diseases, the foundations for a system of research in the field of food crop-raising and support for basic training pro grammes in rural areas. You will all have observed in this list of aims the spe cific operations of the programme to combat hunger in the world. They are being studied attentively. Before the end of the year the Commission will submit to you a paper on these topics. The appropriations asked for here will help to fund some of these studies and to carry out certain self-evident measures which are urgently necessary. This is not all, however. 35 million ECUs for the sup port of the food strategies themselves and for the development of food crop policies will be added to the 40 million ECUs that will be devoted to these specific projects. Before concluding, it is appropriate that I should remind Parliament once again of the basic principles and the methods of the policy submitted to Parliament today. The fundamental principle may be summarized as fol lows : hunger is an intolerable evil for which the entire international community is responsible and which it must cure mankind of without delay. Hunger is the result of economic disorders, fundamental maladjust ments and absurd yet ingrained policies. Only long- term structural measures provide any hope of over coming it. The European Community and the Member States, for their parts, commit themselves to contributing in the most determined way to overcoming this scourge. The method adopted will consist of specific projects and food strategies. The means already exist and they must be used more efficiently, before being increased. The presentation you have just been given will seem all the more relevant as it harmonizes with the logic of your Committee on Development and Cooperation, which has just given its support to the excellent report which Mr Michel has presented to you on its behalf. Before I conclude, let me, as the Commissioner re sponsible for development matters, warn you against one temptation \u2014 the temptation of approving the Michel report today and approving tomorrow a reso lution calling for the urgent mobilization of fantastic sums of money which you will nevertheless not include on your budget, and which no one can guarantee will be put to rational use. (Applause) The two approaches to this matter derive from con tradictory views; they are inspired by opposed political conceptions; they are the result of political attitudes which are alien to each other. I ask you to adopt today ",
        "No 1\u00ad286/118 Debates of the European Parliament 16.6.82 Pisani and to abide by the principles and the means of a long\u00adterm programme designed to attack the evil at the root, to reform money flows, behaviour, structures and power systems. This is what your Committee and its rapporteur have also proposed. Once you have addressed yourselves to the essential matters, you can then go on to decide on individual, immediate, urgent measures specifically intended to save lives. But let nobody claim that, in so doing, you will have cured mankind of its besetting evil! Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it would have been extremely easy for someone such as myself, for whom the hunger suffered by others is intolerable, to fall in with those who noisily stir up the crowds with\u00ad out suggesting any solution. For someone like me, for whom world hunger is intolerable, it would have been easy to make moving and moralizing speeches, to let myself be carried away by the force of emotional pro\u00ad paganda. I could easily have made myself popular by yielding to the temptation to indulge in inflammatory and exaggerated talk designed to stir up emotion. Not for one moment did I dream of yielding to these temp\u00ad tations, because neither you nor I are here to win votes by stirring up scandal: we are here to find a remedy to an evil which we all find unacceptable. By preparing its programme to combat hunger in the world, by patiently implementing it, by asking for your support in terms of budgetary resources, the Commission is asking you for a fundamental expression of political will, and not for political gestures to suit the mood of the moment. (Applause) President. \u2014 I call the Socialist Group. Mrs Focke. \u2014 (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentle\u00ad men, I should like to thank Mr Michel for his report on behalf of the Socialist Group since it gives us the opportunity one year and nine months after the Fer\u00ad rer\u00f2 resolution was adopted here by a large majority, to assess and determine what has happened in the interim \u2014 or rather what has not happened in the interim \u2014 to follow up, to set back in motion, to update our views and once more to mobilize public opinion. I should like to say right from the outset that the over\u00ad all assessment is exceptionally negative. What has been done up to now falls far short of the demands and proposals of the European Parliament. I do not except the European Parliament from this criticism, since we have neither included in our budgetary decisions the fund which would have been necessary to implement the Ferrer\u00f2 resolution, nor have we found a common denominator for development, trade and agricultural policies. But my criticism is first and foremost directed at the Council and at the Member States working in Euro\u00ad pean political cooperation and it is to no avail that the representative of the Council is today stating what an enormous wealth of ideas and suggestions have been amassed. We want to see acts and I am forced to con\u00ad clude when contrasting what was expected with what has happened, that food aid has not been reformed and has been insufficiently supplied with funds. As before, ridiculous sums are made available in our budget for emergency aid. No firm deadlines have been set for reaching the 0\u00ad7% objective and the International Fund for Agricultural Development \u2014 IFAD \u2014 has not been sufficiently funded. No out\u00ad come has been reached in the global negotiations at the United Nations, the energy chain has not been set up . . and so on and so forth. To sum up between Sep\u00ad tember 1980 and Cancun and now with Versailles only infinitesimal progress has been made. I must also direct this criticism at the Commission. Mr Pisani, you have just made a very good speech, and shown us the right direction. It is certainly not by chance that under the influence of this debate we have organized today, you have informed us that in the supplementary 1982 budget further funds will be made available for combating world hunger. But even in the Commission work has been proceeding at a snail's pace. The Commission's preliminary draft budget includes insufficient funds for this purpose. Within the Commission none of the required restructuring which we asked for nine months ago in order to fulfil the task of combating world hunger more fully has been carried out, we are still waiting for almost all the reports, analyses and proposals for reform which were requested in the Ferrer\u00f2 resolution one year and nine months ago. I refer particularly to the reports on food aid and the effects of the Common Agricultural Policy on international trade in farm produce. What you call your action plan \u2014 last autumn's mini\u00adreport which is still the basis for your future work \u2014 does not deserve any such title. We are still waiting from the Commis\u00ad sion for a short, medium and long term plan which would bring into play all the potential and instruments at the European Community's disposal to combat world hunger. Only three positive things have happened, firstly, rural development in the developing countries has managed to be pegged higher in the programmes and projects \u2014 40% now go to this sector within the framework of the European Development Fund. Ladies and gentle\u00ad men, I am willing to recognize this. This means, how\u00ad ever, over five years for 62 countries no more than 1 \u25a0 2 thousand million ECUs \u2014 if we keep to the Lom\u00e9 framework until 1985. Secondly, the potential for using products for food aid which do not originate in the European Community has somewhat improved. However, I must ask where has this actually taken place up to now? Thirdly, there are at last some food strategies being implemented \u2014 ladies and gentlemen, yesterday at the Council of Development Ministers food strategies were decided for three countries, one year and nine months after the Ferrer\u00f2 resolution and ",
        "16.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/119 Focke v long after the international community has agreed on the importance of this way of improving the world food situation. I am forced to state that this is a very meagre result from such a vast amount of work. Given the lack of action by the European Community in a worsened food situation, we are once more focus ing our attention in the Michel resolution on the most important points, those which already appear in the Ferrer\u00f2 resolution: a time schedule with deadlines for achieving the C-7% objective, specific proposals from the European Community for combating world hun ger at United Nations level for global negotiations on the implementation of the Brandt plan \u2014 particularly for the emergency programme and with respect to automatic financing \u2014 for a raw materials agreement, buffer stocks, storage projects, for the reform of food aid in close cooperation with rural development and food strategies for very many other countries than the first three I have referred to, for an incontrovertible correlation between Community development, trade and agricultural policies and of course for higher than average rates of increase in the Community budget for development and corresponding funds to be included in exceptional budgets. At world level we would seem in Versailles to have pushed the door a little wider open. There is even to be found in the Communiqu\u00e9 a statement that specifi cally orientated impetus should be given to food pro grammes. Are these simply words? What we demand here today is that once and for all something serious should be done about this problem. What does specific impetus involve? It involves providing money and know-how in order to promote self help. Let us once and for all stop dodging the issue by saying that it is apparently not possible to invest so quickly. We have never even really tried to offer more. I call upon the Members of the Commission and of Governments in the Council and working within European political cooperation to give ten times more than they are doing today to the non-governmental organizations and then you will see how quickly and how well they can invest that money. Give more money for food strategies and then you will see how many more countries will offer funds to this end and how greatly the readiness to develop food strategies will increase, Make a commit ment that what is now spent on food aid, which hope fully one day will be less necessary because rural prod uction in the countries themselves will have been greatly stimulated, will continue to be provided as financial support from the Community. Then you will see how quickly rural development can be set in motion. Much too little is being done and it is taking far too long. I too am filled with impatierice and anger when I look upon the ineffectualness of the last year and nine months. I too am being overcome by a desire to do something spectacular much as a sit-in or walk in at the next European Council together with Marco Pan- nella who I cannot see here for the moment but who loves taking such actions. I can understand that at times this seems to be the only way out in a world in which otherwise nothing would budge one iota \u2014 at least not towards serious appropriate action which meets our present knowledge of the need for develop ment cooperation in the world and which does not smack of paternalistic charity but fosters true develop ment. Mr President, as usual the final item in the Michel resolution calls for it to be forwarded to the Council and the Commission. I strongly urge you to deal with this matter differently and in your capacity as Presi dent to seek out the Council in person and armed with our resolution to make the same case as we have made before world public opinion by today's debate. There is some urgency if we do not wish to lose the race against death. (Applause) President. \u2014 I call the European People's Party (Christian-Democratic Group). Mr Vergeer. \u2014 (NL) Mr President, ladies and gentle men, I would like to join in thanking and congratulat ing our rapporteur, Mr Michel, on the excellent report which he has presented to us today. This report takes as its point of departure paragraph 56 of the Ferrer\u00f2 resolution of September 1980, which quite clearly states that the Committee on Development and Coop eration and other responsible committees must exam ine what demands have or have not been made and ensure that reports on these must be submitted to Par liament at specific times. This request is now being followed up, and my Group feels that we cannot be content merely to take note of the measures worked out by the Council and the Commission since September 1980. It is our duty to express a political opinion on these. Millions of lives are at stake. My group \u2014 and I want to make this quite clear \u2014 wishes to assess the Council's and Com mission's policy realistically. We refuse, Mr President, to create the illusion that Parliament is in a position to see to it that the problems of poverty and world hun ger can be solved in the short term. We believe it our duty to do our utmost to ensure that the Council and Commission act on the decisions reached by Parlia ment on this matter. And I must be perfectly frank \u2014 my Group is disappointed about this. I echo the ques tions put by the rapporteur \u2014 what has the Council in fact achieved? Of course, I am grateful to the Presi dent-in-Office of the Council for his detailed report, but he should not be annoyed when I say that I have the feeling that if we hold a similar debate this time next year, the Council President then in office will not have all that many changes to make to this morning's address. Mr President, the problem should be studied and coordination is necessary, but we have reached a ",
        "No 1-286/120 Debates of the European Parliament 16.6. 82 point when action is called for. We all know that since the Ferrer\u00f2 resolution was adopted in September 1980 the food supply situation has deteriorated and there is absolutely no question of any improvement. In September 1980 Parliament gave a clear indication of the causes of this appalling situation in a detailed report comprising four main chapters: combating hun ger in the framework of new relations between indus try and the developing countries; the development of agriculture and of rural areas in the developing coun tries; food aid and the Community; and finally, inter national trade in agricultural produce and foodstuffs. Today's rapporteur deserves credit for having dealt with this European programme, which was presented to Parliament in September 1980, as a central topic of the present report. Mr President, it is as well also to point out that the assessment of the results of the September 1980 reso lution, which was conscientiously carried out by the Committee on Development and Cooperation, coin cides with the conclusions we reached with our Afri can partners in our mixed working party 'World Hun ger' of the Joint ACP-EEC Committee. The EPP Group is willing to support the motion for a resolution but feels that this problem must be dealt with at the next Council meeting. It is essential that Parliament, the Council and the Commission should adopt a joint approach in the fight against poverty and hunger in the world and that the motion should be given the priority it deserves. We are faced with three major political options in today's debate: either we leave things as they are, and that means that we resign ourselves to the economic status quo in which the strong profit at the expense of the weak, that we no longer need to discuss the progress of the North- South dialogue, and that efforts to achieve a new and fair distribution of the fruits of the earth remain frus trated. Or, secondly, we could launch a spectacular programme about which we have heard a great deal recently \u2014 shaking public opinion out of its apathy, appealing to the media for their cooperation and the releasing of large amounts of money. Or, thirdly \u2014 and this is the proposal put forward by the rapporteur and repeated by the Commissioner \u2014 we could com mit ourselves to long-term joint action against hunger; although a long-term approach, it is also realistic. Mr President, this last option would be an important step which would require immense effort at every level. This path, although it could at times prove diffi cult, is the one which my Group most unequivocally favours above all other more dramatic approaches. We are in favour of a purposeful and consistent policy. I can assure Parliament, and also the Council and the Commission, that the Group of the European People's Party is prepared not only now but also in the future to cooperate with others towards achieving a consist ent policy and to make a constructive contribution to the combating of this appalling problem. President. \u2014 I call the European Democratic Group. Mr C. Jackson. \u2014 Mr President, on behalf of my group I also wish to thank Mr Michel for the excellent and thorough report in front of us. It is indeed a wor thy successor to previous important reports on the same subject and my group is pleased to give its sup port, subject to a few amendments. The report rightly lists many things to be done. In some areas progress has been too slow and in some areas administration has not been adequate. However, my group strongly supports the general philosophy and approach recently outlined by the Commission and particularly by Commissioner Pisani. He was, in my view, right to respond as he did to the register motion calling for the expenditure of 5 billion ECU, particularly when he said that only lengthy analysis, research, definition and organization can make the rich countries' contributions to combating hunger in the world effective and useful. Mr Pannella has achieved a triumph in stirring people's hearts, and I salute him for this. But I believe on reflection that our Parliament will agree that the Commission's more measured response will be of greater long-term help to the poor and hungry of the world. I was pleased that in this speech the Commissioner mentioned population. If we look at our past debates, consideration of the problem of hunger by this Parlia ment has been curiously one-sided. Twenty years ago there were 350 million people, it is estimated, suffering from malnutrition in the world. Today that figure is more like 500 million. To borrow a phrase beloved of American economists, we have concentrated too much on the supply side of food and too little on the demand side by people. Clearly, population is increas ing in the world at a rate which outstrips our ability to supply food, and the result of this can only be misery. So it is time that the Community, whose absence from the list of donors for population planning is notable, took another look at the subject, as we have recom mended in our Amendment No 151. You know, for every 10 people in developing countries today there will be 15 in less than 20 years time. There will be 4-5 billion people in the developing countries alone, the same as the world's total population today. Let me take one extreme example. In Kenya popula tion growth today is about 4% per annum. 4% sounds a small enough figure, but it means that Kenya's popu lation today \u2014 some 16 million people\u2014 will have grown to 32 million, i.e. doubled, by the end of this century. Now such rates of population growth carry the seeds of total tragedy. The effects of such increases are that some countries are already using marginal land for crops. For them a larger population will make self-sufficiency wellnigh impossible. Increasing num bers of people has led to over-grazing and over-culti vation leading to soil erosion. Deforestation to provide land and fuel, for wood is the world's main fuel, is ",
        "16.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/121 C.Jackson going to provide a serious ecological problem; and, of course, more people means greater shortage of water. The years of dedicated effort since the early 1950s, the shiploads of food, the millions of dollars \u2014 in one sense they have all failed to cure the problem of hun ger, and one key reason is population growth. So I ask the Commission to study seriously what the Community can do to help those countries with rapid population increases that wish to reduce their rate of increase. I would like to see the Community provide a centre for research and information on population planning backed by cash to help developing countries put population planning into effect. Can we not bring to bear on the population problem some of the research and analysis of which the Commissioner rightly spoke in other directions? May we not find that funds and effort directed to reducing the surge of population may do more for human welfare and hap piness than simply voting more food aid, food aid which in any case proves inadequate? Mr President, even this morning we have had a call for more food aid, but I believe that this House and the Commission should take note of the increasing reser vations expressed by experts about food aid. I know that the Commission has a major study in hand and I look forward to the results. In a report to Congress in 1979 the US-Government called for fundamental changes in the way project aid was administered and managed. In 1980 the Canadian umbrella organization for charities, the Council for International Coopera tion, recommended to Parliament that 'except in cases of emergency, food aid should be abolished'. Now these recommendations follow a long history of difficulties with food aid. It seems that it has several disadvantages. It acts almost like a dependence-creat ing drug depressing local farming and taking people away from the local markets. I find it depressing to record the view of a World Bank official who asked whether supplementary feedings for children as part of an educational programme and of the development process provide the answer to the nutrition problem for children. He continued, and I quote: 'One would like to say yes, but extensive literature and experience on the subject tell us the answer is no.' I am beginning to wonder whether we shouldn't reserve food aid for emergencies alone. The corollary to this is that food strategies are the most promising way forward that I have heard. They must be advanced with all speed, but such strategies will require \u2014 and I know the Com mission realizes this \u2014 more coordination and more effective analysis than hitherto. I think that the most serious criticism we can make of all aid efforts of our own or others round the world is that in the past, desperate to provide as much cash and food as possible to those in need, we have forgotten to make use of the greatest tool for the advancement of civilization. I refer to the scientific method, where painstaking analysis of results leads progressively to greater understanding and to more effective inputs. The figures show our failure. We must be prepared to devote more of our aid effort to such analysis, which alone can ensure that our efforts not only help to the utmost but avoid harm. Mr President, finally I would emphasize just one point in the Michel report. In paragraph 10 we ask for more consistent support of voluntary organizations. I was grateful last year when the Committee on Develop ment and Cooperation and this House gave support to a Conservative amendment in the budget providing considerable extra funds for voluntary organizations. They can get to the grass-roots in countries with an effectiveness denied to government organizations. I hope this paragraph will be given priority and empha- In these remarks I have tried to look more to the future than to the past so comprehensively and well dealt with by Mr Michel. A relatively new Commis sioner and a very new Director-General are bringing significant changes to that part of the Commission that deals with development matters. We shall continue to monitor their progress but we wish them well, for in the fight against hunger we are indeed all on the same side. And I hope the future will see the Commission, the Parliament and the Council working together more effectively than in the past to make an even more effective contribution to relieving hunger in the world which is by any standards one of the greatest issues facing our time. President. \u2014 Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the House I welcome to the official gallery a number of visitors, including five Nobel Prize winners and the mayors of several European cities. (Applause) Parliament is delighted that such a lot of interest is being shown in today's debate on this very important topic. I extend a very warm welcome to our visitors. I call the Communist and Allies Group. Mr Ferrer\u00f2. \u2014 (IT) Mr President, other speakers have already mentioned this but I still feel that it is important not to forget that more or less one and a half years have passed since Parliament held its first major debate on hunger and more than two years since we started work on this issue, which is not just distressing but also and above all, become increasingly more serious. Combating hunger is today one of the basic proving grounds for the Community's ability to contribute not just in words but in deeds to creating a new relation ship between the North and the South of the planet. ",
        "No 1-286/122 Debates of the European Parliament 16.6.82 Ferrer\u00f2 What has happened over this period of time? I think we must state quite clearly that little has been achieved. Naturally, we have met and are meeting with difficulties. We know that the real solutions are long-term ones. We are against brief and spectacular bursts of energy. That is why in September 1980 we made working, specific and in some respects 'mini malist' proposals, but the Council did not even follow us along those minimum lines. Over all these months the Commission has not been able to bring about real change and Parliament itself has adopted conflicting attitudes, particularly, as has been mentioned here, . during the last two budget debates. This is what we must draw attention to. It is true, Mr Pisani, that when combating hunger things have to be done well and properly. However, they must also be done with the necessary speed. In some respects we have been found wanting as a Community \u2014 we have been wasting time. Of course, Mr Pisani, hunger is a scourge. It is the sick ness of mankind, but it is similarly true that up to now the cure has been far from sufficient. Today we have learned of the steps taken by the Council, however hestitant and limited they are. We have particularly lent a friendly ear to the proposals put forward by Commissioner Pisani, but we have to say straight away that it does not seem to us that there is as yet \u2014 not just of good intentions but also of the effects they may have \u2014 any sign of the change required to produce a qualitative leap in the whole Community development policy. In any case Mr Pisani, I feel that we will have to return to these proposals in the next few months in order to check on their implementation and efficacity. It would be a ridiculous pretence to try to examine them now in the few minutes we have available. I should instead like now to stress a different aspect of the problem. Over the last few months, in my opinion, a great deal of confusion has been engendered. We have seen, during the discussions over the past few months, the emergence of an inflexible, in my opinion dangerous opposition of views where there are defin itely differing approaches but where under specific cir cumstances they may be basically complementary. The two opposing viewpoints would seem to be, on the one hand, those who are 'blinded by immediacy' and would like to see sensational and spectacular solutions, and, on the other hand, those who are working in depth, assidously and with a view to the long term. The objection to these long term approaches are that structural intervention runs the risk of becoming an alibi for postponing action or, in some cases, not doing anything constructive at all. I should like to reiterate that in my opinion this is a sterile opposition of views and I also think that it is misleading. Does anyone really disagree with what was at the heart of the 1980 report \u2014 and which is once more the focus of policy in the Michel report \u2014 that only development can really combat hunger? Who cannot see the limitations of a policy of assistance based on generosity but which holds in it the danger ous seeds of dependence? At one and the same time, however, who is not aware of the need to hurry things through? This is not just necessary for what are, so to speak, humanitarian reasons: it is a political require ment inasmuch the scandal of starvation is shot through with conflicts which can have explosive con sequences for us all. First and foremost the fight against hunger is nowadays becoming a symbol of po litical determination, of choosing sides. In other words, we cannot escape this crisis by making cut backs, which, over and above being selfish, are short sighted. We can, on the contrary, find a way out by establishing a new relationship with those peoples which for a long and specific period of history were, I think we can say, despoiled, in order to provide a basis for the growth and development of the industrialized world. Mr President, I have much appreciated the clarity, energy and courage of Mr Pisani. I share the basic po litical inspiration behind his opinions. However, I must forcefully reject the view that in the fight against hun ger and underdevelopment, the 'timescale' is decisive. I should also like to say that the correlation between objectives and financial resources is just as decisive. What prevents us, Mr Pisani, from starting straight away or rather what has prevented us from having started some time ago, some months ago, to do what needs to be done \u2014 albeit with the staggered approach which you are referring to here today? We have been talking about food strategies for years now. How many is the Community now supporting, apart from the three which are now being spawned? Food aid? We all agree that it is needed, even though we all also agree that it ought to be totally reworked proposals are forthcoming, as Mrs Focke well knows. But things have more or less continued as before. How many triangular transactions has the Commission furthered over the last few months? How many multiannual agreements has it aided? How has it linked food aid to programmes for agricultural and rural devolopment projects? I do not think that our real choice is between doing things quickly and badly, or doing things properly and in the long term. I think we should take care lest this type of logic should gain the ascendancy, that is a logic of a two-speed system. If we adopted one speed for emergencies and another for real change, then all we would succeed in doing is never dealing with emer gencies and never achieving real change. What we ought to do \u2014 in my opinion \u2014 is not to be examin ing objectives and plans which are already in existence but to be setting in motion immediately and respond ing to both immediate needs and requirements for structural change. This is where the real difficulty lies, and I feel sure that Mr Pisani is perfectly aware of this. However, this ",
        "16.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/123 Ferrer\u00f2 is the sphere in which our political action and Euro pean initiatives should operate. This is why I do not believe in party powerplay, in passing the buck of responsibility from those who adopt a serious and 'structural' approach and the 'uto pian' demagogues. This is similarly why I do not see, in spite of Mr Pisani's warning, any contradiction between these two \u2014 on the contrary I see them as complementary approaches (even though I do not agree with the figure given, approximately five billion dollars) between the Michel resolution and the motion for urgency which I and others signed and which I feel, in spite of the procedural difficulties this would raise, could be merged with the text we are voting on this afternoon. There is in my opinion another topic to which we ought to draw attention, even if this is not so immedia tely obvious. It nonetheless exists and is the problem or dilemma which is now becoming apparent of having to choose between what one might call 'external' and 'internal' solutions. Let me explain. The North-South dialogue has ground to a halt and there is a temptation to do without it and to seek \u2014 I am naturally oversim- plifiying here \u2014 political solutions, solutions which are basically internal, such as policies on prices, stor age, training etc. These are all extremely important matters which ought to be encouraged and supported. But we should take care lest we lose sight of the broad scope of the problem! We must be careful lest we lose sight of the fact that there will be no real means of combating hunger and solving the food crisis without reforming the international economic order. Does this mean that we have to wait for a sort of 'world socialism' in order to tackle this problem? Absolutely not. We must get our ideas straight and realize that there are no short-cuts. The alternative to dependence, exploitation and hunger is not isolation, the alternative is to change the world market and to change international economic and monetary rela tions. Another thing, Air Pisani, where have we got to in the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy? This is definitely something which is needed within Europe, but it is also a precondition for combating hunger and establishing new relations with the Third World. Above all, Mr Pisani, how far have we got with the European initiative towards restarting the North- South dialogue and advancing global negotiations? I feel sure you will agree that on this subject our disap pointment is more than well-founded. Basically we must never lose sight of the fact that backwardness and hunger are the outcome of a whole range of internal political options and international circumstances . . . President. \u2014 You have greatly exceeding your speak ing time. I must ask you to conclude. Mr Ferrer\u00f2. \u2014 (IT) ... As I was saying, therefore, the combat against hunger ought to be pursued internally, through policies which make due allowance for agri culture, within the framework of balanced expansion, and externally through international cooperation and a change in the mechanisms which give rise to exploi tation, dependence, poverty and hunger. This is our challenge and this is the path mapped out two years ago by Parliament and today reiterated in the Michel report \u2014 a report whose significance and in many respects exemplary nature I should like to stress. It is our hope that Parliament, over and above its albeit very real divisions, and whilst guarding against the risk of simply denying all opposition, will once more be able, as in September 1980, to express a joint political determination which is both strong, well-defined and united, since this is the essential weapon in our strug gle against hunger and underdevelopment. (Applause from the Left) President. \u2014 You have greatly exceeded your speak ing time. I must ask you to conclude. IN THE CHAIR: MR LALOR Vice-President President. \u2014 I call the Liberal and Democratic Group. Mr Poniatowski. \u2014 (FR) Ladies and gentlemen, today's debate highlights the responsibilities should ered by a minority of people belonging to a minority of States \u2014 some of which we are. The stakes are too high for this issue to be brought down to a simple con trast of two approaches, on the one hand should we encourage organized, methodical and in-depth long- term measures or take urgent short-term steps? There is no point in our fooling ourselves, even were the United States and the Soviet Union, which do very little in the field of aid, to unite their efforts with those of Europe, we would still be a long way from solving either the long-term or the immediate problems. The true needs are boundless. In all fairness Mr Michel has clearly outlined, in his excellent report submitted on behalf of Parliament's Committee on Development and Cooperation, the broad guidelines of a set of intelligent and effective measures. I should like to thank him for the top-class views he has put forward today. We should also give Mr Pannella credit for the stubborness with which he is attempting to focus ",
        "No 1-286/124 Debates of the European Parliament 16.6.82 Poniatowski attention, with the aid of the Nobel Peace Prizewin ners, of our national parliaments and of European public opinion on the crucial issue with which we are now faced. We are constantly torn between efficiency and gener osity. Efficiency bears the stamp of logic, realism and stands the test of time. Generosity ignores all these things and calls for urgent action. In fact, we are not here faced with a choice but with a twin-pronged approach. Ordinary people, governments, non-gov ernmental organizations and a multitude of measures must be brought forward both on the one hand to draw attention to the problem but also, it is true, in order to act. The plan to combat world hunger requires, as Mr Michel's report which following in the footsteps of Mr Ferrero's report so brilliantly under scores long-term measures to shape the future: prohi biting desertification, household energy savings, vil lage water systems, the storage of farm produce, research applied to the existing terrain and crops, food crop growing and above all population control, and I should like in particular to stress this issue which has not been sufficiently alluded to. This will be the main subject of my speech today. We ought fully to realize that if things continue as they are now doing, at the end of this century our pla net will be even more overpopulated in relation to its resources. This means therefore that it will be even poorer and more ill-fed. Pollution will be higher and a portion of our natural resources gone for ever. We all know the figures : world population has doubled since 1940 and will double again in the coming 40 years. At the end of this century, these four and a half thousand million inhabitants will grow to six thousand two hundred million and more than likely to eight and a half thousand million around 2020/2025. It is not so much the size of the population as the speed of its growth which causes the problems. Of the regions involved, Africa is experiencing the fastest increase. It has gone from 175 million inhabitants in 1940 to 500 million this year. It will almost certainly total approximately 900 million at the end of the century and 1 300 million in 2020. It is the part of the world which is at the moment experiencing the highest popu lation growth, almost 3% on average and 3-9% in Kenya. Some countries, such as Nigeria, will treble their population between now and the year 2020, i.e. in a very short space of time 50 years at the outside. If very stringent measures are not implemented in order to change the current trend, at the beginning of the third millenium and in spite of limited progress, there will be more than four thousand million human beings who are meagrely or ill-fed, one and a half thousand million of whom will be near starvation. Contrary to popular belief, Africa is the most threat ened continent. Africa, almost all of which is linked to the Community through the Lom\u00e9 conventions is a continent whose plight we cannot ignore. Whereas real progress has been made over the last five or six years in South America and in Asia, where India, Pakistan and Bangladesh have managed to increase their farm production, in Africa on the con trary the food situation is steadily worsening. The rate of growth of agricultural production fell in the Seven ties below the population growth rate in almost all African states. Per capita food production dropped by 7% in the Sixties, 15% in the Seventies and is likely to continue to fall in the Eighties. Exports have fallen off and the share of the African continent in world trade has decreased for a large number of basic products. Meanwhile, cereal imports doubled in the Seventies and will probably treble between now and the middle of the Eighties. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, most of what we have to do can be found in Mr Michel's report. These are the foundations of the edifice, but we will certainly have to go further than this because the figures I have given you show that the problem is so vast that North and South must truly consult each other on a major scale in order to solve these difficulties. Reference is often made to the nuclear or atomic hazard. Well, the hazard we are now faced with, that of the population explosion, if it is not properly treated with food and farm resources compensating population growth, has far wider-reaching implications. Mr President, I should like to thank you for having allowed me to speak for a few moments longer than my speaking time. (Applause) President. \u2014 I call the Group of European Progressive Democrats. Mr Isra\u00ebl. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentle men, we are once more gathered here to celebrate a political communion. We are holding a major debate on hunger in the world. You will, I hope, not take it amiss if I do not join wholeheartedly in this ceremony and if I try to be a little more down to earth. Firstly, I should like to praise the steps taken by leading Euro pean personalities, whose determination is making it possible to further the struggle against hunger in the world. I am thinking in particular of the Nobel Peace Prize holders, the mayors of France and Italy and all the political figures who have taken part in Operation Survival 1982. The measures before us are split right down the mid dle. On the one hand, there are those who would immediately like to push the aid required, because the need for urgency is so strikingly clear and the calls for help so drastic, and then there are those who, with their great technical expertise, feel that all we do ought to be planned and organized. I should like to say \u2014 to some extent as a criticism aimed at those who think that this should all be planned and organ- ",
        "16.6. 82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/125 Israel ized, that far too often companies and even sometimes governments use their funds in order to stimulate the production of competitive crops to be sold on the world market with adverse effects on the satisfaction of the food requirements of the people in developing countries. Very often, Mr President, entirely commer cial considerations appear to mask the absolute prior ity which must be given to food and subsistence crops. I should like to add that the task of developing agri culture is not being pursued with the requisite energy. Many of the existing structures function badly, and it is distressing to observe that the Technical Centre for Agriculture and Rural Cooperation, set up under Lom\u00e9 II, has never really got off the ground. It would definitely be of interest to think about setting up a European Foundation combining all the national foundations of the same type, of a non-profitmaking nature, which would act as a coordinating body and make sure that best use was made of land, as our dis tinguished colleague Michel Debr\u00e9 has already sug gested in the Ferrer\u00f2 report. However, this move towards developing agriculture will be slow. Self-suffi ciency in food supplies of developing countries is and remains a long-term objective. In this case, should we go back to the generous approach of our motion for urgency? Should we reject any chance of further expansion of European agriculture when this is the means by which we can help the Third World? In other words, and without wishing to go to the extreme of pursuing a policy of farm surpluses, ought we not to stress the importance of continuing the expansion of our agriculture? It is not possible at one and the same time in a burst of generosity and humanitarianism to desire an energetic food aid policy and then, during budget or farm spending debates, to reduce our food production or prohibit farm surpluses. Certain people may raise the objection that some products are impossible to market since they go against particular eating habits or even religious taboos. In my opinion, this type of argument is unrealistic. Most of our European surpluses can be consumed by Third World populations, whose eating habits, even those dictated by religion, are not irrevoc ably fixed. The policy of aid to the Third World is the natural corollary to the Common Agricultural Policy. And I should like to reiterate quite forcefully here today that food aid should not be decided on criteria related to the type of regime of the country concerned. In this connection, it should be remembered that the Michel report has perhaps the slight shortcoming of not imposing sufficient constraints. Some Member States still have to commit themselves to observing, from 1985 onwards, the United Nations resolution estab lishing government development aid at 0-7% of GDP. This is the aim of one of the amendments we have tabled. In addition, Europe ought not be alone in making these efforts. The United States, Japan and the Soviet Union ought also to take part in boosting the struggle against world hunger. Is it not somewhat sur prising that, whilst Community aid represents 0-46% of the gross internal product, that of the United States represents only 0-27%, of Japan 0-32% and as Mr Michel rightly pointed out, that of the Soviet Union 0-03%. But first and foremost, Mr President, the struggle against world hunger is a means of furthering the right to live, which is the basic right of all human beings, and from which all the other human rights to which the European Community is attached take their source. The right to live, that is the real issue we are debating here today. (Applause) President. \u2014 I call the Group for the Technical Coor dination and Defence of Independent Groups and Members. Mr Pannella. \u2014 (IT) Mr President, one of our col leagues \u2014 Mr Isra\u00ebl \u2014 has just said that this debate is like celebrating a mass or a rite. I agree wholeheart edly with him, Mr President. However, the mass in question is a requiem \u2014 the more people try to deny this the truer it becomes \u2014 and a ceremony for laying to rest not only those who are willing to die, but also the moribund, whom we pretend not to see. Mrs Focke and Mr Ferrer\u00f2 have already, for the most part, expressed my thoughts on the inconclusive and irrelevant nature of the Community's action, and its sheer inadequancy \u2014 through the joint responsibility of the Council and the Commission. They are trying to hoodwink people by saying that, whereas Parlia ment reasons with its heart and offers lofty ideals, the Commission and the Council are bodies which act, and with the full knowledge and awareness of what they are doing, since they have the know-how and it is their responsibility to do the actual work. But I feel that this claim reveals their intellectual arrogance, which is the very thing which deprives them of the ability to observe, criticize and take action. The point is that we do not have here Pascal's 'reasons of^the heart' set against Descartes' reasons of nature, be they mathematical or more or less abstract in a Cartesian way. We are dealing with facts here. What we are celebrating here, Mr Pisani, is an old and nau seating rite. Only masters of rhetoric and their adepts would maintain anything else! For a time \u2014 and a long time, too \u2014 individuals and whole societies were exterminated for the sake of grand plans for society and men, as a result of the savage zeal of revolutionar ies or conservatives whose arrogant pride, betraying none of the virtues of Lucifer, led only to degeneracy and destruction. This is the tragedy of our history, whenever religious or political fanaticism has made people say: for the sake of our dream for society, we do not care about those who will have to pay here and ",
        "No 1-286/126 Debates of the European Parliament 16.6.82 Pannella now with their extermination, just so long as this model of development is built! This was true of the Volga-Don projects in the 1930s, is true of Draconian tax policies and the illusions of centralized power which, right or left, have always been part of some kind of class struggle, doomed to failure in the end. Since you have already spoken for 26 minutes, Mr Pi sani, I get the feeling that you are more keen on mon ologues than dialogue. But we in this Parliament, with the reports by Mr Ferrer\u00f2, by Mrs Focke on the ACP-EEC meeting, and now, today, by Mr Michel, have been spelling it out since July 1979. What we have been saying, over and over again, has enabled you to come here today with your four proposals for action which, in reality, can be found in our docu ments dating from two years ago. It is not up to us to congratulate ourselves on the fact that you have finally grasped the point! It is our task to ask you what guar antees you can give us that these policies will be rap idly implemented! The fact is that the European Parliament has pin pointed the heart of the structural problem: the 0-7% of GNP for public development aid. You have abso lutely no right, Mr Pisani, to say to the 77 Nobel Prize winners or the national parliaments, or \u2014 for example \u2014 the Italian Christian Democrats or the Socialist Party, or Mr Verges or Mr Poniatowski, that we have allowed ourselves the luxury of being generous with your money, which it is your task to spend. Nor does the intellectual arrogance which grips the Commission entitle you, Mr Pisani, to be unaware of the fact that not a single word of Mr Brandt's report on the North-South dialogue has been included in the Community's document on concrete action! Just think of it, Mr Pisani, not one single word: there is not any hint of a guideline which would affect \u2014 on the one hand \u2014 the arms trade, and, on the other, the setting up of extraordinary funds to finance a structural ac tion programme which is out of the ordinary, but by no means spectacular, Mr Verges! There is only one spectacle and that is the awesome sight of the huge cemeteries needed for the 30 million dead, for those people, who, being neither Spanish nor Italian, are not privileged enough to have a Mr Bernanos or a Mr Pis ani! They do not even have that honour. We believe that a policy worthy of the name must also take into account the very real problems of the legal basis for action and the demands put by the 77 Nobel Prize winners. To speak of a new international order or global agreements in the absence of these factors is merely to mouth empty and meaningless words. All that I wanted to say, Mr President, is that we are trying to achieve what is feasible, even if it means only advancing by 1 mm a day in the right direction. A cer tain individual has had the effrontery to come here and preach realism at us in the name of feasibility \u2014 feasibility which we have created and on which all his ideas are based. But the realism which he is preaching at us has filled cemeteries thoughout the world. I trust that this Parliament, united today as it has been . in the past, can respond appropriately. Unfortunately, those who hold power in the Community today do not want us to be united. There are those who are hoping, Mr Pisani, Mr President of the Council, that Parlia ment will be divided this evening between the 12 sup porters of the Nobel Prize,winners with their Utopian ideals and the strong-minded advocates of creative realism! But no! This idea is an illusion! There is only one argument, whether used by Mr Ferrer\u00f2, Mr Michel, Mr Brandt or by us and the speeches given by Mrs Focke and Mr Poniatowski have demonstrated this. I should just like to add that I may well not have understood Mr Jackson's speech, who spoke on behalf of a group which is nearly always present here. Today however, fate decreed that he would be a solitary figure. Did you realize, Mr Jackson, that there wasn't even one other conservative to listen to what you had to say? (Applause) President. \u2014 I call Mr Fuchs. Mr G. Fuchs. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, ladies and gen tlemen, Mr Michel's excellent report and the oral questions connected with it are the subject of today's debate, a subject which is both dramatic and scandal- It is dramatic because, even in the midst of the bloody conflicts which are being waged throughout the world at this very moment, we cannot ignore another kind of violence, which is even more fundamental and unac ceptable, in that it abandons millions of human beings to a state where they do not have enough to eat. How can we possibly forget that tens of millions of men and women are going to starve to death again this year? It is scandalous that such a situation exists. While this is happening to them, we in our part of the world are holding ponderous debates on the best way of curbing our agricultural surpluses. While the prowess of our technology is allowing us to conquer space, the atom, and other technical complexities of life, other people are being abandoned to starvation. Has this state of affairs been brought about deliber ately? I do not believe so. In the course of my career, I have met very few people in authority who felt that hunger and war were part and parcel of their political aims or strategies. Nevertheless, war and hunger con front us on all sides. Has this been brought about by indifference? Cer tainly, this is a more obvious explanation. We know only too well that those who enjoy prosperity and peace \u2014 even relative prosperity and peace \u2014 have ",
        "16.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/127 Fuchs never evinced much interest in the problems of others, or much desire to help solve such problems. It is only too true that indifference often serves to shield selfish interests. I should like to pay tribute to Marco Pan- nella for his attempts to penetrate this indifference and to combat this egoism which is the basic cause of hun ger in the world. That does not mean to say that Mr Pannella is either the first or the only person to have engaged in such a combat. We are obliged to acknowledge that, far from receding with the years, malnutrition and hunger are on the increase. In the course of the last decade, food production per inhabitant has gone down by more than 1% per year in Africa. Purchases of cereals by developing countries have doubled in volume and quadrupled in price. The number of populations afflicted by hunger has increased. It is therefore essen tial for us now to go beyond a denunciation of the effects of hunger \u2014 to which Mr Pannella confined his speech \u2014 and inquire into the real reasons why hunger exists. Some people attribute malnutrition and hunger to the various climatic disasters which regularly strike the poorest countries in the world. Drought in the Sahel and floods in Bangladesh are examples. Others empha size \u2014 and we have heard some of them this morning \u2014 the huge population increases of these countries with the direct and indirect \u2014 such as ecological \u2014 impact this has on the countries concerned. None of these factors can, of course, be denied, but I should like to point out, particularly to Mr Jackson and Mr Poniatowski, that we now know that the birth rate can be controlled only after there has been a rise in the standard of living, not before. For my part, I should like to stress what I feel to be the main reason for this state of affairs, namely the colonization which was practised in the past and the unequal exchange which continues to operate today. Can ever enough blame be put on the colonists of yesterday and the multinational firms of today, who, between them, have driven peasants off their land so that the notorious export crops could be grown, crops demanded by our cities? In the past, these have been cotton, coffee, sugar, and ground nuts; today they are manioc or soya. The land of the poor is used for the surpluses of the rich, can we ever say this often enough? And what is the outcome of this trend: a fall in the production of basic foodstuffs, a rural exodus and the growth of unhealthy shanty towns on the outskirts of big cities. Is it necessary to remind you that, even today, 80% of cultivated land on the island of Mauritius is planted with sugar cane and more than 50% of cultivated land in Senegal is planted with ground nuts? Must I remind you that, for the majority of these sub-Saharan Afri can States \u2014 who are continually stepping up their food imports \u2014 only one or two of these products for export constitute the source of more than 50% of their export earnings? And finally \u2014 and I can think of no more revealing example of this outrage \u2014 what about the fact that when there was drought in the Sahel region through-out the long years of 1971 to 1973, and great famine, the nutritional value in proteins and calories of all the ground nuts exported was greater than that of the imported food aid? Does that mean that the income resulting from these exports can at least allow the developing countries to purchase in exchange the subsistence goods which their popula tions need? Unfortunately, this is not the case. For years, the purchasing power of these countries for basic products has been going down. This unequal exchange is the last and the most certain purveyor of misery in a number of third world countries. Political empires and direct colonization may well have disap peared, but the strait jacket of economic relations remains, allowing the industrialized nations to impose \u2014 by means of the markets which they dominate \u2014 the trading terms which are most favourable to them and which enable them to reject agreements on prod ucts which would at least guarantee that the wildest fluctuations could be stabilized. There is no point kid ding ourselves, the root cause of hunger is political before anything else. Does food aid constitute the right response to this situation? It is my opinion \u2014 and I want to say this as plainly as I can \u2014 that, as it has been practised up to now, the answer is no. Do not misunderstand me, I am talking about the conditions under which food aid is given. There are of course emergency situations such as natural disasters where it is essential to provide food rapidly for people to survive; there are other distress ing circumstances, such as those\u00b7 of refugees, where only outside assistance is capable of allowing auth orities in a country to cope with the ensuing problems. I must say that, in this particular sphere, the Com munity's intervention may generally be judged favour ably. But when it comes to what is by far the largest portion of food aid \u2014 by which I mean that which is geared to remedying chronic want by the redistribu tion of our surpluses \u2014 then this frequently seems extraordinarily pernicious to me, in both its concep tion and its implemention. The negative impact of this type of aid has been widely acknowledged nowadays. Firstly, by substituting itself for the traditional types of food consumed, new eating habits are gradually created which subsequently prove very hard to reserve. For this reason, a large number of African people, often among the first beneficiaries of our aid, nowa days consume more wheat and rice than millet or sorghum. Western eating habits are assimilated to such an extend that any reverse trend is almost impossible. In Senegal, for instance, attempts to make bread with a mixture of millet and good quality wheat, but darker than the usual bread, have met with total failure. In this way, outlets for traditional cereals are gradually reduced. In the last analysis, food aid halts the own production of these countries and therefore increases the need for itself. What is more, some of the products which are sent under the auspices of food aid to developing countries ",
        "No 1-286/128 Debates of the European Parliament 16.6.82 Fuchs are often highly unsuited to their context. The most vivid example is milk powder. The successful use of this powder, particularly when feeding babies, presup poses the knowledge of basic hygiene rules and the existence of sufficiently pure water. But these condi tions, as we well know, are only too rarely fulfilled. In Africa, 80% of rural populations only have access to insufficiently pure water and there are a great number of slums in Latin America or in Asia whose water quality is also nothing to boast about. In this particular case, the result is an increase in infant mortality, even though such mortality is already high enough, and I must confess that I was very surprised to hear Mr Jackson saying what he did just a short while ago, since only a few weeks ago he proposed the adoption by the Community of a directive to make multina tional firms respect the World Health Organization's code. At a more general level, experience has often shown that food aid contributes to disorganizing and discour aging local production in a country, either because, for political reasons, it is distributed free or at prices lower than the costs of local production, or because it arrives on the market at the wrong time. In any case, this has the ultimate effect of making the country con cerned more vulnerable. Finally, at a more fundamental level, aid changes the attitudes of those who receive it, inducing dependency and debilitating the will of beneficiaries. Some leaders of third world countries are content to go along with this, since, in the short term, it consolidates their posi tion, but others, who are in the majority, fortunately, quite rightly refuse to content themselves with shaking the begging bowl and insist on dignity and respect. Necessary as food aid is in quite specific circum stances, I cannot say forcefully enough that multiply ing it tenfold in order to fight hunger will only aggra vate imbalances and increase existing dependency even more. Since I am practically certain that this would only make the situation which we are supposed to be fighting worse, it would be a tragic mistake. If we fight only the effects and not the causes, if we try to sepa rate the campaign against hunger from the world wide struggle for development, if we try to disassociate the problem of hunger from that of North-South relations as a whole, we are only going against our avowed aim. Just as charity has never led to the re-establishment of social justice, so food aid as it is now practised will never be able to abolish hunger. When I tabled the oral question \u2014 together with other Socialist members of the Committee on Cooperation and Development \u2014 and which I have just submitted, I did so in the hope that the Commission would echo and back up my analysis and that its plans would have a different purpose in view, that of supporting food strategies which aim at self-sufficiency for the popula tions concerned. To conclude, I must make my point one more time: developing countries are not asking for charity, they are asking for justice! Except in emergencies, it is not help which must be given them, but our cooperation in meeting the objectives which they themselves have defined. The war against hunger will only be won on these terms. President. \u2014 I call Mrs Cassanmagnago Cerretti. Mrs Cassanmagnago Cerretti. \u2014 (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I trust that you will allow me first of all to congratulate Mr Michel on his report, in which he has summed up the problems facing the Council and the Commission, and allow me from that basis to move on to three essential considerations which, in my own view, involve quite fundamental decisions. First, the Bucharest conference on planned parenthood, so as to make sure that we do not speak of, or rather accuse, third world countries without taking account of the proposals they themselves made at that conference. And then there was a second important conference, the one held in Paris and Cancun, in which the devel oping countries cast light on a number of specific deci sions to be made relating to a number of problems. But the fact remains that despite the efforts made so far by international authorities to cope with this situation \u2014 which is accepted as morally indefensible \u2014 the results achieved so far remain very modest and at a far lower level than the efforts which the situation objectively requires. The European Parliament has already spoken out about the problem of hunger in the world in its resolu tion of September 1980, addressed to the Community authorities \u2014 Council and Commission \u2014 but not only to them; almost two years later we find ourselves obliged to propose the same action with renewed urgency following the deaths of another million human beings as a result of starvation, malnutrition and disease. For its own part, at the recent conference held in Ire land the European Peoples Party gave some promin ence to the question of hunger in the world and emphasized that alongside other political problems of equal importance a way had to be found to launching an overall development strategy for the third world with coordinated measures, cooperation in finance and the final details left to the requirements of the inhabitants of the countries concerned. All this has to be carried out against a background where power blocks lose their significance and international dia logue is encouraged so that there is a dovetailing of the programmes we all wish to see carried out. We also made clear the need to launch a policy for development and peace by striking a new balance between expenditure on arms and investment in prod uction and infrastructure and social spending. Nobody ",
        "16.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/129 Cassanmagnago Cerretti would deny these countries the right to immediate aid in food supplies or other indirect aid, nor that such aid could be improved in terms of both quantity and quality, but we remain convinced that those principally concerned with development must be those for whom the aid is intended and that that is the only way in which we can gradually bring about the independent development of those countries, by stimulating initia tive, responsibility and self-government. In this respect we are in complete agreement with what Mr Pisani has said. That is to say that we do not wish quite simply to transfer to them planning methods and systems which would be difficult to implant in an ethnic and socio- cultural context different from our own, just as it would be a mistake to offer general aid which runs the risk of being changed into a dangerous way of forcing agreement and consequently a road to catastrophe. Any aid to development must be accompanied by a cultural policy to guide towards research and self suf ficiency the psychological and creative potential of its destin\u00e9es \u2014 a potential which, alas, at present finds its expression only in terms of Darwinian survival. In other cases, where international aid has already proved to have beneficial socio-economic effect, we must promote job training to ensure that whatever is made available in terms of goods and services, of production and social structures, is kept, adapted and maintained, and that we do not \u2014 as we saw with Mrs Focke \u2014 see things which have been built lying idle with no-one to run them. Amongst the financial and technical cooperation pro grammes, microprojects are measures of undoubted value which are easy to manage. The interest of people participating in such projects becomes clearer each time. The 32 ACP states have understood the advan tages for this kind of project which enables the priority needs of small communities to be met rapidly. Refer ence is made to this in the latest report by the Com mission to the ACP-EEC Council of Ministers pub lished a few days ago, and to the satisfaction expressed about the 55 annual programmes which cover the 2 000 microprojects completed between 1976 and 1980. For our own part, we should like to see a significant increase in the financial resources available, some tan gible support for the initiative shown by non-govern mental organizations, which have already performed a notable role and are confident that they will achieve further good results. The truth is that the fight against the scourge of hunger in the world must be given aid urgently, generously and massively against a back ground of universal and specific human solidarity; that aid must be supplied through more flexible budget methods which give priority to human values and which do away with this infamous 1% barrier: that is the only way we shall bring about a development policy which brings all the countries of the world together in a new relationship. As you said, Mr Pisani, we need a tangible policy which brings in the world's young people and women, with sacrifices which every one of us must be, and is willing to make on condition that they can be shown a plan and a real hope for the future. I am convinced that the governments and the citizens of the world will be prepared to follow the example of the Community institutions and give their surpluses for a future of jus tice and to bind the citizens of Europe in true solidar ity with the citizens of the world. (Applause) President. \u2014 I call Mr Pearce. Mr Pearce. \u2014 Mr President, may first of all thank the Commissioner for his excellent contribution to our debate and also the President-in-Office of the Council though I did notice that he omitted me and members of our group from the list of people whom he thanked for their contribution to the ongoing work of the Par liament concerning hunger in the world. May I say that I support Mr Michel's report. I think it is an excellent report and I hope it goes through. It is quite right, Mr President, to remind the world of the grave and frightening problem that we face concerning starvation in the world, not only for the humanitarian reasons that are obvious, but because we in Western countries have reasons of self-interest at stake as well. Access to raw materials, access to export markets, stra tegic considerations should all draw our minds onto the problem of maintaining stability and peace in the world and of the contribution that feeding people properly can make to that aim. I also support what Mr Jackson said, particularly his warnings about the need to concentrate on population .control. For Mr Pan nella's benefit, I was listening to Mr Jackson's speech from over there. Mr Pannella might in future look around a little more carefully before he tries to claim who is in the Chamber and who is not. The real battle today is between the measured prac tical thought-out approach of the Commission, as sup ported by Mr Michel, which will achieve real results in the future, and the demagoguery, the gesture politics and indeed the irresponsibility of the Pannella approach which will achieve nothing. Mr Pannella complains about a monologue from Mr Pisani. We have had in three years in this Parliament a continuous monologue from Mr Pannella, obstructing the work of Parliament and retarding the work of Parliament in considering proper actions in the Community.... (Applause) .. . Including actions in the world of development and cooperation, and Parliament owes no thanks to that Member for what he done to our work. ",
        "No 1-286/130 Debates of the European Parliament 16.6.82 Pearce The sound of Mr Pannella's voice or, indeed, his ironic applause will not feed one hungry mouth, nor will the ill-thought-out emotional and publicity-seek ing programme which he is proposing. The measured approach of the Commission, as we have heard this morning, supported by Council, supported by Mr Michel, will do some good; will help to relieve starva tion and malnutrition in the world. And for that reason I hope that the voice of this House is solidly behind Mr Michel and is opposed to the views that Mr Pannella has tried to introduce in a motion that may or may not be debated tomorrow. President. \u2014 I call Mr Irmer. Mr Inner. \u2014 (DE) Mr President, the hallmarks of this morning's debate were disappointment, recrimina tion, impatience and anger \u2014 and I fully understand why. Nearly two years have elapsed since we debated Mr Ferrero's report and in that time, hardly anything has been achieved. Today we have been treated to hopeful refrains from Mr De Keersmaeker and Mr Pisani, who claim that everything is going to get better. I get the message, but I don't believe it, to paraphrase the words of a great poet. If we are going to analyse how improvements can be made, we ought to have a practical example before us. I am referring to the Community's food aid, which was subjected to thorough analysis by the Euro pean Court of Auditors a short while ago. Their con clusion was that the European Community's food aid policy had failed. This was not because not enough money had been made available. It had failed for much more deep-rooted reasons. The main reason was that the food aid policy had not been incorporated into food strategies and into a general Community development policy. If we had had such a policy, it would also have contributed to a basic improvement in our relations with these destitute countries. Now Mr Pisani is telling us \u2014 and I believe him \u2014 that it has been recognized that this was the wrong path to take. In future, food aid should be given solely to meet the requirements of European surplus produc tion, but should be given to places where it is really needed. Suitable products should be delivered to the right place and at the right time so that the food stra tegies which Mr Pisani has in mind can be promoted. Isn't that just wonderful ! The Court of Auditors also pointed out, however, that the way in which decisions are taken inside the Com munity is not properly organized. I have yet to hear anyone offer any ways of improving this. I fear that all our other plans will inevitably come to grief if we do not tackle this problem soon. A framework directive should now be issued and dis cussions to this end are now in course. Once again, the Council is insisting that the principle of unanimity should be applied for crucial decisions, Mr De Keers maeker. It is this principle of unanimity, that has pre vented responsible decisions from being reached in the past, often because only one single Member State was against. Nevertheless, even the framework directive has provision for a so-called administrative committee which would be able to block decisions or at least to hold them up for a considerable time. These committees are not even Council bodies, but bodies organized by the Member States through which national egoism can be exercised to excess. This wretched situation \u2014 and it will not change unless we do something about it here \u2014 stems from the fact that we have not yet managed to regard food aid \u2014 just like the whole of development policy \u2014 as a true Community policy. If we carry on allowing each Member State to act in accordance with its national requirements, preventing the Commission from imple menting its well thought-out programme, this situation is not going to improve. And if that is so, we are going to find ourselves here in two years time, beginnig this debate all over again! To conclude, I would say that there is no shortage of good will or responsible proposals and programmes, and, above all, there is no shortage of money. In the last few years, quite sufficient money has been doled out for these purposes. But what is lacking is the polit ical decisiveness to conceive of aid to development \u2014 and with it, food aid \u2014 as a Community policy. Ladies and gentlemen, I am asking you all to do your utmost to achieve this aim. (Applause) President. \u2014 I call Mr Cohen. Mr Cohen. \u2014 (NL) Mr President, Parliament is keep ing to its word; it must do this since hunger is still with us. We began the great debate on world hunger nearly two years ago. We adopted the Ferrer\u00f2 report and today, nearly two years later, we are faced with the same problem. We now have the Michel report before us, and on behalf of my Group I would like to thank Mr Michel for his efforts. It is a very competent report, and we have not tabled any amendments to it. We shall be accepting it, but of course it is nonetheless sad that we now have to return to the same problems. I fear that in two years' time we shall have to discuss these problems again, since they are unlikely to have been solved by then. Commissioner Pisani has said this morning that a new 'food strategy' element is to be introduced into the Community policy, and we are of course grateful to him for this. But we prefer to wait for the results before passing an opinion on the prospects for this ",
        "16.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/131 Cohen new policy. I was incidentally rather surprised, disap pointed and even a little depressed to hear a hint of neomalthusianism in Mr Pisani's speech. Mr Poniatowski, Mr Pisani.. . . . . they must be surprised to find themselves together. This neomalthusianism, which is in fact a pretext for saying that the situation is so dire that we cannot do anything about it and that we do not have the resources to carry out the policy required, belongs in the 19th century and has no place in our present age. We have the technology and resources to ensure that the world's population can be fed. The question is whether we apply the technology and the policy to turn our ideas into reality. I was even more surprised, disappointed and depressed by the speech by the Presi dent-in-Office of the Council. I had the feeling that the President had received the document, which had been competently drafted by one of his officials, for the first time this morning. He read it with difficulty and seemed surprised at everything he had to tell us about all the proposals, studies and investigations which were to be carried out and which would soon improve the world situation. It was an uninspired report. Apparently Mr De Keersmaeker \u2014 and my cirticisms are directed at him, even though he is not listening \u2014 has not yet found the proper strength of conscience or attitude to address us with whole hearted conviction in this debate on hunger. The Community is primarily responsible for the ACP states. Whether we wanted this or not \u2014 and some Member States wanted it more than others \u2014 is imma terial. The fact is that we are first and foremost res ponsible for them, and when discussing world hunger we naturally think first and foremost of the African countries. The Caribbean and Pacific islands do belong to this group, but hunger is primarily an Afri can problem. Through the implementing agreement of section 4 of Yaound\u00e9 I, Yaound\u00e9 II, Lom\u00e9 I and Lom\u00e9 II, we have been occupied with Africa for more than 25 years \u2014 25 years, and nothing has really changed. Africa is a poverty-stricken continent, especially in the rural areas, a continent in which internal savings stagnate and which therefore relies more than others on outside help. Africa is a continent in which the level of farm prices is a crucial factor in economic policy and in which the problem of general education and the level of development are even more vital than technical services and infrastructures. After more than 30 years of development aid to that continent and more than 25 years of the Community's efforts directed towards Africa, it remains an interna tionally acknowledged scandal. Africa contains 20 of the 31 countries considered by the United Nations as being the world's least developed States. It makes little difference to such countries that declarations are made like the one issued at the Versailles summit, which referred to the need for a policy of active cooperation with developing countries to increase their import cap acity. Such countries also benefit little from declara tions like that of the NATO summit, which spoke of the development of the Third World to avoid tensions in potential spots outside the zone covered by NATO. Mr President, I do not deny the importance of these declarations, but neither Mali, nor Niger, nor Tanza nia derive any benefit from them. These countries are concerned with 'bread and butter issues' and in the situation in which they find themselves no blame can be attached to them. It is high time that the Com munity realized that there is little to show for 25 years of effort and that Africa's food imports are increasing rather than decreasing. The almost sacred importance which the Community is accustomed to attach to Lom\u00e9 is becoming less and less credible. Africa is poor and needs help. It is no quirk of fate that money has been found to open up mines in Brazil but not in Africa. It is a sign of the times. Nor is there any point in shedding crocodile tears over this. What we must do is adapt our development policy to Africa's real needs. If we continue to finance large projects, we shall in many cases be doing no more than building cathedrals in the desert. What we must do \u2014 and Mr Pisani has already mentioned this \u2014 is gradu ally change from project to programme aid for Africa, devote more attention to small-scale projects, and try, together with non-governmental organizations, to increase Africa's agricultural capacity. This could all be achieved in the fairly short term. It is not necessary to wait for actual approval of food strategies. We can immediately begin to use the money available in the budget and that resulting from the Lom\u00e9 Con vention in a different way. Already now \u2014 and this is again a short-term idea \u2014 we can enter into negotia tions on Lom\u00e9 III with the firm conviction and resolve that this policy should in th\u00e8 next few years be placed on a different footing. That is what we should do. But because Parliament as such cannot do this, and because we need the policy-making institutions, espe cially the Commission and Council, I appeal once again to both institutions to act quickly in giving a new policy of this kind a fixed form. What Parliament can do is to mobilize public opinion. We must do this, especially at a time like the present, when the econo mic crisis makes it all too easy for us to ignore the needs of the third world and of other countries and concentrate only on the difficulties we are facing here in the Community. For us to be able to continue our efforts successfully, there must be tangible results. Lit tle has been achieved so far, but perhaps the new food strategies will provide some kind of relief. Also, of course, food aid should be geared more to what can be achieved in the future by the food strategies. We can not continue to regard food supplies merely as a con sequence of our own farm surpluses, as we have done ",
        "No 1-286/132 Debates of the European Parliament 16.6.82 Cohen repeatedly and almost exclusively in the past. And despite the fact that there is a sizeable agricultural lobby in this House, the Socialist Group will not hesi tate to stress this point again and again. Parliament has initiated a number of new measures, but they are not enough in themselves. Parliament must also bear the consequences of its measures. It has happened that certain groups, when it was time to vote on the budget and when the continuation of the funds for a new development policy was at stake, have refrained from any action. Parliament, as well as the Council and the Commission, should practise what it preaches. But apart from what we can do within the Community \u2014 and we should give this priority \u2014 we should also consider the international environment in which the Community finds itself and which it can influence. I am thinking of all the decisions which have already been mentioned and which I would like to list briefly: the 0-7% and the 0-15% for the least developed countries, the conclusion of raw materials agreements, sugar \u2014 and here I include isoglucose \u2014 what are in fact the Community's intentions on this?, grain, buffer stocks, the North-South dialogue, the consequences of the Cancun conference, and the reactions to the reso lutions of the Paris conference on the least developed countries. All these are decisions which cannot only be carried out within the Community but which the Community must discuss in an international context. The Community must act from the standpoint of also having responsibilities outside the Lom\u00e9 Convention, and it must accept these. The Socialist Group will con tinue to insist on all these points. IN THE CHAIR: MR VANDEWIELE Vice-President President. \u2014 I call Mr Narducci. Mr Narducci. \u2014 (IT) When we debate a subject like hunger in the world, Mr President, ladies and gentle men, we choose almost instinctively the path of emo tional assault, with such tragic figures on hunger and such a clear link between defence expenditure and underdevelopment and between the arms race and the widening gap between the northern and southern hemispheres. We are all well aware of the facts and figures of the situation; they have been referred to several times not for the purpose of sterile recriminations but as a means of continuing the methodical and impassioned work the main lines of which this Parliament has already indicated and which Mr Michel's report here today has further developed and refurbished. If we were here today merely for the pleasure of debating, then we would have no lack of things to talk about, the more so since we receive constant remind ers be they from the moderate commitment of the West or the total absence of the communist bloc from any development policy. But merely to debate the question of hunger will not save a single life. It is our responsibility and our duty to add to the means and the efficiency of aid from the Community and from its Member States. But I would add that such emergency operations must be implemented systematically with medium and long-term projects whose aim is to eradi cate the problem of hunger. A great many paths have already been indicated, and I have no wish to repeat myself, so I shall do no more than stress that our food aid policies and indeed the emergency aid itself must be reconsidered with a view to integrating them into programmes and agricultural and rural development schemes aimed at improving agricultural output and security of food supply. In brief, I believe that what we have to do is abandon our ideological diatribes and refocus this debate on the agricultural sector of the Third World: the sacrificial lamb of our cooperation policy. Recent evidence from Africans has reminded us of the harsh realities of rural life which continue in too many developing countries : the absence of organized commercial channels, the inadequacy of storage facilities and means of com munication to circulate food products, blocked prices paid to agricultural producers, claimed to be in def ence of urban consumers, inadequate technical resources slowing down agricultural development, the absence of services to popularize the results of agricul tural research which prevents the selection of the crop varietes best suited to local conditions. Crops must be improved, pests must be treated. Lastly, there is no agricultural credit suitable for the needs of the peasant and able to shelter him from usury. And with all these negative factors \u2014 which we must deal with urgently in our plans \u2014 there is one essential cultural factor: too little has been done in the field of alternative training which takes into consideration the realities of rural life and the requirements of agricul ture and encourages real education and awareness of the fundamental values of local society. In our Euro pean programmes a great effort must still be made to give more weight to that hitherto ignored cultural fac tor which nonetheless constitutes one of the keys to real development. Lastly, I must once again stress the special r\u00f4le which is waiting for non-governmental organizations. These organizations must be given more say in the planning and implementing of strategical food security pro grammes, because their experience is irreplaceable. Their needs for co-financing are enormous: the whole of the EEC budget nowadays would scarcely meet half their requirements. Since Giovanni Bersani managed to have the principle of co-financing adopted in Europe in 1976, major progress has been made and a ",
        "16.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/133 Narducci fruitful system of cooperation has been established. We must not fail to take precise account of such trends in the 1983 budget. Once again our words in this chamber, our proposals, will find their real test in the budget. That is a duty which falls to the Commission, and a duty which falls to the Council of Ministers. (Applause) President. \u2014 I call Mr Turner. Mr Turner. \u2014 Mr President, as you will recall, over 7 000 churchgoers in Suffolk and Harwich in England signed a petition to the European Parliament in 1980 on food aid. That compares with only 2 000 who signed a petition on seals this year. I think that shows the relative importance of the two subjects. I have a proposal to make. It is not mine; it is that of the Archbishop of Canterbury which he made in Lon don on 3 June. He made it modestly, of course, as you would expect, but it is a very imaginative and novel proposal. It is that the multinationals should them selves undertake a programme of food aid. How often in this Parliament, when we are debating difficult questions relating to multinationals, have we not heard them say that they wish to take an initiative them selves? Now I believe this is exactly what they can do if they take up the Archbishop's proposal. They may have doubts and others may have doubts, but the source of this proposal is so august and so politically neutral that it should put all doubts to rest. I believe that the multinationals should seize this opportunity. They have the practical expertise, they have an extensive overview of the Third World, they have a most thorough local knowledge in the Third World, they have worldwide infrastructure and local infrastructure in the poor countries. They are in a most excellent position to take up his proposal. Of course, there may be distrust of the multinationals in the United Nations and here \u2014 there often is \u2014 but locally they are very often the most respected institu tion in a poor country and could give practical help to the local inhabitants. They may say: 'Well, where will all this lead?' They may be cautious. I do not know where it will lead, but I would say that if they want to take an initiative, this is the one they should take. They cannot take an ini tiative as imaginative as this without courage and dar ing, and I would aks them to do so. President. \u2014 I call Mr Gremetz. Mr Gremetz. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentle men, hunger in the world is a serious problem to which no one can remain indifferent. In past centuries it has hit populations in large numbers; Europe experi enced death-dealing want and famine at a period when the world economy was mainly agricultural, and man had little control over nature. Today scientific and technical progress has been made in all spheres, including agronomy, the crop and agrarian methods which provide the means necessary to satisfy vast needs. And nonetheless hunger exists. Worse, it is increasing. Thus the number of persons suffering from hunger has been estimated at 400 million. The World Bank consi ders that about 1 000 million persons living in develop ing regions do not have adequate nourishment. Behind the figures and the words, there are, as my friend Danielle De March said at the ACP/EEC Consultative Assembly, the faces of children deprived of smiles and joy; there are mothers who will never see their daugh ters grow into adults; there is the massacre of intellig ence and human creativity. Such a situation is intolerable at the dawn of the 21st century, when there is no world shortage of food products. Yes, we must act immediately in response to the call of those who are suffering and dying, we must act to save lives, to fight poverty, misery, hunger. The countries of the European Community have the resources. Our people are deeply aware of the need. Thus France, as French Communists have long advo cated, has assumed its responsiblities in this field. The French government has decided to increase its aid to the least advanced countries to 0 \u00b7 15 % of the GNP by 1985, in accordance with the conclusions of the Paris Conference. That is a practical, positive decision which should inspire other governments. In the same spirit I welcome the wide condemnation of the use of food as a weapon joiced by the ACP/EEC Consultative Assembly. The European Community, however, is slow in responding to the expectations of the developing countries. It is limiting its food aid. It is excluding countries such as Vietnam. It is stalling as long as it can on the conclusion of long-term agree ments for the sale of agricultural products. It is reduc ing its own production although the FAO forecasts a world food deficit at the end of the century and a con siderable increase in the price of food products on world markets. For our part we are in favour of a substantial increase in the food aid of the Community and of the Member States. If it is negotiated with the recipient States and populations, if it forms part of food self-suficiency strategies, food aid can be a powerful means of con quering hunger and contributing to development. To act against hunger is in fact undeniably to take emer gency action to allay the suffering of men and save lives, to act so that millions of others are not endan gered. It is to make progress towards a new world economic and political order. To combat hunger ef- ",
        "No 1-286/134 Debates of the European Parliament 16.6.82 Gremetz fectively presupposes that one attacks the underlying causes, the roots of the problem, without trying to shield the economic and political forces which are fighting to maintain an unjust world. Hunger in the developing countries is in fact the result of centuries of exploitation, of colonization, of monopoly of the riches produced by imperialism. Hunger is the inability of dozens of young nations to feed their people without aid because their productive systems have been geared to the export of basic prod ucts, because their food economies have been de stroyed, because some large companies make huge profits in exporting and trading in the raw materials. Hunger is the result of the subservience of the econ omies of dozens of countries solely to world market laws. Hunger and its aggravation is the result of the crisis, the result of economies strangled between the rise in interest rates, the inflated prices for manufactured products and the collapse in the prices for basic prod ucts. the mechanisms set up by the Community witness once again the urgency of finding solutions at world level in the framework of the United Nations. The failure of the Stabex has just provided fresh proof of this. On the contrary ACP-EEC cooperation would become truly meaningful if it formed part of active and positive Community action involving global nego tiations and product agreements. Allow me therefore, in conclusion, Mr President, to reaffirm the conviction of the French Communist Party that the struggle against hunger in the world is an integral part of the struggle to establish a new world economic order and is inseparable from the struggle for greater justice and liberty in our country. The struggle against hunger in the world, at the end of the 20th century, is a choice which crops up in all pol itical decisions, it is the choice of justice and solidarity. (Applause) President. \u2014 I call Mrs Pruvot. Hunger is the crisis to which capitalism is incapable of finding solutions and of which it makes the poorest, as in Europe, bear the consequences. As requested by the developing countries themselves, France is taking steps to replace these relationships of domination by cooperation based on mutual advan tage and interest between equal partners. This is the meaning of the proposals made at Cancun by the President of the French Republic in support of global negotiations within the framework of the UN to deal with all these issues. The opposition of the United States and several Community countries is unfortun ately holding up the opening of such negotiations. For our part we have decided to continue our efforts to remove these obstacles, convinced as we are that hunger will not be conquered if an end is not put to the pillage of natural resources, and the economic and political domination inherited from another era. The past is weighty and the forces wishing to maintain it are powerful, but nobody can stifle the rising aspira tions for greater justice in relations with developing countries; this is the purpose of the global negotia tions, the joint fund and the product agreements offer ing producer countries a profitable price for their products. In working towards these objectives our country is not just facing its moral and human responsibilities. Indeed by promoting trade, by working towards a form of cooperation reflecting the needs and choices of these countries, by allowing them to truly develop, we are helping ourselves. The extent of the growing awareness of the convergence of interests between developing countries and peoples and industrialized countries is promising. The limits and inadequacies of Mrs Pruvot. \u2014 (FR) The mobilization of a credit of 40 million ECU for immediate food aid will save 8 million persons from hunger and death during one year. Bravo! We can but welcome the EEC's pro gramme to combat world hunger which was submitted to us today. The first condition for the effectiveness of this pro gramme is that each country have a true agro-food plan adapted to its needs and its resources, thereby making it possible to arrive at individual or collective food self-sufficiency in liaison with other countries of the region. We must insist on the importance of true national food strategies and the urgency of imple menting them. The second condition for the effectiveness of the pro gramme drawn up by the Commission is the rapidity with which it is executed. If there is one sphere in which speed is vital it is that of life. Thus all of us here have an obligation to get results rapidly. We have already lost to much time: let us give the hunger vic tims the physical means of using the economic instru ments and structures which we will help them to set up. This fundamental approach which consists in creating and developing structures on the spot, will make it possible to arrive at consumption and production methods adapted to the inhabitants. We are placing great hope in the so-called 'thematic' measures: fight against desert expansion, economy of domestic energy, village hydraulics, fight aginst endemic cattle diseases, improvement of transport and storage condi tions, etc.; these are the things that will contribute to protecting the natural patrimony of the developing ",

Having said that, Parliament's suggestion to mobilize immediately a sum of 500 000 dollars to be used to combat the high mortality rates by means of a survival programme which will attack the primary causes of this mortality, is not, whatever the Commis sioner may say, in contradiction with his analysis. We are of course aware that only in-depth action can definitively overcome the scourge of hunger and con tribute to a true process of development. This is why I would like to thank Mr Michel for his excellent report and tell him that my group will vote in favour of his motion for a resolution with the conviction of thereby doing something useful. But we are thinking of the living, those that are still living. Commissioner, it is not displaying a taste for spectacular measures, or demagogy, but rather assist ance to persons in danger, to do everything to bring to an end as quickly as possible the pain caused by this secular disease which, if we had faced our responsibil ity much earlier, would not have assumed such cata strophic proportions. Our awareness of the gravity and urgency of the mea sures to be taken, combined with our will to see these impoverished countries become privileged and impor tant partners of Europe, are what determine our politi cal will today. President of the Council, Commisssioner, don't you think that the Council and the Commission should collaborate better with the European Parliament? Don't you think that it would be a good idea to involve it more in the reflection which precedes your decision-making? Mrs Focke said just now that you progressed with the speed of a snail. The truth of this is such that one may wonder, Commissioner, how many persons will remain to be saved when, at the end of your reflections, the Community will finally be ready to take action. (Applause) President. \u2014 I call Mr Verges. Mr Verges. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, today's debate is positive to the extent that it manifests the European Parliament's will to pursue and discuss permanent measures to combat world hunger. Following the Fer rer\u00f2 report, the Michel report is an obvious contribu tion to this objective. However, as we said in the course of the debate on the Ferrer\u00f2 report, the formu lation of the report risks giving rise to confusion. Hundreds of millions of human beings are suffering from malnutrition and undernourishment in the world, tens of millions die each year and amongst them a considerable proportion of children. This is the prob lem posed bluntly and it calls for exceptional measures of far greater proportions than the effort made to date. Having said this, we find it unfair to contrast the need for these new extensive measures, on condition obviously that they are realistic and effective, with the other decisive need for a long-term strategy designed to achieve the food security of countries which are at present constantly threatened by famine. What is important is to do far more both today and tomorrow. Simultaneously there is the problem of fighting under development, of which hunger is just one of the conse quences. At this point, the question assumes world proportions. We are speaking of the situation in the countries of Latin America, Africa and Asia which were colonized for centuries, which remain dependent and which represent almost 80% of humanity. These countries are caught in the spiral of contradictions arising from the present world crisis and their own contradictions: fall in raw materials prices and increase in the prices of industrial products, inflation unleashed by the interna tional monetary disorder, oil bills, increasing indebt edness, galloping demographic growth, outdated land structures, rural exodus, increasing spread of the desert, anarchic urbanization, unemployment, particu larly of young people, deplorable sanitary conditions, catastrophic food deficit. We are witnessing a combi nation of all these factors which is causing the crisis to accelerate, affecting entire continents and hundreds of thousands of human beings. The situation is deteriorating and the gap between industrialized countries and underdeveloped countries is widening. Thus it is a problem which urgently requires structural measures at all levels, whether they be global negotiations on North-South relations, raw material, mining and agricultural agreements etc. It is within such a framework that it will be possible to define a policy of food security for these countries threatened both by hunger and by the food weapon wielded by certain developed countries. At the same time there is the problem of the over-arming of these countries and the obvious link between the problems of the fight against underdevelopment and the fight for peace. The initiatives of the European Parliament, the new Commission proposals are, in\u00b7 our view, and seen in this light, positive to the extent that they reflect a trend in public opinion which, faced with the drama of the third world, is presently finding expression in the manifesto of the Nobel price winners, the position taken by important personalities, members of Parlia ment, churchmen, political parties, trade unions and associations. This is the beginning of an immense movement which will be decisive in making progress towards solving the problem, whatever the diversity, confusion, ambiguity and sometimes the real differ ences in the movement. What is emerging is a new solidarity in response to the necessities of the present situation. ",
        "No 1-286/136 Debates of the European Parliament 16.6.82 Verges But we must have no illusions. Substantial interests are involved. How can one call into question, in twenty years, what has existed for almost five centuries of colonization and dependence at all levels? We are wit nessing the end of an epoch. The world is oscillating between peace and war, between civilization and bar- bary, but where is the civilization, where is the barbary in this drama in which hundreds of millions of human beings are involved? We must progress towards res pect for their right to live, which is the first of all human rights. This presupposes what we call a 'new world economic order' and, in conclusion, Mr Presi dent, I would like to say that I regard this as being inseparable from a new world social order. However, this new social order in the industrialized countries, as well as in the undeveloped countries, also presupposes a new cultural order, that is in the final analysis, a new 'international mental order'. (Applause) President. \u2014 I call the Commission. Mr Pisani, Member of the Commission. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, I am the last to speak and since my only purpose is to reply to the previous speakers, to whom I have listened attentively, I shall be brief. The more so since the speech I gave earlier on behalf of the Com mission enabled me to consider the heart of the prob lem and the position adopted by the Commission with a view to resolving it. I would however like to give you some further infor mation on a number of points. In particular I should like to say that the analysis given just now by Mr G\u00e9r ard Fuchs on food aid, its risks and the immediate need for us to proceed with it, is entirely in agreement with the Commission's analysis. And, since I speak of food aid, I would like to tell Mrs Katharina Focke and one or two other speakers who mentioned the subject that a study has indeed been made of this problem and that, as I said earlier, on 15 July Parliament will be presented with a report of an enquiry into the effects of food aid and into the criticisms which can be lev elled at the administration of that aid. Parliament and Council will be able to use that report as a basis for deliberations. The Commissions will use it as a basis for concrete proposals to redefine food aid, and that in about November and in any event before the end of the year. I think it is sometimes a little unfair that we should be reproached for making reports when we have been asked for reports and for making analyses when analyses are needed. I wonder what action can mean to a man of politics unless there are words to act upon. Do we, in order to be men of politics worthy of that name, have to go down into the street, or should we first try to analyse the problems and find a solution to them? It is my honour to work with this Parliament on the basis of documents I have drawn up with my colleagues, which I put to the Commission and which the Commission puts to the Council. That is what pol itical action is. Parliament and Council will therefore be presented with an analysis and our proposals. I should like to refer again to the problem of demo graphy, which was mentioned by Mr Jackson, by Mr Poniatowski and finally by Mr Cohen. Mr Cohen, I do not believe that I deserve to be reproached for mal- thusianism. I did not say that demographic growth had to be stopped in a drastic and deliberate way. What I said, and I repeat it now, is that two facts of life, which would normally have followed on one from another, exist side by side. Tradition and biological need meant that in former times there was an absolute need to produce ten children in order for three of them to survive and for the family to continue. With modern medicine eight out of ten children survive; sometimes nine, never less than seven, and under those circumstances the familyV survival and the work required of the family no longer depend on having ten children. Families could be quite successful with four or five, but they have not yet adapted their biological rhythm to the health realities of the present day. And I think that an effort to educate, an effort to inform might, without any obligation, without any intention to extinguish life, but with a view simply to organizing life around the new realities, persuade mankind to reduce this growth which, attaining as it does in some countries 4% of the total population and 8% of the urban population, presents us with practically insolu ble problems. I believe simply that demography is one aspect, and just one aspect, not the only aspect of the problem. And I believe that we must in any case approach it with infinite care, because there are ques tions of tradition and questions of conscience. But I believe, to sum up, that the problem deserves to be raised. (Applause from certain quarters) I am grateful to those members who have tackled the question of development in cultural terms. I would like to say that, although today's proposals are not in es sence intended for that aspect, we do consider that, as I said last year at the ACP/EEC Consultative Assembly, the cultural dimension is of great import ance, it is essential and in a way it is the ultimate goal of our efforts, because on the day that that culture, which is part and parcel of a nation's existence, forms part of its everyday reality, that nation will have escaped from the jaws of hunger and will be able to devote itself to development. I believe that this, the Schaal report which was adopted by the Consultative Assembly, could prove the starting point for a most fruitful debate by the European Parliament. Indeed, it is against the back ground of that debate that I raise the question of research, which was mentioned by one or two of you. It is of primordial importance, and I say, I repeat that research cannot find a satisfactory solution in the transfer of technology. The transfer of technology is a ",
        "16.6. 82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/137 Pisani temporary, provisional solution. It is like food aid: the objective must be to make it unnecessary. The fact is that if you transfer technology you transfer national problems, national ways of thinking, you transfer solutions which may be valid here and not valid there. If the transfer of technology is necessary its medium- term aim must be to lead to the establishment of research centres, research networks and research schemes which take up the realities of these countries and their peoples and attempt to solve the problems which are posed by everyday reality. I would now like to consider the question of the rate at which we implement our strategies. First, I should like to repeat that the food strategies we are con cerned with are those called for by the European Par liament. A number of proposals have been formulated within international institutions but I must say in all honesty that my own responsibility for implementing them has shown me that they still need to be given some content. Our work over the last few months, based on a virtually self-evident truth and at the very least our driving motive, has been to define the approach to what could be a food strategy, for three countries, and first of all amongst ourselves in terms of research. Do you believe that it is an a priori truth that the starting point for such a strategy is the release of productive economic forces? Do you think it reasona ble to say without analysis that such productive forces have been paralyzed by a certain number of economic policies? Do you believe that it can be said a priori that to release such forces will produce such or such an effect and do you believe that we have clear means of ensuring that once released those forces do not collide with immovable objects or become entangled in bureaucracy or doubt.\u00b7 Do you think it all easy when we are in Brussels \u2014 or indeed anywhere else, the FAO in Rome or the United Nations in New York \u2014 to imagine what food stra tegy should be, when we can see that every national strategy is different from its neighbours, and different from anything else anywhere else in the world, not just because the natural factors are different, not just because production capacity is different, not just because the tribal and social structures are different but because the political motivation and the political capacity of governments are different. Do you believe that somebody sitting in Brussels with a document a few pages long can decide what there is to be done when it takes hours and hours of negotiations with governments to try and get them to produce their own capacity and their own motivation? Believe me, the few months we have asked for to draw up food stra tegy are not too long. What we are doing with these three countries \u2014 which, by the end of the year, will no doubt be six, is embarking on a great adventure, and adventure which, as I was saying just now, will do away with the inevita bility of failure to which we have become accustomed. Let me explain. We have become accustomed to fail ure becoming inevitable. Is it not a fact with food aid, and the determination to increase food aid, if we say that each day we will give a little more for these coun tries to eat \u2014 are we not admitting that they will inev itably fail to produce whilst we know that they can do so? The building works described just now by, I think, Mr Cohen, which will become deserted cathedrals in a desert, do you not think that accepting that these works will not be 100% useful and that no one will take them over because nobody local has been trained to do so \u2014 do you not believe that that is the inevita bility of failure? Do you not think, on the other hand, that if we set off the process which shakes down the economic forces with a view to mastering them and handing that control over to the people themselves, do you not believe that that should be the fruit of research and determination on which a little time has been spent? The principal point of my speech, however, I address to Bruno Ferrer\u00f2. How, after being a rapporteur your self, Mr Ferrer\u00f2, dare you to say what you just said? How could you do it?... (Interruption by Mr Pannella) President. \u2014 Mr Pannella, if you please. You have not even asked for me to call you. I will allow your inter ruption to be included in the record of proceedings. I call the Commission. Mr Pisani, Member of the Commission. \u2014 (FR) If it wasn't so easy to do it I would have been quite pleased with myself for getting Mr Pannella angry . . . I should like to address myself to Mr Ferrer\u00f2. After that I shall address Mr Michel. Mr Ferrer\u00f2, there is a difference between the two approaches. Because food aid, by which we make means immediately available merely gives more power- to the tendency for these countries not to produce for themselves; because food aid distributed immediately overwhelms the market for basic food products to the extent of triggering a rise in prices which wipes out all the benefit achieved by our aid and because it would lead us, the European Economic Community, to believe that we can always produce more, without reflecting on the danger which that represents to prod uction systems within developing countries. What I am not saying, what I have never said \u2014 indeed I have said the opposite \u2014 is that we must rule out emergency aid altogether. The Community has the management of emergency aid and would like to have more funds available for that aid: what I do say is that there is a contradiction and a danger in raising emer- ",
        "No 1-286/138 Debates of the European Parliament 16.6.82 Pisani gency aid, which is necessary, to the same level as the basic structural effort required from us to establish thriving economies. When this House has strongly endorsed the need to give absolute priority to strate gies, that is to say to the independent production capa city of agricultural developments, then, as temporary and corrective measures, insofar as those strategies are not jeopardized, emergency aid becomes possible and becomes necessary. It is an auxiliary effort, albeit urgent, albeit indispensable, and though everything may incite us to give, it is of only secondary import ance compared with the key policy represented by agricultural production in developing countries. Now, Mr Chairman \u2014 and I trust that Parliament will forgive my fervour, I would like to turn to Mr Michel and tell him in answer to the question which he raised just now that I have already replied in the clearest of terms that the Commission has proposed, the Council is considering and Parliament will debate allocating 184 million EUA to the fight against these situations which we are claiming to be dealing with. 40 million EUA last year and 184 million this year is some improvement. Whether it will be either possible or necessary to give more next year remains to be seen. My own personal belief is that if we reverse the trend of failure and start to show some success, which I believe possible, then needs will increase and we shall be able to tell European opinion and our political mas ters that the money they make available or which we ask them to make available will be useful, since in the last analysis it will be used to increase the food pro duction of the developing countries themselves, in other words to achieve the development which we have been seeking for so long. (Applause) President. \u2014 I call Mr Pannella. it were its own hat and the rapporteur's and to speak twice .. . President. \u2014 You are giving another speech, Mr Pan nella! Write to the Bureau. I will not allow you to con tinue. You are not in Italy now ... (Mr Pannella attempted to continue but his microphone was switched off) Mr Pannella, you are perfectly entitled to ask the Chair a question. If I allow you to speak \u2014 and I knew this was coming \u2014 it is only so that I can tell you to submit your question in writing to the Bureau so that you get a ruling because, frankly, I am very grateful to Mr Pisani of the Commission. On behalf of the entire House I wish to tell him that we are very grateful for the fact that on behalf of the Commission he has accorded such an importance to what we have to say here that he has been kind enough to come and tell us what the Commission intends to do. Now you are making a fuss, Mr Pannella, because the Commission has too much to say. I have never heard of such a thing. Usually ministers are criticized because they do not say enough or because they keep quiet or because they are not willing to say anything. And now you are kicking up a fuss! We have heard enough of what you have to say in the corridors, Mr Pannella. You have not stopped talking all day. It really is too much, Mr Pannella! I call the rapporteur. Mr Michel, rapporteur. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, first of all I should like to thank the President of the Council and the Commissioner, Mr Pisani, for their answers to some of my questions. However there is one point I would like to come back to. Mr Pannella. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, there are certain rules of the game which are there in our Rules of Pro cedure and in the treaties. I do not want to waste time by dragging up the treaties but I am keen to say that according to the treaties and our Rules of Procedure \u2014 and this is quite right \u2014 the institutions, by which I mean the Commission and the Council, speak in this Chamber whenever they see fit to do so. If the pro ceedings in this Parliament are going to be organized, and in accordance with parliamentary precedent, when a big group like the Socialists is given \u2014 I think I am right \u2014 a total of 17 minutes during a major debate and the Christian Democrats get 16 minutes, then you really have to ask the Commission and the Council, when you are organizing the debate, how much time they are going to need when they come to speak. When this question was put the day before yesterday, the answer we got was more or less that by way of something of a change from the way things have been done in the past, the Commission intended to wear as I stated that if the Member States honored their com mitments \u2014 0-7% of GNP in public aid to the devel oping countries and 0-15% in special aid to the least developed countries \u2014 and ensured the financing of the international agricultural development fund as they have promised, one would arrive at a figure of 500 000 million ECU in the coming years. I should like to know if the Commission and the Council have considered this factor because it proves that commit ments have been made along the lines desired by many and as all those who are carrying on the campaign wish. Personally therefore I am opposed to the crea tion of new funds if countries do not assume their res ponsibilities in those which already exist and which should function. The Commissioner paid particular attention to the demographic problem raised in my report. His reply on the subject of the birth rate must be examined closely but I should like to add that at present, accord- ",

Conse quently there is a need for far more numerous development programmes than those being set up at present. There is also the problem of financing them, their framework and the sharing of responsibilities with those who, in the final analysis, must take the decisions. Because we cannot decide for others, parti cularly not for those whom we want to aid and assist, otherwise we are returning to paternalism. And this is what I personally refuse to do. (Applause) President. \u2014 Does the Commission wish to reply again? (Interruption by Mr Pannella) For heaven's sake, Mr Pannella, must you always by so courteous? (Laughter) What do you want to say now? Mr Pannella. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, I want to com ment on what you said just now, in a very unpleasant manner, to the effect that we are not in Italy. I really think, Mr President, that we could invite you there to teach you something about parliamentary manners. (Applause) President. \u2014 I withdraw what I said, Mr Pannella. I like Italy very much. I have been there almost every year for the last thirty years. Now that we have come to the end of this excellent debate on this fine report, I suggest that we do not take the point any farther. The debate is closed. The motion for a resolution will be put to the vote at the next voting time. (The sitting was suspended at 1 p.m. and resumed at 3.05 p.m.) IN THE CHAIR: MR ESTGEN 2. Question Time President. \u2014 The next item is the second part of Question Time (Doc. 1-330/82). 1 We begin with the questions to the Council. Since they deal with related subjects, I call Question No 51, by Mr Seligman (H-847/81): What types of decisions by the Council can at present be made by qualified majority vote, and what steps does the Council want to take to widen the range of such decisions? Question No 66, by Mr B\u00f8gh (H-172/82): Will the Council confirm that each of the ten Member States has the right to impose a veto on decisions involving national vital interests, and that each of the ten countries decides for itself whether and when it considers a matter to be vital? and Question No 69, by Mr Purvis (H-187/82): Following the procedures adopted for approving the farm prices on 18 May 1982, what is the cur rent convention regarding voting in the Council of Ministers, and has the Council now returned to the provisions of the Treaty of Rome and dis carded completely the so-called Luxembourg Compromise of 1966? Mr De Keersmaeker, President-in-Office of the Coun cil. \u2014 (NL) I should like to answer the questions by Mr Purvis, Mr B\u00f8gh and Mr Seligman jointly. The Council had already repeatedly answered this question \u2014 according to my list, about twenty times. I have nothing to add to what I have said before, i.e. that the Council decides in accordance with the provi sions of the Treaties. However, according to these Treaties, a decision can be made either with a simple or with a qualified majority. This does not mean that the Council do not continue in their endeavour to achieve convergence of viewpoints before the Council makes its pronouncement. As regards the specific question raised by Mr Seligman, one should distin guish between two sorts of voting by qualified major ity. Firstly, there are those cases in which the Council decisions have a direct basis in the Treaties \u2014 the so-called 'basic decisions'. The second category of Council decisions are based on previous decisions taken in implementation of the Treaties \u2014 the so-called 'secondary decisions'. Obviously, the first type of decisions are determined by the Treaties, and unless the Treaties are revised the number of cases in Vice-President 1 Request to waive the immunity of a Member \u2014 Topical and urgent debate (objections) : see Minutes. ",
        "No 1-286/140 Debates of the European Parliament 16.6.82 De Keersmaeker which a qualified majority is provided for cannot be increased. In the second case, it could be considered increasing the number of cases for which voting by qualified majority is provided for, and the Council takes the view that it is its task to determine in each case, depending on the subject involved, which voting rule should be applied. and the Accession Treaty of 1972, does the Council feel that the vote on the agricultural prices for 1982/ 83 represents a return, after 16 years, to institutional orthodoxy and does it feel that the statement by one delegation concerning an abuse of the principle of vital interests, which was made on the occasion of this vote, amounts to admitting that a Member State cannot be the sole judge of its right of veto? IN THE CHAIR: MR KLEPSCH Vice-President President. \u2014 Our convention has always been that each questioner can put a supplementary question. Mr Seligman. \u2014 I welcome the President's very clear statement on what has recently become a rather sensi tive matter. I am glad the Council will consider enlarg ing the number of second-degree cases which will be decided by qualified majority. Regarding the first-degree basic cases, I have an enor mous list here which have to be decided by unanimity, under the Treaties of course. Now will the Council consider expediting Community progress by removing some of the non-vital categories, by, in fact, revising the Treaties? Mr De Keersmaeker. \u2014 (NL) I can inform the hon ourable Member that no modifications whatsoever are envisaged, particularly as regards the Treaty. Mr Purvis. \u2014 The President-in-Office of the Council will be aware that this Parliament is somewhat con cerned at the large number of Commission proposals that have passed through the Parliament and are wait ing for approval at Council level. I wonder if he could give us some idea of just how many there are and if he now plans to prosecute them with greater vigour in the new environment that we have; and in that he will be discussing, I gather, in the Council the Genscher-Co lombo proposals in the next few days, what line is he anticipating will come out of that? Mr De Keersmaeker. \u2014 (NL) What Mr Purvis' ques tion boils down to is in fact the same as a question put by Mr Hutton. As I have no wish to answer Mr Hut- ton's question prematurely I will give an answer to Mr Purvis when I come to deal with Mr Hutton's question. Mr Radoux. \u2014 (FR) Since the principle of majority votes is absolutely fundamental to the Treaty of Rome Mr De Keersmaeker. \u2014 (FR) I must inform the hon ourable Member that the Council's vote of 18 May was totally in accordance with the Treaty. As regards the interpr\u00e9tation of the 'Luxembourg Compromise' and all it implies, this will be discussed by the Council on 20 June 1982, i.e. next Sunday. Mrs Clwyd. \u2014 I wonder if the President-in-Office of the Council could tell me whether he agrees with the version put forward by Mrs Cresson, who, of course, was the French Minister of Agriculture who played a key role last month in the defeat of the British within the European Community? She said that the rules of the Luxembourg Compromise remain unaffected by what happened \u2014 namely, that a veto can only apply to the issue under discussion. She said we warned the British in advance, in every conceivable way, of what was in store if they carried on with their veto of farm price increases as a form of budget blackmail, but they simply did not believe us.' She went on to say: 'On this occasion, I think the British Government goofed.' Would the President-in-Office of the Council agree with that version? Mr De Keersmaeker. \u2014 (NL) I must give the same answer as I gave to the previous question. I am obviously familiar with Mrs Cresson's interpretation and the reasons she gave in connection with the vote of the French delegation. It was not my job then, nor is it my job today, to pass any judgment. Each delega tion can have different reasons for the same act and this is connected with the fact that this Luxembourg Compromise exists and is a bone of contention. Some countries do not accept it and others interpret it in dif ferent ways. We all know\" that this conflict exists and we are all anxious to find a way out. There is no need, therefore, for me to go into the vexed question of interpretation on behalf of others. We intend to dis cuss this question in the Council next Sunday, but I must make it quite clear that, as President of the Council of 18 May, I abided completely by the rules provided for in the Treaty. President. \u2014 I call Mr Purvis on a point of order. Mr Purvis. \u2014 Although I accept that the preamble to my supplementary covered what is coming up in a sub sequent question, the actual question referred to the ",
        "16.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/141 Purvis meeting that is starting on Sunday to consider the Genscher-Colombo proposals. What is the current convention in line with the Genscher-Colombo proposals that you are going to discuss, and notably paragraph 223? Where are we at now and where do you expect to come out? President. \u2014 Mr Purvis, I cannot allow this question since you asked to speak on a point of order and this was why I gave you the floor. Mr De Keersmaeker. \u2014 (NL) One could obviously also put it the other way round and say that the vital interests of nine countries should not suffer because of the vital interests of one individual country. The Council says that when the vital interests of one coun try are at variance with the vital interests of other countries, these two vital interests cancel each other out and we simply follow the Treaty. I would repeat that this is a very controversial matter and the Council is trying to find a way out. My job at that time was to apply the rules. I have nothing to add. Mr Purvis. \u2014 Mr President, in fact it was a point of order because you disallowed the original question on the basis of the preamble but not on the substantive question, which does relate to my Question No 69, as to the current convention. President. \u2014 If the President of the Council is pre pared to answer the question, I will allow it. Mr De Keersmaeker. \u2014 (NL) The answer is in fact very simple. The questions which have been brought up are to be dealt with on 20 June. I cannot, however, predict the outcome of these talks but the questioner can obviously enquire after next week's meeting. Mr Lange. \u2014 (DE) As regards this document which was signed in 1966 in Luxembourg and to which I have referred, can this document really be called a compromise? Can we really claim that it contains provisions for a veto? Can we really talk of a veto in the terms of the Treaty, and is it really right to con sider the Luxembourg document as a component of the Community? Mr De Keersmaeker. \u2014 (NL) As I am sure Mr Lange is already aware, the so-called 'Luxembourg Com promise' is also known as 'an agreement to disagree'. It contains a series of paragraphs each stating different viewpoints. It is an attempt to find a way out of these difficulties and the Council intends to discuss this question on Saturday. Mr Kirk. \u2014 (DA) Mr President of the Council, will you confirm that there will always be a limit to the power of veto in the practice which has developed in the Council since they agreed or failed to agree on the Luxembourg Compromise, and that this limit was passed in the specific case of the agricultural price-fix ing, in that nine Member States clearly had vital inter ests in reaching a solution, whereas there was one country which thought it had vital interests in prevent ing a decision being reached, and that the vital inter ests of nine Member States should take priority over a vital interest which one Member State insists on? President. \u2014 I allowed so many supplementary ques tions since this was a matter of general interest. We hope that the discussions on Sunday will lead to a pos itive outcome. I call Question No 52, by Mr Radoux (H-82/82): At their latest meeting of 6 April 1982, the Minis ters of Social Affairs and Employment declined an invitation from the International Labour Organ ization to take part in a pan-European meeting, the reason adduced being events in Turkey and Poland. Would the Council clearly explain this and any other reason for its refusal? Mr De Keersmaeker, President-in-Office of the Coun cil. \u2014 (NL) To date the member countries of the European region have received no invitation from the ILO to take part in a regional conference. Conse quently no decision whatsoever has needed to be taken on the matter. President. \u2014 I call Question No 53, by Mr Hutton (H-92/82): How many proposals by the Commission, on which Parliament had proposed amendments in giving its Opinion, were awaiting a decision by the Council at the latest convenient date; and what new measures does the Council propose to take to eliminate this backlog, in the interests of the Com munity and its citizens? Mr De Keersmaeker, President-in-Office of the Coun cil. \u2014 (NL) The Commission regularly draws up a list of proposals pending before the Council on which the European Parliament has given its Opinion. For its part, after each part-session, the General Secretariat of the European Parliament draws up lists of the Opin ions the latter has given, whether or not they contain suggested amendments to the Commission proposals. The Council is aware that, in certain instances, there may be a considerable lapse of time between submis sion of the Commission proposal and the delivery of the European Parliament's Opinion on the one hand, and the adoption of the Council decision on the other. Work on some of these proposals is continuing within the Council, but the complex and technical nature of ",
        "No 1-286/142 Debates of the European Parliament 16.6.82 De Keersmaeker these proposals would explain why this work has not yet been completed. Mr Hutton. \u2014 Would the President-in-Office of the Council deny that at 1 May the figure that I am seek ing was 313? Is he aware that every Commission pro posal amended by Parliament which is held up by the Council represents a body-blow to this Parliament, because it has got no way of demonstrating the amount of time and effort put by its committees and its part-sessions into formulating and voting on our amendments? Would he further deny that the Council is deliberately crippling the Parliament in its actions, or would he, perhaps, admit that it is now so paralysed by the Luxembourg Compromise that it has practically lost the power to arrive at decisions? whereby the Council has not yet received Parliament's Opinions but nevertheless continues with its discussion of these questions, merely postponing the formal deci sion until it has received Parliament's Opinion. Take for example the Council of Ministers of Social Affairs of 27 May. Subjects such as flexibility as regards retirement age, voluntary part-time work and the out look in the social sector have already been extensively discussed and decided in the Council, which is the reason underlying my supplementary question \u2014 i.e. could not the Council adjust its priorities in such a way that decisions on proposals on which Parliament has issued an Opinion and possibly amended would it take priority and that the Council would wait until it had received Parliament's Opinion before discussing other subjects on which Parliament had not as yet pronounced? Mr De Keersmaeker. \u2014 (NL) I must point out to the honourable Member that this is by no means the explanation since if we look at the figures, we see that there is a very reasonable balance. For example, I can inform you that between 1966 and 1981, i.e. over a period of six years, the Council adopted 3 588 regula tions, directives, decisions and other measures on the basis of the 3 788 proposals received from the Com mission. This, I think, is a very reasonable balance. Mr Newton Dunn. \u2014 Would the President-in-Office of the Council accept that the failure to pass the more contentious proposals, to which my colleague Mr Hutton has referred, leads to a failure to make the Community work successfully and therefore leads to public disillusion and, ultimately, to the break-up of the Community? Mr De Keersmaeker. \u2014 (NL) I must inform the hon ourable Member that the Council must in fact always take account of Parliament's Opinion. There are exceptional cases of urgency where the Council goes ahead with its deliberations in view of this urgency, as for example in the case of the arrangements in the wine sector. However, it waits until Parliament's Opinion is available before making the final decision. Mr K. Fuchs. \u2014 (DE) Does not the President of the Council agree that the figures he has just mentioned for the most part referred to individual technical deci sions and that the Council unfortunately continues omitting to make the important political decisions in, for example, the transport sector, in spite of the fact that no less than eleven Articles of the Treaty of Rome call for a common transport policy? Mr De Keersmaeker. \u2014 (NL) No, that is certainly not the case. I am told that there was a mistranslation and the figure 3 588 which I quoted was given as 3 188. This was wrong and this correction makes the balance to which I drew attention in my previous answer even clearer. However, the last supplementary question implied that the Community has ground to a halt because the Council is omitting to deal with the most important proposals. This is by no means the case. Indeed, it would be more accurate to say that there are various reasons why certain matters have not been dealt with or have only been dealt with after a considerable delay. There might be proposals which have become obsolete and there might even be propos als which have not received any attention from this Parliament. On the other hand, there are proposals which are complex and technical that they call for a great deal of preparation and time if they are to be studied thoroughly. This is the real explanation. The backlog, both as regards bulk and time, must be con sidered in this light. Mr De Keersmaeker. \u2014 (NL) I should like to point out to Mr Fuchs that no distinction was made in the figures I quoted, i.e. they referred to all the proposals which have been discussed. As regards the problem of transport policy, I can inform you \u2014 and I happen to be very competent to speak on this question since I used to be deputy chairman of the relevant Parliamen tary Committee, on which I also in my day frequently deplored the absence of a decision on this matter \u2014 but the most recent Council of Transport Ministers did indeed reach a decision on this question. Mr de Ferranti. \u2014 Is the President-in-Office aware that we agreed just this afternoon to have an urgency debate on questions concerning the internal market? Whilst we appreciate very much the Belgian Presi dency's efforts to get decisions made, could he tell us whether he has been successful in calling a Council this month to try and complete some of the 88 direc tives that relate to the internal market? Mr Eisma. \u2014 (NL) Does the President-in-Office real ize that the opposite also occurs \u2014 i.e. a situation Mr De Keersmaeker. \u2014 (NL) This was indeed the original intention but unfortunately, it has not yet ",
        "16.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/143 De Keersmaeker been decided to hold this special Council meeting to deal with the question of the internal market. President. \u2014 Since its author is absent, Question No 54 will receive a written reply. Question No 55, by Mr Deleau (H-l 17/82): With a view to resolving its numerous trade dis putes with Japan and the United States in parti cular, could not the Community take the initiative of calling a high-level meeting on trade with its Japanese and American partners? Mr De Keersmaeker, President-in-Office of the Coun cil. \u2014 (NL) The Council does not think that there is any need for new channels of communication with our two major industrial partners, either on bilateral or multilateral level or even at the highest political level. This does not mean, however, that there is no need for talks. The recent economic summit at Versailles specif ically gave the Community an opportunity to stress to its partners the potentially serious consequences of any further disputes for the international trade system and for Western solidarity and the resulting need for de-escalation of these disputes and for each of the major Western partners to shoulder its responsibilities. The Governments should realize the possible conse quences for the other partners of national political decisions and should be resolved to act in compliance with the spirit and the letter of international undertak ings entered into and, in particular, with the principles and procedures of GATT. Finally, I would refer you to the report made by Mr Tindemans to your Parliament on the results of the Versailles summit. Mr Deleau. \u2014 (FR) I should like to thank the Presi dent of the Council for his answer. There is indeed no lack of channels of communication but since the Council recognizes the need for consultation on this specific point, this was not a negative answer. Is the Community prepared to convene a major meeting on trade matters of this kind with our Japanese and American partners \u2014 and when I say partners, I mean above all, competitors. I should be pleased if the Council could undertake to initiate new negotiations with a view to putting an end to the dispute, and I should be grateful for a far more precise answer. Mr De Keersmaeker. \u2014 (NL) Any more precise answer I give must take its place in the context of the general answer I have just given. The dialogue on these issues took place in the context of the Versailles Summit and will be continued at ministerial level at the forthcoming GATT meeting. Mr Marshall. \u2014 Would the President-in-Office of the Council accept that many of us believe that where Japan is concerned the time for talking is rapidly com ing to an end? Would he accept that many of us find Japanese trading practices to be unacceptable as they seem to believe in freedom of trade for their exports and monstrous restrictions upon imports into Japan? Mr De Keersmaeker. \u2014 (NL) If I remember rightly, Mr Tindemans drew up a report on his visit to Japan in which he stated that the Japanese government had shown itself to be prepared to consider this problem directly and that it had already adopted a series of limited measures. We regard these measures as indeed limited, but nevertheless feel that they represent an ini tial step towards convergence in this area. This atti tude on the part of the Japanese Government was also reaffirmed at the Versailles summit. Mrs Hoffmann. \u2014 (FR) What specific measures does the Commission intend to take to contend with the American decision to apply countervailing duties on European steel and hence to protect production and employment in the steel sector in the Member States of the Community? Mr De Keersmaeker. \u2014 (NL) The questioner asked what the Commission intends to do. Obviously, the Council cannot answer this question. Mr Habsburg. \u2014 (DE) I should like to ask the Minis ter whether or not he agrees that a large part of our problems with Japan stem not so much from abuses on the part of Japan, but simply from the fact that in Japan the State accounts for 19% of the gross domes tic product as against 47% in Germany, and that we should not have so much to fear from Japanese com petition if our governments were as good at its job as the workers are at theirs? Mr De Keersmaeker. \u2014 (NL) You are asking for me to make a value judgement on behalf of the Council. That is not what I am here for. President. \u2014 I call Question No 56, by Mr Remilly (H-118/82): Are there any immediate plans to hold a joint Council meeting on Social Affairs and Economic Affairs with special reference to employment problems? Mr De Keersmaeker, President-in-Office of the Coun cil. \u2014 (NL) As I said before on 21 April 1982 in reply to the oral question by Mr Eisma, the success of a Council meeting of the Ministers for Economic Affairs and the Ministers for Social Affiars depends on extremely careful preparation of the meeting. As part of these preparations some useful work was done at ",
        "No 1-286/144 Debates of the European Parliament 16.6.82 De Keersmaeker the meeting of the Standing Committee on Employ ment on 27 April 1982 and that of the Council of 27 May 1982. Mr Boyes. \u2014 As unemployment, particularly amongst our young people, continues to grow no one can forcecast the political, social and economic conse quences of the problem of long-term unemployment. History tells us that the consequences for individuals, countries and continents can be extremely tragic and yet some governments \u2014 for example the one in the United Kingdom, led by the Conservative Party which is worshipping at the feet of the god of monetarism \u2014 continue to deliberately create an ever-increasing pool of unemployment. (Interruption) I thought you were keeping quiet this afternoon! I thought you were half dead most of you, but perhaps you have been beaten into submission . . . this reason the Belgian Presidency felt it wise to exer cize patience and to ask the Danish Presidency to take this matter over. As I am sure you are also aware, the European Council recently \u2014 I think it was in March \u2014 took an important decision in Brussels, i.e. it agreed in principle that a policy should be pursued at national level which would provide either a job or a chance of vocational training for every young person coming on to, the labour market. This principle must be put into practice in the policy of the Member States, but the decision was in fact reached at European level. Mr Pearce. \u2014 Would the President-in-Office agree \u2014 contrary to the spirit of Mr Boyes' supplementary question \u2014 that the magnificent victory that Britain has won in the Falkland Islands would encourage us all to see that where there is determination, ability, honesty and a love of freedom we can cure serious problems that affect humanity and that, with that sort of spirit and that attitude, we could cure this terrible problem of unemployment? President. \u2014 Mr Boyes, you should put a question and not address the House. Mr Boyes. \u2014 ... or maybe you are celebrating over this terrible victory in the Falklands. (Protests from the European Democratic Group) I am thinking of the 250 . . . British servicemen who have been killed in the South Atlantic. Will the President-in-Office please tell me what recommendations he will be passing on to his succes sor in an effort to combat the problem of 15 million people in this Community being unemployed? Mr De Keersmaeker. \u2014 (NL) As you know, it was the wish of the Belgian Presidency to organize a jumbo Council. However, this sort of thing calls for thorough and somewhat lengthy preparation and Mr Tindemans explained yesterday in his statement on the Belgian presidency why this jumbo Council did not in fact get off the ground. 'Mr Boyes has rightly drawn our attention to the dramatic proportions which youth unemployment has attained. It was the intention of the Belgian Presidency to devote particular attention to this question. The preparatory work has already been started and must be followed up. The Belgian Presi dency takes the view that the question of youth unem ployment must continue to take priority under the Danish Presidency. One of the things necessary for sound preparation was prior consultation with the two sides of industry with a view to ascertaining what objectives are realistic and to avoid raising unfounded hopes. Inadequate prepara tion would increase the risk of disillusionment, and for President. \u2014 I cannot allow this question. I call Question No 57, by Mrs Gaiotti De Biase (H- 124/82): Is it true that the Primate of Poland, Archbishop Glemp, has asked that instead of delivering fin ished food products to Poland the Community authorities should supply quantities of maize and soya to be used in private poultry raising, and how does the Council react to what appears to be rea sonable and well-founded request that would en able part of the private poultry-raising industry to be saved and increase by a factor of five the nutri tional value of Community aid? Mr De Keersmaeker, President-in-Office of the Coun cil. \u2014 (NL) The honourable Member's' information concerning the request by the Primate of Poland, Archbishop Glemp, is correct. However, while the Community sympathizes with the problems facing the people of Poland, such a request raises a number of technical and financial difficulties, in particular in con nection with the decisions taken by the Council in Jan uary and February 1982 on the nature of emergency aid for the people of Poland. I would remind you that the Council decided on emergency aid of 10 million ECU for foodstuffs and products, to be channeled through non-governmental organizations. This aid scheme was in fact rapidly implemented by the Com mission, in close cooperation with these organizations. Mr Marshall. \u2014 On a point of order under Rule 90, Mr President. On a previous occasion certain remarks from Mr Balfe were expunged from the verbatim report of a meeting of this House. Can we have an assurance that the remarks of Mr Boyes which were ",
        "16.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/145 Marshall unpatriotic and attack the activities of British troops in the Falklands will not be expunged under the direction of you or anybody else? President. \u2014 I can assure you that the questions will be recorded in the Minutes. That applies to your remark too. Mrs Kellett-Bowman. \u2014 Mr President, Rule 90 says quite categorically that a verbatim report of the pro ceedings of each sitting shall be drawn up in the offi cial languages. Many of us here heard Mr Boyes use the words 'the terrible victory in the Falklands'. Now as the order is that the report should be verbatim, I would respectfully suggest that those unpatriotic words must in fact be included. provide an opportunity to discuss other matters under the pretext of a procedural debate. I will look into the question of whether there is a divergence between Mr Dankert's view and my own. If so, we will have to find another decision. Mr Balfe. \u2014 Mr President, my name has now been mentioned three times. The point of order I would like to make is that I took this matter up with President Dankert, since it concerned me and since I wished the matter to be in the record. He pointed out to me \u2014 I do not know under which rule \u2014 that the President of the sitting has the right to delete any word that he considers should be struck from the record. It is up to you to decide. President. \u2014 As I have already explained, the supple mentary question will be reported verbatim. If all sorts of remarks are contained in a question \u2014 in parenthesis, as it were \u2014 they are obviously part of the question, even if the questioner has overlooked this fact. As President of the sitting, I expunged these remarks. I do not want a major procedural debate to develop over the word 'unpatriotic'. The supplementary ques tion will be reported word for word as Mr Boyes put it in the verbatim report of proceedings. Mr Harris. \u2014 Mr President, could we be absolutely clear on this point because when a\u00ab similar situation arose some time ago when Mr Balfe was in the Cham ber the President of Parliament, Mr Dankert, ruled in similar terms as yourself that the Minutes would reflect the deletion of Mr Balfe's remarks. In fact he accused British troops of being murderers. Now I tried to catch the President's attention at that point because I thought that Mr Balfe's disgraceful remarks \u2014 as I saw them \u2014 should be fully reflected in the records of this House. But when we looked at the official record, the rainbow \u2014 in British terms the Hansard of the Parliament \u2014 and we found the next day that all reference to Mr Balfe's remarks which, as I say, I regard as absolutely disgraceful, had been expunged. So I think there is a difference, with respect, between the Minutes of Proceedings and the actual official ver batim report of what is said. Could I please reinforce the pleas made by my col leagues that when the official verbatim report of today's proceedings is printed \u2014 hopefully tomorrow \u2014 Mr Boyes' remarks will be reported in full so that others, like myself, can bring them to the full attention of the British public. President. \u2014 (DE) The purpose of Question Time is to permit answers to be given to questions and not to President. \u2014 As President of the sitting I can decide what is included in the verbatim report of proceedings. I call Mrs Gaiotti De Biase for a supplementary ques tion. Mrs Gaiotti de Biase. \u2014 (IT) I should like to say that I am somewhat dissatisfied since it seems to me that the Presidency has not answered my question. In answer to a previous question of mine to the Com mission I was told that it has not been possible to meet the request by Monsignor Glemp because this would turn the aid we are providing to Poland into economic aid. As I see it, however, such requests would not con stitute economic aid to the Polish regime but rather aid to the people of Poland aimed at promoting the development of a free economy in that country, as well as being inspired by that type of solidarity which this Parliament has always affirmed. I hope that the Council of Ministers and the Commis sion can go back on this decision and get over the financial obstacles which appear to be underlying it. This, I think, would be a very clear demonstration of what the European Parliament means by solidarity with the Poles at a time when the Church itself is going through times which are undoubtedly even more difficult than the period ' immediately following 13 May. This Parliament should, I think, take an ini tiative with a view to meeting the request of the Polish Church through non-government channels. Mr De Keersmaeker. \u2014 (NL) I did not say that a definitive decision had been reached on this point. Naturally, it is first and foremost the task of the Com mission to evaluate this proposal and to make its own proposals to the Council. There is no getting away from the fact that this goes beyond the terms on which the Council evaluated the aid offered to Poland and that a great deal of new and complicated problems arise. From the point of view of certain Polish bodies, ",
        "No 1-286/146 Debates of the European Parliament 16.6.82 De Keersmaeker this would indeed to a certain extent involve economic aid to sectors in difficulties. Without wishing to antici pate the final decision, it should be pointed out that the Council has always regarded the aid to Poland as humanitarian aid. Mr Alavanos. \u2014 (GR) In this mornings's session we discussed the Michel report and I do not recall any speaker supporting the idea that supplies or other forms of aid should be used as a weapon or should be subject to political conditions but I'm afraid it seems from the reply of the President-in-Office of the Coun cil that something similar is happening, at least in the case of Poland. I should like to raise this specific issue both in general terms and with particular reference to Poland and ask whether the supplies sent as aid by the Community are subject to political conditions or are being used as a political weapon. The President's answer will be of considerable importance because we shall shortly be called upon to vote on the Michel report. Mr De Keersmaeker. \u2014 (NL) At its meeting on 22 and 23 February, the Council decided in favour of eight million ECU from Community funds being used for swift humanitarian aid for the benefit of those Pol ish citizens most in need of it. The Council stated that this aid would only be supplied via the Commission to non-governmental bodies providing the requisite guar antees that the aid would indeed be distributed among those in need of it. I cannot see anything in this apart from our intention purely and simply to help those in need as swiftly as possible. President. \u2014 I call Question No 58, by Mr Bord (H- 140/82): What measures does the Council envisage taking in order to solve any difficulties which Israel may encounter, especially in the agricultural field, as a result of the enlargement of the Community to include Spain and Portugal? Mr Marshall. \u2014 May I welcome that comment by the President-in-Office of the Council and underline that this is of major importance to Israel, because the export of Mediterranean produce forms a very sub stantial part of Israel's trade with the Community and could be substantially at risk once enlargement takes place? Mr De Keersmaeker. \u2014 (NL) This is indeed true. This was more of a statement than a question on your part, but I should nevertheless like to add that we should view this question in a more general context. It is not only Israel which will be faced with problems, but other countries too. Certain North African coun tries are also wondering what will happen to certain sectors of their economy, such as agriculture, in the event of the accession of Spain and Portugal. They have a perfect right to do so and the European Com munity has agreed to consult them. However, certain countries are calling for negotiations with the coun tries which have concluded preferential agreements with the European Community to be held in parallel with the enlargement negotiations. This is not institu tionally provided for, but we must take account of Israel's concerns in that area. Mr Alavanos. \u2014 (GR) I am surprised that the Presi dent-in-Office of the Council should give assurances to Israel that it will not be exposed to risk and this at a time when a dastardly attack is being launched from Israeli territory against the people of Lebanon and Palestine, an attack condemned by the Council of the EEC itself. In such a situation we must ask why, whereas, in the case of Poland, where there was no military occupation, no invasion by foreign troops, and tens of thousands were not killed, we neverthless had immediate condemnation, with television crews in the European Parliament, why, I say, do we provide Israel on the other hand with assurances that it will not be at risk as a result of the admission of Portugal and Spain. It seems to me that we should at least have some sense of decency. Mr De Keersmaeker, President-in-Office of the Coun cil. \u2014 (NL) Within the bodies provided for in the Mediterranean agreements, the partner countries, including Israel, have had the opportunity to voice their concerns as regards the possible consequences for them of Community enlargement. The Community has confirmed to them its availability to discuss the matter once solutions are reached in the context of accession negotiations with Spain and Portugal, which is not yet the case as far as the areas of most import ance and interest to our Mediterranean partners are concerned. Moreover, the Community intends, in par allel with the accession negotiations, to continue to devote detailed thought to the effect of enlargement on its relations with non-member countries. The Com mission should shortly be submitting a communication on the subject to the Council. Mr De Keersmaeker. \u2014 (NL) The questioner has misinterpreted my answer. I did not say that an enlargement treaty could not have consequences for others. President. \u2014 I call Question No 59, by Mr Haagerup (H-143/82): Does the Council consider that Article 2 of the Portuguese constitution, which provides for the development of a Socialist society, should be deleted before Portugal joins the Community? Furthermore, does the Council consider the con tinued existence and present political role of the Council of the Revolution to be consonant with a democratic constitution? ",
        "16.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/147 Mr De Keersmaeker, President-in-Office of the Coun cil. \u2014 (NL) The Council is convinced that Portugal, as a State applying for membership, is conscious of the principles on which the treaties and the obligations arising therefrom are based as well as of the content of the joint declaration on fundamental rights issued by the European Parliament, the Council and the Com mission on 5 April 1977 and the declaration of democ racy adopted by the European Council on 7 April 1978. It will also be recalled that, when negotiations for Portugal's accession were opened, the Portuguese government spokesman affirmed that Portugal unre servedly shares the ideals of democracy, peace and freedom which are the foundations of the Paris and Rome Treaties. Mr Haagerup. \u2014 (DA) This sounds all well and good and so far there is nothing especially and exclusively directed against Portugal. We all know the tendency to interpret ideas in our own way, but is not one of the fundamental human rights that in a democratic coun try one should be able to hold views which are at vari ance with the constitution? I as a Liberal at any rate would like to say that I would be very dubious about a constitution which provided for the development of a socialist society. Is there no procedure which can be followed and which is a little more precise than the procedure mentioned by the President of the Council, in which the basic principle is simply that the applicant countries will go along with the fundamental princi ples forming the basis of the Community and its insti tutions? Mr De Keersmaeker. \u2014 (NL) The Council of Minis ters of the European Community is not at liberty to pass judgment on the content of the Portuguese con stitution, and certainly not a specific point contained in it, i.e. the existence of a Council of the Revolution. It is none of our business whether or not this Council should be abolished. We must see whether the Portuguese government and Portuguese politics can be reconciled with the fundamental principles and rules underlying the European Community, and I think they can. President. \u2014 I call Mrs Ewing on a point of order. Mrs Ewing. \u2014 The House's habit of taking points of order when they are raised means that we have failed to reach my very topical and interesting question on fishing. In view of this, could we not perhaps for once look at the custom that obtains in the British House of Commons, whereby points of order are taken at the end and do not use up the time of those who have put down questions in the hope that they will be reached, particularly when they are as topical as the one I have put down? May I suggest that in future points of order be raised at the end of Question Time and that if people want to indulge themselves in internal feuds about matters irrelevant to Question Time, they should do so at the end of Question Time, because the fishermen, I am sure, will not be impressed at not getting an answer to their question. Could you not consult the House as to whether it would not be the wish of this House to hear the result of the fishing question, which was, after all, only taken yesterday? President. \u2014 I will bring this question up with the Committee on the Rules of Procedure and Petitions. Mr Pearce. \u2014 This point of order relates directly to Question No 77, the first of the questions to the For eign Ministers meeting in political cooperation. I believe that is the point that we have now reached on the agenda. I wish to challenge the admissibility of this question, Mr President. Referring to Rule 44 and its annex, I find that this question contravenes two of the condi tions which are required. It is specified in Annex I that such questions should not contain assertions or opin ions and that they should be interrogatory in form. Mr President, I believe that the terms of Question No 77 are in breach of both of these prescriptions and I therefore call upon you not to call it. I should not regard it as satisfactory, Mr President, if you were to propose passing this matter to the Bureau or the enlarged Bureau. You are about to call this question, on the face of it, and I think you should refer to the Rules and should, in fact, cause this question not to be called at this moment. President. \u2014 Please bear in mind that we only have half an hour left for Questions to the Foreign Minis ters meeting in political cooperation and that we should not waste this half hour discussing the rules of procedure. Question No 77 was allowed as it stands and conse quently will be answered by the Council in this form. Mr Harris. \u2014 Mr President, may I follow up the point made by Mrs Ewing? I realize that I was the one who raised the point of order on an original question. Could you put to the House the possibility that the Council of Ministers should be given permission, per haps at the end of Question Time, to answer her ques tion on fishing, bearing in mind that this is the first opportunity that this House has had to question the Council of Ministers following the very important meeting which took place yesterday, and in view of the exceptional nature of the circumstances surround ing this question? I wonder therefore if you could con sult the House on whether the House would give per mission for this question of Mrs Ewing's to be answered either now or perhaps right at the end of Question Time.

I had indicated that I wanted to ask a supplementary ques tion on Question No 58, and at least three hands went up for supplementary questions on Questions No 59. I would ask you to look very attentively round the Chamber to make sure that you do pick up the requests for supplementary questions. President. \u2014 According to the Rules of Procedure, it is the President of the sitting who decides which and how many supplementary questions will be admitted, and I have done this to the best of my abilities. Mr Israel. \u2014 (FR) I am sure you will agree with me that all the members of this Assembly are equal regardless of the position they occupy in the h\u00e9micy cle. Being very badly placed, Mr President, I have noi> managed, in spite of my vociferous attempts \u2014 I am afraid I have a very weak voice \u2014 to attract your attention, but I wanted to put a supplementary ques tion in connection with Question No 59, by Mr Haa gerup, in my capacity as Chairman of this Parliament's Working Party on Human Rights. This is a matter of the utmost importance and I deplore the fact that I was not able to speak on this point, particularly as my Political Group has not been heard at all in the supple mentary questions. I would ask you, therefore, to take account in future of requests by those who do not have the good fortune of sitting in the front row of the h\u00e9micycle. Mrs Ewing. \u2014 Mr President, could you answer Mr Harris's suggestion that you put the possibility to the House of taking the fishing question now or at the end? President. \u2014 I will discuss this question with the Min ister and inform you of the outcome at the end of Question Time. We continue with the questions to the Foreign Minis ters. I call Question No 77, by Mr Pesmazoglou (H-102/ 82): Despite the UN resolutions, Turkey continues to occupy Cypriot territories. The tragic conse quences of the 1974 invasion for the people of Cyprus are widely known. Recently an invasion in another part if the world rightly provoked a strong reaction from the European Community which accordingly took measures against the country responsible. Do not the Foreign Affairs Ministers consider that for reasons of principle, consistency and credibility a similar stance should be adopted towards Cyprus? Mr De Keersmaeker, President-in-Office of the Foreign Ministers. \u2014 (NL) The Member States of the Euro pean Community have endeavoured, in the context of European Political Cooperation, to contribute towards a solution to the Cyprus question on the basis of Reso lution No 3212, adopted on 1 November by the United Nations General Assembly. They also hope that it may prove possible to solve the problems between the two communities in Cyprus by means of inter-community talks under the aegis of the Secretary General of the United Nations and that we may see significant progress in these talks as soon as possible. Mr Pesmazoglou. \u2014 (GR) The French wording of Article 2 of United Nations Resolution 3212 of 1 No vember 1974 is as follows: demande instamment le retrait rapide de la R\u00e9publique de Chypre de toutes les forces arm\u00e9es \u00e9trang\u00e8res .. . In the light of this I should like to ask how the Euro pean Community can avoid calling for the immediate implementation of the United Nations Resolutions when that same Community is clearly, reasonably and inevitably committed to the implementation and the safeguarding of proper legal processes as a basic aim and principle of the European Community. Mr De Keersmaeker. \u2014 (NL) One should, I think, consider the text of the UN resolution in its entirety. Secondly, the Council must examine the best possible way of achieving a result. Talks are underway on this question, there is a procedure and it cannot be said that no progress is being made. This is the Council's Mr Pearce. \u2014 Does the President-in-Office agree that the principle which is at stake here and which is analo gous to the situation in the South Atlantic, which the question refers to, is that the question who should run a particular portion of territory should be determined by the wishes of the people who live there, rather than by the wishes of people who live somewhere else and who make claims for historical geographical reasons to have sovereignty over it? Mr De Keersmaeker. \u2014 (NL) This was a statement rather than a question. In the situation under consider ation, we would prefer to see a solution arrived at in the context of inter-community talks between the local populations of Cyprus itself. Mr Plaskovitis. \u2014 (GR) The President-in-Office is not providing any real answers. There is a United Nations resolution which calls for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Cyprus. Is that so or is it not? And if it is so, what is the point of the talks going on ",
        "16.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/149 Plaskovitis between the two communities, at a time when, arbi trarily and in defiance of the ruling of the Interna tional Court and the resolutions of the United Nations, part of Cyprus is occupied by a foreign invading force? The President-in-Office has not answered that question. Mr De Keersmaeker. \u2014 (NL) I have never said that the text \u2014 which has been quoted \u2014 is not correct. I would emphasize, moreover, that we support this text, i.e. this resolution adopted in the context of the United Nations. The procedure chosen is a procedure which must be viewed in the context of the United Nations and I have already informed you of the Council's opin ion on this subject. generally acknowledged that they have not produced results. These discussions are conducted under the threat posed by the armed forces of the Turkish invader, the Greek government wants those forces withdrawn, the Cypriot government wants them with drawn, and the Greek government proposes that an international conference be convened. I am surprised \u2014 and this is a point on which a reply should be given by the Greek government \u2014 when I hear it said that the Greek government did not raise the issue of an international conference. Whether or not the matter has been raised by Greece, I would again ask if the Community, the Foreign Ministers, are of the opinion that an international meeting could lead to the imple mentation of the United Nations resolutions before a crisis erupts in Cyprus. President. \u2014 I call Question No 78, by Mr Kyrkos (H-12/82): \u2022 How do the Foreign Ministers of the Ten Mem ber States meeting in political cooperation view the proposal to hold an international conference on the Cyprus question? Do the Foreign Ministers intend to encourage an initiative of this kind designed to overcome the present deadlock and lead to the implementation of the UN decisions? Mr Alavanos. \u2014 (GR) Mr President, I hope that it was due to art oversight on your part, but when you called Mr Ephremidis another member spoke instead; I think Mr Ephremidis should at least have the oppor tunity to put the final supplementary question to Mr Pesmazoglou's question. President. \u2014 I am sorry I just mixed up the names of two Members. Mr Ephremidis. \u2014 (GR) Mr President, I know that Mr Plaskovitis did not mean to prevent me speaking, he asked to speak and was allowed to. It was you who prevented me from speaking since, although my name is down for a supplementary question, you did not call me. I should now like to put the supplementary ques tion. Mr De Keersmaeker. \u2014 (NL) If the questioner main tains that the talks in the context of the United Nations are producing no results whatsoever, I could answer him by drawing up a relatively long list of what is in fact happening. These talks are indeed leading to progress. The appropriateness of holding an interna tional conference at this time would at any rate depend on the existence of the guarantee treaty of London of 16 August 1960. I can say no more on this question except that the Council has not discussed the suitability of organizing an international conference and has consequently not come to any decision on the matter. Mr Ephremidis. \u2014 (GR) It is curious that the Presi dent-in-Office of the Council should refer so persist ently to the intercommunity talks and I should there fore like to put a further question to him. Does he know that these talks dealt with topics which go to the heart of the Cyprus problem, such as the constitutional position and the administration of the state of Cyprus, whereas the problem raised by the question of the two communities is clear. Are the Community and the Council for or against an international conference which, following on the relevant UN resolutions, would help to ensure the withdrawal of the invading forces from Cyprus and to clear the way for intercom munity dialogue? We want to be told clearly whether they are in favour or not and we do not want any talk about peace-keeping forces or about discussions which have been going on for tens of years. Mr De Keersmaeker, President-in-Office of the Foreign Minister. \u2014 (NL) The Foreign Ministers meeting in political cooperation have not discussed the proposal mentioned by the honourable Member and have con sequently not reached any decision on it. Mr Kyrkos. \u2014 (GR) My question concerns the one previously put by Mr Pesmazoglou. The President- in-Office referred us to the intercommunity discus sions. They have been going on for eight years. It is Mr De Keersmaeker. \u2014 (NL) Mr President, I am authorized to inform you on the work of the Council and do not intend to overstep the limits this implies. President. - (H-91/82): I call Question No 79, by Mr Hutton Have the Foreign Ministers seen and discussed the appalling evidence contained in the 22 March 1982 Report to Congress of the American Secre- ",
        "No 1-286/150 Debates of the European Parliament 16.6.82 President tary of State on the use of chemical warfare by the Soviet Union and its agent States in South-East Asia and Afghanistan? Mr De Keersmaeker, President-in-Office of the Foreign Ministers. \u2014 (NL) The report mentioned by the hon ourable Member has not been discussed by the For eign Ministers of the Ten. However, it should be pointed out that since December 1980, the Ten have supported a draft resolution tabled under No 35144 C at the 35th United Nations General Assembly. This resolution concerns the organization of a study by the United Nations following reports on the use of chemi cal weapons, at which the Ten feel the utmost con cern. For the implementation of this resolution, a group of experts was set up and submitted a report in 1981 in which it was stated that in was not possible to reach any formal conclusions since it had not been possible to carry out on-the-spot investigations within the time available. Resolution 3996 C, which was adopted in December 1981 by the United Nations General Assembly with the support of the Ten, renews the mandate of the UN group of experts for a period of one year. The group of experts has not yet completed its study. The Ten continue to take the view that the group of experts should be admitted to the areas indi cated so that a thorough investigation can be carried out. Mr Hutton. \u2014 May I thank the President-in-Office for his answer which was a little fuller than I had expected. Is he aware that the document to which I refer in my question contains evidence which suggests that much of the warfare is being used as a test of these weapons in the very remote areas, particularly in Laos, and does he not feel that the evidence contained in the document would materially enhance the work that is being done by the group of experts in which the Ten are taking an interest since the troops in Eastern Europe are also equipped with chemical weapons which pose a threat to people the Foreign Ministers represent? Mr De Keersmaeker. \u2014 (NL) I can inform Mr Hut ton that the text of this report is in my possession and it is, I think, for the Council to come to some conclu sion regarding its authenticity. Mr De Keersmaeker. \u2014 (FR) Mr Isra\u00ebl, as I have already pointed out, there is a group of experts within the United Nations and we would like this group of experts to be able to do its job effectively, i. e. that it should be able to carry out on-the-spot investigations under conditions which would permit it to get a real picture of the situation, which it is unfortunately un able to do at present. Mr Boyes. \u2014 Could I, before I ask my supplementary, just thank the President-in-Office of the Council for the full answer he gave to my supplementary question on unemployment. I do thank him for that reply. Mr President, those of us who are campaigning for disarmament and the use of the United Nations to set tle disputes condemn totally and unreservedly the use of chemical weapons wherever they prove to have been used. Will the President agree that the best way of prevent ing the use of chemical weapons is to ensure that they are not manufactured? And will the President confirm that this is the view of the Foreign Ministers of the Governments of the Ten and, if so, pass this view to all countries in NATO, particularly the United States of America? Mr De Keersmaeker. \u2014 (NL) It so happens that the conference on disarmament is currently underway in the United Nations and I am convinced that this and many other aspects will be brought up. President. \u2014 The President of the Council is pre pared, following the wish expressed by this House and Mrs Ewing, to answer the Question by Mrs Ewing for which there was previously insufficient time, on the understanding, however, that no supplementary ques tions can be allowed. I call Question No 60, by Mrs Ewing (H-146/82): In view of the considerable economic disruption caused by the absence of a common fisheries policy and of the European Parliament's repeated demands for a rapid agreement on this burning issue, will the President-in-Office state why such little progress has been made since December 1981? Mr Isra\u00ebl. \u2014 (FR) Mr President of the Council, I share Mr Hutton's satisfaction at your answer. How ever, I should nevertheless like to ask you whether it would be possible for you to see to it that the Haig report is studied in this respect and to inform us of your conclusions. For the rest, could you collect infor mation on this delicate issue from Pakistan which is receiving a number of refugees who have been in con tact with chemical weapons? Mr De Keersmaeker, President-in-Office of the Coun cil. \u2014 (NL) I can inform Mrs Ewing that our first meeting on the new Commission proposals for a com mon fisheries policy was held yesterday. As regards the main points of the policy itself, the Commission pro posals were only received the evening before, that is to say, very late. We had to restrict ourselves to a very general debate, following an introduction by the Com mission. However, this debate was useful and I can tell ",
        "16.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/151 De Keersmaeker you that a large majority is in favour of reaching a decision in the near future. The Council has therefore taken certain steps with this end in view. We have, for example, set up a working party at as high a level as possible, which is due to start work on Monday, with a view to resuming the debate with a minimum of delay and, if possible, reaching a decision at a subsequent meeting, which will probably be held on 28 and 29 June. Some important work was also done yesterday on other aspects directly connected with the fisheries policy. For example, we adopted the proposal for a standard system of inspection and dis cussed the technical aspects of conservations. We also thoroughly examined the four most important propos als for regulations. This, Mrs Ewing, is how matters stand. I can assure you that this is a very difficult subject but that there is a willingness to make progress among the vast major ity of the delegations. President. \u2014 The second part of Question Time is closed. 1 implied in that answer supplementary questions. With great respect I wonder if you would put to the House the issue whether we should allot time for supplemen tary questions to the House, as indeed happened on many other occasions in this House in the past? President. \u2014 If we come to: an agreement with the Council, we must keep to it. The time available for Question Time has run out and the next item on the agenda is the report by Mrs Rabbethge. It would be regrettable, I think, if we had to postpone this report until tomorrow because of a procedural debate. I call Mr Kirk. Mr Kirk. \u2014 (DA) I should also be very pleased to receive an answer to this question, but I noticed that the President of the Council said that the Council had only just received a proposal from the Commission. Would you, on behalf of Parliament, stress to the Council that the European Parliament is entitled to be consulted on the proposals which have just have been submitted before the Council takes a decision? I call Mrs Ewing on a point of order. Mbrs Ewing. \u2014 On a point of order, may I ask, Mr President, if the reluctance to have my supplementary question answered comes from the President-in-Office of the Council, or from yourself, Sir? I think this House is entitled to have that question answered. Is the President-in-Office refusing to answer me or is it your own ruling, Sir? If it is your own ruling, Sir, may I respectfully suggest we leave it to the Presi dent-in-Office of the Council? President. \u2014 Mrs Ewing, I announced in good time that I would not allow any supplementary questions. I call Mr Harris. President. \u2014 Naturally, Parliament has the right to discuss these questions before a decision is reached. We will see what happens. 3. Science and technology for development President. \u2014 The next item is the report (Doc. 1-202/ 82) by Mrs Rabbethge on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation on: the proposal from the Commission to the Council (Doc. 1-271/81 \u2014 COM(81) 212 final) for a Council decision adopting a programme of research and development in the field of science and technology for development 1982-1985. I call the rapporteur. Mr Harris. \u2014 Mr President, further to that point of order and with great respect, we do very greatly appreciate the move you have made in giving the President-in-Office the facility to answer this most important and most topical of questions. After all the Council met yesterday on a subject which is of vital importance to fishermen throughout the Community. However, if you remember, when I raised this matter on an earlier point of order, Mr President, I did, with great respect, ask that the matter should be put to the House to decide whether the President-in-Office should answer the question and also, obviously, 1 See Annex II. Mrs Rabbethge, rapporteur. \u2014 (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Development and Cooperation welcomes the Commission's inten tion to step up cooperation in the field of research and development with developing countries, especially since it has been generally acknowledged that agricul tural and medical research are of crucial importance in increasing agricultural production in the long term and in promoting basic improvements in the health of populations. Nevertheless, our Committee was not so impressed with the Commission's proposal that we felt like say ing that it was worth waiting for in the end. The Com mittee expressed a certain degree of irritation, a num- ",
        "No 1-286/152 Debates of the European Parliament 16.6.82 Rabbethge ber of divergent opinions, and fundamentally different interpretations with respect to the content of the pro posal. Why was this so? One reason is that the Commission's document was in some places formulated in a way which was not entirely solicitious, giving rise to appar ent contradictions between the avowed aims and pur poses of the proposal. The Committee on Develop ment and Cooperation goes along with this criticism. A brief perusal of the Commission's proposal might lead one to conclude that the most crucial issue to be dealt with is the expansion of research institutes within the Community. The point should have been empha sized much more strongly that research needs to be geared to the needs of developing countries rather than to the requirements of industrialized nations. In another working document of the Commission, however, it is emphasized that the meaning behind the proposal is to devote part of the research potential of Member States to highly technical programmes and projects which will help to solve urgent problems which developing countries are not yet in a position to solve on their own. At any rate, during the course of our discussions a number of bright ideas emerged and are now reflected in the motion for a resolution. Our definitive approval of the Commission's proposal depends, however, on the Commission's willingness to adopt a number of important amendments and additions as set down in \u00a7 44 of the motion for a resolution. It is not only the opinions of my colleagues or those of members of other committees which are reflected in the motion for a resolution, but also the knowledge and opinions of a whole number of European and non-European scien tists and experts who are responsible for dealing with these problems. I will mention only a few of the most important points incorporated in the motion for a resolution. Firstly, the proposal for a programme can only be con ceived as part of scientific and technical accompanying measures to aid development. Provision should be made for a further programme after four years, with further financial measures, as the problems to be tackled cannot possibly be solved in such a short period of time. Secondly, the relatively small amount earmarked for the proposed programme means that priorities will have to be defined quite clearly. In the third place, the aims of the research and its con tent must be established in accordance with the basic needs of developing countries, with top priority being assigned to comprehensive agricultural research, given the precarious food situation in most developing coun tries. Fourthly, from the outset, careful planning must gov ern the participation of the research institutes of devel oping countries and ensure technical and financial aid for the support and expansion of regional research institutes in developing countries. Fifthly, developing countries must be guaranteed the right to voice their views as members of any commit tees set up to implement the programme, and the par ticipation of representatives from relevant expert organizations must also be ensured. Sixthly, it is vital to promote partnership and coopera tive relations between ourselves and the developing countries and to promote the education of scientists from developing countries either here in Europe or in their own countries. It is essential to store the results of research centrally. Our Committee wishes to emphasize the fact that it is necessary for the research results which are needed and could be used by developing countries to be made available to all of them. Among the technical projects to be carried out, the following must take priority: improvement of food production \u2014 in particular, by increasing protein-rich food production\u2014 tropical medicine, land develop ment, alternative sources of energy, exportation of raw materials, desalination, birth control and the use of satellites for meteorological and other purposes. The implementation of true development in develop ing countries, based on the participation of large sec tions of their populations, is a condition which deter mines the success of any initiatives. Instead of promot ing growth in isolated enclaves where modernity has reached, development ought to be broad-based and seek to integrate the masses into the process of achiev ing growth. Instead of the motto 'first grow, then share', we should have one which says: 'growth through participation of the masses in production'. Developing countries have need of new technical pro cesses which do not require much capital and which are also energy-saving. Methods of production must be found which will enable families and small commu nities to satisfy their basic needs themselves to a great extent. What is required is a new form of aid compris ing practical and technical alternatives at the same time. The emphasis must be placed on technical pro cesses which can be reproduced in the majority of developing countries even where resources are meagre. A number of people have criticized the fact that the Commission's proposal lays too much emphasis on the expansion of research institutes in the Community, and hence too much emphasis on basic research. Research in industrialized countries to promote devel oping countries must of course concentrate on basic research, but, at the same time, it is necessary to coor- ",
        "16.6. 82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/153 Rabbethge dinate basic research with fact-finding missions on the place for which it is destined. Known research results must, as a priority, be adapted to conditions specific to development; this necessitates the type of research which, to a great extent, is specifically geared to solv ing problems and which concentrates more on the needs of developing countries than on the require ments of the industrialized countries. The Commission proposal should therefore comprise two equal parts which will grow together, namely, basic research and fact-finding missions. Above all, the efforts made by the developing coun tries themselves are a guarantee that science and tech nology can actually be put to use by the countries involved. The Committee on Development and Coop eration is particularly interested in the way in which the programme is to be implemented and carried out, because the conditions under which the programme is executed are what counts when assessing the value of the programme for developing countries. Precise rules are needed to govern the decision-making process, the management and monitoring of the programme's implementation, so that the aims of the programme can be achieved with the desired degree of efficiency and flexibility and at the same time can be seen to cor respond to the specific needs of the developing coun tries. What is more, the programme will be meaning less unless research institutes in the developing coun tries are involved in all the work from the outset and unless the Community gives its support to scientific establishments in the developing countries where the programme is being implemented so that they can expand their own research and development capaci ties. Unless both types of research are synchronized, the whole project will founder! If we concentrate on essentials, the proposal submitted by the Commission now before us is a useful attempt to initiate improvements in the deployment of scien tific potential for the purposes of development policy. Our target must be to reduce the advantage which the European research institutes enjoy in the field of knowledge in order to show that the Community's development policy is to be viewed not as a form of paternalistic aid but as cooperation between true part ners. cipating committees. From the scientific point of view, of course, we are hardly conquering any new territo ries with this Commission proposal. It does however constitute a fundametally new element in European development policy. The cereals shortfall will be 190 million tonnes in the year 1990 \u2014 only 8 years away \u2014 and by the year 2000 it will be around 395 million tonnes. These shortages can only be made good by increases in production and one way of achieving this is by promoting agricultural research, which is a long- term research project. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this Parliament of ours has always been well aware of its responsibility towards developing countries. This has been demon strated amply in the case of emergency and disaster aid and in the debate on hunger in the world. It is such behaviour which to a large extent has been responsible for the good image of this House in the public eye. We should remember that all of us in this House will be held responsible for the situation in 1990 and 2000. When it comes to our ideas and actions for combatting hunger in the world, we will also be questioned about scientific research. I appeal to you all, and especially to some members of the Socialist Group: please stop this business of abstaining and work with us so that in this way too we can fight against hunger in the world! Give us your approval for the motion for a resolution. I can do no better than to quote the words of Her mann Kahn, the American researcher, who said: 'Tomorrow's world needs us today.' President. \u2014 The debate is closed. The motion for a resolution will be put to the vote at the next voting time. 4.

Secondly, I think that is not a valid reason to postpone a vote and so I would ask the Assembly not to follow your advice. I call Mr Berkhouwer.

President. \u2014 If you ask for an adjournment, Mr Pranch\u00e8re, I am obliged to put the matter to the vote, which is different from the practice in the French Assembl\u00e9e Nationale. I can put it to the vote only if ten other Members support your request. Do you have ten Members to support you? I note that there are ten such Members.

For a detailed account of the voting, see Minutes) Donnez report (Doc. 1-298/82) /adopted Explanations of vote Mr Enright. \u2014 Whilst I accept that there is a consistency between the previous report produced on this subject and this report, I think it is a consistency which is wholly wrong and which is contradictory to natural justice and natural law. If Mr Pannella wishes to be tried before the courts of his country, then he or any Member of this House has that right and should have that right and it is in no way up to this House to take away from any Member his natural rights. That, in effect, is what we are doing if we pass this report. I think it would be wholly, completely and utterly wrong and we do ourselves a grave dis service in passing it. I therefore shall be voting against it, and I hope that those Members who believe in natural justice will also oppose it. Mr Megahy. \u2014 Yes, Mr President, I was the only member of the Legal Affairs Committee who actually voted against the adoption of this report so I am being quite logical now in supporting this in the House. I support the views that have been put forward by Mr Enright and I would say that I find it quite remarkable that when we are talking about events before the time when Mr Pannella came into this House, one should be using the argument that it is necessary in order to uphold the institutions and the dignity of this House that we should continue to refuse to waive Mr Pannella's immunity. I find that a remarkable argument. The circumstances surrounding this have no connection with the European Parliament. They cannot in any way be said to affect the working of this institu tions and it seems to me that we are guilty of gross political interference there. If politi cally Mr Pannella feels that he ought to face the courts in order to get a chance to have his name cleared, as he puts it, then we ought to afford him that right and we ought not to use this cloak' of parliamentary immunity to protect him from this under the guise of pro tecting the EEC institutions or the dignity of this Parliament.

We must hope that mutual understanding will prevail over this unilateral decision contrary to GATT rules. When the Foreign Ministers meet on 21 and 22 June they will have tcmake this point quite clear and this measure will have to be rescinded. Secondly, there is the disturbing attitude of American embassies in Europe, especially in Brussels, when it comes to granting visas for the special session on disarmament which is currently being held at the United Nations in New York. A churchman, Canon Gord, and a university professor, Mrs Pierson, are still not able to go to the UN Assembly in New York on the grounds that they are supposed to have had contacts with Communist circles over a period of time. It must be said that democrats in Europe are not keen on the arrival here of this kind of witch hunt, which totally lacks any basis of freedom and democracy. Mr Kyrkos. \u2014 (GR) Mr President, we shall be voting against Mrs Gredal's report and motion for a resolution. Both in this Flouse and from any other platform we consistently support the need for the European Community to acquire its own identity. But this means severing the bonds of dependence on the United States, and ceasing to be a mouthpiece of US policy, which pursues the aim of world domination and thus backs the most reaction ary regimes everywhere, encourages an unbridled arms race, instigates or provides cover for crimes against humanity, such as the Israeli attack on the Lebanon, the genocide being committed against the Palestinian people and the Turkish occupation of Cyprus, and is leading the world to the brink of nuclear disaster. Our vision is one of an independent Europe, links of peace and cooperation both with the United States and with the Soviet Union, and support for a new world economic and political order going beyond the mili tary blocs and based on the equal'participation of small countries and the Third World in international relations. Mrs Gredal's report leads us in the opposite direction, and so the Greek Communist Party of the Interior will vote against it. Mr Ephremidis. \u2014 (GR) Mr President, we do not doubt the need for the Community and its Member States to cooperate economically with the USA and with any other country in the world. But we are doubtful about the active role of the Community as such in the development of relations within the Atlantic Alliance, as stated in paragraph 1 of the report. Furthermore, we doubt the honesty of the report, since the literary turns of phrase on cooperation for security and peace hide the real fact \u2014 of which the peoples of the Com munity have painful experience \u2014 that the relations of their countries with the USA are relations of total dependence in which the role of the USA is damaging to their economic interests, as shown by the notorious problem of high interest rates, and dangerous, as shown by the increased stationing by the USA of rockets in Europe, by the theory of limited nuclear war in Europe and by the pressure put on the countries of Europe to keep on increasing their military expenditure. For these reasons and because the resolution does not place \u2014 either because its author does not wish to or because she was not allowed to \u2014 the relations of the Community and its Member States with the USA on an equal footing which would genuinely serve the interests of the peoples and of peace, we shall be voting against the motion and the report. Mrs Baduel Glorioso. \u2014 (IT) Mr President, I feel there is some definite meaning in the fact that the chairman of the delegation is not present. You cannot send a delegation from the European Parliament off to the United States with a document which is as vague and as lacking in balance as this one is. The fact is that although there is recognition of the links with the United States and between the European Parliament and the US Congress the equal balance is merely stated and not backed up with arguments in this document which is pretty poor and \u2014 I coud add \u2014 humiliating for Europe, for the reason that this balance should be founded, with due modesty on our side, also on where we differ with the United States. I can mention the economic dispute on the problems in the steel indus try which are causing redundancies in Europe. I can mention the dispute over interest ",

Matters like these should be properly discussed on a genuinely equal foot ing between partners. We are not keen on stirring things up between the United States and Europe. We want to strengthen our ties with the United States and with the US Congress. Let me quickly say, Mr President, that the Kennedy resolution for a freeze on arms and the peace marches are forging a new and powerful bond between the people of the United States and the people of western Europe. Mrs Van Hemeldonck. \u2014 (NL) Mr President, I intend to abstain from voting on this motion for a resolution since it misses the real issues. The preamble rightly stresses the political interdependence of the European Community and the United States, but the recommendations overlook the fact that economic and social matters are also political matters. It shows a deplorable lack of awareness of the social problems and even fails to mention the scandalous cutbacks which the current American Government is making in the social sector, with the result that millions are being made unemployed and further mil lions losing their rights to social security and an alternative source of income. The resolu tion disregards the violation by President Reagan of trade union rights as laid down by the International Labour Organization. I would draw your attention here, for example, to the dismissal of striking air-traffic controllers and the denial of the right of workers in certain South-Western States to trade union respresentation. We in Europe are all too aware of the economic interdependence of the European Community and the United States. Amer ican multinationals which used to be established in the Member States indulged in social exploitation for years on end by taking what advantage they could of all the economic and social advantages which Europe affords, and then transferring their activities to low-wage countries, leaving behind them highly-trained workers without jobs and substantial social security debts. These too, Mr President, are political aspects of the relations between the European Community and the United States which this Parliament should discuss. Mrs Boserup. \u2014 (DA) This report insists that it is the aim of the Soviet Union to see a split between the USA and Western Europe. This does not fit in at all well with our wishes for independent positions in political cooperation. It is simply an unthinking parrotting of attitudes which are likely to cause friction. In addition, the report advocates the European Community playing an active r\u00f4le in NATO. There is no foundation for this, either in the Treaty or from the political point of view, and, furthermore, the idea involves brushing Ireland aside, since it is not a member of NATO. The resolution has been called a political signal. It is a dangerous signal and I intend to vote against it. Buttafuoco report (Doc. 1-182): adopted Albers report (Doc.1-211/82): adopted ",

Explanations of vote Mr Sutra. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, it will only take me a moment to say how sorry I am that some of the paragraphs in this report have been hacked about. Be that as it may, the report is still along the right lines, Mr Maffre-Baug\u00e9's efforts have been outstanding and the work of the committee has been rewarding. Although there have been one or two votes against the report here in the Chamber, we shall be supporting it. Unfortunately, in this European Community there are two Europ\u00e9s in our view, and since I have been sitting in this Parliament I have realized how true this is when it comes to the budget. The fruit and vegetables that this report is about have always come off badly in the common agricultural policy. Since the creation of the common market in fruit and vegetables in 1970 and up to 1981 fruit and vegetables have received on average 0-8% of the EAGGF budget, which if you ask me is scandalous. In recent years there has been a system of aid for processed fruit and vegetables. But they still get barely 3 \u00b7 5 or 4% of the EAGGF budget. That is the way things are at the moment, and as a result it is sad that some of the Members here have done a hatchet job on this report and shorn it of all its strength and punch. However, you should never follow a policy of making things worse in a parliament, and that is why \u2014 since this report is along the right lines \u2014 we shall be voting in favour of it. Mr P\u00e9ry. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, France and especially its southern regions on the Medi terranean and Atlantic coasts make a fair contribution to Community production by accounting for 19% of the fruit and 25% of the vegetables grown in the EEC. Bolstering the organization of the market is therefore a major objective for the French Government. On 2 June the setting up of a fruit and vegetable office was approved by the French Con seil des Ministres. The job of this office will be to implement Community regulations but it will also have one or two new tasks to cope with, such as market trends and transparency, assessment of production potential and regional needs, speedier response to foreign trade and promotion of products. Added improvements to Community legislation are needed in our view and we support the Maffre-Baug\u00e9 report which moves along these lines. Three points are particularly important. First of all: a more important role for producer groups. We hope that the Member States will be able to extend the regulations governing producer groups to cover producers who are not organized. Secondly,.we need to see an improvement in management procedures which could be preventive in nature, in particular the idea of public purchasing occurring at a stage in the marketing process ahead of the retail stage. And thirdly, we need to strengthen the import arrangements, by extending the system of reference prices to new products and keeping for the moment the import schedule. When Spain joins the Community the area of farmland, the number of holdings and the number of people working on them will go up by 30%. It is therefore vital to make a start now on improving the common organization of the market in fruit and vegetables. Mr Vgenopoulos. \u2014 Mr President, I regret to say that I too am forced to agree with what my colleagues have previously said because this excellent report \u2014 one of the few of such high quality which have been presented to this Parliament \u2014 has been amended to such an extent that in very many points it has become unrecognizable. This applies especially to the points which are of particular interest to the Mediterranean countries, such as Com munity preference and the extension of protection to fruit and vegetables from the Medi- ",

I regret that the report has been amended to such an extent that whereas originally we had decided to vote in favour of it, we will now abstain. Mr Pranch\u00e8re. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, in the south of France fruit and vegetable growers have just started taking action to protest against the drop in rates which is mainly the result of the trend in imports. Things cannot go on like this. It is high time we righted the wrongs which Mediterranean farmers in the Community have to suffer. The Maffre- Baug\u00e9 resolution puts forward a series of proposals which if implemented would provide growers with a guaranteed security and level of income and the development opportuni ties they need. I shall not mention again the positive elements which were tabled and adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and then by Parliament. However, we are unreservedly against the Woltjer amendment on enlargement as from 1984, since it involves a serious threat to Mediterranean growers. It is clear that all the provisions of the report would be swept aside if enlargement came about. Given the circumstances, at the end of the debate we intend to ask for an adjournment in order to assess our position. We are sorry to see this amendment which opposes measures that were indispensable and will remain indispensa ble for Mediterranean producers. Mr Gautier. \u2014 (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the German Social Democrats intend to vote against this report. The Commission document on the reorganization of the market, which has been submitted to us, was already a compromise which we would have found it difficult to support. With this report it has become virtually impossible to go along with the matter. It amazes me that many of my Christian-Democratic friends in Germany are against the destruction of fruit and vegetables but \u2014 when it comes to the crunch \u2014 vote in favour of continuing the Community practice of destroying cherries, capsicums, artichockes and green beans. We cannot and will not go along with this. Nor will be go along with increased protectionism on the part of the Community in the fruit and vegetable sector and its wish to introduce, if possible, similar systems as in the milk sector. We German Social Democrats also advocate changes in the system, but along dif ferent lines than those advocated by the Christian Democrats. Mr Cottrell. \u2014 Mr President, while indicating that I shall vote against this report, and recognizing as I do the strength, vigour and boundless fertility of the agricultural lobby in this Chamber, I wonder whether you would consider a ruling as to whether those Mem bers who will gain a direct financial benefit from this and other agricultural proposals should actually take part in it? I fully recognize, however, that there is a problem there, because there are so many farmers in the House we might not actually have a quorum to complete the vote. Mr Vitale. \u2014 (IT) Mr President, with regard to the Commission proposals and also those put forward by the Committee on Agriculture, we stand by all the reservations which were voiced during the debate on behalf of the Italian Members of the Communist and Allies Group and winch initially \u2014 as I said before \u2014 had prompted us towards abstaining. However, let me now say that we shall be voting in favour, for two basic reasons. The first is that since then the House has adopted some of our amendments which we felt were important. The second reason is that the Woltjer amendment has gone through and this removes one of the things we were worried about, namely that this report might include obstacles to Spain's joining the Community. These are tow good reasons why we should be voting in favour and there is also a third one, and on this point I agree with Mr Sutra. By voting in favour, we are not only voicing our regard for the Maffre-Baug\u00e9 report but also distancing ourselves from the violent cri ticisms of the entire Mediterranean policy which many Members from northern Europe, ",
        "No 1-286/160 Debates of the European Parliament 16. 6. 82 particularly among the Coservatives, expressed during the debate and justified on rather spurious budgetary grounds. Consequently, we shall be voting in favour of the report. Dalsass report (Doc. 1-184/82) /adopted The rapporteur was: \u2014 in favour of Amendments Nos 2, 4 and 5. Explanations of vote Mr McCartin. \u2014 While I support the recommendations in the Dalsass report because they would make Directives 159 and 161 much more relevant to the conditions in remote areas of the Community, I do not want at the same time to be seen as condoning the delay by the Commission in putting forward the new measures. It should be recognized that 159 and 160 have been most ineffective in poorer, more remote areas of the Community where the structures are bad and development is required. I want also to state that I am unhappy that whilst we have a common agricultural policy, nevertheless structural assist ance has not been uniformly provided throughout this Community and in regions where the structures are worst and incomes are lowest, the least aid and assistance is being given. I want the Commission to take a particular look at this situation when drawing up and amending their directive to ensure that the areas of greater need will at least get assistance comparable to areas which are in fact better off. Mr Clinton. \u2014 I have sought an opportunity to give an explanation of vote, not because I disagree with anything that is said in the Dalsass report, but because I have a feeling that the Commission is not sufficiently in touch with what is happening in relation to the oper ation and effectiveness of these directives in each of the Member States. The flexibility of a directive can, in certain cases, be a good thing but in the implementa tion of these directives, it has had, in the main, a detrimental effect. In some Member States the maximum permitted benefits are not being paid at all and even worse than that, costs are not being updated with the result that farmers are getting, in some cases, less than half the available grant. In other Member States where agricultural-support measures represent a very small percentage of the total budget, the maximum benefits are being paid. I have the feeling that the Commission may not be aware of these important details. I would not like to feel that they are aware but have not been prepared to do anything about them. I feel very strongly also that in severely handicapped areas, grants should be paid as to 100% from Community funds. This is one way to eliminate the difference in levels of support being given to farmers with similar degrees of handicap, and it is also a way, perhaps, for giving supplementary income without robbing people of their dignity and self-respect. I think it is a great pity, too, that the pension scheme as provided in some Member States for the release of land has not been working really at all. It is too bad that farmers have no alternative but to go on trying to work when they are no longer able to work and it is also a loss of a valuable national resource. Mr Nielsen. \u2014 (DA) From the legal point of view, the crux of this report is that we should approve the Commission's proposal to continue, on a provisional basis, the existing rules governing structural aid and this is something I can go along with. When we come to the various points in the resolution, some of them are clearly excellent \u2014 for example, ",
        "16. 6. 82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/161 paragraph 6 on the possibility of young people taking over holdings and paragraph 9 on stricter control on State aids. However, there are also a number of items about which I am sceptical and have reservations. These are those points which are aimed at making the agricultural structural fund an instrument of social and regional policy. I can wholeheart edly sympathize with the idea of the Community taking action as regards social and regional policy in the backward areas too, but, in my view, this action should not take place via the agricultural policy. I therefore have reservations regarding these items. Nevertheless, I go along with the general aim, Le. to continue until 1983 with the current arrangements which support the development of effective family holdings \u2014 and I stress both 'effective' and 'family* \u2014 and the modernization of processing plants. Mr Vgenopoulos. \u2014 (GR) Mr President, we are in complete agreement with the Com mission's initiative seeking to prolong the three directives on agricultural structures. The discussions on the revision of the common agricultural policy has not taken account of the Community provisions currendy in force, and in any case prolonging the validity of the directives on social structures until the end of 1983 will give the Community institutions time to examine the question more thoroughly and to make use of new data. These direc tives on social structures play a most important part in keeping the farming population on the land, particularly as regards the disadvantaged regions of the Community. Greece only applies Directive 268 of 1975, which concerns the problem regions, and this only as far as compensatory amounts are concerned. On this point, Mr President, I agree with the previous speakers and protest against the fact that the Community reimburses my country for only 25% of the expenditure involved, while Italy and other countries receive 50% of such expenditure. I would agree with the Member who stated that the Community should pay 100% in these problem regions. But in any case, Mr President, since it is necessary to aid the agricultural regions, whether they involve cultivation, stock farming or hill farm ing, and since, if this is not done, the inhabitants of these regions will abandon their activi ties there, with all the social repercussions caused by such a rural exodus, we shall vote for the motion for a resolution by the Committee on Agriculture, with which we fully agree. Israel report (Doc. l-296/82):&\u00e1optied The rapporteur was: \u2014 in favour o\u00ed Amendments Nos 1,2,3 and 8; \u2014 against Amendments Nos A, 5,6 and 7. Explications of vote Mr Plaskovitis. \u2014 (GR) Mr President, the Greek Socialists have frequendy had the opportunity of stating that they are firmly opposed to any military action which violates international law and amounts to the destruction of the sovereignty of an independent State. This statement of ours is still valid for the violation of the independence of Afghanistan. However, this does not mean that we can approve of texts which are fanatical and one sided, like die Isra\u00ebl report, which more or less asks us to recognize the internal Afghan resistance as the legitimate force representing the people, and this at a lime when there has never been any such proposal either for the forces of liberation in El Salvador or for the Palestine Liberation Organization. Reports such as the one before us do a disservice to the efforts to achieve detente and disarmament, which are the only way of providing a defini tive solution to the problem of Afghanistan also. For these reasons the Greek Socialists will vote against the report. ",
        "No 1-286/162 Debates of the European Parliament 16. 6. 82 Mr Alavanos. \u2014 (GR) Mr President, I should like to say the following on the Isra\u00ebl report: I think that the rapporteur is behaving rather like Don Quixote. His misfortune in Pakistan was not enough, since now he comes here and plays the general of the Afghan resistance by suggesting, in paragraph 5 that the Afghan 'resistance movements' should be united. In our view this report is not reactionary but ridiculous. The only thing I should like to refer to is the attitude of the enlarged Bureau. We find it unacceptable that the enlarged Bureau decided, even though it had not been agreed in advance, to place the report on the agenda together with Mr Tindemans' statement on the six months of the Belgian presi dency. This is an attempt by the enlarged Bureau to distract our attention from the burning issue of the day, namely the events in the Lebanon, and we are bound to condemn it. We shall, of course, vote against the report. Mr Segre. \u2014 (IT) Mr President, the Italian Communists condemned the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in strong terms. We asked for the troops to be withdrawn and we upheld the right of the Afghans to freedom, independence and self-determination. This was, is and will continue to be our position, together with our call for a political solution which will end this serious crisis and guarantee peace, independence and non-interference for Afghanistan and for the whole region. It is precisely because this motion for a resolution does not concentrate on this need for a political solution, but instead approaches the problem from a different angle, that we can not go along with it. There seems to be different thinking behind it, based on the idea of linkage which now \u2014 we are happy to say \u2014 even the Americans seem to be dropping because it is inadequate when it comes to controlling and coping with the serious crises we have at the moment in so many parts of the world, including Afghanistan. Mr H\u00e4nsch. \u2014 (DE) I would very much have liked to have voted in favour of Mr Israel's report. We join you all in this House in condemning the Soviet occupation of Afghani stan. We realize that the people of Afghanistan are fighting for their freedom, and we are prepared to give them political and humanitarian aid. We also acknowledge the fact that there are many positive things in this report. However \u2014 and I am saying this particularly for the benefit of Mr Isra\u00ebl himself \u2014 as long as the report contains statements such as those concerning the use of chemical weapons \u2014 for which, as you yourself know, there is no concrete evidence \u2014 as long as we try to influence the Afghan resistance organ ization and make suggestions as to what should be done and what should not be done, as long as we agree to support the Afghan resistance as an organization without going into the details of what form this support should take, I cannot go along with the report. Mr Ripa di Meana. \u2014 (IT) Mr President, I am sorry that the Socialist amendments met with only limited success. Be that as it may, many of us are aware of the importance of this motion, which endorses the political recognition of the Afghan resistance. This is a tre mendously important decision which could give a new direction to international solidarity. It is consistent and in line with all the other useful and timely moves of this Parliament. Let me also say that it is perfectly consistent with the unflagging expressions of political solidarity with the Afghan resistance from Socialist parties and Socialist leaders, such as Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand. Consequently I wish to inform the House that the Socialist Members in favour of this motion for a resolution include the following: Mr Glinne, Mr van Miert, Mr Ferri, Mr Zagari, Mrs Macciocchi, Mr Did\u00f2, Mr Pelikan, Mr Gatto, Mr Orlandi, Mr Lezzi, Mr Ruffolo, Mr Cariglia, Mr Arf\u00e9 and myself.

Along with Mrs Veil, Mr Ripa di Meana and others, I tabled the motion which was put to the Political Affairs Committee. Now, after the adoption of the Israel report, I assume that no delegation will be going to Pakistan and that there is there fore no longer any reason for this resolution. However, there is one problem I must mention. If we take action against Pakistan along the lines we have asked for, it will be the three million refugees who receive aid and pro tection from Pakistan who suffer the consequences. This means that while we persist with our moral and political condemnation \u2014 which is still quite justified \u2014 the part of the resolution dealing with retaliatory measures against Pakistan must fall, in my view, because these sanctions mark a disproportionate response and will only aggravate the existing problems which aid for the Afghan refugees has to cope with. I do not want the Afghan refuges to have to pay for a serious act committed by the Islam- bad government and above all I do not want the people who are calling out for aid in Pakistan to suffer the repercussions of a resolution which is wholly justified in moral terms but which should not call for economic sanctions against Pakistan if they are going to affect the poor refugees from Afghanistan.

Questions to the Commission Question No 6, by Miss de Valera (H-105/82) Subject: Social Fund aid for day nurseries Can the Commission confirm that it has now been established that the Social Fund can be used to help pay the cost of paying a nursery nurse for the children of women who are attending training courses? Answer 1. The Commission is glad to be able to confirm the position as set out in the honourable Member's question. 2. Social Fund grants are calculated as a percentage (usually 50%; in the absolute prior ity regions 55%) of expenditure in respect of the preparation, operation and management of training courses. (Article 3(1) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2396/71.) 3. No application for Social Fund assistance included child-care facilities as a cost until last year when East Leeds Women's Workshop submitted an application under the Women's Section. The expenditure included the cost of employing a person to be respon sible for the care of the children of the women attending the course on the training prem ises. Following a favourable opinion from the Social Fund Committee, the inclusion of this cost as part of the eligible expenditure for the purpose of determining the amount of the grant was approved by the Commission as part of the second series of Social Fund grants for 1981. This decision has attracted a good deal of attention from persons inter ested in equal opportunities for women. 4. Child care in isolation would not qualify for Social Fund aid. To be eligible, the facil ity must form part of a programme which is eligible for Fund assistance and selected for a grant by the Commission in accordance with the criteria prescribed in the guidelines for the management of the Fund. Question No 12, by Mr Collins (H-44/82) Subject: EEC code of practice relating to payments to workers in South Africa Is the Commission aware that there are certain British companies who allegedly are in breach of the EEC code of practice relating to payments to workers in South Africa and will it say what action it proposes to take to bring these companies into line? Answer 1. The Code of Conduct for companies with subsidiaries, branches or representation in South Africa' is the result of concerted action between Member States within the frame work of political cooperation. The Commission participates in the work of political coop eration but it has not been instructed to administer the Code. 2. The Commission has been informed that certain Community firms are not fully com plying with the Code's provisions on pay, but it is unable to take the kind of action referred to by the honourable Member. ",

The Commission would like the Member States to continue their efforts to ensure the widest possible compliance with the Code's provisions and welcomes the cooperation and encouragement of the European Parliament to that end. Question No 25, by Mrs Hoffmann (H-135/82) Subject: Use of the European Social Funds to finance the vocational training of girls Can the Commission state with regard to each Member State how many girls of less than 25 years of age who were unemployed or in search of employment participated in 1981 in vocational training schemes arranged with assistance from the European Social Fund and the types of training and organizations for which finance was provided? Answer Training programmes specifically designed to prepare young women under 25 for entry into new types of employment or into professions where women are under-represented receive first priority under the 'young persons' category of intervention of the European Social Fund, and for this reason they are clearly identifiable. In 1981, Social Fund grants amounting to 23-5 million ECU were made towards a series of programmes of this type, submitted by six Member States and concerning a total of over 18 000 young women. This represents an increase of over 40 % compared with the previous year. Most of these pro grammes were carried out by the public authorities in Member States and involved train ing for the mechanical, electrical and building trades, as follows: Belgium: Office national de l'emploi, 100 persons, techno-industrial training 1 German Federal Republic: \u2014 Bundesminister f\u00fcr Arbeit (Ministry of Labour) on behalf of 8 regions, 9 285 persons for techno-industrial training 1 \u2014 Bundesanstalt f\u00fcr Arbeit (Federal Employment Department) 6 54\u00d3 persons for techno-industrial training 1 France: Ministry of Labour. 125 persons for training in building by the coordinating body for centres of apprenticeship. Netherlands: Ministry of Labour. 365 persons. Techno-industrial training 1 and for build ing and wood industries. United Kingdom: Dept. of Employment for Manpower Services Commission (Training Services Division). 665 persons in mechanical and electro-engineering. Besides these relatively important programmes, there are also a number of non-continuous programmes. For example, the training of telephone fitters, landscape gardeners (town of Bremen, 10 persons) and car mechanics (Bradford College, 15 persons). If the German Federal Republic was the first country to take a special interest in this type of aid, then other countries are now in turn presenting more substantial programmes. For example, the D\u00e9l\u00e9gation \u00e0 la formation professionelle in France obtained for the year 1982 approval for a programme involving 8 080 persons, while a new programme for 9 000 per sons presented by the same body is at present under consideration for the period 1 July 1982 to 30 June 1983. 1 Techno-industrial training implies access to the following occupations: locksmith, metalworker, toolmaker, mechanic, electrician, lathe-operator, printer.

        "No 1-286/166 Debates of the European Parliament 16. 6. 82 It should be emphasized that young women under 25 also participate in the many other kinds of training schemes which were grant-aided by the Social Fund in 1981. Many of these were the large-scale youth unemployment programmes for which it is not possible even for the promoters themselves to give precise details about the exact nature of the training or the number of girls taking part. More information about Social Fund opera\u00ad tions is however included in the annual reports of the Social Fund. Question No 27, by Mrs Le Roux (H-l38/82) Subject: Dumping of radioactive waste in the Atlantic In 1981, 9435 tonnes of radioactive products from the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland were dumped in the Atlantic 800 kilometers off the coast of Britanny under the supervision of the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency. Given the progress which has been made in the treatment and stockpiling of waste on land, does the Commission not intend to propose to the Member States regulations res\u00ad tricting and eventually prohibiting the above practices? Anwer The Commission of the European Communities has not participated in any way in the organization of the dumping in which some of the Member States have participated. These dumpings are supervised by the Nuclear Energy Agency (\u039d\u0395\u0391) of the OECD. They are executed in accordance with the provisions of the London Convention on the prevention of marine pollution by dumping wastes and other matter and in accordance with the recommendations of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for the application of the Convention. The Commission has however followed the evaluation of the validity of the site which was performed in 1978 and 1979. This OECD evaluation concluded that: \u2014 the site would be suitable for the receipt of packaged radioactive wastes during the next five years at annual rates comparable to those reached in the past; \u2014 there is a need to develop a site-specific model of the transfers of radionuclides, parti\u00ad cularly on short and medium time scales, from the dump area to human populations. Therefore there is clearly a need to continue investigations presently aimed at improv\u00ad ing our knowledge of transport processes in the north-east Atlantic. A programme plan for research and surveillance which has to complete the scientific basis for the evaluation of the dumping site was approved by the \u039d\u0395\u0391 in April 1981. An execu\u00ad tive group has been set up to implement the programme plan. As far as the competence and responsibility of the Community is concerned I underline that in accordance with Article 37 of the Treaty the Member States have to send to the Commission the general data of any plan for the disposal of radioactive waste in whatever form, so as to enable the Commission to evaluate whether the implementation of such plans is liable to result in the radioactive contamination of the water, soil or airspace of another Member State. A new recommendation for the apllication of Article 37 which the Commission approved last February (OJ No L 83 of 29. 3. 1982) indicates what has to be understood by disposal of radioactive waste. It makes clear that the sea dumping of radioactive wastes has to be declared under Article 37. As indicated by the honourable Member the techniques for surface storage of these types of wastes are well established. However for various reasons certain Member States feel that they need sea dumping for particular types of voluminous low level wastes. As the dumping practice is in line with the provisions of the London Convention and the interna- ",
        "16. 6. 82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/167 tional recommendations and considering that it can be excluded that contamination can result from the dumpings as performed up to now, a Commission intervention over what has been stated previously is not necessary or justified at this moment. Question No 29, by Mr Kyrkos (H-141/82) Subject: Adverse consequences of accession on Greece's trade balance in agricultural products At a recent meeting of Communist and Socialist Members in Brussels on 3 and 4 May to discuss the Community r\u00e9gime for Mediterranean products, Greek experts revealed that after one year of membership Greece had a deficit in its balance of trade with the Com munity in agricultural products. Considering that Greece is primarily an agricultural country and that this was the first time in its history that it had a trade balance deficit in agricultural products, what does the Commission intend to do to counter the negative consequences of accession on Greece's trade balance in agricultural products? Answer It is true that Greece's balance of trade with the other Member States in agricultural and food products was negative in 1981. However, it is not correct to suggest that Greece's balance of trade in these products was negative for the first time in history. Such a result occurred at least in 1973 and 1979. Greek imports from other Member States increased in 1981, especially in the case of meat and dairy products which accounted for almost 60% of all agricultural and food products from the Community. On the other hand, Greece had a more positive balance of trade in cereals, fruit and vegetables. In the case of major products, increased imports from other Member States were compen sated by a drop in imports from third countries while increased exports to the Community were sometimes compensated by a reduced level of exports to third countries. For the first time since 1976 the trade balance with third countries was positive in 1981. The Commission regards this trend as a normal consequence of Greece's accession to a huge market which benefits from a better regional distribution of agricultural products, which has also brought benefits to the consumer. The Commission is convinced that Greek agriculture will be able to boost considerably its exports of typical Mediterranean products. It is not the Commission view that special measures directly affecting the Greek balance of trade are called for. The Commission would point out that certain measures have already been applied, for Greece's benefit, in both the areas of market support (cot ton, dried grapes, dried figs) and of production and marketing structures (producer groups, citrus fruit improvement plan). Question No 30, by Mr Gawronski (H-l44/82) Subject: Community inquiry into poverty The Community inquiry which found that there are eight million poor people in Italy caused a considerable stir. Can the Commission indicate to which social categories most poor people belong and what criteria were used to define poverty? ",
        "No 1-286/168 Debates of the European Parliament 16. 6. 82 Answer The poverty programme included three types of action: pilot projects, pilot studies and national reports. The national reports, which were undertaken by independent experts in each of the Mem ber States, aimed to provide information on the policies implemented in Member States to combat poverty in a variety of sectors: income, housing, education, health, etc. In order to establish a basis for Community comparisons, most of those responsible for the national reports agreed to assemble data on the basis of two alternative definitions of the poverty threshold; which were 40% and 60% of net average income per inhabitant of the country concerned. The Italian report, which Mr Gawronski is referring to, used a different basis for calculat ing the number of poor in Italy: a family of two persons whose average monthly expendi ture in 1978 was less than LIT 175 000. It is on this basis that the eight million is obtained for Italy, that is to say approximately 15% of the population. More detailed data may be found in the national reports (a complete set of which has been sent to the Parliamant) as well as in Chapter IV of the Commission's final report where the total number of poor is estimated at 30 million for the mid-1970s, based on an inter mediate poverty threshold of 50%. It is important, however, to remember that a poverty threshold is only a relative measure as it relates only to income since other factors also characterize poverty. These are also considered in the national reports and the final Commission report. Question No 32, by Mr Calvez (H-147/82) Subject: General practitioners General practitioners, especially in the Netherlands, consider that the judgement handed down by the Court of Justice in the Broekmeulen case (246/80) has given rise to discrimi nation against national doctors who have followed a specific course of training in general medicine. Is the Commission aware of their concern and does it intend to put forward proposals for a directive in this connection? Can the Commission inform Parliament what work it has already done concerning the role of general practitioners and the extent of their training? Answer The Commission is aware of the reaction, referred to by Mr Calvez, aroused by the judgement of the Court of Justice in the Broekmeulen case (246/80). It should, however, like to emphasize in this connection that the mutual recognition of diplomas, as laid down by the 'Doctors' Directives of 1975, is based on the harmonization of minimum standards of training. Under this system, a Member State may not impose additional training requirements on migrant doctors, even where this training is required by the Member State in question for the purposes of its national diplomas. Nevertheless, the Commission is aware of the changes taking place in recent years in the profession of general practitioner. Therefore, after seeking the opinion of the Advisory Committee on Medical Training and the Committee of Senior Officials on Public health, 1 1 Set up by the Council Decisions of 16 June 1975 (OJ L 167, 30. 6. 1975).

Question No 33, by Mr Prag (H-148/82) Subject: Postage rates within the European Community In response to my Written Question No 1512/81, ! the Council failed \u2014 indeed did not attempt \u2014 to justifiy the failure of two Member States, the United Kingdom and Ireland, to apply the Commission's Recommendation of 29 May 1979 that inland postal rates should be applied to letters and postcards in mail between Community countries. The result is flagrant discrimination between Member States in mail charges despite the fact that postal communication is an important element in freedom of movement for peo ple, goods and capital. Users in the UK and Ireland are particularly affected. When is the Commission going to do something about it? And what? Answer 1. On 11 September 1980 the Commission wrote to the Member States, including the United Kingdom and Ireland, reminding them of its Recommendation of 29 May 1979 and asking them to follow it. In its answer to the Commission the United Kingdom explained why it could not do so. Under the Post Office Act 1969 the Post Office alone is responsible for determining post al rates. The Government has no power to intervene in the matter. The Post Office considers that since it is required to operate on a strictly commercial basis and meet strin gent financial commitments it is unable to apply the inland postal rate to mail addressed to the other Member States. Ireland has not replied to the Commission's letter. 2. The Commission is aware of the psychological effect on Community citizens of having the inland rate apply throughout the Community. It also shares the honourable Member's view that these rates ar a key factor in the free movement of services. On the other hand, the Commission is aware too of the financial problems the postal authorities would have in introducing the inland rate. The Commission is nevertheless pursuing its efforts to find a solution which would overcome these difficulties and is looking into the question whether it should not propose specifically Community measures to achieve the purpose the honourable Member has in mind. Question No 34, byMrBeazley (H-l52/82) Subject: Revision of Regulation No 67/67/EEC Following on from paragraph 14 of the European Parliament's resolution on the Commis sion's Tenth Report on Competition Policy, will the Commission forward its proposal to revise Regulation No 67/67/EEC in time to enable Parliament to express its opinion before the adoption of the new regulation and, if so, when? 1 OJC92, 13. 4. 1982, p. 11.

In publishing these proposals the Commission invites all interested parties to submit their comments. In accordance with its normal practice, the Commission will be sending the draft texts, once they are ready for publication, to the members of the appro priate committee of the European Parliament and to the appropiate division of the Eco nomic and Social Committee for information and discussion. Question No 35, by Mr Christopher Jackson (H-l 58/82) Subject: Action on the Lange resolution of 15 November 1979 1 At present virtually all Commission proposals involve direct financial advantage to some Member States and corresponding disadvantage to other Member States. For each Mem ber State in the Council of Ministers the assessment of this balance of advantage usually outweighs the intrinsic merit of a proposal for the Community as a whole, and is a major factor in the current crisis in the Community. In November 1979 in the Lange report, the European Parliament made proposals to break the pernicious link between Community policy and immediate financial cost or benefit to a Member State, and to promote economic convergence. Will the Commission give its current view on the Lange proposal for financial equalization and will the Commission, in view of the current crises in the mandate negotiations, agree to put forward as a matter of urgency proposals along the lines called for in the Lange resolution agreed by Parliament in November 1979? Answer 1. The Commission shares the opinion of Parliament, expressed in its resolution of 15 November 1979, that convergence can come about only from the development of gen uinely common policies and from the coordination of the policies pursued by the Member States in the economic and monetary spheres. 2. The Commission also shares the concern expressed in that resolution about the finan cial imbalances which exist in the budget and the burdens which they place on certain Member States. In the Commission's view the principal cause of these imbalances lies in the pattern of expenditure through the Community budget. 3. The Commission has taken note of Mr Lange's proposal contained in the resolution in question. We believe that ideas of this kind, which could for example take the form of a progressive rate for VAT contributions, could well play a part in the development of new own resources for the Community. The Commission will, as the Commissioner responsi ble recalled in May in his speech to Parliament on the preliminary draft budget for 1983, make proposals for such new own resources when this becomes necessary to achieve agreed objectives. 1 OJ C 309, 10. 12. 1979, p. 34.

The figures used by the Commission for its analysis were provided by the Danish Government which had obtained them from the Danish Statistical Office. The figures relate to annual averages for the years 1979 and 1980. After completion of the Commission analysis, figures for 1981 became available. In the period 1979 \u2014 1981, the average level of unem ployment in the South-West of Jutland was 11-2% as against 10-8% for Denmark as a whole over the same period. 2. The honourable Member will by now in all probability \u2014 in view of the bulk of the material \u2014 have received the information relating to the first part of the question, i.e. the extent of aid on the German side of the border, directly from the Commission depart ments. Question No 37, by Mrs Hammerich (H-l 75/82) Subject: Classification of expenditure Will the Commission confirm that the reclassification of compulsory expenditure as non- compulsory expenditure implies the transfer of responsibility from the Council, in which there is the right of veto, to the Parliament where there is no right of veto, and that this transfer of responsibility detracts from the sovereignty of the Member States? Answer The honourable Member's question seems to be based on a misapprehension. The classifi cation of expenditure as compulsory and non-compulsory is effected each year in the course of the budgetary procedure by common agreement of the two arms of the budget ary authority (Council and Parliament) on the basis of the Treaty provisions. The Council acts during the budgetary procedure by a qualified majority. Question No 38, by Mr B\u00f8gh (H-l 76/82) Subject: Right of veto Will the Commission confirm that each of the ten Member States have the right to veto on decisions involving national vital interest, and that each of the ten countries decides for itself whether and when it considers a matter to be vital? 1 OTC 309, 10. 12. 1979, p. 34. 2 Cf. the extremely incomplete answer to Question No H-88/82, verbatim report of proceedings of the sitting of 12 May 1982.

        "No 1\u00ad286/172 Debates of the European Parliament 16. 6. 82 Answer It is not stated at any point in the Treaties that a Member State has the right to impose a veto to protect vital interests. The Treaties merely state in what cases unanimity is required and in what cases a qualified majority or simple majority is adequate. This is how the matter stands from the legal point of view. Question No 39, by Mr Simpson (H-l57/82) Subject: Import of frogs' legs from India Following its answer to my Written Question No 1733/81,\u25a0 will the Commission explain its view that a difficult economic situation in an exporting country is an adequate justifica\u00ad tion for avoidable cruelty to animals? Will it publish its guidelines as to what degree of economic difficulty justifies what amount of cruelty? Answer Quite obviously, a difficult economic situation is never an adequate justification for cruelty to animals. None of this was implied in the Commission's answer to Written Ques\u00ad tion No 1733/81. What was implied in the Commission's answer to Written Question No 1733/81 is that the suggested solution \u2014 a trade ban \u2014 would not provoke any modifica\u00ad tion in the methods of capture, transportation and slaughter of frogs, but would certainly provoke new difficulties in our relations with a developing country currently running a trade deficit of 900 million ECU with the Community, which it attributes to the Com\u00ad munity's restrictive policies. It can also be pointed out that at present the main responsibil\u00ad ity for sanitary conditions to which these importations are subject rests with the auth\u00ad orities of Member States. The Commission is giving priority in its working programme to the protection of farm animals during production, transport and slaughter. Question No 40, byMrPattison (H-l61/82) Subject: The future of the EMS In the statement issued at the end of the European Council of 29/30 March 1982, it is noted that the EMS has operated satisfactorily so far, and the Economic and Finance Council were asked to report back on actions to give fresh momentum to the system. However in its Annual Repon the Federal German Central Bank has virtually ruled out further development of the EMS? Can the Commission state its opinion of the German Central Bank's view and what action it considers necessary to give fresh momentum to the EMS? Question No 41, by Mr Boyes (H-169/82) Subject: Commission involvement in the European Institute for Security Policy It is understood that the general aim of the European Institute for Security Policy is the establishment of an EC defence policy.

Answer The task of the European Institute for Security Policy is to provide help in decision-mak ing on security policy issues in order to promote the aim of European Union by studying the outlook in the fields of foreign policy and security policy. Mr Narjes, Member of the Commission of the European Communities, attended the meeting of the Institute which was held in Brussels on April 1982 on invitation from the Institute's Chairman Mr Kai- Uwe von Hassel, MEP. Question No 42, byMrKazazis (H-l 78/82) Subject: Unsatisfactory allocation of Social Fund resources to Greece It can be seen from the first financial statistics established for 1981 that Greece was allo cated only 2-8% of the resources of the Social Fund's overall budget for that year. Does the Community consider this to be a satisfactory state of affairs? If not, what are the reasons for this state of affairs? Does the Commission intend, in connection with the revision of the regulation governing the Social Fund's operation, to take special measures on behalf of Greece in order to remedy this situation? Answer 1. Operations carried out in Greece benefited from a total of 30 648 000 ECU from the Social Fund (2-98% of the Social Fund budget) during 1981. The level of Greek partici pation in the Social Fund was inevitably influenced by the problems of adjustment facing any new Member State. The structure and capacity of the vocational training system within Member States also conditions the volume of eligible applications that may be sub mitted. In Greece much training activity is not eligible for Social Fund support since it comes within the normal school system. 2. To facilitate Greek access to the Social Fund during the period leading up to the review of the Fund, it was decided to retain the whole of Greece as a first priority region, eligible for the higher rate of Social Fund intervention. Similarly the guidelines for the management of the Fund provide for special account to be taken of the particular situation in Greece, which has enabled the Commission to finance operations which would not nor mally have received priority. 3. As stated in its recent response to the Greek memorandum of 19 March 1982, the Commission is willing to examine with the Greek authorities how they intend to develop the vocational training system. Depending on what priorities might be agreed, the Com mission will examine whether any special transitional measures should be taken to help speed up the scheduled transformation of the vocational training system.

Answer The Commission has proposed and the Council of Ministers has recently adopted a con tinued co-responsibility levy for 1982/83. It is expected that in the 1982/83 season over a third of the co-responsibility levy receipts will be used for specific measures designed to directly increase consumption (sales promo tion at home and abroad, the school milk scheme etc.), with the remainder being used towards the cost of measures for the disposal of milk products in surplus. Question No 44, by Mr Treacy (H-l80/82) Subject: Ineligibility of holders of British pensions for certain fringe benefits in Ireland Is the Commission aware of the situation obtaining in Ireland, where certain categories of pensioners in receipt of British pensions are not eligible for the full range of fringe benefits available to other Irish pension holders, such as, inter alia, free television and radio li cences, free telephone rental, free travel, free fuel and the living alone allowance; does it consider that Regulation 1408/71 on the application of social security schemes to employed persons and their families moving within the Community is relevant to the situ ation and will it call on the Irish Government to introduce the necessary measures to redress the situation? Answer 1. The Commission would referto its reply to Written Question No 574/80 of Mr O'Connell. 1 2. The schemes under which fringe benefits such as free travel, free television licences, free telephone rental and free fuel are granted to pensioners are non statutory social assistance schemes. These schemes are not covered by Regulation No 1408/71 on the application of social security schemes to employed persons and their families moving within the Community, as Article 4 (4) states : 'This regulation shall not apply to social and medical assistance .. .' It should be noted that the schemes in question apply to all residents fulfilling certain con ditions, irrespective of nationality. Furthermore, free travel is granted to all persons aged 66 or over and residing perma nently in Ireland, as well as to blind persons 18 years of age or over. OJC238, 17.9. 1980, p. 12. ",

Question No 45, by Mrs Baduel Glorioso (H-l85/82) Subject: South Korea Mr Narjes, on returning from his recent visit to South Korea, stated that he had been impressed by that country's economic performance, and stressed the South Koreans' desire for closer relations with the EEC. Does the Commission not agree that this economic success has been achieved largely thanks to political and social repression and, according to a recent ILO report, a legal working week longer than in any other country in the world (53 \u00b7 3 hours for women and 52 \u00b7 8 hours for men)? Answer It is true that the Republic of Korea's efforts in recent years to further the economic and industrial development of the country have produced remarkable results. During its frequent contacts with the Korean Government the Commission has on numer ous occasions made known its concern regarding the political r\u00e9gime in the Republic of Korea. Accordingly, when the President of the Commission, Mr Thorn, met the Koreah Prime Minister in 1981, he was at pains to stress the importance which all democracies attach to the respect of human rights. Mr Narjes pursued the same line during the visit to which the honourable Member refers. It is also undeniable that the hard work of the Korean people is one of the factors, although not the only one, which has contributed to the country's economic success. It is also without doubt that the working week in Korea is particularly long.

Question No 47, by Mr Marshall (H-l 94/82) Subject: Discrimination against imported cigarettes in Italy The Commission anounced in reply to an oral question by Mr Marshall in September 1981 that it was enquiring into the position regarding the sale of imported cigarettes in Italy. Nine months have now passed. Has the Commission published its findings and if so, what action, if any, does it propose to take? Answer In my reply to the previous question (H-249/81) on this subject by the honourable Mem ber, I said that the Commission still had to take a decision on the continuation of the proceedings against the Italian Government with regard to the monopoly for processed tobacco. As the honourable Member will have been able to ascertain from reading the 15th General Report and the 11th Report on Competition Policy, the Commission has been able to reconsider appealing to the Court on all the issues except the fixing of retail margins, as a result of the changes made by the Italian Government after negotiations conducted by me personally. I would point out that the Ministerial Implementation Decree under Law 724/ 75 on the importation and wholesale marketing of processed tobacco was passed and pub lished in the Official Gazette of the Italian Republic, No 42 of 12 February 1982. On 2 April 1982 the Italian Council of Ministers passed the bills on the changes to the said monopoly which were to be submitted to the Italian Parliament for urgent adoption. On the other hand, the problem of the fixed margin, which it was impossible to solve with the Italian Government, was put before the Court on 24 February 1982 (Case 74/82). In view of these results I believe that manufacturers from other Member States should soon be able to import and sell their products without any intervention from the mono poly, or if they so desire, to conclude new sales agreements with the monopoly without any pressure being brought to bear. With regard to the aspect which I mentioned in my reply to your previous question con cerning the distribution costs charged by the AAMS for the distribution under contract of products imported from other Member States, I would hope that I thought it better to concentrate on the main problems, for which we have obtained the above results. I shall however certainly take the required measures if they prove necessary.

        "16. 6. 82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/177 long-winded? Has the Commission any plans to review and simplify EAGGF application forms and procedure? Answer The Commission assumes that the honourable Member is referring to assistance granted under the Guidance Section of the EAGGF for projects to improve structures for the mar keting and processing of agricultural products in the context of Regulation (EEC) No 355/77, which is the most widely known. The forms required for applications for such assistance are prescribed by Regulation (EEC) No 219/78 and the parties concerned, for example, cooperative organizations, were closely involved in drafting them. The Commission feels that these forms, which call for information essential for the assessment of the economic and structural value of the project, are entirely appropriate to the needs of the situation given the financial import ance of the investment and of the Community aid in question. In the experience of the Commission's services, those concerned generally accept the need for these formalities and the Commission has therefore no intention of modifying these forms at present. Question No 49, by Mr Moreland (H-l 97/82) Subject: Tableware and ornamental ware imports from Korea and Taiwan In a written answer to me (No 416/81) 1 last August the Viscount Davignon said on behalf of the Commission 'The Commission does not propose restricting entry of ceramic prod ucts from Korea into the Community'. In view of the substantial increase into the Community of tableware and ornamental ware imports from Korea over the last year has the Commission changed its view on such imports from Korea and also from Taiwan? Answer The Commission has been informed that imports of tableware and other articles used for domestic or toilet purposes of common pottery and stoneware originating in particular in South Korea and Taiwan were increased and that the conditions in which they are taking place are liable to cause injury to the Community industry. In application of Regulation (EEC) 288/82 on common rules for imports the Commission decided to open an inquiry procedure in respect of importations of tableware and other articles used for domestic or toilet purposes of common pottery and stoneware.

Moreover within the framework of the generalized preferences system for 1982 the ceil- \u00b7 ings for imports of ceramic products from South Korea under the tariff headings referred to in Mr Davignon's reply to Written Question 416/81 2 were frozen at the same level as 1981 to take into account the competitivity of the Korean industry for these products.

Answer It is a well-known fact that South Africa is a major producer of natural uranium. As part of their supply policy Community consumers have concluded long-term contracts, includ ing contracts with South African suppliers. In accordance with the tasks for which the Supply Agency is responsible under the terms of Chapter VI of the Euratom Treaty, the Director-General of the Agency takes part in the negotiation of these contracts and signs them pursuant to the Agency's 1975 rules. This responsibility also requires the Agency to consider the conditions which are written into individual uranium supply contracts and which in particular concern its use and subsequent disposal with regard to peaceful uses. It is obvious in this context that contracts exist between the Director-General of the Agency, the users concerned and the South African authorities which seek to ensure that individual contracts contain clauses which are as satisfactory and as little restrictive as pos sible. II. Questions to the Council Question No 54, by Mr Coust\u00e9 (H-l 16/82) Subject: Benelux revival as an example for European unity Now that certain newspapers are reporting a Benelux revival, does the Council consider that this development could serve as an example for greater European unity? Answer Anything that might serve to strengthen the links between two or more Member States of the European Communities will also help to strengthen the Communities themselves. Question No 61, by Mr Alavanos (H-153/82/rev.) Subject: Action by the EEC to prevent the adjustment of the cost-of-living index At the European Parliament sitting of 10 March 1982, in reply to my question to the President of the Council as to whether the EEC intended to ask the Greek Government to keep within the margin of manoeuvre laid down by the Council or the Commission, the President stated that the Council would pronounce on the matter the following Monday. Can the Council state \u2014 with regard to the obstruction and delays in the implementation of the automatic adjustment of the cost-of-living index in Greece \u2014 whether pressure of ",
        "16. 6. 82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/179 any kind was exerted or 'wishes' expressed during the meeting of 15 March 1982 and the discussion of Greek economic policy with a view to preventing the automatic adjustment of the cost-of-living index in Greece; and whether the statement in the press communiqu\u00e9 that 'the Council endorses the main lines of the economic course to be pursued by the Hellenic Republic in its 1982 economic policy programme' also implies Council agree ment on the subject of the adjustment of the cost-of-living index, when, as is well known, the governments of many EEC Member States (United Kingdom, Belgium, etc.) are opposed to such measures? Answer The economic policy guidelines for Greece, adopted by the Council on 15 March, were published in the Official Journal of the European Communities on 24 March 1982. The honourable Member will note that, as for the other Member States, these guidelines relate to the policies considered most suitable for ensuring a durable and balanced development for the Greek economy. They do not make any reference to the problem of the automatic indexation of wages. Question No 62, by Mr Christopher Jackson (H-l 59/82) Subject: Action on the Lange resolution of 15 November 1979 1 At present virtually all Commission proposals involve direct financial advantage to some Member States and corresponding disadvantage to other Member States. For each Mem ber State in the Council of Ministers the assessment of this balance of advantage usually outweighs the intrinsic merit of a proposal for the Community as a whole, and is a major factor in the current crisis in the Community. In November 1979 in the Lange report, the European Parliament made proposals to break the pernicious link between Community policy and immediate financial cost or benefit to a Member State, and to promote economic convergence. Does the Council believe that Commission proposals along the lines of the Lange resolu tion referred to above could be a helpful initiative, either in relation to the mandate, or in the longer term? Answer The Commission has not submitted to the Council a proposal along the lines indicated in the honourable Member's question and the Council does not intend asking the Commis sion to submit such a proposal. Question No 63, byMrPattison (H-160/82) Subject: The future of the EMS In the statement issued at the end of the European Council of 29/30 March 1982, it is noted that the EMS has operated satisfactorily so far, and the Economic and Finance 1 OJ C 309, 10. 12. 1979, p. 34. ",
        "No 1-286/180 Debates of the European Parliament 16.6.82 Council were asked to report back on actions to give fresh momentum to the system. However in its annual report the Federal German Central Bank has virtually ruled out further development of the EMS. Can the Council state its opinion of the German Central Bank's view and what action it envisages proposing to give fresh momentum to the EMS? Answer At their recent meeting in Brussels on 17 May, the Ministers for Finance and Economic Affairs again confirmed that the European Monetary System has operated well in its pres ent form and has contributed to monetary stability both in the Community and at world level. They reaffirmed the need for convergence of economic performance and noted that all the governments of the Member States intended to work towards this aim. They called on the Monetary Committee and the Committee of the Governors of the Central Banks to continue examining any possible technical improvements to the system which might, at the appropriate time, be the subject of a Commission proposal to the Council. Question No 64, by Mr Bonde (H-170/82) Subject: Commission interference in Danish regional development aid Will the Council dissociate itself from the Commission's attempt to restrict Danish regional development, and in particular prevent the South Jutland region being given a lower investment rating than Schleswig-Holstein? Answer The Council has not yet had to discuss the question raised by the honourable Member. It points out that the management of the ERDF (European Regional Development Fund) falls within the competence of the Commission. The Council would also draw the atten tion of the honourable Member to the fact that under the system set up by Articles 92 to 94 of the EEC Treaty it is for the Commission \u2014 subject to the powers conferred upon the Council \u2014 to decide whether aid is compatible with the common market. Question 65, by Mrs Hammerich (H-l 71/82) Subject: Classification of expenditure Will the Council confirm that a reclassification of compulsory expenditure as non-com pulsory expenditure implies a transfer of responsibility from the Council, in which there is the right of veto, to the Parliament where there is no right of veto, and that this transfer of responsibility detracts from the sovereignty of the Member States? Answer The respective powers of the Council and the European Parliament as regards the budget are defined by the Treaties. Any alteration to these powers would require revision of the Treaties. ",
        "16.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/181 Any agreement between the Council and the European Parliament on the reclassification \u2014 hitherto a matter of controversy \u2014 of certain types of expenditure into compulsory or non-compulsory would be aimed at enabling the budgetary procedure to function prop erly. Question No 68, byMrMegahy (N-184/82) Subject: Uniform electoral procedure What action does the Council propose to take following the proposals of the European Parliament for a uniform electoral procedure to apply for the 1984 elections? Answer At its meeting on 26 and 27 April 1982, the Council agreed: \u2014 to examine the proposed uniform electoral procedure on the basis of Article 138 of the EEC Treaty and the corresponding Articles of the other Treaties, in accordance with the procedures laid down therein, \u2014 to instruct a working party of experts to begin this examination under the close politi cal supervision of the Permanent Representatives Committee. This working party met for the first time on 9 June 1982. Question No 70, by Mr Cluskey (H-l 90/82) Subject: Community poverty programme Will the Council report on the situation concerning action to combat poverty in the Com munity following the recent meeting of the Social Affairs Council? Answer At its meeting on 27 May 1982, the Council took note of the submission of a report by the Commission on the programme of projects and pilot studies to combat poverty. It stated its intention to conduct as soon as possible the necessary detailed examination, both at national and Community level, of the various elements of assessment and guidance con tained in the report. The Council will able, on the basis of that examination, to carry out an assessment of action undertaken and of the guidelines set out in the report. Question No 71, by Mr Horgan (H-191/82) Subject: Outcome of Council of Education Ministers Will the Council outline the main decisions taken, and the priority areas dealt with at the recent meeting of Education Ministers? ",
        "No 1-286/182 Debates of the European Parliament 16.6.82 Answer At their meeting on 24 May 1982 the Council and the Ministers for Education meeting within the Council agreed to a draft Resolution aimed, in the field of education and train ing related to the employment situation, at introducing a new series of at least 25 pilot projects at Community level for the period 1983-86. In the sphere of the academic recognition of diplomas and periods of study, the Education Committee, whose report on the subject was adopted, was instructed to continue its work and report at a subsequent meeting. This Committee was also asked to report to the next meeting on the effect of demo graphic changes on educational systems in the Community. It will also, during 1983, draw up a report on the impact of new information technologies on education and training sys tems. Question No 75, by Mrs Le Roux (H-200/82) Subject: Social aspects of the common fisheries policy Does the Council intend to put consideration of the harmonization of social schemes for fishermen on its agenda? Answer The Council is aware of the importance of the harmonization of social schemes for fisher men. It considers, however, that such harmonization has to be considered in the overall context of a common fisheries policy. Such a policy is currently under study by the Coun cil, which devoted a meeting to the subject on 15 June 1982. Once the principles and means of this policy have been established, the Council will certainly deal with the social aspects of sea fishing on the basis of the communication submitted to it by the Commis sion. Question No 76, by Mr Van Miert (H-205/82) Subject: EEC sanctions against Argentina Can the Council explain what reasons prompted its President-in-Office to state at the meeting of the Parliament's Committee on External Economic Relations on 18 and 19 May last that, although EEC sanctions were important as a token of political solidarity, he doubted their effectiveness, except in the long term? Answer The measures adopted by the Community vis-\u00e0-vis Argentina on 16 April 1982 and subse quently extended twice on 18 and 24 May do not prevent the entry into free circulation in the Community of products originating in Argentina: \u00e9 \u2014 accompanied by import documents issued before 16 April 1982; \u2014 to be imported under contracts concluded before that date; ",
        "16. 6. 82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/183 \u2014 already on route for the Community at that date. It is understandable that in such circumstances the impact of such measures will only make itself fully felt in the long term. III. Questions to the Foreign Ministers Question No 81, by Mr Rieger (H-123/82) Subject: CSCE Follow-up Conference in Madrid Do the Foreign Affairs Ministers take the view that East-West economic cooperation is an important factor in implementing the CSCE final act, and if so, what action is the Euro pean Community taking in this connection to create better conditions for the successful continuation of the CSCE Follow-up Conference in Madrid that has now been adjourned until November 1982? Answer The Helsinki Final Act is a balanced whole in which the provisions concerning economic cooperation form an essential component. Interesting progress was made in this area at the Madrid Conference. The Ten hope that when the Madrid Conference is resumed, cir cumstances will permit a positive result to be attained. The aim of the Ten in Madrid is to bring about the adoption of a substantial and balanced final document in all sectors of the CSCE. With this end in view, solutions must be found to those problems which are still outstanding, i.e. the military aspect of security, human rights, contacts between persons, information and the follow-up to the Conference. Thus, the problems concerning eco nomic cooperation must be dealt with in parallel with the other issues and take their appropriate place. Question No 82, by Mr Van Miert (H-l88/82) Subject: Situation in El Salvador What steps have been taken by the Foreign Ministers meeting in political cooperation to implement the resolution on the situation in El Salvador adopted by the European Parlia ment on 11 March 1982, and more specifically, have they already contacted their Mexican counterpart with a view to the Member States making a positive contribution to the suc cess of Mexico's offer to act as mediator? Answer The Ten are not at present in a position to take any steps likely to make a serious contri bution to solving the problems of Central America and, in particular, EI Salvador. The Ten are continuing with their analysis of the developments in the situation in El Salvador and will see to it that their diplomatic contacts are stepped up with those countries which are in the best position to make a joint contribution towards a solution. ",
        "No 1-286/184 Debates of the European Parliament 16. 6. 82 Question No 83, by Mr Ephremidis (H-154/82/rev.) Subject: The Council's position on the Falklands crisis The deteriorating situation in the Falklands constitutes a direct threat to peace in the South Atlantic as indeed to world peace. The Council's support for the Thatcher Govern ment is helping to polarize the situation and to undermine the work of the UN. In view of the major threat which the Falklands crisis poses to world peace, can the Foreign Minis ters state whether the governments of the Member States, conscious of their duty to pre serve international peace, are willing to withdraw their support for an aggravation of the crisis and energetically to assist the Secretary-General of the UN in implementing recent UN resolutions on the Falklands together with previous UN resolutions on the decoloni zation of the region? Answer At their meeting of 24 May in Brussels, the Foreign Ministers of the Ten Member States of the European Community returned to the question of the situation in the Falklands. During their debate, they wholeheartedly endorsed Resolution 502 of the Security Coun cil, which \u2014 calls for an immediate halt to hostilities; \u2014 calls for the immediate withdrawal of all Argentine troops from the Falklands; \u2014 calls on the governments of Argentina and the United Kingdom to endeavour to find a diplomatic solution to their dispute and to respect in full the objectives and princi ples of the United Nations Charter. At their meeting of 24 May, the Ten also expressed their hope that a peaceful solution would be found to the conflict. The Ten will continue to uphold this objective. Question No 84, by Sir Fred Warner (H-l62/82) Subject: Laos What steps do the Ministers propose to take to insure the withdrawal from Laos of Viet namese troops which are in occupation of the country in the defiance of international agreements and to restore the independence of the country? Answer The military presence of Vietnam in Laos is a fact that has been well known for a consid erable time. Nevertheless, the Ten hope that an overall solution to the problems of the Indo-China peninsula will be found and that this solution will contain international guar antees enabling the withdrawal of all foreign troops. Question No 86, by Mrs Ewing (H-l 77/82) Subject: Soviet Jewry Will the Foreign Ministers meeting in political cooperation state what action they propose to take and have already taken on the resolution 1 adopted by the European Parliament at its last part-session on the continuing problems of Soviet Jewry? Doc. 1-23/82. ",
        "16. 6. 82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/185 Answer The problems raised by the honourable Member have already been the subject of several interventions by the governments of the Member States of the Community. This matter is being dealt with within the framework of the efforts which the Member States have been making continuously, together with other western countries, at the CSCE meeting in Madrid with a view to ensuring better application and extension of the provisions relating to human rights questions in the Helsinki Final Act. Renewed pressure will be applied when the Madrid meeting resumes in November 1982. The objective of the Member States of the Community at this meeting consists of achieving a substantial and balanced final document which must contain, inter alia, progress in the application of sev eral provisions of the Final Act. These have implications for the position of the Jewish community in the Soviet Union and in particular, for the principles of the genuine exercise of human and fundamental rights and religious freedom. Question No 87, by Lord Bethell (H-l82/82) Subject: Visas in order to enter the United States Have the ten governments considered the fact that, while all their citizens require visas in order to enter the United States, American citizens can enter Member States without visas? Are they aware that for several months a bill which would put right this injustice has been pending before the United States Congress? What discussions have they had about this matter and what representations have they made to the United States Government? Answer The problem of the visa which European citizens require in order to travel to the United States is one which interests the Ten. They therefore hope for favourable developments in this matter. Question No 88, by Mr Moorhouse (H-195/82) Subject: Execution of Baha'is in Iran In a previous answer to a question about the execution of Baha'is in Iran, the President- in-Office undertook to make representations to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in a further endeavour to put a stop to the persecution and systematic eli mination of the Baha'is religious minority. What were the results of these representations and what further action is being taken? Answer At the last meeting of the UN Human Rights Commission the Member States of the European Community supported a draft resolution on violations of human rights in Iran. Five of them were co-signatories of the motion. The resolution expressed concern about reports of serious violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Iran and urged the Iranian Government to show respect for the human rights of individuals in Iran. ",
        "No 1-286/186 Debates of the European Parliament 16.6.82 This resolution followed up the action taken on 31 Januar of this year by the representa tives of the Ten in Teheran, with the support of Australia, Portugal, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland, when representations were made to the Iranian authorities in favour of the Baha'is. On this occasion the profound anxiety of the governments and the great concern of the public about the violations of the human rights of the Baha'is were expressed. The Ten are continuing their consultations in the context of political cooperation with a view to further appropriate action on behalf of the Baha'is. Question No 89, by Mr Gawronski (H-204/82) Subject: Security arrangements for dissidents from Eastern bloc countries residing in the Community \u00b7 \u00b7 Is the Conference of Foreign Ministers aware of the disappearance in Paris of the writer Virgil Ta\u00f1ase and the assumption that the secret services of the Eastern bloc countries are responsible? If so, what action does it intend to take to strengthen security arrangements for dissidents from Eastern bloc countries residing in the Community and to shed light on the disappearance of the Rumanian writer? Answer The Foreign Ministers of the Ten meeting in political cooperation have not discussed the question of the disappearance of the writer Ta\u00f1ase. I would point out, in this connection, that the same security measures apply to dissidents from the Eastern bloc resident in the Community as for other aliens within the territory of the Ten. ",

It might be better to say that the Com mission took the time. President. \u2014 Very well, Mr Pannella, we shall think about the word allocated. 1. Approval of the minutes President. \u2014 The minutes of proceedings of yester day's sitting have been distributed. Are there any comments? I call Mr Pannella. Mr Pannella. \u2014 (FR) I was not talking about the time allocated to the Commission but about the time taken by the Commission in the debate. President. \u2014 You are splitting hairs, Mr Pannella. I said we were going to think about the word allocated. This means that the word is not going to be in the final version of the Minutes and we shall have to find another one. Have you any suggestions? Mr Pannella. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, on page 6 of the Minutes it says that Mr Pannella spoke on the speak ing time allocated to the Commission. We did not allocate anything to the Commission and I would sim ply point out that the Commission allocated to itself a speaking time which was different from the time announced and that the person in the Chair, at the time when I was merely trying to point this out, said some very unpleasant things about Italy, Parliament and the Members and he did not allow me to give my opinion. If I attribute this to the fact that the person in the Chair was notable for his lack of courtesy, at the same time I am keen to make it clear that a certain Mr Pannella. \u2014 (FR) Yes, what I was going to pro pose, Mr President. Let us say that the Commission allocated the speaking time to itself. President. \u2014 I do not think that is the most felicitous way of changing the Minutes, but I have noted your comments.

For these very many reasons including not least the ruling from the Committee on the Rules of Procedure and Petitions of which this, I think, would be the first test. I object. It would be most unfortunate if the entire House were to be held to ransom by the unfor tunate absence of two people from that committee. On that basis, Mr President, I would beg to oppose the request for adjournment. President. motion. I call Mr Pflimlin to speak for the President. \u2014 Thank you, Mr Enright. I think they would like to have you but we shall keep you where you are. (Parliament approved the Minutes) Mr Pflimlin. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, I am in favour of adjournment for the reasons you gave. They are deci sive. The fact is that it would be better if this item were deferred until the next part-session. (Parliament agreed to the request for adjournment) 2. Agenda President. \u2014 I must now consult the House on the request by the chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy and Regional Planning for an adjournment of the debate on the report (Doc. 1-295/ 82) by Mr Faure on measures to combat excessive urban concentration. In a letter of 15 June Mr De Pasquale noted that the report had been put on the agenda of the current part-session only last Monday and he pointed out to the House that Mr Faure would not be able to attend the debate because of his commitments as a member of a French delegation to the United Nations. Mr De Pasquale himself has also had to leave the part-session for important family reasons, and so he will not be here either when the debate is called. It is for this dual reason that Mr De Pasquale has asked for the Faure report to be deferred until the September part-session. I call Mr Forth to speak against the motion. Mr Forth. \u2014 Mr President, you will be aware that the Committee on the Rules of Procedure and Petitions recently made a ruling on this very matter to the effect that, in order to avoid removing items from the agenda at a very late stage in precisely this sort of way, each committee should accept the responsibility of ensuring that in the absence of a rapporteur, or indeed a chair man, someone else on that committee should take res ponsibility for seeing a report through the plenary. Otherwise, the House is always going to be at the mercy of people's absences for whatever reason. I hope that we will resist and oppose this request, because it creates a bad precedent, it makes a mockery of our agenda and it makes it very difficult for Mem bers and indeed for the public, the press and everyone else, to follow our business in an organized way. 3. Situation in Lebanon President. \u2014 The next item is the joint debate on the following six motions for resolutions. \u2014 Motion for resolution (Doc. 1-343/82) by Mr Penders and Mr Croux, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (CD Group), on the Lebanon. \u2014 Motion for a resolution (Doc. 1-348/82) by Mr Bangemann and others, on behalf of the Liberal and Democratic Group, on the situa tion in the Lebanon. \u2014 Motion for a resolution (Doc. 1-354/82) by Mr de la Mal\u00e8ne, on behalf of the Group of European Progressive Democrats, on the situ ation in the Lebanon. \u2014 Motion for a resolution (Doc. 1-357/ 82/Rev.) by Mr Glinne and others, on behalf of the Socialist Group on an immediate cease-fire in Lebanon. \u2014 Motion for a resolution (Doc. 1-358/82) by Mr Glinne and Mrs Charzat, on behalf of the Socialist Group, on the threats and attacks against the embassies of the ten Member States of the European Economic Com munity, their accredited representatives and their diplomatic staff in the Lebanon. \u2014 Motion for a resolution (Doc. 1-361/82) by Mr Fanti and others, on behalf of the Com munist and Allies Group, on the Israeli inva sion of Lebanon. I call Mr von Hassel, who is deputizing for Mr Pen- ders. ",
        "No 1-286/190 Debates of the European Parliament 17.6.82 Mr von Hassel. \u2014 (DE) Mr President, ladies and gen tlemen, before the Political Affairs Committee could complete its report on the Lebanon, the Penders report, the Israelis undertook the acts which concern us today. As far as I can ascertain, world reaction is critical of the Israelis and demands their withdrawal. World public opinion is fully aware of the Israeli inva sion, but there is a stubborn refusal to take into account what the true situation in the Lebanon was, what was going on there and what motivated the Israeli move. I reprove the West for not having unduly troubled itself up to now about the fact that the Lebanon's national identity was in great jeopardy, that it has been for years in an almost hopeless situation precisely because 30 000 Syrian troops had moved into the Lebanon and have been established there for years. In addition, the Christians, who originally, as you all know, were in a majority in the Lebanon, have been placed in a minority because of the immigration of several hundred thousand Palestinians, mainly under the military and militant leadership of the PLO. The slogans that have been coined in that region depicting the future of the Christians are, I feel sure, sufficiently well known here. The tragic circumstances in the Lebanon have repeat edly prompted us, the European Christian Democrats, to go there to study those circumstances and to talk to those concerned. We have repeatedly prevailed upon world public opinion and also on those responsible in the region to do their utmost to try to recreate the integrity of the Lebanon, and not to restrict the free doms the Christians have enjoyed up to now, that means to create the preconditions for Lebanon to return to a state of peace and national unity. All this has, in my opinion, not interested world public opinion, or hardly at all. The repressive situation in the Lebanon was of no matter. Perhaps this was because people did not want to spoil things with the PLO, or perhaps with the Arabs in general. We have repeatedly insisted that the integrity of the Lebanon should be assured and that outside interference of any sort should be prevented, that the Syrians should withdraw and that the Palestinians, particularly the militants, should leave the region. Instead of this, the Palestini ans have constantly carried out attacks on Israel from Lebanese soil, led night patrols and sent shock troops to carry out subversive operations with explosives and even with rockets, killed Jews, in other words, used naked terror tactics. If the PLO had acceded to our demands and left Israel in peace, then Israel would never have attacked. (Interruptions) One can only judge the Israeli attack if one knows the initial situation obtaining in the Lebanon and is pre pared to assess it and not to ; condemn one side alone. (Applause \u2014 interruptions) Even if one really knows the initial situation \u2014 and you over there ought to know it too \u2014 then one nonetheless takes one's time about drawing conclu sions. But one at least should look into the motives. Anyone who subsequently makes a one-sided assess ment and only makes demands on one side in the con flict will not be contributing to peace. The Syrians must withdraw, and the militant PLO cease adopting its aggressive attitude. The integrity and the inviolability of the Lebanon must be re-estab lished and recognized. Then any reason for the Israelis to remain in that country will cease to exist and they will withdraw. (Applause) President. \u2014 I call Mr Donnez. Mr Donnez. \u2014 (FR) Ladies and gentlemen, it is not enough merely to regret the Israeli army's actions in the Lebanon and the large number of innocent victims which we all deplore. We must also suggest ways of ending this state of war and, even better, ways of prev enting a similar situation from ever recurring. We all only too frequently tend to mix up in our own lives cause and effect. I am afraid that for a large num ber of us the same is true of the Lebanon crisis. No right-thinking person could believe that the Israeli government lightly decided to undertake the military operations we are now following. As a result, we must seek out the fundamental motives behind their actions in order to avoid such an outcome in the future. I am sure that everyone will admit that the Lebanon, when it still had a government, had accepted a large number of Palestinian refugees in its territory, and that this was a humanitarian and highly praiseworthy act. But quite clearly it was not the Palestinian refugees' role to become involved in the Lebanon's internal affairs. We are forced to admit, however, today that the Palestinian refugee camps had become real strong holds with fighting forces and weaponry superior to that possessed by the Lebanese army itself. The legal government of the Lebanon lost its hold on the coun try as a result and the PLO exercised control over a large part of the Lebanon. This de facto situation could have only one outcome, and that was to create a permanent state of war between the Palestinian and Lebanese armed forces, which led to an appeal to Syria to re-establish peace. Once again we are now forced to admit that the Syr ian armed forces do not behave in the Lebanon as a force for peace but rather as occupation forces. This has meant that the Lebanon only appeared to be a free country whilst in fact being occupied by the PLO and Syrian armed forces who in addition remain the avowed enemies of Israel, even to the extent of disput ing its legal right to exist. ",
        "17.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/191 Donnez Thus, on Israel's borders a state of tension and inse curity was gradually established and further exacer bated by terrorist acts carried out by the PLO in Israeli territory. We can now deplore the brutality of the Israeli reac tion but we can not avoid examining the reason for it. The fact is that peace will only return to the Leba non . .. President. \u2014 Will you give Mr Schinzel permission to put a question during the debate? Mr Donnez. \u2014 (FR) With pleasure, Mr President. Mr Schinzel. \u2014 (DE) Mr Donnez, is it your view that there is any reason whatsoever for anyone in the world to allow Israel in this specific case the right to kill 10 000 or more civilians? (Applause) Mr Donnez. \u2014 (FR) Mr Schinzel, I assure you that it was my intention to state that I deplore this as much as you. (Interruptions from various quarters) You over there are really not in a position to right wrongs! Why don't you tell us a little about Afghani stan or Poland and how you act in those countries! You really cannot talk. Since the converse is also true, we are on an equal footing. I shall answer Mr Schinzel's question but not reply to your group as a whole, since we are only too familiar with your ideas. I deplore as much as you, Mr Schin zel, all these victims but I, for my part, am trying to discover the reasons behind the problem in order to avoid any future recurrence of such tragic events. This is what I am talking about and that is all. Unlike some of you I am a man of peace, whereas you are men on the payroll of others who are not after peace. This is the fact of the matter. (Applause) In conclusion, Mr President, peace will not in fact return to the Lebanon \u2014 and you can see that I am a man of peace from this \u2014 unless all the armed forces, and I repeat all the foreign armed forces, leave the country and the sovereignty of the Lebanese govern ment is restored. All armed forces including the Israeli army. In this connection, I feel sure that for once we will be talking the same language and I should there fore like to conclude by telling you that our motion for a resolution is basically composed of facts. It is a logical follow-up to decisions taken by Parliament on 10 and 22 April last. It has therefore the advantage of being consistent, and I might also say that in spite of what some people may think, it also has the advantage of showing common sense. (Applause) President. \u2014 I call Mr Israel, deputizing for Mr de la Mal\u00e8ne. I should like to ask the Members not to whistle since this damages the microphones. (Laughter) Mr Isra\u00ebl. \u2014 (FR) I should like to thank you, Mr President, for having taken that precaution just as I am about to start speaking. (Laughter) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen on all sides of this House, the most important point is to state clearly that the Lebanese people, Christians and Muslems alike, have a right to freedom, well-being and happiness. Similarly, the Lebanese State has a right to political independence, security and the observance of the integrity of its territory. The logical conclusion to be drawn from these two necessities is that all foreign forces should withdraw from the Lebanon. Syria, which has never recognized the Lebanon as an inde pendent State, should evacuate the Lebanese territory which it has been occupying for years in the guise of an Arab dissuasion force, blowing and hot and cold alternately, sometimes attempting to put down the Christians and at others the Palestinians. The fact is that having the Syrians in the Lebanon does no more than make it impossible to find a peace. The part they assert they are playing as referee of buffer between the progressives and conservatives is mere deception. The Syrains unfortunately occupied the Lebanon in order to further their own unavowed interests. Similarly, the Palestinian forces ought to be disarmed. The heavy and sophisticated weaponry, they possess, supplied by the Russians through Syria, no doubt jeo pardizes everyone's safety, but particularly that of the Lebanese people itself. (Interruptions from various quarters on the left) I am sad to say that those organizations which assert to be representatives of the Palestinian people make any peaceful solution impossible because their political programme is aimed at wiping the State of Israel from the map and they are causing the downfall of the Palestinian people which for years has been legiti mately seeking security and justice. Similarly, the Israeli army must leave the Lebanon. The fighting now going on in the Lebanon involving ",
        "No 1-286/192 Debates of the European Parliament 17.6.82 Isra\u00ebl Israeli forces is causing too much loss of civilian Lebanese life, of innocent, ill-supplied people for it to be fully justified. The cease-fire which ought to be called should make it possible to withdraw all the armed forces now in the Lebanon. It is clear, however, that the situation is undergoing a far-reaching transformation. Prospects for peace which did not exist before are now apparently taking shape. Perhaps some good will come of this disaster. It is to this end that determined intervention by Europe can be of use. Let us not condemn one side only. Let us help to build peace. Then we will see that the Lebanese, regardless of creed, politics or outlook, can agree and rebuild a country which asks nothing more than to live in peace with all its neighbours. The era of hypocrisy is past. We must now clearly state that the Lebanon should regain all its freedom and independ ence as indeed should all the peoples of the Middle East. I hope my statement has been sufficiently clear. President. \u2014 I call Mrs Dury. Mrs Dury. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, I thought that we were holding this debate in order to give voice to our emotion and indignation and in order to assume our responsibilities as Europeans. However, I now realize that we are holding this debate in order to pillory the Palestinians. It is my belief, Mr President, that the Lebanon's pres ent distress, the large number of civilians, women and children, killed are all reasons for .us to feel indigna tion. We Socialists have always recognized Israel's right to exist but we believe that there is no way of bringing peace to the Middle East other than by giving the Palestinians the State to which they are entitled. I also believe, Mr President, that if we, as Europeans, wish to hold a dialogue than we must first try to foster it. Instad of selling arms to Israel, we in Europe ought to be fostering a dialogue with the PLO which is the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. I feel that we undertook economic sanctions against Argentina lightly and as a result I should like to know what is preventing Europe from devising sanctions which might be taken against Israel. It is may view that there is a great deal of hypocrisy in today's debate. Naturally we are in favour of Israel's right to exist, but we are forced to condemn the inva sion of the Lebanon by Israel. We are forced to con demn the mass killing of Palestinians. We are forced to condemn the fact that the Israelis wish to wipe out the PLO and do away with the Palestinian question by applying a final solution. I should like to conclude, Mr President, by stating that, in addition, as Socialists, we feel we ought not just to support the International Red Cross but also all the humanitarian organizations which are working to the same purpose in the Lebanon, particularly the Palestinian Red Crescent. I am making an appeal, Mr President, for the initiation of a dialogue and a move towards peace. (Applause) President. \u2014 I call Mrs Charzat. Mrs Charzat. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, ladies and gen tlemen, my motion for a resolution calling for the re-opening and maintaining of the embassies of the ten Community Member States is fully justified by the events which the Lebanon has been experiencing over the years and over the past few days, but my motion is also a declaration in favour of a future which will be that of the rebuilding of a sovereign, free and inde pendent Lebanese State. There are three guiding principles behind the tabling of this motion for a resolution. The first relates to the inviolable sovereignty of the Lebanese State. The assination on 4 September 1981 of Mr Louis Delamare, French Ambassador to Leba non and the savage attacks in 1981 and 1982 on chan celleries and diplomatic staff of Member States, were all attempts, through symbolic and dastardly acts, to impair the sovereignty of the Lebanese State. The hooded death which struck the staffs of embassies, and of the French embassy in particular, was intended to create a diplomatic vacuum in the Lebanon. The aim in view, which is the outcome of the thirst for domina tion of the Lebanon's powerful neighbours, was to splinter the Lebanese State exactly as Poland was split up in the 18th century. By re-opening, maintaining and strengthening the embassies of the ten Member States, Europe will not only be reaffirming the inviola ble sovereignty of the Lebanese State, but also its own determination to apply pressure towards achieving the rebirth of a free and independent Lebanon. My second guiding principle was based on observance of international rules. These international rules, appli cable to all States, have at their root a reverence in war and in peace for established diplomatic relations between States, expressed through the inviolability of diplomatio missions and their staff. This means of necessity that a State's representatives should in no way be connected with the policies of the governments of the State they represent. These international rules have not been observed in the Lebanon. Faced with the tragedy that the Lebanon is living through, the ten Member States have a duty to reject this violent black mail. All foreign troops should withdraw from the Lebanon, but all the embassies should return to it. The third guiding principle is based on observance of human rights. Embassy, staff can under no circum- ",
        "17.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/193 Charzat stances be allowed to become the targets, and at times the victims of blind violence. Ambassadors hold diplo matic immunity. When carrying out their mission, they must not become the favourite targets of barbaric vengeance wrought for murky political motivations. In conclusion, the democracies of Europe must flour ish their sense of solidarity towards the Lebanese State. The first step in stating Europe's desire to see Lebanese sovereignty upheld, and its integrity observed, is the re-opening, maintenance and contin ued operation of diplomatic representation of the ten Member States. To this end, political cooperation between Member States has become an urgent neces sity. This cooperation for the furtherance of right and peace will lend real weight to Europe's determination to side with the Lebanese people and the sovereign Lebanese State. (Applause) President. \u2014 I call Mr Fanti. Mr Fanti. \u2014 (IT) Mr President, the Communist and Allies Group by its motion for a resolution wished to appeal to the conscience and sense of responsibility of the political groups in the European Parliament and in the institutions of the Community, that is the Commis sion and the Council. We are however not in agree ment with the amendment tabled by Mr Barbi and consorts and we should like to lodge a protest against the procedure adopted. The situation created by the act of aggression carritd out by the Israeli forces against the Lebanon and the Palestinian people is exceptionally serious, both because of its immediate effects and its longer lasting consequences which involve Europe's relations with the Arab world, the Middle East and more generally with the whole area of the developing countries. The Israeli leaders cynically labelled their military operation 'Peace in Galilee', an operation which, in resources, methods and effects, brings to mind the Blitzkrieg tac\u00faes which we would have wished could merely have remained a sad memory and warning of Hitler's Nazis. Peace in Galilee \u2014 as indeed elsewhere in the world \u2014 can never be founded on violence, de struction, the massacre of civilians and death. We too wish to see the State of Israel living securely, and the Israelis living in peace, but this much must be quite clear: this can never be achieved over the dead bodies of Palestinians. What has happened and is now happening in the Lebanon can only increase from one generation to the next, the hatred, fanaticism, and violence which exist between the Israelis and the Arab world and anyone who does not adopt a definite stance in this matter is making a serious mistake and taking upon himself a weighty responsibility. We are not just here appealing for a consistent policy. We have not hesitated one second in adopting a stance of defending peoples and human rights without being 'remote controlled' and we are amongst those who last night demonstrated in Rome with the leaders of the Christian-Democrats, Socialists and Communists in the presence of representatives of the PLO. Our appeal is intended first and foremost to be one for the protection and defence of Europe's role and func tion today and in the future. Its international credibil ity and the outlook for its own development are closely linked to its ability to be a factor for peace and development in all international relations and particu larly in North-South relations. What possible meaning could yesterday's passionate discussion on hunger in the world have if this were not the case, Mr Pisani? For this reason, we consider as absolutely essential the request we have put forward for a determined con demnation of Israeli aggression, for the application of the UN resolution on the cease-fire and a withdrawal of Israeli troops, for a demonstration of our solidarity with the civilian population and the Palestinian Libera tion Organization by recognizing that organization as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. We ask the Foreign Affairs Ministers of the Ten to take steps \u2014 including that of an arms embargo on Israel \u2014 in order to achieve a lasting peace in the Middle East, via negotiated solutions and with full observance of everyone's rights particularly those of the Palesti nian people who are being so hard-hit at the moment, of territorial integrity, and of the independence of all countries, including the State of Israel and lastly of the creation of a State for the Palestine people. These are the demands which we consider to be essen tial and necessary for Europe to make its voice and democratic determination clearly heard. (Applause from the Communist and Allies Group) President. \u2014 I call the Socialist Group. Mr Glinne. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentle men, the Socialist Group will abide by the motion for a resolution (Doc. No 1-357/82/rev.) which it has tabled. In the spring, a delegation of the Socialist Group was on the spot in the Lebanon and we experienced at that time tremendous sorrow. As things stand today, we can but judge the bombing and murder of innocent people in the Lebanon by the Israeli Air Force as a fla grant violation of international law. Similarly, the invasion of Lebanese territory by Israeli forces can only be considered by us as an act of aggression, a compounding factor to those which prevent the Lebanese State from really being a sover- ",
        "No 1-286/194 Debates of the European Parliament 17.6.82 Glinne eign State, able to act and to assume the responsibili ties which ought to befall it. We have always stated that, on the Middle East problem, we voice with the same determination the statement of the right to exist of the State of Israel and the right of the Palestinian people to settle in a State of its own. With reference to the latest developments, Mr Presi dent, we approve the declaration of the Foreign Affairs Ministers of the Ten made on 10 June. We condemn, in Israel's recent behaviour in sending its troops into the Lebanon, a flagrant violation of inter national law. We launch an appeal to the Israeli Government to withdraw its troops inside the Israel- Lebanon border. We also feel that the political behav iour of the Israeli Government should be assessed with all the implications this will have for the cooperation agreements we hold with it. We ask for as binding as possible a cease-fire to be imposed and uncondition ally observed by all parties. We hope that a dialogue will be instituted between all the parties concerned without exception since this is the only way to create a fair and balanced solution to the problems of the Mid dle East. Indeed, we expect the Council of Ministers of the Member States to take all the necessary steps to achieve this aim. Lastly, we ask the Commission and the Council to implement forthwith and aid programme for the vic tims of the Lebanon war and to support in this respect the efforts of all, I repeat all, the humanitarian organi zations involved. President. \u2014 I call 'he Group of the European Peo ple's Party (Christian Democratic Group). Mr Penders. \u2014 (NL) Mr President, after lengthy deli berations both yesterday and the day before, a joint text has been produced on behalf of a number of groups. This was the best we could manage. However, I should like to point out that I am uneasy about this text. The resolution is \u2014 and I must choose my words carefully here \u2014 rather well-disposed towards Israel. Fortunately, paragraph 3 does in fact condemn the action, but I particularly find that our text could have been somewhat more outspoken and unequivocal in support of the excellent statement by the ten Foreign Ministers of the European Community, since what is the role of the European Parliament? It must apply itself to the Middle East problem with imagination \u2014 in other words, it must keep two basic principles con stantly in mind, i.e. the right to existence of all the States in the region, including Israel, and the right of self-determination of the people of Palestine and I have grave doubts as to whether the way Israel is behaving at the moment is likely to do anything to help these principles be put into practice. Don't get me wrong \u2014 I can perfectly understand Israel doing something about the build-up of Palesti nian and PLO artillery on its northern borders and the shooting. We all knew something like this would hap pen. However, I cannot sympathize with the current reaction, which goes much too far. Purges involving orgies of merciless killing are taking place among the civilian population of South Lebanon. People talk about restoring an \u00a1dependent, sovereign Lebanon and I sincerely hope this will in fact be done. The Lebanese people have a right to an independent and sovereign State, but this must not be an Israeli vassal State, nor must it be a State in which \u2014 and I think I am entitled to say this as a Christian Democrat \u2014 the Christian section of the Lebanese population lays down the law. Anyone who thinks that the PLO is out of it now is making a mistake. It will obviously come back. After all, where can it go? It cannot stay in Jordan and it cannot go anywhere. I shudder to think of the massive Arab reaction which is impending. I shudder to think how this is all grist to the mill of fanatics such as Khomeini and of the enormous resurgence in Moslem fundamentalism which will result from these acts. The European Parliament cannot take on any responsibility for developments of this kind and for this reason I support this resolution. President. \u2014 I call the European Democratic Group. Mr Fergusson. \u2014 Mr President, this debate has all gone to show that there is no matter in the whole world on which people are so divided as they are about the Middle East. No matter whether you take the Parliament as a whole, my own of any other group, any faction within any group or indeed any number of individuals, the entire House is split down the middle about the rights and wrongs of this matter. It is reflected in all our attempts to find agreement on a text, it will be reflected in the vote: it will be reflected in almost everything we do every time this matter arises. Because here is a dispute where the claims of the two sides seen irreconcilable, a problem as insoluble as that of squaring the circle, as impossible as that two people can be in the same place at once or one person in two places at once. Mathematically, the problem is expressed in the proposition that you can not have a square root of a minus quantity. Once we talk of blame, of the origins of this struggle, of its rights and wrongs, we are hopelessly divided. There are clearly those in this House, taking either part, who are quite happy to cast the first stone at the other side. So what can we usefully do? We can consider where we are now; we can see where we are trying to get to and try to make plants to help. So where is the com mon ground at this moment about this particular new departure in the Middle East? We are all, I think, without exception shocked and appalled by the scale and the horror of the latest events, irrespective of whom we condemn \u2014 if condemnation helps. All of us, I think, believe that we must do all we can, because ",
        "17.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/195 Fergusson we have the money to give aid and shelter to those who have been dispossed and oppressed in this way. We all, I think, believe in the withdrawal of all forces from the Lebanon, however that should eventually be achieved. We are all, I think, agreed that the hapless, hopeless Lebanon, caught up in the war against its will, the base for PLO operations against Israel, must have its integrity restored. The Lebanon needs it; so does Israel; so, surely does Syria; and so do all the people living in that area, whether visiting or resident, whether military or paramilitary or otherwise \u2014 the refugees most of all. Lastly, we all, I think, believe that negotiation is the only way to solve this kind of dis pute. This is the recurring theme of Europe the recurring theme of this Parliament. What we fear is that the con sequences of this latest explosion will be not good but bad. We can only pray, therefore that they may lead to 30 years of peace and not to 30 more years of acri mony and feuding. As to the amended resolution before us, I believe it will help it does not express the full fears or the full hopes of everybody or anybody, but it is a brave attempt to reconcile all our opposing views and, with luck, to bring some kind of settlement, some kind of peace at this moment to the Middle East. (Applause) to the European Parliament to give us the latest infor mation, and I would propose that the House should approve this move. I agree with the measures proposed by Mr Fanti, and I should like to conclude by stating that I know how many of these measures you will adopt, ladies and gentlemen. But before you decide in this House, listen to the voices of the women and chil dren who are being butchered and who are turning to us beneath the tracks of the Israeli tanks. What Euro pean ideals are you talking to us about, Mr Tinde mans? Who fails to comprehend that what is being murdered in the camps of the Lebanon is humanity, independence, the promise of self-determination, their credibility, our credibility and the relations of the European Community with the Arab Nation and with the Third World. Ladies and gentlemen, we know from history that, whatever happens, no matter how many victims there are and no matter how much blood is spilled, the Palestinian resistance will triumph, and it would be an act of wisdom on the part of the European Parliament for the Europe of the Ten to intervene with measures to ensure an immediate and just solution based on the condemnation of the invasion and on the recognition of the rights of the Palestinian people. (Applause) President. \u2014 I call the Liberal and Democratic Group. President. \u2014 I call the Communist and Allies Group. Mr Kyrkos. \u2014 (GR) Mr President, ladies and gentle men, we sympathize with the people of Israel. During the Nazi occupation we protected the Jews in my country. We want them to be safe where they are, to have secure borders and to live in peace with their neighbours. But we cannot condone Israel's attempt to prevent the Palestinians by military means from exer cising their own right to have their own homeland and their own State. And we are horrified that the govern ments and political forces within the EEC are covering up with platonic statements the brutality of the recent invasion of the Lebanon, the plans to partition it and to destroy the Palestinian resistance, and close their eyes to the crime against humanity which is the mass murder of the Palestinians. Ten thousand people have already been murdered, and this figure is a conserva tive estimate. How many have yet to be killed, Mr Isra\u00ebl, before we in this House show any sensitivity? I appeal to you, ladies and gentlemen, of whatever political persuasion, let us not confine ourselves to polite and hypocritical words, but let us express our anger at the trampling underfoot of international legality by taking actions and decisions which actually hurt the Israeli Government. Fifteen Members of this House have, in a small way, already taken such action by sending an urgent invitation to Mr Arafat to come Mr Nordmann. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, the resurgence of violence in the Lebanon should give rise to a three fold attitude of emotion, clear-thinking and maybe hope as well. The emotion is quite obviously caused by the unbear able spectacle of war and the whole trail of destruction it drags behind it, an emotion which is all the stronger for the marked imbalance between the aims and the means employed. However, a clear-thinking attitude demands that we not be ruled by instinctive, emotive reaction. It means that we must take today's crisis for what it really is: the culmination of a long drawn-out deterioration. The Israelis did not go into a Lebanon of milk and honey, they went into a Lebanon which was already bloodied and bullied by occupants, by the harassment and impositions of both Syrians and Palestinian terror ists. The Israelis went into Lebanese territory not with claims to ownership or aims of annexation but in order to defend themselves, and after having exhausted to no avail all the other means of parrying the relentless attacks they were subject to. They went in to defend themselves, but also to defend us. Let us not forget that it is from Lebanese training camps that the neo nazis have arrived in order to bolster the efforts of the Palestinian terrorists who for years now have been launching the most ferocious attacks on the multi party democracies. ",
        "No 1-286/196 Debates of the European Parliament 17.6.82 Nordmann Let us remember the bombings of the synagogues in the rue Copernic and rue Marbeuf. We hear talk of victims. But Israeli soldiers have been dying for their country too. They are also dying in order to defend the security and freedom of Europe, and the elected repesentatives of Europe should ponder this fact. Hope today is for peace and for the Lebanese them selves. This hope is not unfounded. Quite clearly, the Camp David agreement has up to now stood the test of time and is more than ever a precedent and an example of the only acceptable and fruitful way of proceeding, one which is based on mutual recognition of one's right to exist. As a corollary to, and over and above, its defence objectives, the Israeli military opera tion will be justified if it manages to bring peace back to the Lebanon by giving the Lebanon back to the Lebanese, by resuscitating a Lebanon in which the var ious communities live in peaceful coexistence, a Leba non without Syrians, without Palestinians and without Israelis. I should like to conclude, Mr President, by merely reminding those who are now talking of Israeli aggres sion that on 6 June 1944 there were people in Europe talking about Anglo-American agression. President. \u2014 I call the Group for the Technical Coor dination and Defence of Independent Groups and Members. Mrs Castellina. \u2014 (IT) Mr President, I am filled with indignation and I must state it loudly and clearly because what I have just heard in this House and what is contained in some of these resolutions can quite frankly only inspire indignation. The Palestinian peo ple is being referred to as the aggressor, without any body recognizing its right to aspire to becoming a legi timate State. The Group of the European People's Party is con cerned about generalized violence, and does not des cribe it any more closely. It does not however express in its motion for a resolution, not even once, concern about the Israeli aggression which nonetheless, heaven knows, tramples some sacred principles underfoot! Although in one supplementary amendment there is at last a reference to the fact that this is an Israeli aggres sion, in the first resolution there is no mention of it at all. Naturally enough, they want to see the Lebanon rid of all the occupying forces. Well, let us see that happen! Let it be rid of the Israeli forces and of the Syrian forces! But where do you intend to put the Palestini ans? Where do you think the Palestinians captured by Israel can be put? Is it really possible that this question has not occurred to you, that it is not uppermost in your minds? Of what importance is the fact that the Italian Christian Democrats demonstrated yesterday in Rome together with the PLO, when they still do not have the courage to recognize that the Palestinians ought to be able to live somewhere or another. These matters are quite serious enough for one to get 'hot under the collar', if you do not mind me saying so. I should like to add a remark for my Socialist com rades: it is impossible that you too should not have the courage to recognize that, if negotiations should take place, this can only occur between broad groups. If negotiations could take place today, the PLO, as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, ought to participate in them. If there are no negotia tions \u2014 you know this as well as I do \u2014 then there will be war and with the circumstances now prevailing in the Lebanon, there will inevitably be a surge of ter rorism. For all these reasons, Mr President, I will vote in favour of the motion for a resolution tabled by the Communist and Allies Group. (Applause from the Communist and Allies Group) President. \u2014 I call the Non-attached Members. Mr De Goede. \u2014 (NL) Mr President, the terrible events in the Lebanon call for severe criticism and con demnation of this most recent act of unadulterated aggression, from everyone who hitherto felt and con tinues to feel sympathy for Israel. Criticism from friends should not be lacking at this time \u2014 quite the contrary. Undoubtedly, the State of Israel has a right to recog nized and safe borders and it is quite right that Israel should not entirely trust the Arab world. Too many brutal incidents involving the PLO \u2014 for example, the attack on the Israeli Ambassador in London \u2014 and too many expressions of hate and intolerance give Israel the impression that it is under a constant threat. However, this does not give Israel the right to react in such a disproportionate manner. It would certainly appear that Israel is now out to deal a death blow, not only to the militant wing of the PLO but to Palestinian society as a whole, including the thousands of poor wretches who have already been living under abomin able conditions in refugee camps for years now. It would also appear that Israel regrets having adopted that part of the Camp David agreement which states that, in addition to the need for safe and recognized borders for the State of Israel, a solution must also be found for the people of Palestine. It is an impenetrable tragedy of history that the people of Israel, who have been through so much suffering themselves should now itself be causing another people brutal and horr ible suffering and riding roughshod over international agreements and codes of conduct. Israel is currently busy alienating itself from its friends, the United States, countries of the European Communites, and this is a tragic development for all concerned. It has ",
        "17.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/197 De Goede become apparent once more what a powder keg the Middle East is. An outbreak of violence in that area involves major risks for world peace, as we can see from the reaction of the Soviets. We endorse the state ment of 10 June by the ten Foreign Ministers of the Community in which they condemned the Israeli ac tion in the strongest possible terms. The motion for a resolution by Mr Glinne comes the nearest as we see it, to a possible solution and we intend to support this resolution. President. \u2014 I call Mr Papantoniou. Mr Papantoniou. \u2014 (GR) Mr President, I do not believe that in any honest conscience there remains any doubt that the tragic events of the Lebanon were prepared a long time ago. Apart from the advance warnings issued by the Palestinians that the govern ment of Mr Begin was preparing for a new war in the Middle East, the very fact that thousands of extremely well-equipped soldiers with plenty of supplies moved into northern Lebanon within a few days and reached Beirut is enough to convince anyone that what was being carried out was a well prepared plan, adopted at the highest military level, with the aim of wiping out the PLO and slaughtering the Palestinians as a whole. The mass killing of civilians and children decided on by Mr Begin is reminiscent of the methods used by Hitler against the Jews, and we Greeks find this parti cularly sad and revolting since during the War the Greek people made heroic efforts to save Jewish lives. If this Parliament wishes to retain its prestige and not be an accessory to the mass murder of the Palestinians, it must unequivocally condemn the Israeli invasion, call for the immediate withdrawal of Israeli troops and firmly state that there can be no solution to the prob lem of the Lebanon without the creation of a Palesti nian State. We Greek Socialists of PASOK will oppose any motion for a resolution which blurs or deviates from these simple principles, and we would state that we shall abstain from the vote on the Socialist motion unless the amendments tabled by Mrs Dury and her co-signatories are adopted. (Applause) President. \u2014 I call Mrs Gaiotti De Biase. Mrs Gaiotti De Biase. \u2014 (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, even in the tragic series of events that the Lebanon has experienced in these last few weeks and is still experiencing, the first duty of this House, as of all Parliaments, is to stifle its anguish long enough to lend political support to the stance adopted by the Council by upholding the declaration of the Ten, which is a declaration consistent with previous declarations and with Europe's role as partner, a timely and unanimous declaration. We Italian Christian Democrats are therefore very sorry that the rejection of the possibility of a joint resolution, backed up by a large majority of this House, has led in both motions now before us, to a watering down of this clear-cut and formal support. The present Lebanese tragedy once more dispels the horrible illusion, fostered by all sides and which for decades at regular intervals has made the world's heart miss a beat, and that illusion is that you can either solve the Palestinian problem or ensure Israel's secur ity by the use of armed force. Many times over the past years we have stated, with out leaving any room for doubt, that terrorism could not solve the Palestinian problem. This is why we were right, in spite of its limitations and shortcomings, to welcome the foundations of a path to agreement laid in Camp David. Now, in the presence of this terrible escalation of the military situation, we must continue to state vocifer ously that the Palestinian problem cannot be solved through a genocide. There is only one way of avoiding the frightening chain of events from terrorism to mas sacre and back again to terrorism and that is to recog nize that the Palestinian problem exists, that it is a political fact and a human dilemma which must be taken for what it is, and that nothing can be gained by falsely convincing oneself that it can be eliminated. It is clear that today political know-how and moral con science concur. Anyone taking false refuge in violence may find themselves tomorrow paying the same supreme cost which is today being paid by both the perpetrators and the innocent, that is the Palestinians and the Lebanese. Europe's role as peacemaker, with a more determined decisive shape than it has had up to now, depends on two prerequisites. Firstly, a single strategy, not just by governments but by all the political groups in this House. And secondly, a determination not to tolerate, even implicitly, any political or economic support for any nation which continues to believe in the logic of armed might. The UN crisis is the continually worsening and widen ing one of the political philosophy of negotiation, a philosophy which is being replaced by the old doctrine which for centuries criss-crossed human history with wars and violence, the doctrine of armed retaliation. Europe ought by its behaviour to bring a halt to this crisis, by showing at all times its confidence in the logic of peace and reason, the two indissociable ele ments of which are the Palestinians' right to self-deter mination and Israel's right to security. \u00b7 (Applause from the Centre) ",
        "No 1-286/198 Debates of the European Parliament 17.6.82 President. \u2014 I call Mr Taylor. Mr J. M. Taylor. \u2014 Mr President, the official view of my group has been expressed by Mr Fergusson. I have approximately one minute to speak for myself and therefore may I say this. If time permitted or if thoughts were cool enough today, we might profitably reflect on a definition of Palestine and draw the con clusion, no doubt, that four fifths of it lie to the east of the Jordan. Meanwhile, the State of Israel is not only internationally legitimate and impeccably so but it also represents a formidable human success story, a formi dable human achievement. And this is despite the fact that throughout the 34 years of its existence, it has been always resented, several times invaded, and almost continuously harassed. For one such harass ment, this latest reprisal is certainly grim. It is my hope, Mr President, in this limited time, to give some support to the hope that maybe from this grim crisis a stabilized Lebanon might emerge. A country of its own, not one insinuated by other people's political ter rorism. I conclude by saying, Mr President, that the text with which I feel most sympathy and which I find most to commend is the Cottrell/Forth amendment. President. \u2014 I call Mr Adamou. Mr Adamou. \u2014 (GR) Mr President, the unprovoked invasion by Israeli forces of an independent country such as the Lebanon and the crimes of mass murder committed against Lebanese civilians and Palestinian refugees, which are reminicent of similar action by Hitler's Nazi hordes, provoke justified anger and dis may throughout the world. It is only in this House that most people have engaged in a suspicious waiting game. This attitude reveals an attempt to cover up for those who are really guilty and morally responsible for the attack and the crimes, namely those who govern in Washington, without whose inspiration, support and cover Begin's fascists would not have dared to perpetrate these crimes. If we now wish to align ourselves with the sentiments of international public opinion, we must take measures immediately and the Member States of the EEC must immediately break off economic, trade, political and other relations with Israel until the Israeli forces with draw totally and unconditionally from Lebanese terri tory. We must protest against and condemn the mili tary, political and economic aid which the USA openly provides to Israel and which constitutes decisive sup port for Israel's expansionist and adventurist policy, which is a danger to peace. Some people in this House call for the withdrawal of the Palestinians from the Lebanon. But where are they to go, since they have been deprived of the right to have a homeland? They call for the departure of the Syrian forces which are in the country by decision of all the Arab States, but they do not call for the with drawal of Israel, in accordance with the resolutions of the United Nations Organization, from all the occu pied Arab territories, where they have been commit ting atrocities for years. Those are the views of the Greek Communist Party. (Applause) President. \u2014 I call Mr Beyer de Ryke. Mr Beyer de Ryke. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to oversimplify no doubt and make four different remarks on this Lebanese tragedy. Firstly, let me define the present situation. The three nails in the Lebanese coffin are: Syria, which wishes to wipe the Lebanon off the map, the PLO which has moved in to establish its bases there and Israel which is attempting by armed might to settle things in its favour. My second remark is that the Israeli action, unlike what some speakers have said, is not retaliation. This action is part of a policy showing a deliberate refusal to accept a status quo which Menahem Begin consi ders to be more intolerable than Shimon Peres felt it to be. My third remark is that this may yet, I hope, be a blessing in disguise. The tragedy is that people have to die. Many have died and countless more may die, and I cannot prevent myself, and I must openly say this now, from feeling that the Israeli army, Tsahal, has perhaps been easier on itself than it has on others. I take as my witness my colleague Jean-Jacques Leblond writing in the Figaro, an excellent journalist and wit ness of great integrity who states : 'There is no doubt at all that the Israeli air force has been shooting as if it were at war, dropping fragmentation bombs and firing rockets.' Another aspect of this tragedy is that the booming of Israeli guns may well become the trump of doom sounding for the spirit of Camp David. Will Egypt not be placed in an untenable position? Now, let me tell you how this tragedy might be a blessing in disguise since it holds the seeds of a rebirth of the Lebanon, provided that the Christian troops are backed up by significant support from the Lebanese Muslims, provided that the re-established State has the means to pursue its policies and to ensure its security and is not just propped up by Israel. It is here that Europe can and must aid in finding a solution via a United Nations peace-keeping force in the Lebanon which would no longer pursue a policy of passive de- ",
        "17.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/199 Beyer de Ryke fence, which we now know was more passive than defensive. My final remark is that the PLO obstacle has been lifted, but only fleetingly. History knows no final solu tion and the Jewish people has had imprinted in its flesh, soul and spirit the huge, cruel lessons of history. Israel \u2014 and I say this forcefully, with conviction and determination \u2014 Israel must live. It must live, but without forgetting that the Palestinians \u2014 this leftover people \u2014 will unceasingly continue their search for a homeland until they find one. Israeli actions will not snuff out the fire flickering in the bosom of the Middle East, a fire which never ceases to threaten us with bursting into flame. In conclusion, on behalf of the Mashreq delegation of which I am proud to be President, I should like to ask you to dispatch a multi-party delegation to the very spot where these events are now taking place. I always lend greater credence to eye witness accounts than to second-hand reporting. Seeing for ourselves and then telling the public about what we have seen, this is and must remain our task at all times. Please allow us, Mr President, to fulfil this role. (Applause) President. \u2014 I call Mr Romualdi. Mr Romualdi. \u2014 (IT) Mr President, in our motion for a resolution tabled as Israel was beginning its offensive against the Palestinian forces in the Lebanon, and which to some extent justified our having written it, we asked immediately for the European Com munity, the Council, the Commission and Parliament to prevail upon or enjoin the Israeli Government to suspend any war-like action and withdraw its occupa tion forces. We asked for the independence and integrity of the Lebanon to be re-established, without any double-dealing, that is without any decisive influ ence of the PLO \u2014 which is not, Mr Fanti, the only representative of the Palestinian people, this is quite untrue \u2014 which has for a long time been established in the southern regions of the Lebanon and been car rying out operations from there, and without any fur ther influence from the Syrians, who are called a dis suasion force but are in reality an occupation force established in the other regions of the Lebanon. What has happened and is now happening, and cannot but be condemned by everyone and arouse a wide spread feeling of pity for the hundreds and thousands of civil and military victims, should not however make us forget the political reasons for this situation, the dramatic and unsolved political problems with which we have all failed to deal and which are at the source of all acts of armed might, those that Israel is commit ting by attempting in this unacceptable manner to eli minate the threats to its independence and those of terrorist violence, responsibility for which the PLO cannot deny. These are acts which cannot lead either to guaranteeing the State of Israel, unfortunately still grudgingly accepted by the Arab world, nor to guar anteeing the birth of a Palestinian State which we all desire but which no one is making any great effort to achieve. This is true also because up to now nobody knows where it ought exactly to have its source, what size and limits it ought to have. The responsibility for these events, ladies and gentle men, lies with us, they are evidence of our inability to get to grips with the real problems and therefore of our shortcomings. President. \u2014 I call Mr Fich. Mr Fich. \u2014 (DA) On behalf of the Socialist Group, I should like to urge the Chairman of the Israel delega tion, Mrs Tove Nielsen, to take steps to suspend work in the Israel delegation immediately and until such time as the Israeli troops have withdrawn from the Lebanon. This would also involve calling off the pre parations for the work of the delegation. As we see it, our assembly cannot have dealings with a parliament the majority of which is in favour of waging war on the territory of another country and occupying that country. In our view, one of the few concrete steps we can take here in this Parliament is to suspend delega tion cooperation with the Knesset. I hope the Chair man of the Israel delegation will tell us as soon as possible to what extent she is prepared to take an ini tiative of this kind, and we obviously hope she will give us a positive answer. President. order. I call Mrs Tove Nielsen on a point of Mrs Tove Nielsen. \u2014 (DA) In a democracy, it is not up to the Chairman alone to decide on behalf of a delegation. I wish to respect the principles of democ racy and, for this reason, the delegation will meet and it will then be up to the delegation to make certain decisions. If it was only the Chairman who made deci sions, this would not be a democracy but a dictator ship and our work in the European Parliament is based, as I am sure Mr Fich will understand, on demo cratic principles. President. \u2014 I call the Commission. Mr Pisani, Member of the Commission. \u2014 (FR) In this dangerous situation, the political stance of the Com munity was clearly stated by the Council of Ministers of the Ten, meeting in Bonn on 9 June. ",
        "No 1-286/200 Debates of the European Parliament 17.6.82 Pisani I should like to reiterate the main features of the com muniqu\u00e9 which the Ten published after their meeting and state some of the measures which, strictly within the letter of these guidelines, we have seen fit to enact. Firstly the communiqu\u00e9: The Member States of the Community strongly condemn the new Israeli invasion of Lebanon and the bombing attacks. They consider it to be a fla grant violation of international law and feel that there is an imminent danger of a more widespread conflict. They reiterate their attachment to the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and national unity of the Lebanon and refer to Security Council Resolutions 508 and 509. They call upon Israel to withdraw all its forces immediately and unconditionally. Should Israel continue in its course, the Ten will consider the possibilities for future action. The Ten emphasize the need for an overall, just and lasting peace on the basis of a negotiated solution which they are prepared to help achieve. The Ten will give urgent consideration to the provision of aid for the vic tims. A number of decision have been taken in strict accord ance with this line of policy. Initial emergency aid amounting to 200 000 ECU and supplementary aid of 500 000 ECU have already been decided. Further sup plementary aid may be planned as needs are pin pointed and means of transport brought into action. In addition, the Community, at the Commission's proposal, is intending to send 10 000 tonnes of cereals in the form of exceptional food aid. Furthermore, the Commission has discussed authorizing the European Investment Bank to lend 50 million ECU to the Lebanese State. Lastly, in order to take account of the final recommendations in the Council of Ministers' communiqu\u00e9, the Commission and the Council have decided to postpone the signing of the second Finan cial Protocol with Israel, scheduled for 14 June. (Applause) President. \u2014 The joint debate is closed. I call Mr Cottrell on a point of order. your amendment was tabled 24 hours before the com promise one. The problem is that your amendment does not touch on the original EPP resolution tabled by Mr Penders and Mr Croux. So, if I had to respect the order in which amendments had been tabled, I should still have to put, first, the Penders-Croux reso lution, then your amendment and then the Barbi amendment to the vote. But that would make com pletely superfluous the Barbi amendment, which also covers the Penders-Croux resolution. For that reason, I think the only way to deal with the matter is to put the Barbi compromise amendment first to the vote. If that is not adopted, we shall then have to take the Penders-Croux resolution. If that is not adopted, we shall come to the Cottrell amendment. I have another problem, and that is that the compro mise text proposed by Mr Barbi says that it covers six motions for resolutions, but in reality it does not. It does not deal in substance with the resolution pro posed by Mr Glinne and Mrs Charzat on the embas sies in the Lebanon. There is no reference at all to that resolution. Therefore I think that even if the Barbi amendment is adopted, we shall still have to vote on the Glinne-Charzat resolution. I think that is the only way to deal with this problem, and that is the decision of the chair. I cannot have any discussion on it now. I call Mr Fanti. Mr Fanti. \u2014 (IT) Mr President, you rightly defined the amendments tabled by Mr Barbi and others as compromise amendments. But a compromise can be reached only by those who agree. I was not even con sulted, nor have I accepted the compromise, and so my motion for a resolution cannot be included in this sort of compromise. I think it should be voted on separ ately. President. \u2014 Mr Fanti, it is not a compromise amend ment but an amendment which replaces the others tabled on the same subject. The Barbi amendment replaces \u2014 it says so if you read it \u2014 all the motions which deal with the Israel and Lebanon conflict. This means that if the Barbi text is adopted the motions for resolutions by Mr Penders, Mr Cottrell and others will fall. Mr Cottrell. \u2014 I refer to what has been flatteringly described by my group as a compromise amendment tabled by myself and Mr Eric Forth. I would draw the attention of the presidency to the fact that this amend ment was tabled 24 hours in advance of the similarly- described compromise amendment put forward by Mr Barbi, Mr Fergusson and others. It is my impression, Mr President, that my amendment should be called and voted on first.

Several of us had asked to speak, before you announced that the vote was open, to ask for a vote on each paragraph.

Can you explain to me why, therefore, we have gone right past that and you have not respect that request? Mr Taylor tried to support it verbally. Now you have to explain to the House how it is that a writ ten request submitted in advance can be ignored. President. \u2014 Mr Forth, it is very simple. We have voted on the text as a whole. Even if I had received that written request it would have been included among the other papers because of the discussion that arose on the order of priority of the different amend ments. An error has occurred. I admit that. The fact is that we have voted on the whole of the Barbi amend ment. I put it to the vote and the vote was opened. We cannot go back on what has already taken place. I call Mrs Veil.

Members may make a written statement in the Minutes concerning their views on this split vote. I call Mr Johnson. Mr Johnson. \u2014 I should just like to confirm. Mr President, that I was the author of the written request to you for a split vote on paragraph 3, and there were I think several people trying to catch your eye at the time you proceeded to the vote asking for a vote by division Mr d'Ormesson was one of them and I do feel that, given that I put in this written request first thing this morning, there was a chance for it to have been drawn to your attention before the actual vote occured. In that case, Mr President, I hope you will proceed to take a vote on it. Mr Radoux. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, there is not a Member here who does not consider you an excellent President. Consequently, I think you should put this to the vote again and take the view, when there has been a written request, that if a mistake has been made it should be admitted and another vote taken. (Applause) President. \u2014 Mr Radoux, the Rules of Procedure may sometimes be interpreted but it is the President's job to comply with them. That is the problem. The only thing that can be done now is to submit written statements. I call Mr Marshall. Mr Marshall. \u2014 Mr President, did jou not say that we could vote on whether there should be a split vote?

Now that rule is there to make provision for the sort of thing that we have just been through. I would like to ask you if you could still now bear that rule in mind and make your own judgment as to whether it would help the House, under that rule, to avoid what has just happened.

Situation in the iron and steel industry President. \u2014 The next item is the joint debate on two motions for resolutions: \u2014 motion for a resolution (Doc. 1-347/82), tabled by Mr Calvez and others on behalf of the Liberal and Democratic Group, on the situation in the European iron and steel industry; \u2014 motion for a resolution (Doc. 1-353/82), tabled by Mr de la Mal\u00e8ne on behalf of the Group of European Progressive Democrats, on countervailing duties on European steel products. I call Mr Calvez. Mr Calvez. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentle men, a few days ago a French newspaper bore the headlines: 'The Community cannot continue to pro vide capital grants to a European steel industry which will lay off 200 000 persons by 1985'. We Members of Parliament cannot remain indifferent to such information. We have followed the discussion on steel between the United States and the European Community which was broken off on 10 June, and we have taken note of the American Department of Commerce decision to tax certain steel imports from Europe, Brazil, South Africa, at rates varying between 1% and 40% of the selling price. This measure will reduce European steel outlets in the United States and will lead to a drop in Community exports. On the eve of the meeting of the Council of Foreign Affairs Ministers on Monday and Tuesday next in Luxembourg, I should like to know the Commission's opinion on the United States' decision and on the measures it plans, since the Community practices which we are reproached with are neither in contra diction with the GATT rules nor, above all, with the consensus agreed by the OECD. Once again in this Chamber we are hovering over on ailing European steel industry. We have followed the development of the crisis anxiously in recent years and also the efforts made by the Commission to implement an anti-crisis plan. Unfortunately, we have noticed one thing: the situa tion has not improved; we observe an overcapacity in steelworks of between 25% and 30% of the produc tion capacity of crude and finished steels, which is quite substantial. According to the experts this reduc tion in capacity will lead to the unemployment of 200 000 workers. Today each Member State is doing all in its power to implement the various stages of a 'steel' plan, whether it be production capacity, the modernization of instal lations and their financing, which is very expensive, or social measures arising from the closure of installa tions which could not be made profitable. By deciding to introduce a modernization plan for the French steel industry which will cost more than 26 thousand million francs between 1982 and 1986, France is trying to restore a strong and competitive steel industry in four years. Is the Commission aware of the French plan? Does it fit in with the Community's 'steel' plan? Would it not be better for the Member States of the Community to decide together on the measures to be taken to restructure the European steel industry, unit ing their efforts to restore a sector which is in crisis in all countries, without exception, while at the same time of course protecting existing jobs? Can the Commission sum up the situation and tell us how Parliament would be associated in drawing up a joint modernization plan for the European steel indus try? Let us beware, because Parliament will be judged on its ability to settle a particularly delicate problem. IN THE CHAIR: MR KLEPSCH Vice-President President. \u2014 I call Mr Deleau to deputize for Mr de la Mal\u00e8ne. Mr Deleau. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentle men, the decision taken on 11 June by the US Depart ment Commerce to levy conteravailing charges on many steel imports from Europe justifies the gravest concern today. First of all because of its direct consequences. Under the guise of a conservation measure, it threatens in fact to prohibit the American market henceforth to prac tically half of European steel sales. ",
        "17.6. 82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/203 Deleau The profound and disquieting significance of this deci sion taken despite the GATT rules by the United States, as both judge and party concerned, reflects a deliberate protectionist stance directed against the European Community. Indeed, while the steels of two non-European coun tries are included amongst those affected by the Department of Commerce decision, it is obvious that the measures taken weigh heavily on Community producers. The fact is however, European producers are not res ponsible for the weakness of the American market nor for the specific difficulties of the US steel industry. On the contrary, their market share has dropped over pre vious years, while in the past their sales have often helped to ensure the normal supply of American user industries. One is shocked to observe that the target for attack is almost exclusively Europe, the best client of the United States and, what is more, a liquid client which overall purchases more from its American partner than it sells to it. Of course it is obviously not in the interest of the United States and the steel industry to create the con ditions for a trade conflict, even a political conflict. It is therefore indispensable that the Community auth orities point out with the necessary firmness to the American Government the dangers involved in pursu ing their present course and that only an equitable agreement respecting the traditional trade patterns of the European steel industry will make it possible to avoid these dangers. At the same time the Community must protest strongly to the GATT and study forthwith the measures required to safeguard the legitimate interests of Europe should the negotiations for an agreement again encounter demands which are unacceptable to the Community. That is, Mr President, in brief, our motion for a reso lution which faithfully reflects the concern of Euro peans. President. \u2014 I call the Socialist Group. Mr Peters. \u2014 (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentle men, on behalf of the Socialist Group I wish to make the following remarks. First: a few weeks ago the European Parliament accepted a motion for a resolution in which the United States were warned against adopting such measures and were called upon to find fair solutions to the problems. Second: the United States disregarded this warning. Last Friday they decided on unilateral protectionist measures \u2014 the imposition of supplementary duties and taxes on imports \u2014 in accordance with the Ameri can steel producers, aim of cutting back the flow of imports, or even stopping them all together. Third : this aim \u2014 to stop all imports \u2014 has not been achieved. What, however, has been achieved? At Ver sailles the Heads of State promised to uphold interna tional solidarity. This solidarity, however, has been made a mockery of by the American Government's decision. It has been shattered, it has been blatantly contradicted and puts the Atlantic Alliance under strain. Fourth: we in the European Community cannot accept this, because these decisions constitute a breach of the GATT rules. The aid for restructuring that has been granted in the European Community does not consti tute a form of export subsidy, whereas the system of duties decided upon by the Americans is quite unjusti fied and cannot be accepted. Fifth: all the institutions of the European Community must resolutely reject these decisions and must express their serious concern that a trade war could result, with chain reactions on both sides; the Commission and the Council of Ministers are called upon to declare quite unequivocally to the Americans that if they do not rescind these measures the European Community will have to adopt retaliatory measures. I should like to say clearly and unambiguously, apropos of this, that the Socialist Group does not want to see a trade war break out, but it is also quite unacceptable that these measures should remain in force. Sixth : At the EC negotiations, talks must not be based on any form of self-limiting measures regarding EC steel exports to the United States. vote in favour of Seventh: the Socialist Group wil both motions for a resolution. (Applause) President. \u2014 I call the Group of the European Peo ple's Party (Christian-Democratic Group). Mr Franz. \u2014 (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentle men, the European People's Party shares the view of the Liberal and Democratic Group and the European Progressive Democrats that a trade war between the USA and the EC must at all costs be avoided. On the other hand, attempts should be made during the discussions with the American Department of Trade, in the interest of both parties, to get the deci sion to introduce countervailing duties on specific steel imports rescinded. Protectionistic measures, no matter ",
        "No 1-286/204 Debates of the European Parliament 17.6.82 Franz where they originate, cannot solve the present prob lems. Protectionistic measures may lead to a shrinkage of world trade, which would result in an increase in the already unusually high number of unemployed in both America and the EC. Even if the Commission is successful and succeeds in getting the American Department of Trade to go back on its decision, this will naturally still not make any difference to the causes of the American decision. The impending coun tervailing duty is a reminder to all of us of the prob lems we have created for ourselves in the Community as a result of the enormous subsidies which we have granted in recent years to the European steel industry. In the European People's Party's motion for a resolu tion, which was accepted by this Parliament on 14 October last year, we once again clearly pointed out that the problems of the European steel industry could not be solved by paying maintenance subsidies. We said that there was a need to find ways of reducing the continuing excess capacity in the European steel industry. It is in the interest of the workers of Europe themselves that antiquated, uneconomic plant should not be kept operational for ever. The workers need new, promising jobs in the appropriate areas, which must be created with the appropriate support. It is, however, unreasonable that unemployment should be allowed to grow further in those very steel-producing regions where there is already very high unemploy ment. Happily, things have begun to move in recent months. At our instigation serious discussions are tak ing place about the possibilities of international coop eration in this area. This on its own, however, is not enough. We therefore support the demand made by the Liberal and Demo cratic Group that the Commission should inform Par liament about the measures it intends to carry out in order to see that the competitiveness of the European iron and steel industries is restored. Of course, I do not believe that it is possible to retain all the existing jobs in the steel sector if steel production in Europe is to remain competitive. Paragraph 4 should therefore probably be completed by the addition of some formula such as 'and to create new jobs in regions threatened by closures'. It will not be possible in the long run to continue to sell steel produced in subsidized European steelworks on the world market. There is therefore no time to lose. In the long run, neither in the USA nor in Europe can these problems be solved through protectionism or subsidies. We must carry out the necessary moderniza tion, we must continue with research and development so that in the future the European steel industry will be competitive in the world market without subsidies and without provoting retaliatory measures. (Applause) President. \u2014 I call the European Democratic Group. Miss Forster. \u2014 Mr President, my group will also sup port these two motions and I welcome the comments already made by the other speakers. Although the US decision last week on countervailing charges has stimulated this debate, it is really the last step in a series of negotiations. The US is operating at less than 50% of capacity, while already 200 000 jobs have been lost in Europe and probably another 200 000 will go before restructuring is complete. This is against a background of worldwide overcapacity and decreasing demand for steel in construction and cars because of the recession. It is therefore naive to expect that there will not be a commercial war for markets. Nevertheless, I do not think we should let the present situation deteriorate into a trade war. We do not want increasing protectionism nor do we want relations between the USA and ourselves to be spoiled by this dispute. It is therefore essential that the Foreign Min isters discuss this matter next week on Monday and Tuesday and decide what the Community should do about it. Britain, France, and Italy will be badly damaged by these countervailing charges not only because of the uncertainty of their future export markets but also because of the cost of the bonds that will have to be put forward to cover current exports. In addition, there is the anti-dumping case which will come up for decision in August, and this may damage the German steel producers. All the Member States therefore are involved, and it is absolutely vital that we act together in the same way as we are already doing under Article 58.1 would like to make three recommenda tions. First and foremost, we must contest by all legal means the decisions that have been made by the Amer icans. 40% against the British, 20-30% against the French and 18% against the Italians \u2014 these figures are far too high and we must question their validity. Secondly, we must go to GATT, if necessary, and not allow the Americans to decide unilaterally which kinds of subsidy are legitimate and which are not. In the UK out subsidies have gone to restructuring and to a reduction of capacity down to 14 million tonnes. In Germany the subsidies are for freight and power but they also help the steel industry, and yet the Ameri cans have not declared these invalid. On their side, the Americans have the DISCs and, if necessary, we must contest these. Finally, Mr President, we must put our own house in order. We must eliminate steel subsidies by 1985, because the only real way to win a trade war is to be competitive and money must not be wasted on pre serving obsolete plants but invested in the future growth industries.

        "17.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/205 President. \u2014 I call the Liberal and Democratic Group. Mr Pintat. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, no long speeches are required to express our support for the motion for a resolution tabled by the Group of European Demo crats. I am even tempted, to tell the truth, to consider its terms too moderate. Indeed we cannot disregard the gravity of the situation resulting from the American decision of last Friday. The United States cannot ser iously maintain that the European steel industry is causing any damage to its national steel industry, which is far more prosperous that ours. European producers' share in American steel imports has been dropping since 1978. The price of European products on the American market, protected moreover by the evocatively named 'trigger price' system, have always been higher than those applied within the ECSC. For my part I do not hesitate to support Mr Davignon's opinion and regard this as a bad commer cial, political and legal decision. Let me add that this decision is the more unjustifiable in that it in fact anticipates the evaluation of the size and existence of the damage invoked by the American steel industry. Furthermore, we cannot accept the risk of similar measures being taken at another time in other sectors, and here I am thinking for example of our agricultural exports, which are also under severe attack from the American administration. President. \u2014 I call the Commission. Mr Thorn, President of the Commission. \u2014 (FR) Thank you, Mr President, I have had an oppor tunity to express an opinion on this subject on several occasions, the last time only the day before yesterday; for that reason I do not need to speak at length and enter into too much detail. Allow me to point out a few important facts in the context of this discussion. It was on 10 June 1982 that the Department of Commerce of the United States Government arrived at the conclusion, and I wish to emphasize 'provisional conclusion' that in 19 cases steel exports from European companies were benefit ting from export subsidies. This conclusion implies that the American Department of Commerce will con tinue its investigation with a view to arriving at a final decision on the 19 cases in question within 75 days, in other words by 24 August 1982. At the same time the International Trade Commission of the United States must decide, within 120 days, thus before 8 October at the latest, on the extent of the damage to the internal American market from our imports. This decision implies that as from 10 June, the imports in question will be subject to a tax equal to the level of the subsidies enjoyed, according to the Department of Commerce, by the exports concerned, and which in their opinion amounts to up to 40%. Pending the final decision on the 19 cases, steel importers are henceforth obliged to lodge the equiva lent of the charges to be paid. These desposits may be refunded, totally or in part, if the provisional decision of the Department of Commerce is not confirmed in full. This shows you the extent of the damage. These new measures, involving the application of dif ferent taxation rates to the exports of various compan ies, affect the various parts of the European steel industry in a very grave and unequal manner. The Commission fully shares the concern of Parlia ment in the face of the unilateral measures just taken by the American authorities against Community steel exports. As regards our position, the position which the Com mission intends to adopt in the face of this new situa tion, it will contest, both legally and economically, all the arbitrary elements contained in the American ana lysis. We cannot imagine that imports which represent only about 5% of American consumption can cause serious damage to the American industry, the difficul ties of which arise, as we have said on several occa sions, mainly from inadequate progress on productiv ity and modernization. Furthermore, one can wonder about the role played by the development of exchange rates. Ladies, gentlemen, I should like to juxtapose the American assessment of the content of aid incorpor ated in European sales with the changes in the exchange rates. In less than two years the dollar has been revalued in relation to European currencies, by 30, 40, even 50%. It appears to me that this develop ment provides an explanation for many of the alleged advances in the competitiveness of Community exports. As you have requested, the Commission will not accept any abusive or unilateral interpretation of the GATT rules. Furthermore it will prove that there are no subsidies designed to help European steel imports to penetrate any market. The national and Community measures benefiting the European steel industry are designed solely to aid restructuring and support is only granted to projects which conform to the aid code by means of which the Community has imposed a strict and consistent discipline upon itself which fact deserves to be appreciated far more by the United States. The aid code demonstrates the European Com munity's wish to ensure greater transparency of the policy pursued in this sphere and to contribute to the maintenance of healthy conditions in international trade. It emphasizes that this effort has involved considerable sacrifices on its part, as you know, ladies and gentle men; in less than six years the Community has reduced ",
        "No 1-286/206 Debates of the European Parliament 17.6.82 Thorn the labour force employed in the steel industry by about one third, from about 800 000 jobs in 1975 to 547 000 jobs in 1981. During the same period the Commission introduced joint measures designed to significantly reduce capacity and improve the competi tiveness of the whole European steel industry by con centrating production on the most efficient plant and on products offering the best prospect of market equi librium. According to the terms of the aid code, these measures are only temporary: their objective is to restore a com petitive European steel industry which can offer last ing employment to its workers. These structural improvements inside the steel industry are accompa nied by programmes designed to offer alternative employment in other sectors: this in reply to some questions asked here. This is why our Commission attaches at least equal importance to the financing, through Community loan instruments, of conversion projects in the steel basins. In reply to Mr Franz let me say that we agree that subsidies should not become permanent. The aid code plans for the abolition of these subsidies; those which are granted, I repeat, are for investment and restructuring purposes. To Mr Cal vez, who asked about the French restructuring plan, let me say that this plan has not yet been communi cated in due form to the Community. Once it has been officially submitted, it will be studied of course on its merits and the Commission will take a position on it. Now, Mr President, I would like to re-situate the American decisions in the framework of our Versailles discussions. The clear conclusions of this Summit were that all of us, all the participants, wanted to preserve an open system of world trade, safe from any protec tionism. The western world, as Parliament here appears to wish, must avoid a trade war which would weaken all the parties concerned. Our economic diffi culties are such that neither the United States, nor even Japan, nor the Community, have anything to gain from commercial confrontation. My very definite view today is that these measures adopted by the Americans conform badly with the spirit but also with the letter of the Versailles conclusions. What attitude should the Community adopt? At the moment, we must first of all avoid falling into the trap of unconsidered and hasty measures. The Americans must bear the full responsibility for their unilateral decisions which have the effect of gravely disturbing the traditional trade patterns between Europe and the United States. For our part, Mr President, we will be neither weak nor accommodating. We will examine the American analysis closely calling on all the necessary technical expertise. With the Member States \u2014 which I am sure will all act in concert \u2014 we will work out a common strategy which should convey the solidarity which is more necessary than ever in the Community today. We will defend our case before all the American courts and also at political level as Mr de la Mal\u00e8ne advocates. In view of the gravity of the situation we will also, as certain speakers requested, defend our steel policy before international bodies \u2014 in this case GATT \u2014 adopting the appropriate procedures. We will do everything including direct negotiation with the United States, to ensure that the Community measures are understood. Ladies and gentlemen, the views which I have just expressed are the result of a very early assessment of the situation. On Tuesday next, 22 June, the Council of Ministers will hold a policy debate. In this context the Commission considers that the adoption of the two resolutions proposed in Parliament and which are being debated today, would be a valuable support for all the Community action, at least in this initial phase. President. \u2014The joint debate is closed. Vote 1 5. European passport President. \u2014 The next item is the motion for a resolu tion (Doc. 1-362/82), tabled by Mr Habsburg and others on behalf of the Group of the European Peo ple's Party (Christian-Democratic Group), on the European passport. I call Mr Habsburg. Mr Habsburg. \u2014 (DE) Mr President, I am delighted to be able to tell you that last night I received from the relevant Council officials a letter stating that the prob lems prompting urgent procedure had been cleared up. Before I now withdraw our motion for a resolution, there is one thing I want to say. We saw yesterday how most people in this Parliament are very aware of the human side of European problems. Against the Bureau's will we managed to get this motion for a resolution put on the agenda. I should like to hope that the higher echelons of the Council will regard this as a shot across their bows. We shall see to it that these measures of relevance for our citizens are taken fur ther. President. \u2014 The motion for a resolution has been withdrawn. I call Mr Irmer on a point of order. 1 See Annex. ",
        "17.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/207 Mr Irmer. \u2014 (DE) Mr President, after the vote on the de la Mal\u00e8ne resolution you stated that the House had voted unanimously in favour of it. I abstained. For very well known reasons my vote was disregarded by the Chair. President. \u2014 We shall check on it. I call Mr Patterson. Mr Patterson. \u2014 Mr President, my point of order is this. In the slightly calmer atmosphere of the previous vote and in the course of the discussion of procedural points which followed the vote on the Lebanon, your predecessor in that chair, the President of Parliament, declared that written declarations could be made. Now as Rule 48(4) specifically excludes explanations of vote after debates on matters of urgency under Rule 48. I just want to ask the chair to clarify what kind of declarations can be made on that vote. Is this a special procedure which we are being given? If so, per haps you could, either now or later, outline to the House what procedure we go through in order to make these declarations, which of course are separate from explanations of vote under Rule 80. President. \u2014 The President has already stated that he will accept written statements on the voting procedure. 6. Internal market President. \u2014 The next item is the joint debate on two motions for resolutions: \u2014 motion for a resolution (Doc. 1-345/82), tabled by Mr Moreau and others on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the progress made during the Bel gian presidency as regards the functioning of the Community's internal market; \u2014 motion for a resolution (Doc. 1-350/82) by Mr Travaglini and others on a Community industrial strategy. I call Mr Moreau. Mr Moreau. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs wanted to discuss this motion for a resolution before the end of the Belgian Presidency. Twenty-five years after the signing of the Treaty of Rome, the concept of a common market is certainly not new; however, this market is not yet a reality, at least not totally. The customs barriers have been abol ished, but other barriers have been and continue to be raised; these are the technical, administrative barriers, the national standards, the tax barriers, which are obstacles to the free circulation of goods and persons and to the existence of a real internal market. The delegation of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs which is investigating these problems and is at present trying to bring home to national members of Parliament and the ministries concerned the importance of this subject, has returned from its first two visits to Brussels and Paris convinced of the justification for its representations in the general interest of the Community. This is the reason why we have presented this motion for a resolution in accordance with Article 48 of the Rules of Procedure. Our intention is to support in particular the intention of the Presidency-in-Office to hold a meeting of the ministers involved in the func tioning of the internal market before the end of its term. Indeed it is vital that the 21 directives of which the Council has completed its technical consideration and which concern the internal market, in particular a Community method of testing products, should be adopted. This would remove the principal non-tariff barriers to trade and improve the position of the Com munity in trade negotiations. We also hope that the Council will concentrate espe cially on a series of fiscal problems in particular the collection of VAT in the ordinary accounts of com panies and not at the frontiers. This procedure would substantially reduce the cost of transporting goods. There is also a need to increase the duty-free allow ances and to simplify the temporary import formalities for craft and artistic material in the frontier regions. One could quote also amongst the required measures, the gradual opening of public markets in micro-elec tronics and progress in the area of travellers' private documents, including the European passport. In our opinion decisions on these matters could contri bute greatly to restoring the competitiveness of our economy and reducing unemployment. The Belgian President-in-Office, whom we spoke with, was pre pared to make progress on these issues. Thus a Coun cil of Community Ministers should be held soon to examine these issues urgently. President. \u2014 I call Mr Travaglini. Mr Travaglini. \u2014 (IT) Mr President, ladies and gen tlemen, the Community is way behind where industrial policy is concerned, particularly structurally speaking. The need to organize a more efficient system of prod uction to face the challenges of other important manu- ",
        "No 1-286/208 Debates of the European Parliament 17. 6. 82 Travaglini facturing centres outside Europe has been recognized in all responsible places; anxiety is expressed over traditional sectors; recurrent energy crises are feared; while unemployment is increasing dramatically, the Member States continue to organize their production systems in total independence of each other without making use of national complementary measures, and protectionist tendencies are coming to the fore again and are threatening the very foundations of the Com mon Market edifice. Some sectors of the Community continue to view the Common Market as an end in itself and the purpose for which the Community institutions exist, rather than as an instrument of economic expansion. But the Community must evolve from being a com munity of trade to being one of production. The Com munity must organize and implement joint or at least harmonized action programmes in order to build a manufacturing base which is as homogeneous as possi ble. Not only must the internal market be made as open as possible, but a framework must be built within which the system's potential can grow, providing practical incentives for research and innovation, so that we can avoid the piecemeal organization of labour on the one hand and taxation in the market on the other. In some high-technology 'sectors, competitiveness can only be restored and assured for the future if production is reorganized at the European level. Community preferential tariffs and a reasoned super vision of investments outside Europe must not be seen as elements of European protectionism, but rather as constituent parts which can be used to weld a Euro pean identity, just as there is a given identity in the United States or Japan. What we need therefore are practical measures to promote agreements between European firms, to develop European technologies, to lay down Euro pean standards \u2014 particularly where new products are concerned \u2014 and encouragement to large public organizations to give preference to European firms. With regard to Community resources earmarked for industry, I could hardly fail to repeat the points made by this Parliament and the urgent tone of entreaty in which they have been expressed. Quite simply, the appropriations are derisory a mere drop in the ocean. With this motion for a resolution, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are asking the Commission and Council to be much more incisive and decisive and to take direct steps to promote the organic development of the Community production system. Unless we embark on a new course for industrial cooperation, for the restoration of competitiveness and a solution to the problems of unemployment and technological modernization for the entire Com munity production system, we are never going to make any progress along the path of economic inte gration. We might even find ourselves forced back into absurd protectionism and hence commercial and economic rivalry between our various countries. President. \u2014 I call the Socialist Group. Mr Rogalla. \u2014 (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentle men, a wise Belgian statesman remarked some years ago that there were many pocket States in the Euro pean Community, but that a distinction must be made between those that were aware of the fact and these that were not. He knew what he was talking about. In this respect, I too have no illusions. The conflict over the Falkland Islands certainly has not done anything to improve awareness in Europe of our own particularism. All the more reason, therefore, for us in this House to struggle, time and again and sometimes with impatience, for control of the common internal market, the heart of the Community, which is the subject of so many earnest entreaties. In so doing, we are also fulfilling one of our principal duties, namely, keeping a watchful eye on the Council of Ministers. In the Treaties, particularly in the EEC Treaty, this is all clearly laid out. The Treaties state that over a tran sitional period of 12 years a genuine common market must gradually be achieved. As we are all well aware, the 12 years in question have long since elapsed. If the Council continues to fudge the issue, then we shall not have a common internal market worthy of that name if we wait 112 \u2014 one hundred and twelve \u2014 years. Today, we as a Parliament are making use of a proce dure covering relations between the Community insti tutions, which also allows for making a formal com plaint of inactivity to the European Court of Justice. We are making use of our rights to burrow away patiently here in order to eliminate prejudices and attempts to keep issues in isolation. We are using the plenary session of the European Parliament to call upon the Council \u2014 which I do not see represented here today \u2014 to be much more diligent in the exercise of its legislative function and to do much more to make the needs of our citizens and our economy the focal point of its work. It is really ironical that in spite of the massive unem ployment problems we face, we are still not capable of dispatching legislation which will help the cause of simplification and which will promote trade and com merce. We talk about full employment and the prob lems of getting back to it, but we are simply not cap able of the mere stroke of a pen with which millions of units of account could be saved and simplifications could be achieved and with which, naturally, jobs could also be created. ",
        "17.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/209 Rogalla Instead of a common internal market and freedom of movement for everybody, wherever small print is involved we come up against red tape and an exagger ated obsession with checking things. This constitutes a real challenge for every member of the European Par liament. Our Parliament has a duty to fight against narrow-mindedness, reputed interests, even against simple prejudices and dislike. I also call upon the Commission, which happily has a deeply committed departmental head for the domestic market, in the person of Mr Narjes, to cooperate in the attempt to get the Council to use in respect of the 21 directives relating to this matter the option of simple majority decisions which it has already made successful use of once before this month, in order to promote simplifi cation, openness and the free movement of goods and to combat unnecessary checks and particularism, in the interest of all Member States. The Socialist Group will vote in favour of both requests for urgent procedure. (Applause) Let me mention a third point: the raising of duty-free allowances for travellers within the Community. This is also a matter which has been discussed for two and a half years. The information we have available suggests that objections to this have been withdrawn. It will be quite incomprehensible to us if no decision is taken on this by the Council before the 30 June. I think this is something that we must say quite plainly. The ancient Romans had a proverb: senatores boni viri, senatus autem mala bestia. With reference to the Coun- xil I should like to say: membra consilii boni viri, consi lium autem mala bestia. (Appkuse) Many members of this body deserve our respect, some of them may even be deserving of our admiration. But when they come together as the Council of Ministers they are a hindrance to almost everything which could make a success o\u00ed Europe, and turn it into a finer and better place. (Applause) President. \u2014 I call the Group of the European Peo ple's Party (Christian Democratic Group). President. \u2014 I call the European Democratic Group. Mr von Wogau. \u2014 (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in drafting this proposal, the authors, of whom I was one, proceeded on the assumption that before the Belgian presidency came to an end one meeting of the Council could be devoted specially to questions connected with the internal market. Since then we have learned that this will not be possible. Our initial reaction of enthusiasm has naturally given way to disappointment, because in our view it is absolutely indispensable that certain matters, which have already been discussed at the technical level and on which all that needs to be done is to take a political decision, should be dealt with and dispatched before the end of the Belgian presidency. These are partly matters which have been pending at the Council for years. Let me mention, as an example, the directive that could lead to an opening of the tele communications market. That is an important sector, capable of creating new jobs, but instead jobs are being lost. If we lose our competitiveness there we shall lose jobs here in Europe, and we are of the opi nion that something must be done in this sector, some thing must be decided. I shall also mention the directive on imports from non-Member States. The fact that we have no com mon position on this matter is the reason why other directives \u2014 a total of 21 are mentioned here \u2014 which could help to open up the domestic market are being held up. Here too, in the end, a decision will have to be taken. Sir David Nicolson. \u2014 Mr President, last part session the vital subject of industrial strategy was squeezed out of the agenda by a debate on plastic bullets, and this time very nearly by one on Israel and the Leba non. In neither of these cases will the views of this Parliament be paid any attention to by the powers concerned, while industrial strategy, which this Parlia ment would influence, always seems to be given second priority. This is a very grave reflection on the practical conduct of this Parliament. How could we cope with the steel crisis without a European strategy? Next we shall see the same prob lems arising in chemicals, with a new Saudi industry pouring exports into the Community. We are in trou ble in aluminium too. In many other areas, our share in the world market is falling. We have record unem ployment, and the Council of Ministers, despite pro mises over the past two years, has totally failed to mobilize the energies of the Community to stimulate industry. This is not time for ideological bickering about inter vention or workers participation, it is a time to do something to find ways to make use of our real assets \u2014 skills and high technology in new fields, and not in declining industries: a time to launch more joint ven tures like the airbus and a time to improve our infra structure and create employment. I cannot comment effectively in two minutes on Com munity industrial strategy, as I am sure you will appre ciate, but I will say that this is of vital and urgent ",
        "No 1-286/210 Debates of the European Parliament 17.6.82 Nicolson concern, and on behalf of my group I support the resolution. (Applause) President. \u2014 I call the Communist and Allies Group. Mr Leonardi. \u2014 (IT) Mr President, we approve of both motions for a resolution because we feel that the internal market can never be developed except through an appropriate industrial policy. Such a policy is today the only \u2014 or at least the most important \u2014 instrument which will enable our Community to achieve active integration. We are asking the Commission, however, to make a decisive move from proposals for an industry policy based on the so-called traditional industries or from general proposals to much more precise and specific suggestions on an industrial policy for sectors of the future such as electronics, telecommunications, etc. It should be obvious that in these sectors scientific research and the industries themselves can only be properly developed at Community level. Only in this way will such industries be able to compete with other industrialized nations, among which we may count not only the United States and Japan but also others which are emerging as newly industrialized States. I should like to remind those present that it is not suf ficient for Parliament to demand these things. When the proposals are formulated we must all think very carefully and with responsibility about the sacrifices which we are all going to have to make in order to arrive at mutual advantages, bearing in mind that the advantages will outweigh the sacrifices. When the time comes, we will have to support the Commission in its efforts to create such a policy, all the while knowing that a price for it will have to be paid by the various Member States, but that the price to be paid will be greatly compensated for by the future advantages. President. \u2014 I call Mr de Ferranti. Mr de Ferranti. \u2014 Mr President, I am sorry that the Council respresentatives are not present, because my remarks are addressed directly to them. The certifica tion and testing procedures described in the resolution are used by Member States to protest minority pro ducer interests and thereby distort trade and cheat consumers even more than the tariffs used to do. The Council now has before it a reasonable proposal for a Community procedure which would resolve the prob lem. If it cannot agree to it, then this means that the economic community towards which we have all of us in this House strived so hard becomes a dead letter. I would be misleading my constituents if, in the event of a non-decision by the Council. I then continued to attend this Parliament and continued to lend credibil ity to a movement in which the Council itself no lon ger believes, and its absence today confirms my view. President. \u2014 I call Mr Fernandez. Mr Fernandez. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, I should like to voice the opposition of the French Communist and Allies Group to this resolution. If the stated objective, i.e. growth without inflation and employment is true, we cannot see how such a problem can begin to be solved simply by increasing trade in the Community market and improving the functioning of this market. First of all there is the important problem of restoring the balance of trade. France's trade deficit vis-\u00e0-vis the Federal Republic in particular, aggravates inflation and the difficulties of the French economy. Secondly, there is the problem of reconquering the internal market; the French Government, and recently Mr Mitterrand, outlined the problems as regards our country. This reconquest must be based on the fight against austerity and a national industrial policy of developing the production potential. The Community should play a complementary and positive role by means of incentives, aid or coordination. However there will be no Community market if we do not take care to protect the means of production in our respec tive countries. Finally, it appears to us unrealistic and dangerous to ask the Council to adopt 21 industrial directives at a single meeting. These problems are too serious not to allow the Member States the physical possibility of assessing the proposals put to them. President. \u2014 I call the Commission. Mr Narjes, Member of the Commission. \u2014 (DE) Mr President, the Commission first of all welcomes the motion for a resolution by Mr Moreau and the mem bers of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and confirms the statement that Mr von Wogau has just made. As we heard, there will unfor tunately not be a special meeting of the Council of Ministers this month to discuss internal market prob lems. The Commission too regrets that the Council of Min isters finds it impossible to meet this month to discuss only the problems of the internal market. But at this point I should like to reiterate how urgently we hope that the Council of Ministers will deal with internal market affairs immediately and intensively. It is precisely in the present crisis that the European economy, undergoing a difficult restructuring process ",
        "17.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/211 Narjes and faced with more urgent demands for innovation, needs the possibilities which only an internal market the size of a continent can offer, to enable the econ omy of each Member State to make full use of its inherent strength. If the Community fails to make clear progress in this situation, it will retrogress put ting its present achievements at risk, and this would be the result of unbridled protectionism. The Community's possessions are not yet crisis-proof or so secure that they would survive our failure to consolidate the internal market and resist the on slaught of protectionism. Our problem is partly that, although the Heads of State and Government are pre pared to issue impressive resolutions supporting the Commissiqn in its alarm at the state of the internal market, this is never adequately reflected in concrete decisions by the Council of Ministers. In other words, the discrepancy between word and deed at the deci sion-making level in the Community has become intol erable! Twenty-five years after the Treaties of Rome were signed, even public opinion is justifiably grieved that traditional customs formalities still exist at the Com munity's internal borders. We should at least reduce them to the level already successfully applied between the Benelux States. But for this we will have to per suade the customs, tax and statistics experts, and goodness knows who else, to consider their technical problems, indisputably important though they may be in relative terms, against the broader aspects of the need to revive the internal market. It is only by making real progress in this direction that we can regain public support for the construction of Europe and reduce costs for the consumer and the economy. The Commission's efforts to achieve fundamental pol itical progress in this field in carrying out the Mandate of 30 May 1980, which mentions these points in Chap ter 1, have so far proved in vain. It has now given up hope and will therefore submit the necessary technical advances as soon as possible for a decision by the Council of Ministers (which is its job), regardless of what the fate of the Mandate of 30 May may be. A second fundamental problem mentioned in the reso lution, for which a solution is long overdue, concerns technical tests on products from third countries. This is not merely a matter of the 21 proposals mentioned, which are still with the Committee of Permanent Representatives. The Council's working parties are dealing with a whole series of further proposals for directives, and it is no exaggeration to say that almost all the work on removing technical trade barriers has been brought to a standstill by this one unresolved question. As early as last October I had the opportunity of des cribing the Commission's position on this matter to the House. I would repeat, as it is such an important ques tion, that we are being guided by four basic notions. Firstly, the Community must be able to establish its own identity even with non-tariff trade barriers, other wise it would be self-contradictory. Secondly, tech nical protection measures with third countries must include the possibility of negotiations in the interests of a reciprocal approach. Thirdly, a customs and economic union must involve different treatment for goods from within the Com munity and goods from third countries. This principle, which was clearly expressed in the most recent pro nouncement by the Court of Justice, will reinspire confidence in Community producers that European integration should primarily benefit employers and workers in the Community. Fourthly, the application of these instruments comes under the provisions of Article 110 of the EEC Treaty. The Community must give priority to a liberal external economic policy in the interests of the European econ omy. With this in mind the Commission has drawn up a compromise which seems to offer a real chance of unity, provided that there is rapprochement between the Member States and that they show confidence in the Community and its institutions. What is now required is a decision of political principle \u2014 we think this too is possible. Because of the short time available, I am unable to deal with a whole series of other points. I should just like to mention that there is a little movement going on in one of the more sensitive areas: the increase in duty-free allowances at the border to 210 EUA, which is to come into force from 1. 1. 1983, with the excep tion of Denmark which has a 12 month delay, seems now to be ready to be submitted to the Council of Ministers for a decision next week. The second motion to be given consideration concerns industrial policy problems. The speeches which have been made and the wording of the motion indicate that we are dealing with more major problems of prin ciple which need further debate. They are couched in the various interpretations given to the word 'real' in the industrial policy. What is a 'real' industrial policy? Different views on this are obviously held in this House and between some Members of the House and the Commission. What are the simple aims and essence of the industrial policy? \u2014 an alien concept to the Treaties of Rome. This is not the time and place to be holding a debate on these principles. I should simply like to spell out the problem very clearly and remind you that the economic consensus of the Treaties of Rome was reached on the basis of the Community establishing essential basic and general principles. These are: firstly, a European internal market, secondly, a common liberal external economic policy to suit the European requirements of a processing area poor in raw materials, and thirdly, genuine and effec tive competition in proficiency. In addition to these basic principles which are to be established under the ",
        "No 1-286/212 Debates of the European Parliament 17.6.82 Narjes Treaties of Rome, and which the institutions are to put into practice, there is a series of further general princi ples to which the Community is committed in sub sequent years \u2014 I would mention for example, envi ronment protection and measures under the research policy, which I cannot go into here. As well as these, there are special commitments on action to be taken, such as under Euratom, the agricultural and regional policies and so on. For the rest, however, the Treaties of Rome go no fur ther than giving the Community a coordinating role in the fields of short and longer-term economic policy and monetary policy, and our experience over the last 25 years has shown how arduous it is to make real progress in these areas and to broaden the area of res ponsibility for them. The Member States differ very broadly in their opinions on the economic order and also on the aims and instruments which a short-term economic policy should have. We cannot afford not to admit this. That is why, against this background, there can be no question now of the Community having general intervention powers, quite apart from the fact that the budget could not provide for them. I think I should add, on the subject of concrete proposals, that many industrial problems, particularly unemployment, the consequences of stagnation and inflation and weak investment, are felt to varying degrees in the individual Member States, and that it would be asking too much of the Community to expect it to put right any wrong turns taken in national economic policies. And the Community would certainly not be well advised to try to repeat unsound national concepts at Community level. If a short-term economic policy is based on shaky founda tions, neither subsidies nor interventionism can help \u2014 the treatment must begin at national level, in the long and short-term economic and monetary fields. Having described all this, I need not go into the indivi dual measures which come under our responsibility and are to a great extent known to the House. I should merely like to point out that the Commission intends to submit in the near future a long-term research and development programme which is now being prepared or is to be prepared together with the economic bodies concerned and the unions. As far as all other measures are concerned, we have long since submitted our plans and possibilities to the Council of Ministers for a decision. The ball is now plainly in the Council's court, and we would be delighted if it would make up its mind to decide more boldly, quickly and with a greater readiness to compromise both in this field, which has been specifically assigned to us, and in the internal market. President. \u2014 The joint debate is closed. 7. European Monetary System President. \u2014 The next item is the joint debate on two motions for resolutions : \u2014 motion for a resolution (Doc. 1-352/82/rev.), tabled by Mr de la Mal\u00e8ne on behalf of the Group of European Progressive Democrats, on the conclusions to be drawn from the cur rent operation of the European Monetary System; \u2014 motion for a resolution (Doc. 1-355/82) by Mr Diana and others on variations in the par ities of the currencies of the Member States. I call Mr Bocklet on a point of order. Mr Bocklet. \u2014 (DE) The two motions are about something which is topical but hardly urgent. In my view the problem is no complex that it needs to be gone into thoroughly. I therefore move, under Rule 85, that the two motions be referred to the rel evant committee. President. \u2014 I call Mr Deleau. Mr Deleau. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, I am going to speak in favour of urgent debate on these motions for resolutions. I do not share the opinion that was voiced a moment ago by another Member. I think it is urgent for this Parliament to raise this matter, which is of extreme importance following the readjustment of the parities which was decided a few days ago, especially where agriculture is concerned. I therefore request that the debate on these two motions be held. President. \u2014 I call Mr Gautier. Mr Gautier. \u2014 (DE) We second Mr Bocklet's request. I really do feel that the subject is far too com plicated to be dealt with in a couple of minutes. In connection with the fixing of prices we had a tho rough debate on how we wanted to handle the pari ties. As a result, I do not feel that this short motion is suitable when it comes to reopening this matter and getting Parliament to find a consistent position. We are therefore in favour of having this matter properly discussed in committee. President. \u2014 I call Mr von der Vring. Vote 1 1 See Annex. Mr von der Vring. \u2014 (DE) There is a difference between referral to committee without a vote but with debate and referral by way of ending a debate. I would not consider that the latter is any longer admissible ",
        "17.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/213 von der Vring after the decision on urgent topics, but I do consider the former to be logical and correct. President. \u2014 In accordance with Rule 85 of the Rules of Procedure referral back to committee may be requested at any time. That has been the procedure until now. Until the Committee on the Rules of Proce dure and Petitions informs us otherwise, I am obliged to act in accordance with the President's decision of 10 May. (Parliament agreed to Mr Bocklet's request) As for the last point raised by Mr Langes, let me tell him that most if not all of the aid in question passes via the Caritas organizations and sometimes via M\u00e9decins du Monde and via Cebemo, and that so far we have encountered no problems in implementing this aid. Such is the case that we are waiting until the present aid runs out completely or is about to run out before we think about any additional aid. The fact is that the situation of the people in this region is alarming. President. \u2014 I call Mr Langes. 8. Emergency aid programme for the Caritas of the dioceses of El Salvador President. \u2014 The next item is the motion for a resolu tion (Doc. 1-331/82), tabled by Mr Langes and others on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (CD Group), on an emergency aid programme for the Caritas of the dioceses of El Salvador. I call Mr Langes. Mr Langes. \u2014 (DE) Mr President, following on from yesterday's debate on hunger in the world, what we have here is a straightforward resolution on charity aid. We have simply to decide whether we want to supply the Catholic Church's aid organizations in one of the world's trouble spots with special aid in the form of rice, butteroil, red beans and maize. I am sure that every Member, no matter what his political beliefs, realizes how essential it is for this aid to reach the Catholic Church in El Salvador so that refugees and those who are starving can be helped. I really do ask you to give your unanimous support to this motion. President. \u2014 I call the Commission. Mr Pisani, Member of the Commission. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, the honourable Member's comments meet with no criticism on our part \u2014 indeed, quite the con trary. I wanted to say that the Community began help ing the people of El Salvador as long as three years ago, and it tries to help by adapting its aid to the real needs of the people. As far as possible they are prov ided with products from that part of the world, because the eating habits of the people there are dif ferent from ours. There has been some query about whether the oats and rolled oats sent to these people matched their requirements. The fact is that we have not noted any criticism and I can even say that it was the non-gov ernmental organizations in charge of distribution which requested these products. Mr Langes. \u2014 (DE) Mr Pisani, my information comes from the head of Caritas in El Salvador and from the Papal Nuncio, Archbishop Kada. I therefore beg you not to say that we should go on waiting; rather it is vitally important that this extra aid be given. (Applause) President. \u2014 The debate is closed. Vote 1 President. \u2014 I call Mr von der Vring on a point of order. Mr von der Vring. \u2014 (DE) Mr President, I should like some information regarding the interpretation of Rule 85(3). A motion for referral back to committee was tabled. I said that a closure of the joint debate was not automatically connected. I wanted to table another motion. You can close the debate at any time but this is a separate procedure and you said yesterday during the vote that there was no way I could say anything else on this point. If it is found in connection with an urgent debate that there is no point in discussing the subject, I think it makes sense to refer the matter to committee. But I do not think it makes sense if this occurs without a debate, after the subject has in fact been placed on the agenda. This is contrary to the Rules of Procedure and I would ask you to observe the distinction between the first and second parts of Rule 85(3). President. \u2014 The Committee on the Rules of Proce dure and Petitions will be asked for a clear ruling. I call Mr Enright. Mr Enright. \u2014 It is all very well to refer things to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure and Petitions of 1 See Annex. ",

So we really must make our minds up whether we are 'in earnest when we refer something to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure and Petitions, or whether it is just an excuse, and once the committee has made its ruling, then this House must accept it and not throw it aside in the cavalier fashion that it did earlier this morning. President. \u2014 Mr Enright, the Committee on the Rules of Procedure and Petitions will consider the matter at its next meeting on 24 and 25 June. The President asked this morning for statements on the proceedings to be submitted in writing. They will then appear in the Minutes of Proceedings. We are aware of the fact that a misunderstanding occurred in one of the languages, in the English translation in fact. I call Mr Patterson. Mr Patterson. \u2014 Mr President, you have just made a statement, and that is what I understood the first time, on written explanations on procedure. Could you tell me whether that includes saying which way you would have voted had there been a separate vote? Because I think that is what most people want to do. If it is only a procedural point we can make, then I think that is different. But if we can give an explanation on the substance, namely, the way in which we would have voted on the issue, that is a different matter. Could you be absolutely clear which you mean? President. \u2014 I would ask you to submit your state ment, if you wish to submit one, and to include in it all the factors you wish to have included. It will then have to be decided whether they correspond with this morning's explanations or not. 9. Situation in Nicaragua President. \u2014 The next item is the motion for a resolu tion (Doc. 1-332/82), tabled by Mr Brok and others on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (CD Group), on the situation in Nicaragua. I call Mr Brok. ber of criteria in adopting its resolutions on El Salva dor and Turkey at the beginning of the year. This motion for a resolution is similar to the other two as regards criteria, contents and wording. What was expressed on that occasion must be repeated again now if we want to retain our credibility in the eyes of the world. The immediate threat to people's lives should be a matter of such urgency that we do not defer this motion again \u2014 it has already been on the agenda once \u2014 but instead we should take a decision for the sake of the people involved, especially the Indian tribes in this country. President. \u2014 I call Mr Enright on a point of order. Mr Enright. \u2014 Mr President, I would like to quote the well-used Rule 85 again and suggest that this be referred back to committee. I waited until Mr Brok had spoken on it to see if there was any urgent reason why we should not consider the matter in depth. I think he is absolutely right; it needs to be considered in depth and therefore I think that it is far better done by the appropriate committee, and I so move. President. \u2014 I call Mr Langes. Mr Langes. \u2014 (DE) Mr President, the resolution is supposed to serve as a signal. The European Parlia ment is considering these matters and how they are being viewed in Nicaragua and these events and how they appear, along the lines of our motion for an urgent debate. Anyway, we have just referred a diffi cult and sweeping problem back to committee. President. \u2014 I call Mr von der Vring. Mr von der Vring. \u2014 (DE) Mr President, we are greatly concerned about the matter raised by Mr Brok. Certain anti-democratic and repressive trends in Nicaragua are having a deep effect on us, but we have found out that the information is very contradictory and that only unconfirmed newspaper reports are available, so that there are reservations which should be taken seriously and this matter should be dealt with thoroughly in committee so that we can then vote on it. (Parliament rejected Mr Enright's request) Mr Brok. \u2014 (DE) Mr President, I should very much like Parliament's support for this urgent motion since it deals with direct humanitarian aid for the people of Nicaragua and also about the very real threats to the Misquito tribe of Indians. Parliament followed a num- President. \u2014 I call the Commission.

        "17.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/215 Pisani ture given by Mr Brok. If there was a problem, it was raised during the talks we had in Brussels with a Nicaraguan official who was visiting us. He told us that his government was ready to allow a committee on human rights into the country to verify the precise situation. In the circumstances, the Commission will not suspend aid to Nicaragua, especially as this aid is for specific needs and we have been assured that it will actually reach the population. Lastly, as part of the programme submitted to Parlia ment in the supplementary and amending budget for 1982 there is a development aid programme for Nicar agua. When this programme is put into effect, we shall have closer contacts with the country in question and we shall thus be in a position to view the situation bet ter. I would point out to the House that the situation is difficult and that Nicaragua, after all it has been through, needs our support. President. \u2014 The debate is closed. IN THE CHAIR: MR ESTGEN Vice-President Vote 1 President. \u2014 I call Mr Collins. Mr Collins, chairman of the Committee on the Environ ment, Public Health and Consumer Protection. \u2014 Mr President, speaking in my capacity as chairman, I wish to refer to item 108 on this afternoon's agenda, the report by Mr Remilly on the action programme in the field of shore-based maritime navigation aid systems. Under Rule 85 I would like to put it to you that in the light of the very large numbers of amendments which have been put down to this report by members of the Committee on Transport, it is fairly clear to me and it must be clear I think to the House that there were aspects of this matter that were not covered com pletely in the report which is being presented to the House. I think that in all fairness it would be a good thing if the committee were allowed to reconsider it and take into account the amendments which have been tabled. President. \u2014 I call Mr Forth. President. \u2014 I call Mr Hord on a point of order. Mr Hord. \u2014 May I suggest that for the voting the bell is rung some time before the actual vote is taken? In the last two votes the bell was rung immediately before you called the vote, which gave no time for Members to get into the Chamber. President. \u2014 The reason, Mr Hord, is that the votes follow each other so closely. I call Mr von der Vring. Mr von der Vring. \u2014 (DE) Mr President, there is a mistake in yesterday's Minutes. On page 49 of the German version it correctly says that subparagraph (e) was adopted but nothing was done as a result of this, by which I mean the deletion of subparagraph (g). President. \u2014 The Minutes will be corrected. (The sitting was suspended at 1 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.) Mr Forth. \u2014 I would like to ask the chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection a question, if I may, namely if he could tell me whether or not the Committee on Transport were asked for an opinion on this matter and, if so, have they given an opinion and, if not, why not? To come at this late stage to the Chamber with what sounds like a very valid case is disturbing in that it suggests complete lack of communication between committees. President. \u2014 I call Mr Collins. Mr Collins. \u2014 First of all, the Committee on Trans port did not offer an opinion and, as far as I can see, it was not given the opportunity to offer an opinion. But whether that was because it was not referred to it or whether it was because we chose not to I am, at the moment, a little bit unclear. But the point is that we did not have the benefit of the Committee on Trans port's knowledge until the amendments were put down. I take Mr Forth's point, but I think in a way this is a general criticism of the system of referral to committees and the way in which they communicate generally, and I think it is a criticism that I would share. See Annex. President. \u2014 I call Mr Enright. ",
        "No 1-286/216 Debates of the European Parliament 17.6.82 Mr Enright. \u2014 In view of the disturbing implications for the relationships between committees, should this not now go to the already overburdened Committee on the Rules of Procedure and Petitions so that they can examine the whole philosophy behind it and see if they can make a ruling for this House which it can then subsequently ignore? (Laughter) President. \u2014 Mr Enright, the matter has already been referred to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure and Petitions. We now have yet another example. Mr Collins, areyou moving referral to committee? Mr Collins. \u2014 It is always very useful to have the judgment of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure and Petitions, but I would not like to think that the report itself would be held up. I am sure that Mr Enright in his wisdom would not wish that either because he is always very keen to have things roll along quickly. So, yes, I am requesting that it be handed back to committee but I have no objection at all that the general principle is looked at yet again by the Committee on the Rules of Procedure and Peti- The Committee on Development has \u2014 as we are very grateful to see, Mrs Rabbethge \u2014 taken up many of our criticisms. Not all, and I should like to add on my own behalf that I would have preferred to see more, but nevertheless a very great deal. The difference between the two committees, I must say in all honesty to the House, is really only in the tactical approach to be used. The Committee on Development says that if the Commission is prepared to make a few changes it will agree. The Committee on Energy and Research, having some misgivings, has demanded that the Com mission should submit a completely new text for us to consider. We both have the same aim, as far as I can see, that changes must be made. It is merely that we have different views on the best way to achieve this. I should now like to outline a few of the reasons why we rejected the programme. The Committee is fully aware that research is required for the benefit of the developing countries. There are more than 500 million people in the world who are underfed. In 50 countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America crops are threatened by pests and diseases. There are over 1 000 million people suffering from tropical diseases, which might be called the 'scourges of modern man'. In this we agree with the Commission that research is definitely required. But the solution given in the Commission's proposal is, in our view, the wrong one. (Parliament agreed to Mr Collins' request) 10. Science and technology for development (continuation) President. \u2014 The next item is the continuation of the debate on the Rabbethge report (Doc. 1-202/82). I call the Committee on Energy and Research. Mr Schmid, draftsman of an opinion. \u2014 (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Energy and Research, on whose behalf I am speaking, rejects the programme in its proposed form. If it remains as the Commission has proposed we cannot agree to it, and we would go so far as to say that in its present state it would be wasting taxpayers' money on the one hand and making unreasonable demands on the developing countries on the other. We shall be watching very carefully \u2014 and let this be a clear warn ing to the Commission for the budget debates \u2014 to see whether the programme has been changed. The Commission cannot rely, as was often the case in the past, on Parliament finally giving in in an excess of European fervour. You may find yourself, Mr Com missioner, in a situation where you have the Council decision, but lack the Parliament majority to approve funds from the budget. I want to make this quite clear as from today. And that for three reasons: Firstly, the programme relies on building up research capacity in Europe. In our opinion, this cannot be the answer. We must build up research capacity in situ in the developing countries, helping them to help them selves. Secondly, the proposal barely gives a thought \u2014 if any \u2014 to how the results can be transposed into the work ing reality of conditions in the developing countries. In technical terms, this means that there is no informa tion on how technology and knowledge should be transferred. Thirdly, we believe that research for the benefit of the developing countries should be incorporated into an overall plan since conditions there must be taken into account. If I may give you an example, there is no point in developing wonder-drugs to cure tropical dis eases if the people there do not have the money to pay for them. There are many examples to show that sci ence has long since produced a solution, but the peo ple still cannot be helped because a treatment \u2014 for bilharziosis, for example, one of the main 'scourges' costs 5 EUA. For us this is a paltry sum, but for people in Egypt it is simply beyond their means. So what is the point, we ask, of intensifying our know ledge if the outcome is useless and is not incorporated into an overall plan. Information on how this is to be done does not feature in the Commission's document, ",
        "17.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/217 Schmid and as long as we are still in the dark about this we are not prepared to agree. I will give you a second example. It often happens in the developing countries that humans and animals must compete for food. It is an aspect of the prevailing social conditions, which no research in Europe can alter, that food is fed to animals instead of to humans. An expert from a German development aid society once expressed it like this, and with the President's approval I quote, 'the concern to fatten up the swine sometimes provides an astonishing contrast with the retarded growth and poor health of children in the same region'. This may be attributed to the fact that the second case will have no immediate economic effects, for it is well known that death counts for nothing in these countries. It is our opinion that if these social conditions exist, our research here cannot change them \u2014 there must be more to it. I should finally, Mr President, like to point out a few of our reservations as regards research. There is no information, Mr Commissioner, on how success is to be monitored. As it stands in the proposed text, the Commission will be monitoring itself. There can be no point in this \u2014 the official has yet to be discovered who will freely admit that he has done something wrong. We will never manage to invent him, even if we all try using the most up-to-date biotechnological methods, Mr Commissioner. Controls must be carried out by independent experts, which is not guaranteed as your proposals stand: This also applies to the mid-term assessment of the programme, which you suggest should be carried out after three of its four years. I have checked the calcu\u00ad lations, and according to the financial plan 'attached, you have already spent 87% and 92% of the funds for the two sectors \u2014 agriculture and medicine. Do you still intend to carry out a mid-term assessment for the sake of the remaining 10%. It only makes sense if this assessment is carried out after two years, when around half of the money has been spent. Finally, personnel and administration costs have been set far too high. The Commission wants four A posts, two \u0392 posts and four C posts \u2014 completely exagger\u00ad ated. It is also not clear why the administration of one part of the programme with 30 million EUA requires just as many staff as a part of the programme with 10 million EUA. You would have to supply an answer to all these technical aspects, quite apart from the fun\u00ad damental considerations, before we would be prepared to agree. President. \u2014 I call the Commission. Mr Pisani, Member of the Commission. \u2014 (FR) I should like to thank Mrs Rabbethge for her report \u2014 with which the Commission is largely in agreement \u2014 and I should like to be more precise about various important points before going on to discuss the philo\u00ad sophy behind this document that has been submitted to us. The proposal on the table represents only the first phase of what needs to be done. The Commission accepts the amendments to the draft decision that were submitted by the rapporteur on behalf of the Com\u00ad mittee on Development and as a result we will make sure that the amendments to our initial proposal \u2014 in accordance with Article 149 of the Treaty \u2014 appear in an amended proposal which we will submit to the Council. The only exception \u2014 and it is of minor importance, so I hope Parliament will accept it \u2014 con\u00ad cerns Article 1 a) of the draft decision. The Commis\u00ad sion considers that the general criteria on which the selection of projects must be based, can \u2014 following a declaration from the Commission \u2014 be incorporated in the report on the Council's decision and do not need to be put into a specific annex. I think that we are more or less all in agreement on this point. Where references in the report and in the motion for a resolution regarding the development of research in developing countries themselves are concerned, I undertake \u2014 on behalf of the Commission \u2014 to draw up a communication to the Council on this subject as soon as possible. This communication will take the most pertinent parts of the report and of the motion for a resolution discussed here today into account. With regard to the other amendments, I have abso\u00ad lutely no criticism to make regarding those submitted by Mr Jackson, but I cannot accept those submitted by the Socialist Group as they do not correspond to the objectives which we are seeking to attain with this pro\u00ad gramme. As for the questions raised by Mr Schmid a moment ago, firstly, I should say that he is mistaken about the total of the administrative costs; they are more like 5% than 15%. On the other hand, I concur whole\u00ad heartedly that an evaluation study of the impact of the programme should be commenced not in three years, but in two years' time, so that we can assess the pro\u00ad gramme's success before all the funds or nearly all of them have been committed. Having made those points, I should now like to tackle the main issue at stake. In recent years, we have been witnesses to dramatic changes in the role of research in the management of societies. Even quite recently still, research merely accompanied developments in society and was geared to meeting requirements as they arose. Subsequently, as research began to make use of models and scenarios, and as computers came into use \u2014 and they play a by no means insignificant role in this respect \u2014 research became a system and hence systematic. Nowadays, research tends to encompass ",
        "No 1-286/218 Debates of the European Parliament 17.6.82 Pisani the entire spectrum of knowledge available. Its pur pose is to pinpoint the areas within this spectrum which call for greater efforts and hence it is now an essential part of social, economic and strategic for ward-planning. As a result, having the capacity to keep tabs on the entire research system or, I should say, the entire system of knowledge at our disposal is becom ing one of the most vital things which governments need to conduct their affairs. Japan is the living exam ple of this. While not one single country in Europe has this capacity, if Europe as a whole were to draw on its diversity it could cover this entire spectrum and with coordinated efforts between countries and research centres could direct its forces where required on the most promising and the most tricky points. This would be feasible for Europe as a whole. I should now like to touch on the specific problem of research in developing countries. Firstly, I must point out that while it is true that the living standards, pro duction capacity and organizational abilities of devel oping countries are way behind those of developed countries, it is also true that the gap between the two is tending to increase because the percentage of income which developing countries can devote to research is much lower than ours, while their income itself is already a lot lower than ours. It is therefore essential, not to say vital for the future, given what I said on the first point, that developing countries are given the opportunity of carrying out research which can soon become independent research. But what we must ask ourselves right now is whether developing countries have the possibility of mobilizing the requisite financial resources, the ability and physi cal instruments needed for research, the organiza tional instruments, laboratories etc., and whether they are capable of mobilizing teams of workers, i.e. whether they already have enough researchers who are capable of setting up research units to tackle the situa tion facing them. Unfortunately, we have to admit that they do not. So we thought \u2014 and our proposal is based on this thought \u2014 that it would be good to involve European researchers in research on behalf of developing countries in such a way that Europe would use its capabilities and devote part of its resources to research on developing countries. It is surely obvious that, if Europe did not do this, the developing countries which are associated with it would not even be able to form the research teams who \u2014 one day \u2014 are going to enable them to catch up. It is therefore essential for Europe to step up its involvement in the future of developing countries \u2014 and this is the spirit behind our text \u2014 but at the same time Europe must help to provide developing countries with resources which will enable them to carry out independent research. If we were to believe that the proposal before you today constituted the entire research policy which Europe intended to devote to developing countries, then this would of course consti tute, in a way, a 'denial of justice' towards these coun tries, as they would never be able to catch up. So, in addition to the efforts already evoked here, we must also have the ability to help developing countries to build up their own research capacities and to gradu ally catch up with the industrialized world. But how does anyone think they are going to ever catch up unless we help them with our own research to become capable of so doing? For that to happen, a number of precautions need to be taken, a number of research teams and individual researchers will have to be invited into our laboratories and we must be prepared to accept the fact that these countries are going to develop their own research systems, with the risk that they will catch us up and even compete with us soon. This is the general philosophy behind this first text of ours and to the Socialist Group \u2014 who have submitted a large number of amendments \u2014 and to the rappor teur of the Committee on Energy and Research I should like to point out that if this document were to be the only one it would mean that we were running a large number of risks which are unacceptable. But I undertake to do my utmost to produce in the coming months a document, the precise purpose of which will be to increase the independent research capacities of developing countries. Initially, this would be drawn from our own research and at a later stage it is to be hoped that they will devise their research systems. It cannot be said that I am building castles in the air since, in the plans for combating hunger and the instrument which has been proposed to you as part of the additional budget for 1982, there is a line devoted to research in developing countries and for developing countries which shows that we are already taking act ion in this sector. I should like to close, Mr President, by explaining why we feel that independent research is so crucial. I could almost take as the basis of my argument a sen tence from the Sermon on the Mount, that sermon par excellence, when Christ said : 'You would not seek me if you had not already found me.' In reality, we do not know whether we are asking those who seek the real questions which have to be answered. When it is we who are asking ourselves what the needs of the Third World are, we are responding to our own concerns. Those who do not yet have their own research system are not capable of asking what their problems really are. That is why we will be fighting \u2014 believe me \u2014 at Parliament's side to make sure that research facilities can be developed in developing countries. I am therefore asking the Committee on Energy and Research and the Socialist Group to be good enough to accept this promise as a formal under taking on my part and hence to withdraw their reser vations and amendments. Having said that, I should ",
        "17.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/219 Pisani not like to conclude without having once again thanked Mrs Rabbethge, the rapporteur, and the Committee on Development, all of whom have devoted the attention warranted to this vital subject. (Applause) President. \u2014 I call the Socialist Group. Mrs Dury. \u2014 (FR) First of all, Mr President, I should like to make a comment about our working methods. Mrs Rabbethge's report is the outcome of a great deal of hard work. We laboured for months over this pro ject, but I really do feel that the working methods that we use here are a great hindrance to the actual work. For instance, Mr Rabbethge was obliged to present her report yesterday in a rush, we will be discussing it today and maybe we will vote on it tomorrow. We are always harping on about the fact that the European Parliament's activities are not publicized sufficiently in the press. I really do feel that if we want extremely vital projects of this type on which we are working to be publicized, we ought to change our working meth ods. That was just a preliminary remark. Now I should like to get to the heart of the matter. We have just heard Mr Pisani defend his programme. I am glad that he promised us that there would be other programmes and other viewpoints on research from the Commission. Nevertheless, it is on this current programme that we must give our opinion. To my mind, the dominating viewpoint behind this pro gramme is quite obviously one which regards Europe as the centre of things, since the basic aim is to finance research in our own countries rather than to base it on the priorities of developing countries. I regret having to point this out, but the Socialist Group thought that this needed to be emphasized. Four basic principles must be borne in mind when one is devising a research programme: firstly, all research must be conceived in accordance with priorities whose objectives truly contribute to solving the problems of underdevelopment. Secondly, all programmes ought to be designed and thought out to fit in with the needs expressed by the developing countries, themselves, independently of partisan interests and of economic and strategic calculations. Thirdly, I would say that such programmes should be carried out by developing countries themselves and should be assessed, not in accordance with our ciiteria, but in accordance with their own. Finally, I would add that any research pro gramme should take into account what is happening elsewhere in other international bodies and institu- I feel that there is nothing to be gained by trying to save ourselves the trouble of making a proper assess ment, since, if we do not, we are more likely to squan der what we have. The fact that the Commission has presented a report which does not take these principles sufficiently into account \u2014 and I think that Mrs Rab bethge's report did not play on this enough \u2014 makes me feel that, in the last analysis, underdevelopment is serving as a pretext for promoting research in our countries. Apart from that, the subtle distinction made by the Commission between strategic and adaptive research does not seem to me to justify the directions taken since all research which is motivated by reality and local requirements is bound to be adapted. Yesterday, we held a debate on hunger in the world and Mr Pisani himself underlined the importance of food crops but, in the programme he is now propos ing, it is suggested that commercial farming should also be encouraged in developing countries. There is even mention of manioc. But this means that the Euro pean Parliament is almost being schizophrenic; the Committee on External Economic Relations is in the process of studying a report on an agreement with Thailand which seeks to limit the importation of man ioc into our own countries. Yet, at the same time, another research programme is asking us to approve the promotion of manioc growing in developing coun tries. Whether we are talking about development stra tegy or whatever, I feel that we really must be consist ent at all times, not only on research but also where international trade with developing countries is con cerned, whether African or Asian countries. There is therefore an inconsistency here and I should like Mr Pisani to explain himself on this point. I do not wish to dwell at length on examples, but there are others to mention particularly where health is con cerned. Gastroenteritis, for instance, is an illness which severely afflicts children. We are not going to be able to solve this problem, however, by carrying out research on the origins of this disease in laboratories in our countries; it can only be solved by hydraulic engi neering, by drilling wells in developing countries and by promoting good hygiene rather than devising vast research programmes in our medical institutes. To sum up, research is just not a scientific question, it is a political one, and is a question of a model for development. The upshot of what the Socialist Group is saying to the Commission with the amendment it has tabled, is this : 'If you do not take account of our amendments, we will not be able to give you our endorsement on the budget'. This issue is so important that we feel we must be firm and demand consistent policies, whether we are talking about hunger in the world or research in developing countries. President. \u2014 I call the European Democratic Group. Mr C. Jackson. \u2014 Mr President, I can be brief in referring to the proposed programme of European ",
        "No 1-286/220 Debates of the European Parliament 17.6.82 Jackson research for development, but first I want to pay tri bute to Mrs Rabbethge's work as rapporteur: the report and the amended proposal are excellent, and in my group's view this programme can be a significant contribution to our efforts to help developing coun tries. I am particularly pleased that the committee accepted the Conservative amendments, in particular those making provision for competent research bodies in the Community to propose research and development pro jects themselves. This will add considerably to the practical impact and value of the programme, and I very much welcome the Commissioner's statement this afternoon in which he expressed the Commission's agreement. Let me now, however, repeat to our Socialist col leagues, with all respect to them, why their view is short-sighted and why this proposal is so important. Of course, in the long term, successful medical and agricultural research will be carried out throughout the less-developed countries. Indeed, there is already a UN programme providing 25 million dollars a year to boost medical research in the developing countries. But some fundamental research needs sophisticated resources which will not be available in developing countries for many years to come, and this is where Europe comes in. For example, the President of the Royal Society for Tropical Medicine and Hygiene in Britain told me the other day that work now being carried out in Europe could revolutionize the control of certain tropical diseases and provide field workers with powerful new weapons for fighting disease. Fun damental research includes and I apologize for being technical here but it is necessary \u2014 the systematic ana lysis of tropical parasites in terms of their genetics, enzymes and immunological defences, and the appli cation of new discoveries concerning their basic pro tein structure and the use of mono-clonal antibodies. In agriculture too some research requires high tech nology which simply cannot be established at present in most parts of the tropical world. This may sound technical, but the results may lead to the relief of untold suffering. Yet today, the recession and its budgetary consequences are seriously threaten ing research in Europe, which is of direct, immediate value to the Third World. I quote places at risk such as the London and Liverpool Schools of Tropical Medi cine and East Mailing, the world's premier crop research institute. Mr President, I hope that this report will be given overwhelming support by Parliament and, looking for ward, I ask the Council to agree the programme, which can be of such enormous help to the Third World, without delay. (Applause) President. \u2014 I call the Communist and Allies Group. Mr Veronesi. \u2014 (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentle men, the proposal for a Council decision on a scien tific and technical research and development pro gramme in order to benefit developing countries has given rise to heated discussions both within the rel evant committee and with the other committees whose opinion has been sought. To discuss these matters in a committed way is a very good thing since it shows we take our responsibilities seriously. On the other hand, I must admit that I have not man aged to understand the attitudes of some people who have fought over, rather than tackle, the issue at stake. The Italian Communists will be voting in favour of the Council draft decision, just as our members on the Committee on Energy and Research did. We feel that the proposals can be incorporated into a strategy for helping developing countries, a strategy whose over riding form was described yesterday by Mr Pisani in the most thorough and exhaustive way. Can it be said that the programme is ideal? I honestly do not think so. Mrs Rabbethge's report, which analy ses the proposals in detail and in depth, has revealed their limitations and drawbacks, while the motion for a resolution \u2014 which is well-reasoned and to the point \u2014 is capable of providing the stimulus for further measures and corrections when the programme is actually implemented. On the whole, however, I am convinced that the gen eral principle behind the proposal before us is a valid one. Nevertheless, I should like to make a few points. The programme is not without its merits, even though, if we compare it with similar activities like the FAO programme and the World Health Organization pro gramme, we can see that the picture of hunger and disease in the third and fourth worlds and the serious problems which still remain to be solved make other initiatives imperative and show that even greater efforts will have to be made in the future. The idea that research should involve collaboration with other scientific institutions in order to avoid duplication is without doubt a sound one. I do not think that it should be too difficult to find bases for profitable joint activities to meet the proposed aims. It is also important to involve the scientific institutes and workers \u2014 where they exist \u2014 of developing countries in implementing the programme. If we want \u2014 as Mr Pisani was saying yesterday \u2014 the popula tions of developing countries to become the protagon ists of their own emancipation, all that is necessary. This aspect must be assessed in relation to the individ ual parts of the programme. It seems to me that a policy of this kind cannot be con tained in a four-year plan; that is a contradiction in ",
        "17.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/221 Veronesi terms. Plans for the future need to be made if these activities are to be given adequate scope. Finally, Mr President, we agree with those who have said that the results should be widely publicized and that the priorities about what needs to be done should be chosen carefully. Summing up, I believe that it is our duty to translate our many declarations of principle into hard facts. This would be a definite sign of political good will towards Third World countries, even if we do not thereby manage to solve all the problems facing the populations of these countries. President. \u2014 I call the Liberal and Democratic Group. Mrs Scrivener. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, ladies and gen tlemen, from the debate we held on Mr Michel's report, it emerged that Third World countries suffer ing from hunger and malnutrition \u2014 which is the particular case of most countries in Africa \u2014 are only likely to achieve self-sufficiency in food if they man age to implement rapidly national food strategies based on land development, increased foodstuffs prod uction, and improvements in transport, marketing and storage facilities. Such strategies call for increased research, and technology which is adapted to the lives of ordinary people. Above all, it must be possible to introduce inexpensive improvements and to facilitate the maximum use of manpower in agriculture. Above all, such strategies presuppose a tremendous amount of training to provide an efficient technical and admin istrative setting for progress in the place where it is required. Thus it can be seen that training and research in both tropical agriculture and in medicine, health and nutri tion are indispensable accompaniments to any efficient plan to combat hunger in the world. I should, of course, like to pay tribute to Mrs Rab bethge for having emphasized in her report that just as much attention needed to be given to developing human potential as to the content of the research. Unfortunately, the Commission document does not have any mention anywhere of training of technicians in developing countries even though this would appear to be absolutely essential. Let me remind you that in December 1981, Parliament reiterated its commitment of 2 500 000 EUA from the general budget of the Community to be awarded over a period of several years to nationals of non-associated developing countries to enable them to undertake special occupational training in specialized institutes of either Member States or of developing countries, such training to be focused mainly on the management of agricultural and even industrial undertakings. This House also approved the disbursement of 400 000 EUA to assist specialized training institutes for their programmes to benefit nationals of develop ing countries. When you spoke to us at length just now, Mr Pisani, you said there would be a document. Perhaps this question of training will be taken up again at that point. By its act of approving these funds and in particular by committing them over a period of several years, it is obvious that this Parliament believes that training programmes are a vital long-term invest ment and are a by no means negligible part of any development policy. We are all aware that the educational needs of these countries are enormous. They are bound to increase as national food strategies are worked out. Training out side the school system \u2014 whether on the site or as part of technical assistance schemes \u2014 encompasses a vast range of activities which, to a certain extent, depend on us for inspiration and may range from linking work and training to classes on nutrition given to mothers in baby clinics. That is why I believe that the time is right for changing our general approach to these problems. This aspect has been totally ignored in research and development programmes submitted to us. Fortun ately, however, the budget which we approved in 1981 should enable us to make up for this shortcoming somewhat by stepping up training schemes to benefit nationals of developing countries, whether or not such countries are associated to the Community. For we must surely all be aware that we will not get very far unless we train the human beings concerned. President. \u2014 I call Mr Pearce. Mr Pearce. \u2014 I would like to use this opportunity, Mr President, to compliment Mrs Rabbethge on her report and to draw attention yet again to the question of schools of tropical medicine. Mr Jackson referred to the London School and the Liverpool School in his speech a few moments ago. I would like to amplify this. I am talking more about the Liverpool one than the London one because it is nearer to where I live. This school is an established centre of research and knowledge on matters of tropical medicine. It has a high standard of knowledge and technology; it is linked in with the university in the area, which means that its standards are those obtaining in the United Kingdom; it is experienced in the field since a long time ago; it has relations with similar institutions in other Member States, and in particular, with the Trop ical Institute in Hamburg. The present economic situation has brought about dif ficulties which means that some of the work concern ing the care of children in the tropics and also, indeed, on the problems of purifying water in the tropics, is at risk. We would like to see support from the Com munity for this effort. That support could come from ",
        "No 1-286/222 Debates of the European Parliament 17.6.82 Pearce projects financed under the EDF, but whatever is done in the field, on the basis of projects, also needs support from back home to keep standards up, to keep research forging ahead. I believe that this is one of the useful and practical and immediate benefits that could come from the adoption of the course of action which Mrs Rabbethge has proposed and I am therefore very happy to support her report and to ask that the work of these two schools of tropical medicine, London and Liverpool, should benefit from the result of her report. President. \u2014 I call Mr Sherlock. Mr Sherlock. \u2014 It seems that in the European Demo cratic Group we are having a little more than our share but I do assure you that we feel very deeply about this matter. If the father of European medicine had been rewriting today, he would have said that the art is long and life is short, judgment difficult, experience fallacious and he would have added equipment and staff are very expensive too. He would have added, I am quite sure, that medical research and medicine are one topic \u2014 tropical medicine is not isolatable from other medical research. This is why in the first instance, Mrs Dury, research in medicine, which includes research in tropi cal medicine, is better conducted for the most part while world resources are concentrated in the present centres of excellence. My group spokesman has already drawn attention to some of the intensely complicated research and I would underline that it is research in medicine in gen eral that sometimes produces spin-off results in tropi cal medicine. I welcome the wider recommendations made by Mrs Rabbethge. I welcome especially the promise that Commissioner Pisani has given us this afternoon of increased, wider and better funded continuing research in this field, where the benefits will be immense. I would have said a little while ago until the all-pervading Committee on Women's Rights had exerted its influence upon even me, that this was a workmanlike report. It now has, of course, to be a 'workpersonlike' report, which is not quite as nice in English but. Mrs Rabbethge, my deepest congratula tions on a study that will stay in my bookcase as well as, I hope, our working committees for a very long time. (Applause) President. \u2014 I call the Commission. point out to Mrs Dury that in life as in political strug gles, consistency is not an edifice which can be drawn in order to be constructed afterwards. No, consistency means continuous attempts at correction and incor poration. That is exactly what we have proposed. I should like to ask Mrs Dury the following question : what would have happened if this report had not been drawn up, if Europe, too busy creating its own research system or trying to do so, had not even con sidered the question of developing countries? In that case, the issue would not even have been raised and Europe would have selfishly gone on developing its own research system. In fact, while continuing to develop our own research system, we in Europe have taken the initial step of say ing: 'we cannot devise a scheme for research focused on Europe which is not at the same time open to the Third World.' What is more, having opened European research to the problems of development, Europe is going to help the Third World to work out its own system of development. A beginning to this can be found in the supplementary budget before us. Other documents will be submitted to you containing attempts at identifying ways of developing research systems in the Third World as such so that researchers in those countries can gradually become the enthusias tic and demanding partners of European researchers. That is the logic governing our actions. We are defin ing our intentions which are to open our facilities to the outside world. But this opening to the outside world is not enough. We will be aiding Third World countries to develop their own research facilities. To Mr Veronesi I should like to say that ACP experts will be associated with the management committees of our own research system. To Mrs Scrivener, I should like to say that it is of course essential for European centres, laboratories and schools to be able to welcome into their midst researchers, trainee researchers or experts from Third World countries so that they can undergo technologi cal and practical training. These activities come under the budget of the Commissioner responsible for development policy. These funds will be deployed. But \u2014 I repeat \u2014 you will only be able to make your minds up about the structure of the system we are pro posing when, in a few months' time, the second phase \u2014 just as important as the first \u2014 will be revealed to you. This second phase will involve creating the means for Third World countries to achieve their own scien tific development. Mr Pisani, Member of the Commission. \u2014 (FR) The point which will have struck the Commission most was Mrs Duty's appeal for consistency. I should like to President. \u2014 The debate is closed. The motion for a resolution will be put to the vote at the next voting time. ",
        "17.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/223 11. Programme on the environment President. \u2014 The next item is the report (Doc. 1-219/ 82), drawn up by Mr Alber on behalf of the Com mittee on the Environment, Public Health and Con sumer Protection, on the proposal from the Commission to the Council (Doc. 1-793/81 COM(81) 626 final) for a draft action programme of the European Communities on the environment. I call the rapporteur. Mr Alber, rapporteur. \u2014 (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have before us today the third Community action programme on the environment. Since 1972, the European Community, has devoted a very great deal of attention to questions relating to the environment, and I should like, right at the outset, to express my very sincere thanks to the Commission and to all the other parties concerned for everything that has been achieved so far. It seems to me that, in a debate which tends to be characterized by moaning and criticizing, we hear too little in the way of appre ciation, and for that reason I should like to say once again that thanks are due to all those who are taking an active and practical part in environmental issues. We are especially pleased that the idea of environmen tal protection has gained increasing acceptance. We began by merely endeavouring to put right damage that had already been done; in other words, we were doing no more than reacting to faits accomplis. The next stage was to introduce preventive planning so that the damage would not be done in the first place. We are therefore all the more pleased that we have now reached a third stage whereby environmental consid erations are taken into account at the planning stage of all policy decisions. However, if our efforts are to bear fruit, we must work out a coherent environmental strategy. That is something we called for in the report on the state of environmental protection work in the Community, and we are very pleased that the Commission has taken up the idea of an environmental strategy in its programme. It is important to leave emotional issues aside in this matter. Nothing would be more damaging to the cause of environmental protection than to seek to make it a vehicle for ideologies, a means of disrupt ing State affairs, as is unfortunately the aim of certain people who purport to be concerned about environ mental issues. Nor has environmental protection anything to do with nostalgia. However sorry we may be at its passing, the era of the idyllic garden populated by garden gnomes has now passed. Some of my neighbours are always complaining that our wild plants are dying out, but they themselves go round with their lawnmowers every second day chopping down everything growing around their houses. I also believe that environmental protection begins at home. It has nothing to do with the kind of nostalgia evoked by a graffiti artist in London once, who sprayed on a wall the legend Remember the good old days, when air was clean and sex was dirty. That may have been so once, but I think things have changed in the meantime. We must view the whole issue of environmental pro tection in the context of the conflict of interests between economic development on the one hand and ecological constraints on the other. We shall only be in a position to do something positive about protecting the environment if we can manage to overcome this conflict, which means that our strategy must be backed up by whatever instruments are necessary. However, before we have recourse to inflexible legal bans and requirements, I feel we should devote our attention first and foremost to market instruments and the like. We can only do that, though, if we have first of all carried out a thorough review of the situation and if we have taken a political decision as to whether or not we are in favour of nuclear energy, what kind of growth we want to see or what form cost-benefit ana lysis should take. I believe that many organizations which regard environmental protection as a priority issue do not unfortunately have the requisite political courage to come down clearly on these vital issues. In considering this programme, we must bear in mind that we have perhaps so far paid too little attention to our natural environment and concentrated overmuch on the human aspect. We have been talking about clean water and clean air, but always from the point of view of man and what benefits he can derive from environmental protection. We should, however, see the natural aspect too. Wild plants, for instance, have just as much right to grow and thrive. We must ensure that devastated areas are restored as far and as quickly as possible on the grounds that these are oases which will, in the final analysis, be to the benefit of human beings too. It is especially incumbent upon us as Europeans to devote special attention to the various aspects of trans-frontier pollution. We are at the moment con cerned about the problem of acid rain, which is des troying our woodland. We also have experience of the problem of trans-frontier pollution and nuisances. Even on the small scale of one's own back garden, it is unfortunately accepted practice to put your compost heap right up against the neighbour's fence. On a national level, though, this kind of thing must not get out of hand, as otherwise it would result in the kind of nuisance that no one can reasonably be expected to tolerate. All too often, environmental policy is a mat- ",
        "No 1-286/224 Debates of the European Parliament 17.6. 82 Alber ter of putting right what has already gone wrong, and that is something we must get away from. We have also taken into account the North Sea and the Mediterranean in other words, the question of water pollution. We intend to make no specific propos als here, although we have criticized the fact that the environment programme does not contain any such proposals, or at least not many. The Commission takes the view that this should not be done, particularly at a time of economic recession. We take the opposite view; we are absolutely sure that environmental pro tection will always be an essential issue regardless of the prevailing economic situation. The only reason why we have put forward no specific proposals is because we do not think Parliament should perform administrative duties. It is up to the Commission to flesh out its action programme, because otherwise it is not worthy of the name. And it is only by including such activities that we can truly speak of an independent environment policy. Only then does the environment enjoy the same status as other basic aspects of our social being, like progress, growth, liberty and security. I believe it is incumbent on us to bestow the same status on environmental pro tection policy. (Applause) President. \u2014 I call the Socialist Group. Mr Collins. \u2014 Mr President, it is now nearly 10 years since the Community first embarked on the develop ment of an environment policy. It is easy to see that we have made some progress in those 10 years. Unfortun ately, I think, there is also a temptation to feel that the environment is now just another part of the political scenery. There is a danger that we become just a little bit complacent. We have done it all. We have an envi ronment policy, and all is well. However, although the Socialist Group welcomes this report and the Commission's proposals, I am afraid that we have to make it clear that we are very careful to recognize that we must not overstate the case. While the Commission can rest content that its envi ronment policy has produced important results in a short period, I doubt very much if we can seriously claim that the word 'substantial' can be applied to the results, because if we look at the machinery that we have for monitoring the implementation of policy in the Community, then we have to admit that it is noto riously uneven across the whole of Europe. It is very difficult to be precise therefore about the results that we have actually achieved. Having said that, there is no doubt in the Socialist Group's collective mind that there is a need for a Community environment policy. The Socialist Group recognizes that we have to have a common approach to a rational management of the earth's resources and that we have to use this as the basis of an improvement in the living conditions of the people of the European Community. We are absolutely behind the Commis sion in its work in this respect. We Socialists are con cerned with the quality of life and not just the quantity of production and consumption. So far as we are con cerned, production should be very firmly in the service of man and not man in the alienated service of pro duction. That is an important political point to make ? and while I accept Mr Alber's dictum that the environ ment is too important to be making small political affrays into it, none the less I think it is very important that we reconize where our priorities actually are. We welcome the changes brought about in the 10 years in which the Community has been active in this. We are very happy to welcome the new concern with the appropriate scale for Community action. We would also like to see the Commission being very careful indeed that it introduces legislation into the Council and Parliament only where it considers very seriously that this is a matter for European concern and not a matter that can be handled either at local level or by, for example, the United Nations. Secondly, we are very happy that there is a recognition that environment policy is not just negative and reac tive but actually has a creative role and may in fact create jobs, create employment and so act as a valuable tool in the shaping of our economic policy. Thirdly, we are very happy to note that the Commission sees a continuing need for education. For our part we feel that it is very important that we should tell the public, tell the citizens of Europe, of the Community's involvement in environment policy, because frankly I think that that is not always very clear at the moment. Fourthly, we are happy to endorse the continued ac tion on water and air pollution: we are very happy indeed to back that. Most of all, I think, we are very happy to recognize that the Commission is now in a position to say that it wants to extend environment policy and incorporate it into other areas of Community policy such as indus try, agriculture and development and cooperation. I think that is very, very important indeed, and we are very happy to note that the Commission intends to have internal discussions to see how the linkages can be made. In other words we welcome the realization that the environment is, in a way, indivisible, we recognize that it is a political issue that is central to all that we do. It is not a simple problem and, of course, it is certainly not an exercise in looking forward, in plan ning for our own future. Mr President, I would like to draw attention to one or two of the amendments. First of all, there are two cor rections I would like to make. Amendment No 9 from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection is exactly the same as ",
        "17.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/225 Collins Amendment No 36 from the Socialist Group. Secondly, in Amendment No 28 we should be refer ring to groundwater and not freshwater. Freshwater is mentioned at one point and groundwater at another, but in fact it should refer to groundwater all the way through. The Socialist Group amendments are designed, like some of the committee amendments, to tighten up on the Commission's proposals. It is an action pro gramme, as Mr Alber has said, and if it is an action programme, then we have to be reasonably specific. Reading the proposals we find that they are a bit gen eral and that they need to be tightened up. So the Socialist Group's amendments refer first of all to the need to restore and reintroduce species that have sometimes disappeared. They reaffirm the need to recognize the importance of scale in developing envi ronment policy. We recognize the need for prevention as being much better than cure and we recognize the importance of informing the public of EEC involve ment in environment policy. We would like the Com mission to have clearer contact with the EFTA coun tries, particularly in relation to the Stockholm Con vention which actually refers to the need to conserve living natural resources and measure that against economic development. We make quite specific suggestions about water quality comparisons, and in Amendment No 47 by Mr Wagner there is a particular reference to the importance of border areas. We com ment these amendments therefore to the House. Finally and in conclusion, Mr President, the Socialist Group reaffirms its concern for the rational planned use of resources. The Socialist Group reafirms its con cern for the quality of life as a priority in the Com munity and its concern that every citizen and every worker be given the right to a clean, healthy, rich and diverse living environment. We support this report therefore. We gave our approval to the Commission. We congratulate the rapporteur and his efforts in this field. IN THE CHAIR: MR POUL M\u00d8LLER Vice-President President. \u2014 I call the Group of the European Peo ple's Party (Christian-Democratic Group). Mrs Schleicher. \u2014 (DE) I should like to thank our rapporteur, Mr Alber, very much for his careful work. Only last year, he produced an interim report on the stock-taking exercise on environmental policy in the European Community; in so doing, he made a highly valuable contribution which, I am sure, acted as a basis for the points covered in the third action programme. On behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, I should like to welcome this action programme of the European Communities on the environment, and at the same time express my appreciation of the previous two programmes and for all the work that has been put in so far. The Group of the European Peo ple's Party attaches great importance to concentrating on certain of the many measures which need to be taken in the interests of environmental protection. In other words, our entire environmental policy must concentrate on certain activities to ensure that devel opments are pushed in the right direction over the long term. We therefore reject certain amendments which would distract our attention from the main tasks ahead, which would smother any active policy and create the impression that nothing was being done at all. In presenting the third action programme, the Com mission and the Member of the Commission responsi ble, Mr Narjes, have shown that they are taking their duties in the field of environmental protection ser iously. But the fact is that any initiative taken by the Commission and any activity on the part of the Euro pean Parliament are bound to come to nought unless the Council at last behaves logically in the field of environmental protection. No matter how fine the words we hear from our 10 governments, it is all no more than hot air unless they are matched by political decisions. My group therefore has a basic demand to put to the Council, which is that it should at long last do something about air pollution. Just to give you one example, the Council has still not managed \u2014 after close on 10 years \u2014 to stipulate quality criteria for the amount of lead in the air. It is precisely in connection with environmental policy that we are often confronted with conflicts of interest vis-\u00e0-vis other policies. It is therefore up to the Coun cil to refrain from putting off decisions as regards environmental policy and to take the necessary politi cal decisions \u2014 especially where a conflict of interests exists \u2014 to enable us to put the land at our disposal to good use and avert harm to the population in general. My group takes the view that the conflict of interests between economic and environmental considerations can be solved by way of the market economy once environmental protection is made economically attrac tive. A second demand we have to put to the Council is that, once a political decision has been taken, it must be followed through to its logical conclusion. One depressing example of how not to go about things is the decisions taken by the European Council in Venice in 1981 on energy policy. As you will know, these decisions were taken in the light of the oil crisis, but the fact is that no country since then has complied ",
        "No 1-286/226 Debates of the European Parliament 17.6. 82 Schleicher with the decision taken to develop nuclear energy resources. Given that any source of energy is fraught with certain risks, we must do everything in our power to ensure that the general risks are kept as slight as possible. There can be no doubt that the problem of acid rain destroying our woodland would not be so serious if the Council had matched its political deci sions with action. The final point I should like to make is addressed once again to the Commission. Certain ecologically damag ing factors deteriorate very rapidly, and the European Community cannot afford to act in isolation if the tide is to be turned. I would therefore ask the Commission to consider, in concluding or negotiating agreements with entities like the Eastern Bloc or the countries of the Third World, to what extent environmental aspects can be taken into account to enable us to pro tect the world population from what are already obvious damaging factors. (Applause) President. \u2014 I call the European Democratic Group. Mr Johnson. \u2014 Mr President, on behalf of the Euro pean Democratic Group I too welcome this third act ion programme by the Commission. I think it does indeed, as previous speakers have said, take the Com munity's environment policy a stage further. In the few minutes that I have I want to draw the Commission's attention particularly to some points which we think are of outstanding importance. Amendment No 1 is not an amendment to the action programme itself but to the resolution which the Council will adopt when it approves the action pro gramme. We ask the Council to give an undertaking that it will make available to the Commission the per sonnel and material resources necessary for the imple mentation of the programme, in particular through the Environment Fund called for in Mr Alber's report which the European Parliament adopted on 20 No vember. I deliberately at this point raise the question of the Environment Fund. As you know, Mr President, it is something which this Parliament, and particularly the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, has been pressing for for some time, and we have had some success. In the 1982 budget, there are five lines \u2014 6610 to 6614 \u2014 which, taken together, relate to the Environment Fund, and in the draft 1983 budget, the amounts concerned add up to approximately 5 million units of account. We are most concerned now, though, that the Commission should capitalize on this and produce the draft regula tions necessary for the Environment Fund, because this is the only way in which we shall get any flesh upon this framework. Items in the budget are one thing, but we must have the detailed regulations. I would ask the Commissioner to take this very se riously and produce this year the necessary regula tions, so that we can build up this item. Mr President, there are some points in the document which we have felt particularly needed to be stressed. On the whole we like its tendency. We wanted to make some of the points a little more specific, and I will mention two or three of them as I go. Amendment No 20 calls on the Commission to come forward with comprehensive studies on the whole question of the exhausts of automobiles. Our amend ment relates not merely to the antipollution devices on motor cars : we also want the Commission to study the question of fuels. In particular, of course, we have in mind the possibility of moving, in the long term, towards fuels which have less polluting characteristics. Amendment No 23 is important. Other speakers have stressed the new emphasis on nature conservation. It is one of the items which figure prominently in the Envi ronment Fund proposals. We support this emphasis on the monitoring or banning of trade in endangered spe cies, and our amendment suggests adding the words 'in goods or products derived from these species'. We believe this is of great importance, and we hope the Commission will recognize this too. In this connection, I approve of Amendment No 39, which would introduce into this environment pro gramme a position which the Commission has already taken in a written reply to Mr Muntingh. That is that where there is a real danger to plant and animal spe cies, an overwhelming danger, then we have to con sider the question of these species having a priority over certain economie and trade requirements. The Commission has already adopted this position as I say, in a written answer, but it is good to have it down in the text of a programme. It is very\u00b7 much the philoso phy of the International Convention for trade in endangered species, and I want to see it written in here as well. There are a few really important matters which are rather topical as well. Amendment No 27 relates to the whole question of the Antarctic. The Antarctic is of course topical because of the Falklands crisis. Every body knows that people have their eyes on the Antarc tic. There is now in New Zealand a meeting in pro gress on the exploitation of mineral resources in the Antarctic I think it is very important that the Commis sion, which has already, as you know, acceded to the Convention on the protection of the marine living resources of Antarctica \u2014 the Southern Ocean Con vention \u2014 should now also use its diplomatic influ ence to join the Antarctica Treaty itself. I am con cerned that without the moderating power of the European Community, we may see a random and uncontrolled exploitation in Antarctica which would, I think, be very detrimental to the world. This is a ",
        "17.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/227 Johnson chance to preserve as it is, or at least much as it is, the world's last great wilderness, and I hope we shall find a way for the Community as such to participate in what is now going on within the framework of the Antarctic Treaty. Much the same applies to the Law of the Sea. We recently had the debacle in New York with the Law of the Sea Conference. We now almost have a free-for- all, with Member States of the Community having, as it were, abstained. Let them please reconsider their position. Let them above all come forward now with a Community regime for the deep-sea bed which will protect environmental requirements. I congratulate the Commission on this document. I hope the Council on 24 June will not finally adopt it, but will discuss it and give detailed consideration over the next two or three months to the amendments we have proposed. (Applause) President. \u2014 I call the Liberal and Democratic Group. Mr Maher. \u2014 My compliments to the Commission and my congratulation to the rapporteur, Mr Alber. However, I do have a criticism to make and perhaps I should start with it. We all know that man, of course, is the great polluter and for that reason I am disap pointed that neither in the Third Directive nor in Mr Alber's proposals has any real attention been given to education, particularly of the young, to enable them to appreciate the environment in which they live: a clean environment with clean air, clean water, clean soil, good food, safe products, etc. Frankly, unless we can educate our young people in particular to be more appreciative and more sensitive and more conscious, it will be exceedingly difficult in future to ensure that there is an adequate and suitable environment avail able to enable us to lead full and happy lives. I would like to pose a question to the Commission at this stage. Do they intend to take any action in this regard at European level. Perhaps to reach out to the schools in our member countries with a programme which would in fact high light the importance of the environment for the future? Frankly if we have to rely upon the policeman or the army to ensure that we are sensible about how we use this earth on which we live, then we are in a sad state indeed. We have go to convince the Com munity generally \u2014 that is the peoples of our various member countries \u2014 that the environment is in their hands, that they have to battle against pollution. I would like to pose that question to the Commission and I would look for an answer from them whether the propose to take any action in this particular field. Being a farmer, Mr President, I am of course very conscious of the environment and always have been. I believe farmers generally are. But farmers frequently have problems. There is a constant battle to get higher output because many people say that food is too expensive, that the price should be kept down. So farmers desperately battle to increase production so as to maintain living standards. Frequently they use, per haps unknowingly from time to time, certain materials which may not be 100% safe. In that regard I think there is a need indeed to look very critically at com mercial companies who manufacture agricultural substances like pesticides and crop protection, animal protection medicines and so on, to ensure that they are in fact safe before they are put into general use. Frequently people like farmers are the subject of high-pressure salesmanship to convince them that by using such and such a product they can increase prod uction by 50% or 70% as the case may be, without making known to them what th\u00e8 damaging side effects may be. I think there is a need to take account of that, to ensure that these commercial organizations cannot make quick money just by using the media and adver tising campaigns in order to sell their products because they are interested in making money without much reference to the health of the people generally who have to use the products on which these particular materials are used. Mr President, I would like to make a brief comment on the question of forestry since it is so closely allied to agriculture and important in the context of our rural regions. I am disappointed that we have made no progress so far in relation to reafforestation. I think there is no question that there are many regions in our Community where more trees would help to improve the environment. It could help to make those regions more habitable for people by enabling them to live in a clean and healthy environment. But yet no progress has been made in that particular area so far as the Community is concerned. That certainly is not desira ble. Of course I have to mention in passing that there is a very important economic advantage also from the existence of a forestry policy. Could I mention something else, Mr President. Much of the pollution caused by the ordinary individual, much of the damage to the environment, comes from the materials he uses. I am always appalled by the fact that I can hardly buy a spanner anymore unless it is wrapped in plastic. Now I do not mind having food wrapped in plastic because it is important to keep food clean; but why wrap a spanner in plastic? That plastic has got to be disposed of! Of course very often it pol lutes and there is a whole range of products where in fact we could go back to the old ways and sell them in their naked shape. After all, you cannot damage a spanner very easily, so why wrap it in plastic. A few nails \u2014 you cannot buy them any more without their ",
        "No 1-286/228 Debates of the European Parliament 17.6.82 Maher being wrapped in plastic. Mr President, I think we could make some progress in that particular way. (Applause) President. \u2014 I call the Non-attached Members. Mr Eisma. \u2014 (NL) Mr President, in the short time allowed me I should like to concentrate on two sec tions of the action programme: trans-frontier pollu tion, on which a number of my amendments have been approved by the committee \u2014 I would mention among others Amendment 18 \u2014 and the resources for implementing the programme. First of all, however, I should like to compliment my colleague Mr Alber on his report. We are very grateful to him for coming out so clearly in favour of our proposals for a regulation on trans-frontier environmental effects. With reference to Amendment 18, I believe that gen eral regulations on trans-frontier pollution are urgently required. They will need to contain a number of rules of practical and procedural application to be enforced in every situation where trans-frontier pollu tion is threatened. Some have already been drawn up by the OECD and by the UN. Amendment 18 aims to formulate these matters at a European level. There are, admittedly, a number of Directives \u2014 I am think ing here of the Seveso Directive and the report on environmental effects, which contain clauses on infor mation and consultation \u2014 but these vary greatly and are very inadequate. In addition, these Directives only cover an extremely narrow section of the trans-fron tier pollution problem, and this has led us to think of asking the Commission to draw up a framework Directive containing a number of concrete regulations. And a basic principle for cases of trans-frontier dam age, and a number of procedural regulations guaran teeing equal legal rights for individuals and action groups on both sides of the border. So, unlike the fragmentary approach of the Commission policy up to now, this would be a comprehensive code for trans frontier environmental problems. Amendment 18 calls on the Commission to implement a proposal of this nature and we should like to know whether the Commission is prepared to change its policy on this question. Point 14 of the draft action programme mentions envi ronmental education in schools. What have we actu ally discovered in our network of sample schools? Has the Committee on Education been consulted on the matter, or are there plans to do so, as on the subject of information for consumer information? This would be in accordance with the Council Resolution of 9 Febru ary 1976 in which the preparation of Council resolu tions on future developments in education was expressly assigned to the Committee on Education. This is, then a question for the Commission. Mr President, I should like to end by commenting on the financial feasibility of this programme. I should first of all like to say in connection with this that we can make more efficient use of manpower and finan cial resources by cooperating with the Council of Europe. It is in the sphere of nature and the protection of the countryside, on which a number of amendments have been proposed, and in restoring stocks of wild animals and plants, that the Council of Europe has already achieved a great deal, and it would be unne cessarily wasteful to carry out our own separate assess ment ignoring one which already exists elsewhere. What I would like to say is this: the Commission can set up a fine action programme and Parliament can add a number of requests, but if the necessary financial resources and staff are not made available, the our efforts will have been in vain. The Directorate-General concerned simply does not have the capacity to carry out the various aspects of the environmental policy adequately, let alone to put new plans into action. In its Resolution of 20 November last year, Parliament requested the setting up of an Environmental Fund as a structural means of covering up the lack of personnel and financial resources. We wholeheartedly reiterate this request. President. \u2014 I call the Socialist Group. Mr Muntingh. \u2014 (NL) The third environmental ac tion programme is to be the starting point of the Com munity's environmental policy for the next four to five years. So it constitutes an extremely important element of this policy, and we have studied it very closely. We have reached the conclusion that, except for a few flaws which we have attempted to put right with a number of amendments, it is a good programme. If all of its plans are realized, we shall end up in a Utopian situation. What fun to see our colleagues in that Uto pia, Mr Sherlock and Mrs Scrivener for example, or Mr Mertens and Mrs Schleicher, or Mr Johnson and Mrs Lenz, or perhaps Mrs Squarcialupi and Mr Berk- houwer, dancing to Commissioner Narjes' tune. However, I fear reality will be somewhat different, as the forbidden fruit is, at it were, piled high and those involved are already gorging themselves on their way to this earthly paradise. The Commission, for example, which drew up this programme, this passport to para dise, seems to have no intention of making sufficient personnel available to enable the programme to be car ried out adequately. This means that it is making a laughing stock of itself, Parliament and everyone who desperately hopes that at last something is really going to be done about these terrible environmental prob lems, and it is fobbing them off with a programme which amounts to a load of hot air. The Council is soon to adopt this programme, includ ing, we would like to expect, our amendments, but it ",
        "17.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/229 Muntingh seems to have no intention of making adequate funds available for it. If this is the case then we are all beat ing our heads against a brick wall, and, like the pro verbial donkey, running after a magnificent carrot that we shall never have. And finally the Member States, who, together with the Commission, would have to implement the programme, seem to have no inclina tion for any form of cooperation, but rather the con trary. Directives acopted years ago for example, have still not been incorporated into the Member States' legislation. Regulations are not being enforced and the public, the electorate is being kept in the dark. A regrettable example of this is the idea put forward by the French Minister, M. Crepeau, a socialist I regret to say, that the hunting of turtle doves should be realized again, which is totally against the Directive on birds. If we in the European Community cannot keep our own house in order as far as the environment is con cerned, what can we expect when we come to carry out the last point of the action programme, dealing with cooperation with developing countries? My group, I must point out, is very pleased and grateful to offer its complete support to the Commission for being prepared to include this point. But how can we make a serious attempt to get to grips with the huge problem of the total destruction of large areas of the Third World, if we ourselves are not prepared to put our own excellent plans into operation? Mr President, you will have gathered by now that I am pessimistic, and that on the very day when I should be happy, since the third environmental action pro gramme in itself, and certainly if Parliament's pro posed amendments are adopted, is a cause for satisfac tion, and something which calls for our cooperation and for our wholehearted efforts. But whether a di vided Commission, and indecisive and impotent Coun cil and the nationalist governments of the Member States actually give us the opportunity to make these efforts, is a question which, I am afraid, gives me no cause for optimism. President. \u2014 I call Mr Gerokostopoulos. tic both as regards the consolidation of the satisfactory results achieved to date by Community policy in this area and as regards the intensity of the future action which is called for. This optimism is justified by the fact that there are many positive elements in the pro posed action programme. I feel it is both necessary and useful to draw your attention to some of these ele ments which are bound to be regarded as encouraging. Firstly, the announced introduction of a policy of prevention and the abandoning of the policy pursued so far, which sought mainly to repair damage already done to the environment. Secondly, the insistence on the 'polluter pays' princi ple, to which particular importance should be attached by the governments of the Member States. Thirdly, the stressing of the need to provide special protection for the Mediterranean, which is terribly at risk, and to do so as part of the overall Mediterranean policy which is being set up. Despite the positive points which I have quoted by way of example, there are at the same time others which might be described either as negative or as omissions. Time does not permit me to deal with them in detail, particularly since this is done in the report by the Committee on the Environment and since the points were also referred to in Mrs Schleicher's speech. However, it would be an omission on my part, let it be stressed,, not to praise the work of the mem bers of the committee, and especially that of its rap porteur, Mr Alber, who deserve to be congratulated on the serious and painstaking way in which they drew up their report. With the corresponding motion for a resolution and the amendments to the Commission's texts, the members of the Committee on the Environ ments have made a successful attempt to fill in the gaps and eliminate the shortcomings in the draft action programme and also to improve its scope. For the information of the House, special mention should be made of some of these \u2014 in my opinion \u2014 useful and important amendments. I consider the following to be so. Mr Gerokostopoulos. \u2014 (GR) Mr President, the texts before the House are encouraging because they con stitute further proof that all the Community bodies have correctly grasped how important and wide-rang ing the problem of the environment is. It is a problem which concerns not only the protection of human health and of man's immediate environment but also the measures which are essential for the social and economic development of the Community. In the light of these considerations, special emphasis should be given to the Commission's initiative in setting up the action programme on the environment funds for the period 1982-86. The proposals contained in its rel evant communication to the Council enable us \u2014 unlike what the previous speaker said \u2014 to be optimis- Firstly, the addition to the proposed Council resolu tion. The purpose of this is, as Mr Johnson has stressed, to get the Council to provide more personnel and financial resources for the implementation of the action programme. At the same time, there is a propos al for a decisive measure by setting up the appropriate financial bodies \u2014 environment funds, for example \u2014 which were proposed in the Parliament Resolution of 20 November based on the report by Mr Alber. Secondly, the addition to the second paragraph of point 6 of the proposed programme. It seeks to avoid the risk of the continuation of the environment policy being dependent on the development of the economic situation in the Community. ",
        "No 1-286/230 Debates of the European Parliament 17.6.82 Gerokostopoulos Thirdly, the addition to the second paragraph of point 14 of the programme, which provides for the continuation of financial support for non-governmen tal organizations which work in the environmental field and make a really considerable contribution to environmental protection. Fourthly, the edition to point 21, which r\u00e9fers to the need to study measures to eliminate pollution from the exhaust fumes of new cars. I hope, Mr President, that the Council and the Com mission will adopt the suggestions and approve the Committee on the Environment's amendments, which seek to make the proposed action programme more effective. In conclusion I should like, if I may, to repeat and stress, as did the committee and its rappor teur, Mr Alber, that unless there is an increase in financial resources and personnel, the action pro gramme will not go beyond the stage of pious wishes. (Applause) President. \u2014 I call Mr Papefstratiou. Mr Papaefstratiou. \u2014 (GR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is to our Parliament's credit that it takes such a lively interest in questions of environmental protection. We must all recognize our obligations towards future generations, since there are extremely grave risks to the very survival of the human race if one considers that in the last 40 years mankind, acting with carelessness, thoughtlessnes and superficiality rather than with malice, has done more to destroy the environment than in the previous 2 000 years of human history. We therefore welcome with satisfaction the compre hensive nature of the report drawn up by Mr Alber on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, and we expect it to meet with Parliament's very broad accept ance. In my opinion the following are among the most inter esting approaches from the practical point of view. When it comes to adopting measures, where will the main emphasis have to be placed, on prevention or on suppression? Hitherto suppression has had the lion's share, but this has proved to be the wrong policy. We consider that most attention should be paid to prevention, without of course neglecting the necessary measures of sup pression either. Another point is the effective implementation of the appropriate legislative measures, since there is no doubt that the legislation in all the countries, at least of our Community, has been considerably improved in recent years. I am basically in favour of the very strict application of penalties \u2014 and possibly not only in the form of fines \u2014 since, ladies and gentlemen, while we take it for granted that those guilty of common crimes must be punished by imprisonment, why not think in terms of similar punishments for those who commit crimes against the environment in which we live and who deprive present and future generations of the means and quality of life? Catalogues of wishes and scientific pronouncements on the problems of environmental protection, as well as actions to increase people's awareness of such prob lems, are admirable, but legislators must also do their duty towards society in this matter. In Greece over the last seven years a number of sound legal measures have been taken by the New Democ racy Party during its period in office, but they have not always been implemented satisfactorily, and I think this also happens in many other countries. I should now like to draw the attention of the House to three specific points among the many and varied interesting questions concerning the environment. I would refer to the problems of marine pollution, the spoiling of coastal areas by a mass of tasteless and dan gerous constructions which are at the same time sources of pollution, and the problems of atmospheric pollution, which is particularly dangerous for the population, particularly that of big cities, and to which particular attention must be paid. For all these reasons I appeal in this House, where many millions of European citizens are represented, to the Council of Ministers and to the Commission to adopt effective programmes, even if they are costly, and to ensure that the Community's common policy is fully implemented in all the Member States. After all, we all have a sacred duty and obligation towards future generations to ensure that they will not have to curse us. (Applause) President. \u2014 I call the Commission. Mr Narjes, Member of the Commission \u2014 (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by addressing a sincere word of thanks to Mr Alber for his excellent report and to all those Members who have taken part in this debate, a debate which has, in my view, been characterized by an impressive number of interesting, instructive and inspiring contributions. It is now up to me to try to strike a reasonable balance between the limitations you expect me to set on my speaking time and the answers you expect to all the questions which have been put to me. Perhaps I may ",
        "17.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/231 Narjes begin by pointing out that what we have here is a mul tiannual programme, an action programme, which is undoubtedly an ambitious one, but which is not intended to be unrealistically ambitious. It is a pro gramme which requires the commitment of all con cerned, including the Council, once the programme has cleared that stage. Now, the fact is that, to take up Mr Muntingh's exam ple, the Council is not a tribunal of wise men who have been sent from above to direct this Community; I think I am right in saying that there is no-one in the entire Council who does not belong to one of the par ties represented in this House. It is therefore our duty to exert whatever influence we have on the Council's decision-making process, whether the matter at hand be protection of the envi ronment or any other Community business. While it is true that paradise is not just around the corner and the Elysian fields are still shrouded in the distant mists, we must stick steadfastly to our exacting and painstaking task rather than succumb to scepticism as to the unat- tainability of the goals we have set ourselves. That, after all, is something we owe our children and our children's children on this extremely important \u2014 not to say vital \u2014 issue. I merely wish to make that point in reply to the kind of scepticism which I can, to be fair, understand. As I said before, the problem we are faced with here is a topical one and comprises a number of elements. In the final analysis, the issue is a human one; what we are concerned about is the people of Europe, whose interest we wish to arouse and on whose behaviour we must exert influence. Mr Maher is quite right to ask what we were doing to educate the man-in-the-Street. Allow me to say first of all, from the purely formal point of view, that this is first and foremost a matter for the Member States. We have no access to the instruments of a European educational policy, but our concern for this problem is reflected in a number of individual measures we have taken, and we are endeav ouring to exert some influence on the educational pro cess and on what is taught in schools. At this juncture, I should like to answer a question put by Mr Eisma. We have a kind of pilot project, consist ing of a network of schools in which schools' repre sentatives meet regularly in Brussels to compare notes. The Commission supplies educational material which is tested in discussions with the schools' representa tives. We are ready and willing to procure a detailed report for Mr Eisma should he be interested. Another potentially effective educational tool is the use of resources under budget heading 6613, which is intended to finance educational and study projects and thus make for a more efficient educational programme for children, students and apprentices. This month marks the tenth anniversary of the Stock holm Conference, and the opportunity was taken recently to hold a world conference On the United Nations' Development Programme in Nairobi. The Community was represented at that conference by the Commission and the Council. The reason I mention this fact is because all the delegations made it very clear \u2014 and this shows to some extent how far we have come since the Stockholm Conference in 1972 \u2014 that the world can only develop sensibly \u2014 in other words, economically acceptably \u2014 provided the requirements of environmental protection and good management of natural resources are borne in mind permanently by all concerned and not merely advo cated by politicians in their weekend speeches. For that reason, all the delegations said very clearly that they were ready and willing to espouse a voluntary environment policy and undertook to quicken the pace of work that was already in progress and to introduce new projects in the spirit of this programme. As far as Europe is concerned, I should like to point out in particular that over the last 10 years \u2014 in which we have come to regard environmental policy as a pol itical activity \u2014 we have done a lot to prepare the ground for specific projects. We have set up adminis trations and undertaken studies, we have made people aware of the problem and created political institutions, and much more, as Mr Teuber has pointed out. But all that is merely the groundwork for an environmental policy and is no substitute for an effective policy in the true sense of the word ! As I see the problem, the second 10 years must be devoted to drastically quickening the pace and con vincing those in positions of responsibility that they have a duty to match their general undertakings with action in every respect and to come up with something concrete to underline their own recognition of the problem and the political priority it has been given over the past 10 years. I should like to reiterate in this respect that we were given the opportunity in April of this year to organize the third meeting of the Committee of International Development Institutions for the Environment in Brussels, that the Commission has accepted these recommendations and, in particular, has acknow ledged that it has a duty to coordinate environmental policy and development policy in the Third World. The Commission intends to bear this in mind not only in respect of the current Lom\u00e9 Convention, but also by stressing the connections between the two policies more than has hitherto been the case in future negotia tions on renewals of the Lom\u00e9 Convention. I should like to say to Mrs Schleicher that, generally speaking, we are of course prepared to explore every international negotiating opportunity to the full. Even as regards the Eastern Bloc, we have the first contact, the first joint undertaking, in the form of the joint par ticipation in the Geneva Agreement on long-distance air pollution, i.e. European attempts to combat the problem of acid rain. We have potential partners in ",
        "No 1-286/232 Debates of the European Parliament 17.6.82 Narjes East and West and we are prepared to extend this cooperation to other spheres. I just wanted to make this brief reference to Nairobi and our other interna tional obligations. What we have here is a first encouraging example. We know what has been achieved in Europe, but we also know all too well what is still lacking and where we have to set about putting things right. I am therefore all the more grateful for this debate. A lot of speakers have referred to the inadequate resources, the inadequate staffing and the underdevel oped political will on the part of the Council \u2014 in this case the Council of Budget Ministers. We are particu larly grateful for any support of this kind. I would prefer not to comment in detail at the moment on what has been done on the various points or what we intend to do. There really is not sufficient time to do that. I merely wish to reiterate that environmental policy is, as far as we are concerned, a preventive structural policy. In the normal course of events, this concept of environmental policy will do away with the conflict between economic and ecological considera tions to the satisfaction, I believe, of both sides. But this will only be possible provided that the ecological outline conditions are drawn up reliably, legally unim- peachably and in good time, to ensure that we can set some store by them and so that they are not subject to constant short-term change. Quite a number of proposals for amending or extend ing the programme have been put forward, and the Commission can, given certain changes in the word ing, accept Amendments Nos 1 to 12, 14 to 17, 19 to 23, 26 to 29, 31 to 33 and 46 without question. I have a few remarks to make in particular on Amend ment No 18, one which has been referred to on a number of occasions, and which features the call for a general directive on trans-frontier pollution. We really wonder whether a legal instrument along those lines would be practicable and whether it would be possible to apply such an abstract provision in individual cases, if only because of the problem of ascertaining the source of trans-frontier pollution. The Commission's policy hitherto of seeking specific individual solutions case by case has not been entirely unsuccessful, if you take into consideration the Seveso directive, the environmental impact testing, the direc tive on the quality of bathing or drinking water and the provisions regarding dangerous waste. In each individual case, we have made arrangements for trans-frontier problems and the attendant political constraints. We have so far always thought this to be the most promising way, but that depends on how you view the question of getting such provisions through the Coun cil. Provided the governments concerned realize what is required and acknowledge that there is a need for something to be done, they are usually prepared to accept provisions along those lines. However, as soon as they are asked to sign a blank cheque and have no say as to how that cheque is to be cashed, and which could give rise to collective lawsuits or other such con troversial measures, we have usually taken the view that there would be little prospect of our getting our way in the Council. It is because of the potential politi cal impracticability that we have refrained from aiming for general legislation and preferred to work out spe cific provisions from case to case, on the understand ing that these are in the interests of our common aim and will bear fruit. Amendment No 13 is concerned with the suggestion that special levies be raised for imports from countries with low environmental standards. I am pleased that this amendment has been tabled, as it shows that this House is conscious of these problems, especially in negotiations with third countries. However, any levy of this kind is bound to be an obstacle to free trade, and we would be leaving our selves open here to the charge or protectionism \u2014 something which is not in line with the Community's trade policy. I therefore feel that the Commission should bear this suggestion in mind, but should not necessarily make it recommended practice. On the other hand, I would ask you not to be too lenient about wielding this impressive cudgel. That is my frank reply to the potential such an instrument has to offer, but also on the risks which its use would entail. As to the proposal that green papers should be pub lished in the field of environmental policy, I may say that the Commission has already taken up this idea in other sectors and would have no qualms about doing the same in the field of environmental policy. The only condition is that the material selected for a green paper must be suitable in individual cases too. A green paper must not be used a pretext for doing nothing or as a second-class funeral for an idea that no-one wishes to pursue for a few years. So I would like to take up this suggestion with certain reservation. Let us not forget the work of the Council of Europe. There are far too few of us for us to allow ourselves the luxury of duplicating work, and for that reason it sometimes happens that the work done by the Council of Europe \u2014 as indeed that done by some national Parliament or another \u2014 can have the force of pre-decision-making enquiries which we should always take into consideration. I am thinking here, for instance, of the excellent studies produced by the House of Lords, which have often been a help to us in the past. The Commission hopes that the keynote debate con ducted by the Council on the 24th will help us to make progress on this programe too. It would be a source of pleasure to me if, in the second half of 1982, we could ",
        "17.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/233 Narjes get down to discussing the details of future develop ments in the committee. (Applause) President. \u2014 The debate is closed. The motion for a resolution will be put to the vote at the next voting time. 12. Dangers arising from the use of consumer products President. \u2014 The next item is the report (Doc. 1-207/ 82), drawn up by Mrs Seibel-Emmerling on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the proposal from the Commission to the Council (Doc. 1-632/79 COM(79) 725 final) for a deci sion introducing a Community system for the rapid exchange of information on dangers arising from the use of consumer products. I call the rapporteur. Mrs Seibel-Emmerling, rapporteur. \u2014 (DE) Mr Presi dent, ladies and gentlemen, this rapid information sys tem has certainly not lived up to its name. I hope, however, that after such lengthy preparations we can finally bring the matter to a satisfactory conclusion \u2014 or rather, a beginning \u2014 and set up a rapid and effi cient system to provide the Member States with infor mation on dangers which could arise from the use of a product or parts of a product. You may recall, ladies and gentlemen, that this House discussed this matter almost exactly a year ago and at the same time carried out a number of exercises in the rules of procedure, which were still rather new to us at the time. To refresh your memories, I would ask you to re-read the verbatim report of the sitting of 9 June 1981 \u2014 some of it does not make very pleasant and cheering reading. The present Commission report, to which I am tabling three motions for amendments on behalf of my Committee, seeks to establish the most rapid and unbureaucratic system possible to protect and warn people against certain dangers. How necessary such a system can be has been emphatically illustrated of late by the Spanish cooking oil catastrophe. A very large majority of the Committee welcomes the Commission proposal. Since the Committee's discussions I have felt sure that the Commission would be willing to accept and com ply with our proposed amendments. They aim at pro viding consumer protection on a broad front, but do not seek to exclude producers and traders, while allowing their views to be heard. Most of the Com mittee also agreed that the consumer protection we have in mind should not only cover the people of the Community; established findings should also be passed on to the third countries concerned. The Committee therefore requests the Commission to bear this in mind in future discussions. My own request \u2014 one which, incidentally, the Com mission used to be firmly in favour of \u2014 that in addi tion to the rapid information system we also need an effective recall system for dangerous consumer goods, was supported by only a minority of the Committee. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope this House will make the right decision today and thus help, if only a litde, to strengthen consumer protection in the Community in this important matter. IN THE CHAIR: MR PFLIMLIN Vice-President President. \u2014 I call the European People's Party (Christian-Democratic Group). Mrs Lentz-Cornette. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Sei bel-Emmerling for her report, which certainly cannot have been easy to produce. Indeed, it was a difficult birth for a system which is supposed to be rapid. The European People's Party has finally accepted the Commission proposal on the setting up of a rapid information exchange system thanks to the reassuring comments made to us in committee by the Commis sioner, Mr Narjes. The proposal is to set up a country by country tele phone network comprising, in all, ten telephones which will be in contact with each other and with the Commission switchboard in Brussels. Each Member State will appoint a person to take charge of this extremely rapid information system. We are in favour of the system, which will be simple, inexpensive and, as Mrs Seibel-Emmerling has said, completely un bureaucratic. Time will tell whether it can work efficiently. On this point, I would like to make a number of comments. Firstly, the proposal covers a very wide range of prod ucts including foodstuffs, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, household appliances, as well as clothes, cars and all other means of transport \u2014 in other words, everything which the consumer uses throughout his life to eat, ",
        "No 1-286/234 Debates of the European Parliament 17.6.82 Lentz-Cornette cure his illnesses, use his leisure time and travel. The purpose of the system is to provide protection against all the dangers arising from all these products. However, the range of possible accidents is very wide : perhaps it should be sub-divided into a number of categories. Moreover, when the adulterated oil mentioned by the rapporteur had led to a number of deaths, it took weeks, months even, for intensive analysis to prove that denatured oil intended for industry was the cause. How much time elapsed and how many people died in Spain before the cause of these fatalities was discov ered? In some cases, the harmful effects of a product do not come to light until some time has passed. The same is true in the case of the infantile deformities caused by thalidomide. It is also necessary to wait some time before the pharmaceutical in question is established with virtual certainty. This leads me to my second comment: such a system can be effective when the harmful effects of a product become apparent quickly and their causes can be rap idly established. It becomes much less effective as the time lag between the accident and establishing its causes increases. Thirdly, it is sometimes difficult to protect the con sumer against damage or injury caused by defective products, because very often the consumer is unaware, for example, whether a car accident is his own fault or is due to a mechanical defect. For if his garage does not inform him of similar accidents which have occurred, how can he be expected to know whether his car has a hidden defect? His guarantee will help him for a certain period, but not indefinitely. Fourthly, a directive on the responsibility of the manu facturer for damage or injury caused by defective products would make it possible to protect the health and safety of the consumer more effectively. We are aware that such a directive is being prepared and it would entitle the consumer to claim adequate com pensation. Rapid information between all the Member States and with third countries where defective prod ucts are used would be most useful in such cases. Fifthly, consumers have a right to information con cerning the quality of the products and the safeness of the appliances they use. They must have access to safe products, especially products which do not damage their health either in the short or long term. But they also have certain duties, in particular the duty to inform those around them, and even consumer asso ciations and government bodies, of accidents they have suffered. Manufacturing defects are in many cases established with certainty on the basis of cross checks and series of similar accidents. In this way too manufacturers can be compelled to withdraw a prod uct from the market and replace it with a safe one. The safety needed is provided by the consumer asso ciation. Lastly, information held by government bodies can only be useful if it is backed by information from con sumers. The information process must be structured both horizontally and vertically if it is to be completely effective in protecting the consumer. President. \u2014 I call the European Democratic Group. Miss Hooper. \u2014 Mr President, on behalf of my group I am also very pleased to be able to welcome this second report by Mrs Seibel-Emmerling. We are aware of the importance which many consumer groups throughout the Community attach to this proposal from the Commission and their belief that it will con stitute a further valuable measure of protection for consumers against dangerous products. When this matter was before this House last year, my group was very concerned that the Commission's proposal was an unbalanced and unnecessary one. In the further dis cussions we have had in committee which have led to the production of this second report, we have attempted to work constructively to produce a more acceptable proposal. We have been concerned with two particular problems. The first is the need to ensure that any overlap between the system currently proposed for the rapid transmission of information on dangerous products and those systems already in existence, such as the OECD arrangements, does not lead either to the crea tion of a new bureaucratic layer or the creation of new national machinery to implement it. We felt that, apart from duplicating controls, any duplication of systems might in fact slow down the process of informing con sumers of any danger as swiftly as possible, which we regard as being the main object of this measure. We therefore welcome the amendment to the Commis sion's proposal adopted by the committee which ensures that the Community system will be or can be administered by existing services within the Member States. The second concern of my group has been the need to achieve a proper balance. Clearly our first priority is and must remain the safety of the public and the assur ance that if there is in the words of the proposal 'an immediate and acute risk to the consumer', then infor mation will be transmitted rapidly to enable the national authorities to take the appropriate action. But we must also bear in mind the interests of the manu facturer, the safety of whose product is being called into question and the adverse publicity to which this exchange of information may give rise. That is cer tainly no reason for withholding the information, but we do feel it necessary to ensure that, wherever it can be done swiftly, the producer, distributor or importer of the product should be contacted by the Member State authorities. ",
        "17.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/235 Hooper We are pleased that an amendment to this effect is also now incorporated into the committee's report. In addi tion, we also lay emphasis on paragraphs 5 and 6 of the motion for a resolution which provide that the information exchange system should be used only after proper investigation and that it must not become an instrument either of protectionism or of unfair competition. Mr President, as a group we will be voting in favour of this report and the proposal in the belief that the amendments adopted by the committee take account of the interests of both consumers and manufacturers, interests which we in this group do not regard as being contradictory. We will be giving our support to the introduction of a system which we hope will be an effective one, which we hope will be applied uniformly in all Member States and which we hope above all will be a real step forward in the Community's attempts to protect the health and safety of consumers. President. \u2014 I call the Liberal and Democratic Group. Mrs Scrivener. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, ladies and gen tlemen, in the previous debate we rejected the Com mission's proposal on this system for the exchange of information on the dangers arising from the use of consumer products. We felt that the earlier provisions had certain shortcomings, and that is of course why we approved of the aim of the system in the field of consumer protection. As we know, there is already an informal information system between the Member States and the Commis sion in the field of foodstuffs. However, we must not forget the Spanish oil affair, nor should we forget that Parliament unanimously adopted a resolution which I had tabled on the need for the Community to develop a system for the rapid withdrawal from the market of products which can be regarded as a danger to con sumer health. It should of course be possible to examine such prod ucts and withdraw them temporarily to ascertain whether they are dangerous or not. We shall therefore be supporting the amendment which has been tabled on this point, if only to ensure that Parliament acts consistently once again. On the basis of this approach we re-examined the Commission's proposal; we have made a number of amendments which are likely to improve it, and that explains why the Environment Committee has requested that not only producers but also distributors and importers should be consulted in advance, since it would obviously be ludicrous not to involve them. This has in any case always been the position upheld by the Liberal and Democratic Group with regard to proposals relating to consumer protection since, con trary to what some people believe, the interests of con sumers do not conflict with those of industry. With this aim in mind, the Community must help producers, in any way possible, to enable them to avoid any mis takes which could jeopardize the health or safety of the people of Europe or to improve safeguards. Pre ventive measures like this \u2014 and prevention is always better than cure, would therefore reduce the hazards to which consumers may be exposed in using con sumer products. We have already had a tragic example of this \u2014 one which must be used as a lesson. (Applause) President. \u2014 I call the Commission. Mr Narjes, Member of the Commission. \u2014 (DE) Mr President, I shall begin by expressing my warmest thanks to Mrs Seibel-Emmerling for her report, which has provided us with an excellent basis for this second debate. We are very pleased that after last year's debate we can now discuss this matter on the basis of her new report. I regard this as a particularly worth while debate, and because of the large measure of agreement it enables me to be fairly brief and thus comply with the wishes of the Bureau. I have already sinned twice today, and I would ask you to see to it that I do not speak too long this time. I have only the following brief comments to make. Firstly, the purpose of the proposal is to set up a sys tem for the rapid exchange of information between the Member States and the Commission which would make it possible to identify consumer goods represent ing an immediate and considerable danger to the health and safety of consumers. Secondly, the desirability of such a system is stressed by the first and second consumer programme, and our need for such a programme has been dramatically highlighted by the 'olive oil' incident in Spain. Thirdly, the proposal clearly seeks to create an unbu- reaucratic systems. The only equipment used will be a few telexes and telephones to permit a smooth flow of information on a mutual basis, as is normal among good neighbours. The sole purpose of the proposal \u2014 and this is my next point \u2014 is to identify dangerous products. It makes no provision for measures, action and repercus sions. These remain exclusively the responsibility of the Member States. We cannot therefore lay down any rules on the withdrawal of products as a possible meas ure to be taken in the event of alarming information. The system is to operate merely between responsible authorities, and confidentiality must be respect in all cases. Such operations cannot therefore be made known to the mass media. I must also stress that prod- ",
        "No 1-286/236 Debates of the European Parliament 17.6.82 Narjes ucts for professional use are not covered by the system and that third countries, at any rate for the time being, are not yet included. Having said that, I do not wish to exclude the possibility of their being covered at a later date. On the whole, we feel that this resolution contributes towards consumer protecti on, and we are therefore prepared to accept amendments Nos 1, 2 and 3. As for amendment No 4, it follows from my remark on the separate responsibilities of the Community and the Member States that this amendment falls within the sphere of competence of the Member States. I wanted to make this point clear, but otherwise I would like to repeat my thanks for your comments. (Applause) President. \u2014 The debate is closed. The motion for a resolution will be put to the vote at the next voting time. in paragraph 16 of the motion for a resolution con tained in my previous report, that the Commission should provide itself as soon as possible with the implementing regulation needed to ensure that the rules of competition are strictly observed by the airline companies. This has apparently already been done. I would like briefly to comment on the need for such a regulation as well as on its contents and application. Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome apply to air transport, as the Court of Justice has repeatedly con firmed, and till now the Commission, with no autono mous powers, depended for the application of the rules of competition in this sector on the cooperation of the Member States. This situation has numerous drawbacks which became apparent, for example, in the Sterling Airways affair, in which, acting solely on the basis of Article 89 of the Treaty, the Commission encountered many difficulties in examining the case. Moreover, there is a danger that cases may arise in the Member States which are not consistent from one Member State to another and which do not take suffi cient account of the peculiar nature of this sector. 13. Air transport President. \u2014 The next item is the report (Doc. 1-286/ 82), drawn up by Mr Schwartzenberg on behalf of the Committee on Transport, on the proposal from the Commission to the Council (Doc. 1-461/81 COM(81)396 final) for a regula tion applying Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty (rules on competition applying to undertakings) to air transport. I call the rapporteur. Mr Schwartzenberg, rapporteur. \u2014 (FR) Mr Presi dent, ladies and gentlemen, this report follows on from the report on competition in air transport which, you will recall, I presented on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in November 1980. Progress in competition in air transport is clearly necessary. But increased competition should obviously be carefully planned, balanced and orderly and should take full account of the characteristics peculiar to this sector and of all the requirements involved. Foremost among these are the social and regional requirements and the requirements of safety. If it is to be acceptable, the strengthening of competition must remain compatible with the essential requirement to devote attention to safety, the optimum protection of passengers and the quality of the services provided. It should also safeguard the future and the social rights of airline personnel. Lastly, it should take account of the common interest, especially regional development and the tasks which government bodies often entrust to airline companies. With this in mind we requested, The motion for a resolution tabled by the Commission is a version which has been modified to meet the needs of the sector referred to by Regulation No 17 of 1962, which the Commission has been using since then to apply its general rules of competition and which pro vides, in particular, for the necessary powers of inves tigation, checks and sanctions. For these reasons para graphs 2 and 3 of the resolution approve the principle of this regulation with, however, some reservations. The following comments can be made concerning the actual contents of the draft regulation. Its scope is limited, as is pointed out in paragraph 4 of the motion for a resolution. It applies, in fact, only to air transport companies, whether publicly, privately or jointly owned, whose behaviour suggests an autono mous commercial policy. When the activities of these undertakings, which in most Member States are pub licly owned, result from instructions received from government bodies or take the form of particular tasks required by such bodies, the regulation does not pre judice the application of Article 90 of the EEC Treaty. However, when the structural conditions for competi tion apply, in particular in the fixing of fares and access to the market, the scope of the regulation may gradually widen, as pointed out in paragraph 5 of the resolution. Similarly, the Commission felt that it should not for the time being undertake to define certain categories of agreements or practices prohibited by Article 85(1) or exempted by Article 85(3). We approve of this graduated approach, because this sector is so complex that if the rules of competition were applied in a heavy-handed and undiscriminating way the competi tiveness of European transport companies, on both the ",
        "17. 6. 82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/237 Schwartzenberg Community and the international markets, could be weakened. Lastly, there are two provisions which distinguish the regulation under discussion from its model, Regula tion No 17 of 1962, on which it is based. These relate to the powers to carry out checks, investigations and apply sanctions. Thus, with a view to simplification, and in accordance with the letter of Article 87, 2 (b) of the EEC Treaty, undertakings can opt whether or not to notify the Commission of their agreements or concerted prac tices. Where undertakings wish to give notification of their agreements, Article 5, third paragraph, of the draft regulation stipulates, again with a view to simpli fication, that if a period of 90 days elapses, this implies exemption on the part of the Commission in order to meet the specific needs of this sector. For the same reason Article 9 states that any Member State can choose to request a Council meeting to examine, with the Commission, matters of principle relating to the common transport policy which it feels have a bearing on a particular case on which the Com mission is to take a decision. This regulation would be of a purely technical nature were it not for the signifi cance which Parliament intends to attach to the widening of competition in air transport. When the report was being examined in committee, our discussions were concerned mainly with the means of applying this competition policy in air transport. Thus, in paragraph 7, we emphasize the need to take account, in developing the competition policy, of the safeguarding of the social conditions, the quality of service and the safeness of air travel. The Member States can only make progress towards the mutual opening up of their air transport markets if the work ing conditions and pay of personnel are harmonized. At present these conditions vary considerably from one Member State to another. Without harmoniza tion, we could see the emergence of '\u00a3100 airlines'. The same applies to the maintenance of standards of service and of the safeness of air travel. These considerations, expressed in the report by Mr Hoffmann which was adopted by Parliament, and also in my first report, imply willingness on our part to continue to develop competition in this sector on an orderly basis. The mistrust which we had expressed concerning total deregulation has been sadly vindi cated by the collapse of the Laker and Braniff com panies. We are now witnessing the very adverse effects of this trend towards deregulation on employment, personnel and the general development of the sector. We should not therefore confuse increased competi tion with absolute, complete, indeed cut-throat com petition which would not take account of the real interests of passengers, personnel, and the common interest, in particular regional development. In its opi nion, the Transport Committee expressed the same concern, and as far as the Legal Affairs Committee is concerned, we have mentioned in paragraph 6 of the motion for a resolution its wish that Council should adopt this regulation soon and, if necessary, by a qual ified majority, in accordance with the provisions expressly stated in Article 87 of the EEC Treaty. Lastly, paragraph 8 points out that if the extension of the competition policy is to be effective, the Commis sion will require increased resources. Such is the scope of this regulation. It is the first phase in the application of a policy on competition in air transport which, as pointed out in paragraphs 1 and 9 of the motion for a resolution, considers the needs of the sector, will benefit users and will help undertak ings to improve their competitiveness. I hope that this report, which was adopted by a very large majority of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, will meet with your approval. President. \u2014 I call the Socialist Group. Mr Key. \u2014 Mr President, I think this is a very timely debate because for most of us in this House who spend a large part of our lives on aeroplanes, aeroplanes like the poor of the world unfortunately are always with us. We have, however, got to note, as Mr Schwartzen berg did, that a number of these airline companies have gone bankrupt in the last few months, in many cases because of excessive competition. But despite its vital importance to the Community, air transport is something we do not often have much chance to debate in this House. This is why I believe that it is important for us to use this opportunity in such a way that our efforts stand at least a sporting chance of being translated into future action. I welcome Mr Schwartzenberg's speech today. It was a considered speech explaining the problems of the airline industry. But I have serious reservations about the motion which is before this House to be voted on I hope in an hour or so. I feel that if this resolution is adopted unamended the Council will look at it, they will look at Mr Schwartzenberg's report, they will look at the Commission's proposal, they will nod very wisely, they will sigh very deeply and then just pass on to another item, as they do on so many transport mat ters. Why is this? I think it is for the very simple reason that the Commission's proposal is based on a very false premise. We are told that this is a mere procedural matter. That must mean that it seeks to determine the means by which effect can be given to an already agreed policy. But where is this policy? We do not have a common transport policy or a common air transport policy within this Community. Not that one cannot be found. On the contrary, the Treaty of Rome refers to it quite specifically and it ",
        "No 1-286/238 Debates of the European Parliament 17.6.82 Key calls for a common transport policy. Depending on how you read the Treaty you may come to the very perfectly valid and logical conclusion that one of the things such a policy might be supposed to embrace is the principle enshrined in the Treaty's competition rules. However, you may not necessarily accept this vital link between the policy and the competition rules. I accept that there are those who would argue that this is a rather partisan approach. However that may be, the House will surely want to satisfy itself that these competition rules, much admired by certain sections of this House, are merely a matter of a procedural appli cation. Can they in practice be applied? The answer is they cannot unless every air service's agreement entered into by Community governments with each other or with third parties is to be rendered illegal. The simple fact is that competition rules as they stand in the Treaty are totally incompatible with the concept of air space sovereignty and with the means that gov ernments have adopted to give expression to this con cept over the last 40 years. This House is, therefore, being led up a blind alley. The shortcomings of the European air transport sys tem are not hard to define. The Commission enjoys no monopoly in wanting to put them right. Some of them can be laid at the door of the airlines. Some, indeed, far more than most people seem to imagine, can be laid at the door of member governments. Some could be solved by the interjection of greater competition, greater freedom of the airlines to innovate with their fares and quality of service, free entry into the market place. That is what it is all supposed to be about, this common market, or so we are told. At present, so far as air transport is concerned, there is no such thing and as long as governments of the Community main tain total discretion over how their air space is to be used, commercially as well as militarily, there is no way in which the Treaty can be applied, procedurally or otherwise. In order to apply the principles of com petition to air transport the tenet of national air sover eignty must be relinquished. We are in this House to further the objectives of this Community. We surely want to remove the fetters on it. All this proposal will do is bind us still further. Given our priorities we must tell the Commission that they must get to the heart of the matter, not tinker with it sympathetically at this moment. The resolution adopted by this House must demand that. I therefore recommend to this House that they accept all the amendments proposed therein. President. \u2014 I call the Group of the European Peo ple's Party (Christian Democratic Group). Mr Franz. \u2014 (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentle men, we have long had cause to regret the fact that air transport is not subject to the rules on competition in the EEC Treaty. A socially committed market econ omy can only function with competition in all areas. Without competition, a market economy cannot be social. We therefore need more market economy and more competition in air transport. But competition of course requires certain basic condi tions. There must be equality of opportunity among airlines. This would involve harmonization of Com munity taxation, air safety controls and airport taxes. Social, regional and safety requirements must be taken into account. The most important thing, however, in my opinion is to fight the undesirable practice of subsidies to air transport which distorts any type of competition. We dealt with the same problem this morning in the debate on steel. We have watched it happening for years : subsidies are, and it has to be repeated over and over again, one of the greatest enemies of competition and they are responsible for many unfortunate devel opments in Europe. Considerable maintenance subsi dies have prevented the demise of unprofitable airlines which have not kept up with progress. This has meant that competitive airlines have often been unable to make the profits they need to finance the moderniza tion which will safeguard jobs in air transport in the long term. Subsidies have led to distortion of competi tion in air transport in the European Community. They are detrimental to entrepreneurial freedom of decision, efficiency and readiness to take risks which are vital elements of the market economy. When it comes to individual business they reduce adaptability and their effect on the whole economy is to impair the control mechanisms of the market economy and reduce economic productivity and flexibility. If we do not take more decisive action against subsidies in air transport, our competitivity in air transport may well decrease. For Europe with its meagre resources in raw materials and energy, world free trade is vital. How else would we finance our urgently needed imports of raw materi als and energy? Just because of the great importance that world trade has for us, we must have the best air transport possible. The increasing importance of air freight also means that we need to have the most mod ern and efficient airlines in the world which can com pete effectively with the best non-European compan ies. Increased competition can help us to do this. According to the Treaties it is the task of the Euro pean Community to guarantee internal competition and world free trade. We must constantly take action not only to defend competition \u2014 the very basis of our economic and social order \u2014 but also to improve it. Air transport cannot in principle be excluded from this even if, and I repeat this, many of the conditions for full competition in air transport, for instance the abolition of subsidies, still have to be met. It will not be easy but it will not stop us demanding that the right action should be taken. ",
        "17.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/239 Franz The EPP Group therefore supports Mr Schwartzen berg's report. President. \u2014 I call the European Democratic Group. Mr Moorhouse. \u2014 Mr President, we shall certainly be giving our firm support to the motions for resolution tabled by Mr Schwartzenberg in what we feel is an excellent report. It is one which is admirably brief and very much to the point. I think most of us could agree with him that there is a real need for a gradual and balanced increase in com petition in the air transport sector as part of the natural development of a common transport policy to which Mr Key has referred. Obviously, we must ensure that safety is in no way impaired and we must look after the interests of all those who are working in the industry today. Let me also, Mr President, pay tribute to the legal opi nion of Mr Janssen van Raay which, as one has come to expect of him, is an important contribution to ana lysis of this complex and involved subject. Now, Mr President, this proposal as Mr Schwartzen berg himself has said, is of limited scope and merely a first step. But it is also a very necessary step for it can not be right, surely, that IATA, the International Air Transport Association, should forever and a day determine what is good or bad for Europe and the air traveller. To leave it to them to determine air fares, who flies where, what facilities we get and so on and so forth, cannot be right. I am not saying IATA does not have a useful function. What I am saying is that we cannot allow and should not allow a conspiracy \u2014 and I use the word advisedly \u2014 to flourish indefinitely anymore than we are prepared to countenance inter national monopolies and cartels. And that is an issue that, quite clearly, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs was quick to grasp. In saying all this in what may appear to be a somewhat critical vein may I, however, welcome the presence unofficially at least through you, Mr President, of so many representatives of IATA and of the airlines who are here for this debate and add that we look forward to having a constructive debate with them in the months and years ahead. I have just touched on the principle. But what, for instance, of the airfare situation in Europe which is an issue that worries and bothers so many of our consti tuents, not only in the United Kingdom but in Den mark and, I suspect, in Greece and in Italy and Ire land, certainly the far-flung countries? Rightly or wrongly, Mr President, people generally feel that scheduled airfares are too high. They resent it and that is the consequence of part of the system that we are living with today. Not only are they high but there are all kinds of anomalies. Why, for instance, is it, Mr President, that one can fly from Dublin to Strasbourg via London for \u00a3140 return yet it costs \u00a3196 return from London to Strasbourg on the same plane? I am talking now about the scheduled flights on the Monday morning \u2014 Dub lin/London/Strasbourg \u00a3140 from Dublin to Stras bourg and \u00a3196 from London to Strasbourg. Or again, Mr President, did you and my colleagues know that it is cheaper to fly first class return \u2014 and I real ize that we do not often do this \u2014 from Amsterdam to New York? In fact, it is much cheaper to get on the plane at Amsterdam and fly all the way to New York than it is to get on the plane at London. Now that is what they call a cross-border saving in the terms of the airlines' jargon. But those two examples strongly suggest to me and, I feel, to Members of the House that airline fares are priced according to the perception of the airlines of what individual national markets will take. An analogy has been drawn by one of our colleagues with the motor-car price variations we have within the Community from country to coun try. I think there may be an interesting analogy to be explored there. I hope I have said enough, Mr President, to you and to the House to indicate that there is scope for improvement on behalf of the air traveller within the Community and we certainly will support the excellent report by Mr Schwartzenberg. President. \u2014 I call the Communist and Allies Group. Mr Leonardi. \u2014 (TT) Mr President, the motion for a resolution we are looking at today attempts to extend the field of application of the rules on competition to air transport. To some extent, this proposal is laud able, because we might, as a result, obtain better ser vice and cheaper flights within Europe. Nevertheless, we must be careful to avoid the mistake of tackling genuine problems with the wrong solu tions. The truth is that we cannot overlook the fact that if air fares in Europe are higher than elsewhere, costs in Europe are also higher than elsewhere, as a result of, amongst other things, the shorter journeys flown by our airlines and the high staff costs. There is no doubt that these difficulties cannot be overcome, as Mr Schwartzenberg pointed out in his report, by 'full-blooded' implementation of the rules of competi tion and a policy of deregulation: we have already seen in the United States what negative effects that can have. The Commission's proposal, therefore, opts for a pru dent and gradual approach, but it does not appear to take adequate account of the special situation of air lines in Europe. ",
        "No 1-286/240 Debates of the European Parliament 17.6.82 Leonardi As regards the general criteria, we must bear in mind that in the majority of the Member States the airlines consider, rightly or wrongly, that the international agreements at present in force on air transport, which are based on bilateral and multilateral agreements, are incompatible with the introduction of Community leg islation on competition. They fear that the only result that would be achieved would be to plunge the pres ent, admittedly far from perfect, system into crisis, which would only favour the economically most viable airlines to the detriment of the weaker ones, with the resulting negative effects that we can easily imagine. So, in our opinion, the only way to deal with the pres ent situation, which undoubtedly has certain serious drawbacks and which in some respects cannot be allowed to continue, is to look at the idea of applying the rules of competition within the framework of a Community transport policy, such as we have called for on several occasions but which so far does not exist. Only in this way could something positive result from a policy of competition and the implementation of the rules of open competition, within prescribed limits. We support the Commission's efforts, which are mainly confined to putting foward rules of procedure. However, we believe that action of this kind is not enough, precisely because there is no general field of reference. Such a field of reference cannot, of course, be prepared for by attempting to implement the rules on voting by a qualified majority at meetings of the Council of Ministers, because the necessary political will, which is at present lacking, cannot be created by procedures of this kind. In a word, though we .appre ciate the efforts that have been made, we believe that they are not appropriate and that they do not take cer tain particular circumstances into account. For this reason we shall abstain. President. \u2014 I call Mrs Nikolaou. Mrs Nikolaou. \u2014 (GR) Mr President, it is well known that in all the Member States air transport is largely State-controlled, and this is of course no co incidence. The operation of national airlines serves the vital interests of the Member States. Competition rules can only be applied to this sector if it done gradually and with the constant objective of abolishing very spe cific practices which are highly damaging to competi tion. On the other hand, the present regulation does not clearly stipulate its field of application. It seeks simply to bring about the transfer of powers relating to the implementation of competition rules from the national governments to the Commission, thus giving the Commission the right to decide in each case which agreements and which practices are forbidden and which are exempt under Articles 85 and 86. This is also why this regulation is almost exclusively of a pro cedural nature. Of the 22 articles it contains, only two concern the actual substance of the question. It is true that the air transport sector has peculiarities which certainly make it very difficult to delimit strictly a regulation's field of application. Furthermore, detailed information is needed about the agreements and prac tices used nowadays, as well as thorough knowledge of the way in which the air transport sector works. These problems, however, cannot be solved simply by increasing the Commission's powers, as the regulation does and as is also accepted by the Schwartzenberg report. We have reservations both on the legal basis and on the field of application of the regulation. The amendments we have tabled to the report relate to these specific questions. In conclusion, we should like to stress that the regulation in its present version is damaging mainly to the national airlines of the small Member States and jeopardizes their survival. Further more, the implementation of this regulation may create something similar to the American 'deregula tion', a system which, as you know, is being aban doned even by America. For this reason, the Greek Socialists have reservations as regards the position they will adopt in the vote on the Schwartzenberg report, and our attitude will depend on what happens to the amendments we have tabled. President. \u2014 I call Mr Herman. Mr Herman. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentle men, my Group supports and shares the extremely well-founded opinions expressed by the rapporteur. I would just like to make two very brief points. Firstly, competition is not an end in itself but should only be planned or established if it ensures a better dis tribution of the elements of production which result in benefits to the consumer. It is questionable whether certain agreements in air transport improve the distribution of resources any more than unbridled and uncoordinated competition. We must therefore take account of the aim to benefit the consumer before embarking on a given course which might produce the opposite result. The second point I would like to draw attention to is the considerable amount of work which the Commis sion still faces if it is to harmonize the conditions gov erning competition. In air transport, in fact, there are enormous differences in operating conditions which stem from the sovereign rights of the various Member States. There are landing dues, handling and the way in which companies are financed and subsidized; oper ating conditions differ radically from one airline to another, and this renders the wholesale application of the rules of competition totally ineffective, or at any rate discriminatory and unfair. For these reasons, while we support the general policy and the Schwartzenberg report, we shall be tabling ",
        "17.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/241 Herman two or three amendments to take account of the points I have just mentioned. President. \u2014 I call Mr Martin. Mr Martin. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, the French Com munists and Allies have already had occasion to express their disapproval of plans to apply the rules of competition provided for by Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty to air transport. I have observed that frequently, when this House votes in favour of extending the rules of competition to air transport, the Council of Transport Ministers refuses, by a very large majority, to commit itself to such a measure in view of the harmful effects of such a move. I also note the difficulties now facing the advocates of unbridled competition. Stark reality, in particular the disorder and waste caused by deregulation, have forced the supporters of liberalization to pay at least lip service to the need to curb competition. In the very first paragraph of the motion for a resolu tion contained in the report by our colleague, Mr Schwartzenberg, two opposing ideas are expressed in a single sentence \u2014 the desire for increased competi tion, which is seen as a necessity, is immediately coun tered by concern for orderliness and balance in its implementation. But the motion fails to specify how such a balance can be ensured, and the fundamental requirement \u2014 the so-called interests of consumers \u2014 makes it impossible to strike such a balance. The particular features of the sector referred to in the motion, whether we consider the close interrelation ship between air transport and a whole range of geo graphical, energy, economic, ecological or social con straints, prevent us from considering the overriding commercial aspect of the sector and from regarding fares as its most important feature. While it is artificial to examine this problem without considering the role to be played by this sector \u2014 leaving aside all the infrastructure \u2014 it is dangerous to plan an effective transport policy without considering the other economic and social objectives which have to be pursued. Liberalization, by attaching overriding importance to individual consumption, makes it impossible to consider the general needs which a mod ern and economic transport system must fulfill. Having learned from the experience of America, where liberalization has wrought instability and the disruption of their own network, we believe, as French men and women and as Europeans, that it would be to our advantage not to abandon the means of organiz ing and running our network to ensure that airlines of varying commercial viability have a real chance of compensation, as well as the guaranteed stability pro vided by a public service. What some people are proposing is in fact quite simply the freedom of the fox in the hen-house \u2014 this we do not accept. For all these reasons we shall again not be voting for the motion for a resolution to apply the principles of competition to air transport. (Applause) President. \u2014 This debate will now have to be adjourned as it is time to move on to the votes. The debate will be continued when the sitting resumes this evening. I call the rapporteur. Mr Schwartzenberg, rapporteur. \u2014 (FR) Mr Presi dent, please forgive me if I raise a point of order and put a question. If there are only a couple of speakers left for this debate, personally I should be quite happy if the debate were closed now; otherwise, of course, the vote will have to be put back to Friday. We all know from past experience that the Chamber is hardly crowded on Fridays. If there are only a few Members still down to speak, I should be very grateful if you could let the debate run on for another five or six min utes so that we can close it now. President. \u2014 Mr Schwartzenberg, I appreciate your concern, which is quite legitimate. However, there are a fair number of Members still down to speak and the Commissioner will also need a few minutes to say what he wants to. As a result, I really must stick to the agenda drawn up by the House. Today \u2014 and this will apply even more in the future \u2014 the increased strength of government organizations makes it possible to create conditions favouring prop erly controlled competition to provide a satisfactory service at the lowest possible cost. Such a policy must be based on the role of the State in ensuring the coher ence of the networks, especially the national and inter national air traffic networks. IN THE CHAIR: MR DANKERT President ",

After the explanations of vote on the Hopper report (Doc. 1-307/82) Mr Hopper. \u2014 Mr President, I asked if I could speak for one reason only. In the preparation of the two interim reports and the final report I have become acutely conscious of how much we depend upon our staff, the staff of the secretariat and the interpreters who are the unsung heroes of this Parliament, and I wish to express my gratitude to them.

Before the vote on the amendments to the Michel report (Doc. 1-281/82) Mr Pannella. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, I wish to with draw some amendments. Perhaps you will allow me a few seconds to explain why. President. \u2014 That depends on the number of amend ments you are withdrawing. (Applause) Mr Pannella. \u2014 (FR) You are being rash, Mr Presi dent, because that could make me withdraw them all. All I wanted to say, Mr President, that once again I feel I have been placed in an impossible position. The fact of the matter is that a fortnight ago I tabled a ser ies of amendments which were acknowledged to be \u2014 and I was grateful for that \u2014 quite consistent in their thinking. Even Mr Michel has just acknowledged this fact. Now, however, I am sorry to find that the rap porteur and thus the committee as well are going to come out against all the amendments I tabled. If you ask me, Mr President, this is not a very parliamentary way of doing things and personal vendettas are neither democratic or right where human relations are con cerned. I do not want to have to ask the Members to go against the opinion of a rapporteur who says straight off that all the Pannella amendments ought to be withdrawn. I am therefore going to withdraw them, Mr President, and leave the field clear for all the other amendments which have been tabled here in Parlia- 1 See Annex. Mr Michel, rapporteur. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should not like there to be any mis understanding among us and I also want to say that between Marco Pannella and myself there is no differ ence of opinion on the objective that has to be sought and resolutely pursued, and I mean the saving of human lives. I should also say that we are all in agree ment on campaigning against malnutrition, ignorance and exploitation. If there are any differences, they are about how to go about it. As for myself, if I said that I could not go along with the amendments which Marco Pannella tabled, it was not because he does not agree with the work I did on behalf of the Committee on Development and Coop eration, of which he is a member anyway. We even got together to draw up a certain number of proposals and guidelines. If I am rejecting his amendments, it is pri marily because what he has tabled constitutes another report! You only have to look at them to realize it. I said that the debate would cover all the proposals from the ACP countries and those we aim to draw up in agreement with them. Let me add that the Socialist Group, like the Group of the European People's Party, has decided not to table any amendments to this motion for a resolution because we want to see some progress in the direction that has already been indi cated. Consequently, although I have decided to reject the amendments tabled by Mr Pannella \u2014 in as much as the decision depends on me \u2014 I should also like all the other amendments to be rejected as well. President. \u2014 I call Mr Irmer. Mr Irmer. \u2014 (DE) Mr President, I just wanted to say that I am withdrawing Amendment No 160. It is somewhat abstruse.

By way of closing, let me say that Mr Michel's words seem to give me satisfaction in a roundabout way. What I mean is that he is not rejecting amendments because of the person who tabled them. What he has decided to do \u2014 although I am not sure if it is the best idea \u2014 is to reject all the amendments. I feel that I have gained satisfaction to a certain extent.

Mr Collins, Chairman of the Committee on the Envi ronment, Public Health and Consumer Protection. \u2014 Before we proceed to this point, Mr President, I think it is in order for me to ask the Commission whether or not it has been able to reconsider the views expressed earlier on the speech that was made in the House by Mr Narjes. I refer in particular to Amendment No 39, which the Commissioner said he could not adopt. Has he changed his mind? President. \u2014 Mr Narjes, I think that Mr Collins has made a procedural error. We must first vote on the action programme, and then this question can be asked of the Commission. So we first proceed to the vote on the action programme, and then we come back to Mr Collins' problem. Mr Collins. \u2014 In that case the Commissioner has even longer to think out a reply.

I would submit that this whole report should be sent back to committee on account of what Mr Pisani said this afternoon. He told us that this pro posal which we are discussing now is in fact only part of a much broader and more extensive Commission policy and that new Commission proposals will be on the table very shortly. It would be better in my view if the whole matter could be considered together. That is why I am asking for this report to be referred to the Committee on Development and Cooperation. President. \u2014 I call the Commission to reply to Mr Collins' question. Mr Narjes, Member of the Commission. \u2014 (DE) I am sorry but I am not able to go along with the proposed wording here, because in the first place the EFTA agreement that is referred to does not exist in this form, and the concepts of protection and survival are not defined in the way we need.

It is a question simply of taking the Treaty and our justifica tion for an environment policy and making it compat ible with our discussions with the EFTA countries. We already have these discussions with EFTA countries, and it is a question simply of making these discussions come together on this particular point. ",

Mr Narjes, Member of the Commission. \u2014 (DE) The Stockholm Convention which has been alluded to is not an EFTA agreement. It is an international declara tion from 1972. It is not an agreement to which one can become a signatory but a declaration, accepted by all those at the meeting then, on the ten years of envi ronmental policy which have now come to an end. President. \u2014 It would have been better if this matter could have been cleared up during the debate. Mr Collins, I think it would be useful to try to solve the problem, because there is clearly some misunder standing which makes it impossible, for me at least, to understand what your problem really is. Mr Collins. \u2014 The problem was in fact cleared up in debate, and I am only sorry that this was not commun icated to the Commissioner. It was cleared up in debate in the committee, and the various spokesmen in the committee who took part in this discussion made it absolutely clear that they were referring not to the Stockholm meeting of some 10 years ago but to the Treaty which set up the European Free Trade Associa tion. I have forgotten the number of the article, but there are special derogations there where endangered species are involved. However, the real point here is the way in which this particular amendment deals with the relationship between giving special consideration to endangered animals and plants on the one hand and economic policy on the other. It is a fairly clear point. It was made here during a debate today. It was also made clear in committee. I am sorry that Mr Narjes is un able to agree to this. It is a point, I think, that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection and this Parliament will con tinue to make and will continue to make fairly strongly. At any rate I hope that has cleared it up. (The sitting was suspended at 8.15 p.m. and resumed at 9.30p.m.) IN THE CHAIR: MR VANDEWIELE Vice-President 15. Air transport (contd) President. \u2014 The next item is a continuation of the debate on the Schwartzenberg report (Doc. 1-286/ 82). Mr Clinton. \u2014 Mr President, this draft regulation sets out to advance competition, and it is difficult not to be completely in favour of competition. Even to qualify one's enthusiasm for competition may seem reaction ary. We are dealing here, however, with an essential public utility, i.e., civil aviation, and my own country, being an island on the periphery of the Community, has a very keen perception of aviation as a vital public service. We cannot therefore give an unqualified endorsement to the idea of competition in this area. The Association of European Airlines, comprising over 20 of the main airlines of Europe both publicly and privately owned, has this to say: 'Competition is not an end in itself, it is a means to an end. If stability, dependability, quality of service and controlled growth of a given industry are the objectives, excessive com petition may not be the best way to achieve the required goal.' Excessive competition, or opening up the industry to the possibility of excessive competition, will do great harm and bring into Europe the United States' disease of instability, price wars, bankruptcies and cancellation of services, particularly to smaller communities, with disastrous results. Our main con cern with this draft directive is that unfriendly and doctrinaire regulators could use it to prevent the estab lished multilateral machinery of coordination from working satisfactorily, machinery which has been built up over the years to monitor and develop civil aviation in the interests of the consumer and of the wider public. Unfortunately, the Schwartzenberg report expresses commitment to the idea of competition per se and fails to recognize the complexity of aviation as an international public utility requiring certain exemp tions if it is to function adequately. We note in particular the stark contrast between the Commission's proposals in relation to aviation and its proposals in relation to sea transport, where explicit sanction is given to fare fixing and capacity determina tion by the carriers themselves and without the sur veillance by governments which safeguards the public interest in the case of aviation. The draft regulation and the report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs seem to elevate to supreme status the competition articles of the Treaty, but there are many other significant and relevant articles which seem to be ignored. Article 2, in defining the very task of the Community, gives pride of place to harmonious development of economic activities, a continuous and balanced expan sion, and increase in stability. Article 74 says that transport matters shall be part of the common trans port policy, but this has not yet been defined. Article 75 says that transport regulatory measures should take account of the standard of living and employment in certain areas and also speaks of the need for enterprises to be given time to adapt. Unani- ",
        "17.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/245 Clinton mous Council decisions are also provided for. Article 78 says: measures taken within the framework of the Treaty in respect of transport rates and condi tions shall take account of the economic circumstances of carriers. These provisions of the Treaty are not reflected in the draft regulation, and even when we come to the com petition articles of the Treaty the draft regulation is selective and discriminatory. Article 85(3) provides that exemption from the competition rules may be laid down for agreements which improve production or distribution of goods or which promote technical or economic progress. Such exemptions seem appropriate for a multilaterally coordinated industry like civil avia tion. Article 90(2) provides that certain undertakings are not to be hampered by the competition rules from performing their assigned tasks. But that is just the threat which the draft regulation poses for air trans port undertakings. In viewing the Schwartzenberg resolution, we note that the concluding plea of the Committee on Trans port for evolution and protection against damaging the system was not adequately taken into account. However, I am glad to note that important amend ments, including some by my colleague, Mr O'Don- nell, have been tabled to the report, and we would strongly recommend that those which attempt to ame liorate the drafts in their present form and reflect the thinking of the Committee on Transport should be endorsed by Parliament. Finally, I would say this. Air transport is an essential public service particularly for Ireland. In the interests of temporary consumer benefits or doctrinaire beliefs in free market forces, pressures are being mounted which threaten instability and crisis. I believe Parlia ment should resist these pressures. (Applause) President. \u2014 I call Mr Adamou. Mr Adamou. \u2014 (GR) Mr President, in connection with the topic under discussion today I should like to talk about the Greek national airline, Olympic Air ways. Despite the unstinting efforts by staff, the performance of the airways cannot be considered satisfactory at present. The company is stagnating because of bad management, constantly-changing policies and government interventions. When Greece joined the Community and when Community regulations on air carriers entered into force, Olympic Airways was in danger of liquidation. The first attempt to implement these regulations occurred on 15 December 1981, at a meeting of Transport Ministers in Brussels. Discussing interregional airroutes, three Ministers demanded that aviation companies of the Member States of the Com munity be allowed to operate domestic flights within Greece. In practice, this would have meant over whelming competition in Greece, resulting in the bankruptcy and dissolution of Olympic Airways. This decision was prevented, thanks to the veto of the Greek Government, but now this subject is back on the agenda. The Commission directive on transport charges for regular air-services will have the same result as far as Olympic Airways is concerned. The aim of this directive \u2014 if it is implemented \u2014 is not to bring air transport charges down by creating an effec tive European air network unfettered by national res trictions, but rather to create unfair competition in Greece. If foreign air companies are allowed to oper ate charter flights on regular routes even to provincial towns within Greece, this will have catastrophic conse quences for Olympic Airways. The Greek Communist Party is categorically opposed to any extension of the rules of competition to air transport in general and to the fixing of transport charges by the Community in particular. We insist that international transport charges continue to be fixed on the basis of decisions by the IATA based on the prin ciple of unanimity and the right of veto. We believe, therefore, that if air transport charges are allowed to be fixed within a Community framework and the pro cedures provided for are implemented, if restrictions are imposed on agreements concluded by sovereign Member States with third countries and, finally, if Member States are forbidden to subsidize their air car riers, then this will have catastrophic results for the Greek national airline. We shall therefore vote against Mr Schwartzenberg's report. President. \u2014 I call Mr Lalor. Mr Lalor. \u2014 Mr President, I want to make it clear first of all that unless the Schwartzenberg resolution is substantially altered by amendments in the morning, I shall be unable to support it. The resolution says that there is a need for a gradual and balanced increase in competition in the air transport sector. I question that contention and I reject it. When we last had a major debate here on air transport over 12 months ago, we had Members waxing elo quent in castigating national airlines and alleged car tels, while Laker was paraded as all that was ideal in highpowered, progressive, effective, exemplary and utopian airlines. All others were challenged to compete with him. What has happened? Since then Laker has gone with the wind. Gone with the wind ! Yes, taking with him Braniff in the US and leaving pretty well all the other airlines floundering around in his wake. Pan Am, the world's most experienced airline, has had to sell its headquarters and dispose of its hotel chain in ",

Sabena showed annual losses of $ 53 000 000 ... (Interruptions from the European Democratic Group) I presume I shall get extra time, Mr President, to deal with the interruptions . . . (Laughter) Somebody says it is a pleasure to listen to me, and I wish they would! (Laughter) El Al dropped $45 000 000 in 1981. We have just heard about the difficulties Olympic Airways have in Greece. Our Irish airline, Aer Lingus, has had to bor row itself almost out of business in order to survive. I realize that that seems to be a contradiction in terms, but that is the situation. The Commission proposal for this Council regulation is based on Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty, without adequate reference to Article 84(2), which states that 'the Council may, acting unanimously, decide whether, to what extent and by what procedure appro priate provisions may be laid down for sea and air transport'. My colleague, Mr Clinton, has dealt with sea transport. Now the drafters of the Treaties built in this important provision immediately before drafting the rules on competition, Articles 85-90. Here we had recognition by those farseeing fathers of ours, who even then could see what the Commissioner and some others of us cannot see now some 20 years later, that international civil aviation was not only an extremely complex industry but was already heavily monitored in the interests of the public and of the Community by numerous instruments of international law and con ventions. Mr President, I respectfully submit that the draft pro posal from the Commission supported by this resolu tion is simply suggesting change for the sake of change. It seems to me that the Commission is anxious to make a gesture by pandering to the ever-vocal con sumers' lobby, which in this instance, of course, includes all of us MEPs. It has succeeded with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which sees the proposal as benefiting airline users and gener ating greater productivity among airlines. I disagree. The Commission should not make regulations on competition or other rules for air transport until there is a common policy for all EEC transport, as indicated by Articles 2 and 74. Then we would have a yardstick to go by, but only then. (Applause) President. \u2014 I call the Commission. Mr Andriessen, Member of the Commission. \u2014 (NL) Mr President, it is perhaps a coincidence that the transport policy of the Community has already been debated on several days this week. Last Monday I spoke here on the subject of air transport, and I con sider myself privileged to be called upon again to speak in this Parliament on a proposal which I believe is very important, although not everyone in this House seems to share that view. Whenever the subject of transport is raised, people say that the field of action is so vast and the area which the Commission is prepared to tackle so small that the two cannot stand compari son. And yet, Mr President, with your permission, I wish to stress its importance; the serious attention paid by the committees of Parliament to the proposal under discussion shows too that it is an important one. May I begin, Mr President, by expressing my gratitude to all the Committees of Parliament which have dealt with this issue and to the rapporteur, Mr Schwartzen berg. Although nothing happened for a long time about Community transport, we now see that the Commission has taken initiatives in many areas, not least of all in air transport. I am prepared to defend these modest contributions of the Commission against the plethora of wishes expressed by many, although not all, Members of this House. I can well understand parallels being drawn between air and sea transport, but I would add immediately that these two sectors are totally incomparable. I can equally well appreciate the disappointment that no greater progress has been made in a Community transport policy than is the case today. Mr President, there are a number of specific propo sals, and the Commission is extremely pleased about that. I shall confine myself at the moment to those proposals under discussion at present in this House. The Commission is highly pleased at the almost gen eral approval of its proposal. Mr President, it is falla cious to believe that the rules on competition in the Treaty are not applicable at present to air transport. The ruling of the Court has shown that they are. What we are trying to do here is to bring the Community's influence to bear on air transport. The reason why no derogations are admitted in certain sectors is that the Commission believes the rules on competition should be applied gradually in this highly complicated sector. That does not mean to say that the Commission will not issue specific instructions at a given moment as to what does and what does not constitute a derogation. It does mean, and this seems to be in line with the view of the Member who urged caution, that the rules on competition must be applied gradually in the field of air transport. In this sector, much importance is paid to the opinions of this House. We agree that competition in air transport must be expanded. We cannot persist in having nearly all other sectors of economic activity in the Community being subject to Community law on competition but air ",
        "17.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/247 Andriessen traffic falling without that ambit. That may be in the interests of the governments, but not in the long run of society or of consumers. The Commission will take action in this area as it does in other spheres of econo mic activity. This is how the Commission can make a valuable contribution to the development of an air transport policy with fair opportunities for expansion. In this matter the Commission does not intend to dif ferentiate between private and public undertakings. The step we are taking here today is a first step, some people think a modest step; others, it would appear from the debate, believe it is already going too far. But in the Commission's view it is at any rate an important step towards gradually introducing the rules on com petition into this sector. Our regulation is admittedly limited. The relationship between governments and airlines is extremely impor tant here, and the Commission must gain as much information as possible on this relationship. We are aware that many governments want to retain the right to approve or reject air fares. This does not simplify our task. We are in the process of analysing the results, but are still awaiting clarification on some aspects of the relationship between governments and airlines on fixing air fares. Nevertheless, I intend to draw up an interim report on this subject in the com ing months and shall, of course, keep Parliament informed. The resolution quite rightly points out the need to establish structural conditions for fair competition in the sector of air transport. The problem is that in this sector there are bilateral contracts between countries which lay down that only one carrier per country may operate on a specific route. I think this is a problem we shall have to concentrate on in the future, and I think it particularly desirable that the Commission should examine the questions of access to the market and freedom of services in air transport in application of Articles 61 and 84(2) of the Treaty, for which my col league Mr Contogeorgis bears the main responsibility. Mr President, may I at the end of my statement in this debate make a few general points arising directly from what I have just said? The Commission has to date submitted two directives to the Council, one on interregional air transport, the other on air fares. Both are aimed at applying the policy on competition to air traffic. So far the Council has not given a very positive response. Indeed, thee is even a danger that in the present discussions the directives are being stripped of their very essence. It has appeared that some Member States have in these talks strongly urged maintaining the status quo and have asked for far-reaching exemp tions for tariff agreements, pooling contracts and what have you. Mr President, it is quite impossible at the moment to predict the outcome of the interim report I mentioned. I confirm, however, that despite all the difficulties in our path, the Commission will remain active in the months ahead. Specific proposals have been made this evening, particularly concerning ways of applying the regulation under discussion. The Commission intends to produce very specific proposals when it has gained more insight into this whole matter, but at the moment this is unfortunately not yet possible. My final word, Mr President. The Legal Affairs Com mittee has made a number of points on the text of the regulation. The Commission recognizes the validity of a number of these points, and I can inform you that in the near future a revised version of the regulation will be printed in the Official Journal. President. \u2014 I call Mr Pearce on a point of order. Mr Pearce. \u2014 Mr President, just in case there was a possibility of a slight mistranslation earlier on I won der if, for the sake of clarity, I could have it confirmed to me that the reason the gentleman gave why Mr But tafuoco was not present to make the speech which he was due to make was that he could not afford the air fare to come here. President. \u2014 Mr Pearce, that was not a point of order. I call Miss Forster. Miss Forster. \u2014 Mr President, the Commissioner has made a very important statement which I personally welcome. May 1 put two brief questions to him on what he has said? This is a most important industry and I feel that this whole question of competition should be . . . President. \u2014 You can put your supplementary ques tions in writing, and the Commissioner will surely be prepared to answer them in writing; but we cannot open another debate. I hope that everyone agrees on this. The debate is closed. The vote will be taken at the next voting-time. 16. Market for electronic products President. \u2014 The next item is the report by Mr Her man, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the state of the market for elec tronic products in Europe and on the consequences for employment (Doc. 1-189/82). ",
        "No 1-286/248 Debates of the European Parliament 17.6.82 President The debate also includes the following oral question, with debate, by Mr D'Angelosante and others to the Commission (Doc. 1-259/82): Subject: Outlook for Siemens-Elettra plants in Italy. Does the Commission not think it should use the direct and indirect instruments at its disposal and intervene as a matter of urgency to prevent the multinational firm Siemens-Elettra, which has violated the undertakings given and disregarded the damage its attitude could cause in one of the economically most backward regions of Italy, from rejecting the favourable proposals made to it by the Italian Government to prevent the closure of its ACE branch plants in Sulmona? How docs the Commission plan to control the tendency of this company to reduce and even tually cease its activities in Italy regardless of the effect this would have on the economic and employment crisis and to prefer speculative invest ments in areas of the world where cheap labour is available? I call the rapporteur. of the production and marketing of the whole data- processing line, and this implies coordinated efforts of research and the creation of a European market in data-processing, which is far from being the case today. Despite the repeated efforts of the Commission, despite support from this Parliament, the Council still seems unable to formulate a policy in this area. The second condition is the following: since the jobs created are not of the same quality and nature as the jobs lost, a considerable effort of adaptation, mobiliza tion and recycling of the workforce will be indispens able. The third condition is that the gains in productiv ity which will result from the spread of information technologies should be distributed in the form of reductions in working time rather than in the form of direct or indirect wage increases. But another thing is equally certain. This is that any policy which would oppose the progress of data-pro cessing through the fear of losing jobs or the desire to retain jobs already existing would be suicidal for the European economy and fatal for employment in the long run. We have no choice. The United States, Japan and the countries of South-East Asia will not wait for us. Mr Herman, rapporteur. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report it is my privilege to present to you was unanimously accepted in our committee, with the exception of one abstention. This says much for the consensus that was made possible by the coop eration and the mutual understanding of my col leagues, to whom I wish to express my gratitude. As has been the case for all previous technological innovations, the spread of the use of microprocessors will have a favourable effect on economic growth, on the quality of life, on social progress, and, in the long term, on employment, even though in the short term the number of jobs lost will probably exceed the num ber of jobs created. The deep concern felt in this regard is due to three factors: the first is that the pro gress has been tremendous and the cost decreases without precedent, which was not the case for earlier technological discoveries. The second factor is that the favourable effects on employment may be felt in other places and at other times than the other favourable effects linked to the spread of activities connected with these new technologies. And the third factor is that the numerous studies made, which have excited consider able interest, have contributed towards the develop ment of this anxiety. These studies, however, point in different directions; for each one there exists another supporting the opposite view, and for this reason it is necessary to be very cautious in this matter. It is certain that the favourable effect on employment which will result from the spread of these technologies can only be felt in Europe if three conditions are met. The first is that Europe must acquire technical mastery I would like now to make some brief observations on the four amendments which have been tabled on my text. I have no objection to Amendment No 1, pre sented by Mrs Theobald-Paoli; on the contrary, I am very favourably disposed towards it. On the other hand, Mrs Duty's Amendment No 2 is absolutely unacceptable, considering the difficulties already encountered in the spread of technological progress. We must not subject this progress to further condi tions; in particular, it should not have to depend on negotiations which might be used as a means of exert ing pressure to obtain a whole series of other objec tives. Amendment No 3 is not very important in itself: when we talk about using the gains in productivity to the advantage of the consumers, it is clear that this means reducing prices. Consequently, this is almost a tautol ogy, but I am willing to accept Amendment No 3. On the other hand, Amendment No 4 proposes a pro cedure which, on thfc level of practical application, is completely impossible. For this reason I can only recommend the rejection of Amendment No 4. President. \u2014 I call the Committee on External Econ omic Relations.

        "17.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/249 Rieger like to make a few short remarks which of themselves will convey nothing new to the House or the Com munity but which demonstrate the need for a con certed effort in this field. The motion for a resolution underlying this report was primarily dictated by alarm at job losses in the elec tronics sector. This alarm can be attributed to the existence of a significant trade imbalance between the Community and Japan which has not heretofore been effectively tackled. Whilst there is nothing new in all of this, it should be noted that the already consider able deficit in bilateral trade with Japan worsened in 1980-81, and the figures involved are nothing short of horrifying. The Community's negative balance of trade with Japan finds its corollary in the employment statistics and, in particular, in certain branches of the electronics sector. Some of these have been very ser iously hurt, and this was the point of departure of the motion for a resolution. In forming its opinion, adopted unanimously with one abstention, the Committee on External Economic Relations made a thorough examination of the course of action open to us and firmly reiterated its opposi tion to protectionism. We consider that the European electronics industry must evolve a positive strategy to counter the Japanese challenge. At the same time, however, we realize that the Treaty has given the Community the means to protect its economies in cer tain preordained circumstances. Article 113 sets out the characteristics of the common commercial policy based on uniform principles, while Articles 108 and 109 provide a safeguard clause in the event of a bal- ance-of-payments crisis in a Member State. To these must be added the safeguard measures contained in GATT, particularly Article 19. I do not intend to go into detail on the effects this has on our attitude towards, for example, Japan and the United States but rather to point out the opinion of our committee on the Community's trading relations with Japan. Sir John Steward Clark's report for our committee treats these trading relations in some consi derable detail. Our committee deems it essential that national govern ments coordinate, to a greater degree than has hereto fore been the case, their trade policies as far as possible to ensure that the Member States at last speak with one voice in their dealings with Japan. Furthermore, we see the need for European industry to develop effective measures in the field of research and develop ment in order to respond to the Japanese challenge. We are determined, even when faced with this difficult and, at times, catastrophic situation for certain branches of the electronics industry, to comply to the letter with the GATT rules in force and will strive to ensure that they cqntinue to be the basis of our trading relations, particularly with our principal trading part ners. A Community industrial-technological strategy could, in our opinion, then have positive results, thereby leading to an improvement in the employment situation in the electronics sector. (Applause) President. \u2014 I call the Socialist Group. Mr Seal. \u2014 Mr President, speaking in general on behalf of the Socialist Group, I may say that we sup port this motion. But there are one or two points which we feel are not so good. It may be that they have lost something in the translation. I think that the Member States of the Community, as the report indicates, must produce their own electron ics, or at least be in a position to do so. As the USA and Japan increase their leads, our dependence upon these two countries increases, and this gives them an advantage, not only in the fields where electronics are a major component but in those where they are only a sizeable minor component. Machine tools provide a good example. More and more machine tools aire computer-controlled, and unfortunately Japan sells to Europe most of the elec tronic controls for machine tools. But it sells them to us at a price higher than that at which they sell them to their Japanese producers of machine tools. This gives them an advantage, not only in electronics but also in machine toolsj and this is something we must consider. As we become more and more dependent on electron ics, we shall, unless we improve, become more and more dependent upon Japan and the United States. We have already seen the problems caused by depend ency with our dependency on oil; and there are many areas where we are falling further and further behind the United States and Japan. Here we must make efforts either to capture the market or at least to be able to produce. There are other areas where we have our own distinc tive competence, and it is here that we must make a supreme effort to retain our technological lead and keep in advance of the USA and Japan. If we do not, we shall be handing over our producing processes and our jobs to the Japanese and the Americans. As I said earlier, Mr President, I think this report has its deficiencies. The title indicates that it is about the state of the market for electronic products in Europe and the consequences for employment. To me it is no good merely calling for a response from the Com munity. We have done this time and time before, and nothing yet has happened. The Commission must spell out the action that needs to be taken. Leaving the re sponse to what we call the good sense of private com panies does not work. We have seen in the United Kingdom that it does not work. We have to plan our ",
        "No 1-286/250 Debates of the European Parliament 17.6.82 Seal production and we have to plan our trade. Member State governments and the Commission must ensure that any gaps in our production in electronics are met, and this will not necessarily be done by leaving it to private companies. What we require are publicly- owned companies to fill these gaps. Now in Japan \u2014 and I have just come back from a visit to Japan \u2014 there is a very close relationship between the government and industry. They work together on planning ahead, and they keep to those plans. Japan is an example of detailed planning in a capitalist society, and it is only now that they are beginning to experience some of the problems that capitalist controls bring. In the United States, the gaps are filled either by the government handing out def ence contracts or NASA handing out space race con tracts. But in Europe we have nothing: there is only the French Government beginning to plan systemati cally the growth of its electronic industry. Therefore, weakly calling upon the Community to respond, as this report does, is useless. Let the Commission prod uce plans and then persuade the Member States' gov ernments to support them! Mr Herman's vague suggestion in this report, 'Making a reality of the Common Market', which is something we have not done, I agree, 'will achieve a European response' is not acceptable. The report is entitled 'Europe': it is not entitled 'EEC', and this suggestion to me is pie in the sky, as we say in the United Kingdom. I would also like to point out that paragraph 5 \u2014 and Mr Herman has acknowledged this to some extent \u2014 is to me very badly written, and whilst I know of Mr Herman's concern from talking to him in the Com mittee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I feel that Mrs Th\u00e9obald-Paoli's amendment must be accepted. I cannot, however, agree with the report that we need greater anti-monopoly legislation, and this is contrary to Mr Herman's own idea of a Community response. We are competing against massive firms in the United States and Japan, and competition among many small European firms will solve nothing. In addition, in some fields \u2014 and one of these is telecommunications \u2014 the industries must be national industries, they must be publicly owned. Let me say to my comrades over there from the United Kingdom that the Tory Government's attempts to split up the Post Office side of telecommunications is stupidly doctrinaire and can only result in the industry going to the Japanese and to United States firms. With these reservations, Mr President, I will support the report. But I warn the Commission that they are going to have to work much harder and they must come up with the goods if we are going to keep a European foothold in our electronics industry. Let me turn to the employment side. The effects on employment of advanced technologies I have eluci dated many times in this Chamber, and they are well documented in the parliamentary records. I would just say that I feel that this report is not to my mind the proper occasion to debate the problems of unemploy ment: that falls within the competence of the Com mittee on Social Affairs and Employment. President. \u2014 I call the Group of the European Peo ple's Party (Christian-Democratic Group). Mr I. Friedrich. \u2014 (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome this report by our friend Mr Herman for its accuracy, honesty and appropriateness. I share the view that the citizens of the Community have the right to demand that the Community speak with one voice on this matter. It is a fact that Member States individually have neither the capacity, the know-how nor the possibilities of responding effec tively to such a challenge. However, I cannot repress a wry smile when Mr Seal talks about the awaited salvation from State-run or nationalized companies. My dear Mr Seal, in what position do the British nationalized corporations, hav ing competed so successfully, find themselves? Where is Austin? Where are all the nationalized British cor porations? Where are the successful companies to be found? Are IBM, Volkswagen and Mercedes national ized? Those are the successful modern companies at the summit of technology and progress. Personally, I cannot think of a single example, not even in Eastern Europe, of a massive monopolistic State-run company at the height of progress ! In the Federal Republic, indeed in the Community generally, we have the highest standard of living and the most comprehensive social-security system in the world. But this much is clear: we can only maintain this standard of living by having at our disposal the most sophisticated technology available. It is equally certain that this standard of living cannot be main tained with a 35-hour working week, the highest production costs in the world and an outdated tech nology. What is needed is the fresh air of competition, which brings forth effort, but not only from top manage ment. It goes without saying that a top management is necessary and that it must quite naturally be prepared to put in more than a forty-, fifty- or sixty-hour work ing week. Efforts must also be made by the middle- range posts, the engineer and the employee. To take the whip only to the top management in an effort to double output will not get us very far. Everyone has to chip in and, my dear Mr Seal, the theory of the French Socialists that with the dawn of the socialist epoch in France, may be seen the begin ning of paradise on earth has been the most glorious disaster on earth.

The false prophets who advocated throwing money to the masses, thus bringing forth welfare of itself will, within the coming months, be dashed against the rocks in the greatest shipwreck of all times.

If the State encourages its leading citizens in the same way we shall have a chance, after a certain time-lag, of success as a result of these mea sures. But for a politician to adopt a laissez-faire atti tude and say, 'Citizens, we shall do everything you desire' would be the worst thing we could possibly do for him, for a year later, he is the one who will have to foot the bill, not the country's rulers.

This attitude is disastrous! The ecologists should have been in favour of technol ogy, given its low consumption of raw materials, its environment-friendly and radiation-free characteris tics. The only way of stabilizing and guaranteeing employment is, if at all possible, with the aid of the most sophisticated technology. I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Herman, on this report. It would be a commendable measure on its part if the House adopted it unanimously. (Applause) President. \u2014 I call the European Democratic Group. Sir John Stewart Clark. \u2014 Mr President, I should like to compliment Mr Herman on his fine report, and Mr Friedrich on his very fine speech. I support the motion for a resolution. I would like to concentrate this evening on the chal lenge which we face in adapting our industries and our schools to the new technologies. The widespread introduction of microelectronics has been described as a third industrial revolution. Like all revolutions, it involves change. It arouses fear and uncertainty, all the more so because it affects peoples' lives at every point \u2014 during their education, their training for work, the kind of work they do and where they work. If intro duced successfully, it may change society's whole atti tude to work. If not introduced successfully, then Europe will find itself undercut by its competitors who have adapted, and serious unemployment will follow. There is no reason, however, why this change in our industrial habits should be feared, provided that we realize the importance of training. Without a massive effort to re-train the workforce, Europe will be unable to respond to the challenges of modern technology. Without a coordinated approach to training in all its aspects, Europe's hopes in this field will be disap pointed. The timing of the industrial change in which we find ourselves in crucial. The degree to which we can recognize what is happening about us as a result of microelectronics and to which we plan for change will be crucial to our future prosperity. Both management and unions still really need to be convinced of the long-term gain in company profitability and the ben efits to the lives of the working population which are likely to accrue from the new technology. If they are to conclude the radical technology agreements neces sary for industrial adaptation, they have to be con vinced that there is a real possibility of early voluntary retirement, longer holidays and fewer working hours; but always in return for increased productivity. May I turn now to training, which is the hub of the issue. The single biggest block to our expansion in microelectronics today is the critical shortage of suit ably skilled labour and of suitably skilled teachers to train and re-train that labour. The European software industry alone estimates that it is short of many thou sands of computer programmers and systems analysts. This manpower shortage is contributing to the erosion of our competitive advantage, and it must be redressed. At a time of rising unemployment, this is a dreadful waste of opportunity. We ask the Commission to speed up the process of bringing together representatives of industry, the unions and teaching faculties to work out a European programme for training staff and workers in industry. A systematic survey should be made to establish the need for skilled electronics engineers and software programmers and to agree on the extent and methods of training which should be carried out. The Social Fund is not being properly exploited and seems to be mainly aimed at semi-skilled and non- ",
        "No 1-286/252 Debates of the European Parliament 17.6.82 Stewart Clark skilled workers but not at specifically trained techni cians. Increased emphasis must be given in the Social Fund to the new technologies, and we cannot forget that most young unemployed and school-leavers are bereft of even the most basic computer-oriented skills. We must therefore ensure that all those colleges of further education involved in training young people to work in the electronics and related industries have the most modern equipment available. In addition, we must ensure that the curricula of such colleges are geared to the impact of new office tech nology on business and commercial education. Could the Commission not usefully sponsor a study project in this area in an attempt to find what is needed and with this information stimulate the prepar ation of common standards for technical qualifications at this level? If common professional standards for the microelectronics industry and its associated industries are not arrived at in the very near future, they will become progressively harder to establish as each coun try starts to set its own. Mr President, we see a widening technology gap with the USA and Japan, which can only be closed by hav ing sufficient top scientists and technicians available in Europe. We need more institutes of higher education and universities to specialize in microelectrortics work ing in conjunction with the major employers in the area. This will ensure that the skills acquired are also geared to industry's needs. The Community should consider creating a centre of excellence in Europe similar to Silicon Valley. We should establish a European Institute of Technology where scholars and scientists from all over the Com munity can come to study and work. I believe Mr Narjes has some sympathy for this recommendation. Mr President, there must also be early changes in trad itional school curricula to include the understanding of the microelectronic age. In addition to this, there is a basic requirement for the use of computer-assisted learning. This has to be increased and speeded up in all schools. There are far too few secondary schools today with a microcomputer installed. Finally, I would suggest two further solutions. Firstly, there should be school computer centres in each town throughout the Community. Secondly, we must have a systematic campaign for recruiting industrialists to train existing teachers in computer science and elec tronics at night schools. Unless we tackle this whole question of training, Mr President, we shall fail. It is vital to the future of Europe, to employment and to technology. IN THE CHAIR: MR NIKOLAOU Vice-President President. \u2014 I call the Communist and Allies Group. Mr Leonardi. \u2014 (IT) Mr President, we are in favour of the opinions expressed by Mr Herman in his report, at least in general terms, and we shall therefore vote for the corresponding motion for a resolution. Certainly, this discussion, which has been pursued in this Chamber for years, is always interesting. It would be well, however, to arrive at some practical solutions; otherwise we shall be saying the correct things, but running the risk of repeating them too often. There is no doubt that technical progress favours social development; however, it must be controlled, and prevented from working for the advantage of the few and to the detriment of the many. It is certain that workers who are laid off because of technical innova tions introduced into the companies must face the problem of where they can go on working and sup porting their families. Therefore it is all very well to pronounce in favour of technical development; it is necessary, however, to ensure that this development is directed towards the common interest. Personally, I should have liked to add certain consi derations on industrial democracy, for workers' con trol of the aspects of technical progress undoubtedly poses problems of industrial democracy, which can in their turn be favoured by the growth of electronic and computer technology. Therefore we should see these problems from an overall viewpoint, in their social context and thereby also in connection with the prob lem of the consensus for technical progress itself, which poses, as I have said, problems of industrial democracy. We have always been opposed to the defence of acquired positions which are contrary to technical pro gress; these positions are contrary to the interests of the workers, and, at a certain point, they turn into pure demagogy leading to the defeat of the workers instead of to their victory. Industrial democracy is therefore essential \u2014 as I have already said \u2014 for solving the problem of the control of technical pro gress, and it is the only way to ensure that this pro gress works in the interests of the majority and not in the interests of only a few. Another argument which I would have attempted to bring out more clearly is that for our countries tech nical progress, particularly in the electronics sector, should be dealt with at the Community level, and I would have been more explicit in saying that all the attempts formerly made and still being made today in the individual countries to deal with these problems on ",
        "17.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/253 Leonardi the national level lead to certain failure, to a waste of resources and a waste of time. Here we must be aware of the greater difficulties, dif ficulties which are raised here in Parliament. In fact, when practical problems must be faced, an attempt is always made to defend short-term and local interests. I would also like to say that the Commission, on the subject of technical progress, has written many pages and made extensive proposals, in general terms, with out dealing with precise sectors and problems of tech nical progress. For example, in the field of communi cations or computerized machine tools or robotiza- tion, we could ask the Commission for development programmes on the Community level, specific and detailed programmes which would lay down objectives and means suitable for their attainment. Only in this way can we go forward and break out of the vicious circle of general declarations which have been made by the dozen both here and in the old par liamentary chamber, and come nearer to specific objectives. It is certain \u2014 as has been mentioned by other speak ers as well \u2014 that the development of these technolo gies can only take place on the Community level, but it will require a close collaboration among the govern ments and therefore also between the Community governments and the companies. I will not, as Mr Friedrich did, discuss the question of whether these companies should be public or private ones. The essen tial point is that all means should be employed in order to attain these objectives. I therefore call upon the Commission, in the wake of Mr Herman's report, to deal with specific problems and sectors and to indicate to us the means to be used for this purpose. President. \u2014 I call Mrs Th\u00e9obald-Paoli. Mrs Th\u00e9obald-Paoli. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too have just returned from Japan. I went there twice in three months, and I could say much about what I learned there. I have no time for this, however, since I have but four minutes to speak. This is why I will table a motion for a resolution during the week \u2014 it is nearly ready \u2014 in which I will furnish the general outline of the proposal made at the Versailles Summit which I would like to see adopted at Euro pean level. I would nevertheless like to make a brief remark in parentheses, for I am worried about Mr Friedrich's health. I am afraid that he will suffer a heart attack because of the French nationalizations, and I want to reassure him, for the state of the technologies, data- processing and computer science, was exactly what was worrying us. All these industries were in the hands of private companies which none the less benefited from public funds in the form of sizeable subsidies. We know what condition they were in despite this aid; they were clearly incapable of meeting any sort of challenge. Today the public, nationalized sector will \u00b7 take up the challenges. This is my hope. Mr Friedrich \u2014 I believe he has gone to the infirmary \u2014 can be calm; all is well. I come now to Mr Herman's report, which I person ally much appreciated, I found it a trifle lacking in cer tain respects, but this is not Mr Herman's fault, for he did not have the means to carry out a complete ana lysis of the effects on employment. Also, the facilities I suggest in my amendment were aimed at saving time. I warmly thank Mr Herman for having accepted this amendment, which gives us means which at present are not available to us. I am aware that the American and Japanese initiatives in public and private investment pose a threat to employment. This necessitates the immediate applica tion in Europe of a vigorous policy in the sector of electronic and information technologies. Such an industrial policy should be to the overall benefit of the Member States, and not involve solely the restructur ing of sectors experiencing difficulties. In order to do this, I believe we must move in two directions: first, towards a more coherent legal and Community envi ronment. The profound differences existing among the national markets have incontestably hindered the development of European undertakings in this sector. Secondly, conditions should be created for a competi tive supply, both on the European and on the world market. This implies a large-scale effort of research. In a motion for a resolution, I myself proposed that the Community earmark 3% of its budget for research. Since innvoation in these sectors is extremely rapid, as you know, it is necessary to encourage the companies to pool their efforts, an action indispensable for ensur ing increased profitability. In order to succeed, we must be guided by one impor tant consideration: employment, for there can be no technological progress against a background of unem ployment, which tends to create a climate of pessimism and encourages attitudes of withdrawal and suspicion. In fact, the new technologies can lead to the creation of employment, not only through the production of new industrial goods, but also through the services associated with them \u2014 distribution, engineering, consultation, training, leisure-time activities. Indeed, the real question is not the loss of jobs in the sector of electronics or data-processing because of extra-Euro pean competition; it is rather the more general issue of job substitution, which must be carried out in a swift and orderly manner. This substitution cannot be only quantitative. It will include a large-scale transformation in content and ",
        "No 1-286/254 Debates of the European Parliament 17.6.82 Th\u00e9obald-Paoli organization, and it will also lead to a further reduc tion in working-time. This is why an increased effort in training and profes sional mobility is needed. This effort must be applied on a priority basis to engineers and technicians who are called upon to develop these new techniques, and to the young unemployed. It must make possible the conversion to the new technologies and thus facilitate professional mobility. The new technologies should also be used to improve living and working conditions. Electronics and infor mation technologies are a powerful tool for the auto mation of dangerous or repetitive tasks. The new pos sibilities in communication implicit in these techniques can open up other fields as well. What is ultimately at stake here is the appearance of new conditions for exchanges and dialogue. The new world centre of information technology and human resources in Paris was created with this in mind. The Socialists believe that if Europe is able to attain the position it ought to hold in electronics and data-processing, if it can apply the policies which will prevent the rejection of these techniques, it will be able to play an important part in the new civilization of communication which will give rise to a true cultural flowering in the future. President. \u2014 I call Mr Fernandez. higher level of qualifications should permit an increase in wages. We are convinced that technological innovation and the development of the use of electronics can be the central element of a policy aimed at overcoming the crisis. The problem of the necessary social changes must also be clearly stated, particularly the question of the relationship between man and machine, that of workers' rights within the companies, and that of working and wage conditions. It will be clear that I regard Mr Herman's report as far from being adequate on this complex of issues. He fails to make it clear that innovation and electronic development presuppose growth and resistance to aus terity. For this reason we cannot vote in favour of this report, even though it takes into account the need to increase aid for research and acknowledges the reality of American and Japanese domination in the sectors con cerned. This domination, in our opinion, calls for the development of these sectors and for protection against excessive imports from the United States and Japan. Finally, while we believe it necessary to coordinate the national efforts, it is evident that the development of electronics and the creation of jobs in this sector must be supported by the national efforts and the industrial policies of each member country. Mr Fernandez. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, electronics can be the basis not only for job-producing industrial growth \u2014 which is often forgotten \u2014 but also for a new way of working, a new relationship between man and the machine. We believe indeed that the work of a skilled worker whose task is dehumanizing and reductive must disap pear. Electronics makes this possible through automa tion, or what is today called robotization. The construction of flexible workplaces, for example, that is, a high degree of automation in a cycle adapt able to production, can free the worker from subjec tion to repetitive tasks and enrich his work. Seen from the standpoint of economic growth, this robotization can, thanks to electronics, be a creator of jobs, and particularly of skilled jobs. This should permit the modification of the criteria of economic management and the substitution of the cri terion of economic and social effectiveness for that of financial profitability through the exploitation of labour; for, if electronics can free man from repetitive and dehumanizing tasks, it can at the same time increase competitiveness, and this, let us note in pass ing, contradicts the idea which maintains that compe titiveness is linked to the level of wages. Similarly, the President. \u2014 I call the Commission. Mr Narjes, Member of the Commission. \u2014 (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Herman on his circumspect and responsibly-constructed report on such a vital matter. On behalf of the Commission, I would like to extend our warm thanks to Parliament for the latter's support for the Commission's introduction of new information technology. At this late hour, I would like to leave aside a whole host of fundamental questions which were raised ear lier this evening. Being of a purely political nature, they should be debated by the House in the manner provided for. I would add, however, that it would be wrong to assume that the Japanese and the American electronics sectors are bereft of competition. Quite the contrary. In Japan, once the pre-competitive stage of coordinated research effort has come to an end, a fierce round of competition is unleashed among Japanese competitors to find the optimal product-price mix for the market-place. In the United States, while it is true that Federal Government procurement through the NASA, the Pentagon, the Academy of Science, etc., is very considerable, there exists, as with Japan, a ",
        "17.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/255 Narjes fiercely competitive private-enterprise sector. Any ana lysis by potential competitors in Europe which failed to take full account of these aspects of the Japanese and American markets would have serious shortcom ings. The motion for a resolution on the state of the market for electronic products in Europe and on the conse quences for employment is practically identical on all points with the ideas and recommendations of the Commission. We are advocating the necessity for national governments to coordinate their policies in this sector and to evolve a long-term Community policy of research and development. In so doing, we are trying to introduce a pre-competitive phase in Europe by creating an area of cooperation using the economies of scale afforded by the Community's size. Using the Community dimension corresponds to para graph 2 of the motion for a resolution, that is, making a reality of the common market itself. The Commission has no illusions about the extent of the American and, ever increasingly, of the Japanese inroads into the information technology sector of the market, despite Europe's impressive intellectual achievements in this sphere. The profitability of this Community sector was clearly insufficient to finance the essential long-term research and development pro grammes, the prerequisite for new products and ser vices. It is worth noting here that a range of Community- sponsored programmes are currently under way aimed at reversing the trend, even if the resources committed to such efforts have so far been limited. A Commis sion-sponsored project for a four-year data-processing programme received Council approval in 1979. This was followed, in December 1981, by the Council's approval of a Community microelectronic programme \u2014 the first ever with a strategic aim. The Commission is currently elaborating, in close collaboration with the Community electronics industry, a coordinated long- range research and development programme, the so-called 'ESPRIT' programme. It will cover all appropriate areas of information technology and should pinpoint clear, strategic objectives, in parti cular, the consolidation of European competitiveness. The Commission would like to see national govern ment procurement contracts being thrown open for tender by the Community information industry instead of being reserved for national industry. The Com munity is heavily handicapped at present \u2014 and this may partly explain some of the unresolved issues raised in the House today \u2014 by a situation in which national sectors as widely diverse as the postal service and the ministry of defence steadfastly resist any liber alization on their procurement policies. They would prefer to go under individually than cooperate in assuring the survival and expansion of a Community electronics industry in world markets. The Commission will continue its efforts to prevail upon the Council to adopt its recommendations on telecommunications, which foresee a liberalization of Member States' markets within the Community. National procurement policies contravene the Com munity long-range data-processing programme. The Commission is aware of the necessity for appropriate supervision of the trend in commercial relations within the information industry between the Community and third countries. At present, however, the means at its disposal are limited. The danger of an ever-increasing tendency towards protectionism is particularly pro nounced in the information and related branches of industry. Most of the larger industrialized Member States pro vide an extensive range of subsidies, thereby accen tuating the danger of protectionism. A coordination of these measures at Community level would, however, limit this danger. For this reason the Commission intends to coordinate national commercial policies in both the long-range data-processing research pro gramme as well as its microelectronics programme. Furthermore, the Commission believes that existing competition rules obviate the need to introduce new measures to prevent unfavourable developments for the Community and its consumers. As to the consequences for employment and the social sector of the introduction of microelectronics, the Commission reported to Parliament during the debate in plenary sitting on Mrs Salisch's excellent report on behalf of the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment. In this connection, I would like to reiterate the Com mission's conviction that the introduction and wide spread use of these new technologies affords the best long-term guarantee for employment in the Com munity. It is, in any event, quite certain that to ignore them would result in an inexorable and definitive loss of competitivity for Community products on world markets. In the short term, the introduction of new technology will result in a net job loss within the Community, not least attributable to our sluggish rate of economic growth. Numerous employees will be bereft of the skills needed to take advantage of the new jobs created in the microelectronics sector. A considerable effort will have to be made in vocational and professional training to prepare young people adequately for the new jobs created and to re-train older workers. These difficulties are surmountable and should not be used as an argument against the introduction of this new tech nology. I would especially like to draw Sir John Stewart Clark's attention to a report which the Commission presented to the Council a few days ago. It is entitled 'Professional training and the new information tech nologies: Community initiatives, 1983-87'. ",
        "No 1-286/256 Debates of the European Parliament 17.6.82 Narjes I would be only too happy to forward him a copy, as I am sure he will find a great number of answers to the very pertinent issues raised by him. Similarly, Mrs Th\u00e9obald-Paoli should find answers to many of hers. Some of the innumerable problems resulting from the introduction of these new technologies, such as retraining and the initial loss of productivity arising therefrom and impairment to competitivity, would be so much more severe and durable in the long run if the Community failed to introduce this technology. Mr Herman's excellent report correctly notes that, to be effective, the introduction of these new electronics technologies should be based on a social consensus. In connection with the conclusions reached by Mrs Sal isch's Committee on Social Affairs and Employment, the Commission is redoubling its efforts in the follow ing spheres, to name but a few: increasing the cooper ation between professional organizations and trade unions, combating unemployment while creating new jobs as a result of the new electronics technologies, and sponsoring the necessary schemes of training and further education in the aforementioned sector. It would be illusory to expect these measures to pro vide an exhaustive answer to the internal and external challenges of these new technologies. They should really be seen as part of an integrated Community- wide policy to provide economic growth and restore a suitable employment level. We would, however, warn against hard and fast ideo logical standpoints and point out, in particular, the considerable difficulty of providing up-to-date infor mation on the information-related side of the elec tronics sector in view of the rapid pace of technical innovation in both the hardware and software sectors. This whole sector has been estimated to undergo change at the rate of four times per year. Faced with such a dynamic situation, government is incapable of providing solutions. These should be left to private enterprises which, possessing the most up-to-date facts and, in touch with the market, are able to observe and analyse these developments and take decisions in con sequence. It would be a serious misjudgment to think that civil servants with their limited training in these new and constantly-evolving technologies could ever exercise such purely entrepreneurial decision-making skills. President. \u2014 The debate is closed. The vote will be taken at the next voting-time. Before proceeding to the Rieger report, I should like to inform the House, and particularly our British col leagues, that General Galtieri has resigned. 17. Inward-processing relief President. \u2014 The next item is the report by Mr Rie ger, on behalf of the Committee on External Econ omic Relations, on the proposal from the Commission to the Council (Doc. 1-974/81) for a regulation on inward-processing relief arrangements (Doc. 1-316/ 82). I call the rapporteur. Mr Rieger, rapporteur. \u2014 (DE) Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on External Economic Rela tions, I submit the report on the proposal from the Commission to the Council for a regulation on inward-processing relief arrangements. The report was adopted unanimously by our committee. I would wel come the House's emulating our committee in adopt ing unanimously our motion for a resolution. The regulation on inward-processing relief arrangements would be a new and important instrument of trade policy and would result in a notable improvement in the operation of the common commercial policy pur suant to Article 113 of the EEC Treaty. The committee believes that the rather technical nature of the Commission's proposal for a regulation conceals an event of considerable political significance. In its explanatory memorandum to the proposal for a regulation, the Commission stresses that the latter forms part of a multiannual programme for the attain ment of the customs union and represents, in addition, a contribution towards the establishment of Com munity customs law. Because of its importance amongst the various customs procedures, the Commis sion selected inward-processing arrangements as a pilot project for the implementation of the above-men tioned multiannual programme. Essentially, this involves the transformation into a pro posal for a regulation of the principles set out in a Council directive of March 1969, although certain aspects have been dealt with in greater detail and account has been taken of the extent to which the cus toms union has been attained. In short, the main object of the proposal for a regula tion is to ensure that goods may be imported under the inward-processing arrangements without incurring lia bility to payment of import duties and can be exported outside the customs territory of the Community free of export levies after processing. To achieve this, the 20 articles of the Commission's proposal cover the fol lowing main points: \u2014 definition, criteria for approval and imple mentation of inward-processing relief arrangements, and \u2014 a 'committee procedure' as well as transitional provision. ",
        "17.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/257 Rieger It is important to mention that Article 1(3) provides that inward-processing relief arrangements will also be used for the processing of import goods subject to commercial policy measures. The products covered 'by inward-processing arrange ments are very varied, ranging from salmon and cod to wool and paper. It is difficult to assess the importance of inward-processing arrangements, which varies according to the Member State concerned. Generally, however, one can say that a considerable proportion of Community trade is affected by inward-processing arrangements. In addition, one may estimate that on average the value of imported goods is doubled by processing and that the proportion of total external trade of the Community accounted for by inward-pro cessing lies somewhere between 15% and 20%. Consequently, we may consider the proposal for a regulation as part of the Commission's overall pro gramme for attaining a customs union. Parliament has repeatedly expressed support for the Commission's programme and has urged the Council to delegate more power to the Commission in customs matters. We welcome the fact that, pursuant to Article 155 of the EEC Treaty, this regulation delegates appropriate powers to the Commission to carry out such customs procedures as are economically important. We stress our awareness of the considerable importance of inward processing for external trade, particularly with regard to the employment situation in the Community. Our committee dealt quite extensively with the com mittee on customs procedures having economic impli cations, referred to in Article 16. It shall, pursuant to Article 17, supervise the implementation of the regula tion. Our discussions led us to the conclusion that the functioning of this and other committees should be subjected to a thorough inspection, the outcome of which should be published. I would ask you, on behalf of the Committee on External Economic Relations, to adopt this report. We extend our thanks to the Commission for its initiative and wish them every success in their efforts to obtain adoption by the Council of the report. I hope the Council will take up the matter as quickly as possible and, in so doing, make a very useful contribution to relieving a difficult employment situation in the Com munity. (Applause) President. \u2014 I call the Group of the European Peo ple's Party (Christian-Democratic Group). Mrs Phlix. \u2014 (NL) Mr President, honourable Mem bers, I have little to add to the excellent report pre sented by Mr Rieger, and in view of the late hour I shall be very brief. The Group of the European Peo ple's Party is in principle very much in favour of a cus toms union. This proposal for a regulation from the Commission to the Council represents a new and sig nificant step towards achieving that customs union. We are also highly pleased that no new bureaucracy is being proposed here but that the existing administra tion is to be used. We are convinced that this is an extremely important initiative for Europe and her citi zens and shall therefore vote in favour of the motion for a resolution from our colleague Mr Rieger. President. \u2014 I call the Commission. Mr Narjes, Member of the Commission. \u2014 (DE) Mr President, I would like, at the outset, to congratulate Mr Rieger both on his excellent introduction and on the report itself, and to thank the draftsman of an opinion and to convey to the House the Commission's gratification on seeing that its proposal for a regula tion has found an unequivocal and broad consensus. This type of customs procedure is of considerable importance in the Community's trade relations with third countries. It establishes a definite connection between Community imports and exports and, in so doing, reflects a fundamental Community shortcom ing in external trade. I am referring to our position as an industrial processing region with limited raw- material resources. As such, it is essential for the Com munity to facilitate the import of products which, after processing within the Community, are to be exported at competitive prices to third countries. I would go so far as to say that there would be less of a danger of protectionism if all parties concerned adopted this Community approach. The object of the proposal before the House is essen tially that of transforming into a proposal for a regula tion the principles set out in the Council directive of March 1969 concerning inward-processing relief arrangements, thereby moving a step closer to the attainment of the multiannual programme for a cus toms union. The Commission attaches particular sig nificance to the Committee's plea to the Council for the delegation of additional power to the Commission in customs matters, for which it extends its thanks. The Commission is also of the opinion that it is super fluous to deploy the full legal machinery of the Com munity, including Parliament, on such matters which the Member States could best deal with by simple administrative arrangements. The fact that this is too often the case contributes to the cumbersomeness of the Community decision-mak ing machinery, which is so often bemoaned. In addi tion, it reinforces the public's widely-held view that Council, Parliament and Commission busy themselves all too often with trivialities. ",
        "No 1-286/258 Debates of the European Parliament 17.6.82 Narjes But let us not underestimate this. We are dealing with the delegation of powers in a fundamental matter con cerning relations between Member States of the Com munity. Individual discussions have been taking place for years as to the practical means of supervising such a delegation of power, and during these discussions the idea, already referred to on several occasions, of a 'committee procedure' as a sort of routine solution has, unfortunately, been reinforced. Once used in one individual case, such a routine solution could not eas ily be subsequently questioned. I fully agree with the opinions of the House, and of the rapporteur, that rather than opting for a routine solution, it would be desirable to investigate thoroughly, once and for all, the individual Member States' relations with the Com munity as a whole. Here is a golden opportunity for the Political Affairs Committee to undertake an in-depth survey, because it affords the possibility of making practical progress without modifying treaties. It would contribute towards making the Community more efficient and more effective. In this sphere, one should examine the more interest ing thoughts which have been expressed on the reform of the present Community procedures. I include the idea that the committee procedure, if it has to be retained, should be exclusively consultative. In any event, the Commission is quite prepared to convey fully to the House its experiences with the manage ment committees, and suggestions for alternative measures. (Applause) President. \u2014 The debate is closed. The vote will be taken at the next voting-time. 18. European coastal charter President. \u2014 The next item is the report by Mr Harris, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy and Regional Planning, on a European coastal charter (Doc. 1-302/82). I call the rapporteur. Mr Harris, rapporteur. \u2014 The report which I have the honour to present is rather a modest one. Yet it deals with a very big subject: how we can best give our help on a Community basis towards trying to safeguard one of the greatest assets of Europe, and that is its coast line. I say it is a modest report because it really gives the backing of the Parliament to a very comprehensive document which is not ours. The document I refer to is the European Coastal Charter, which was drawn up by the Conference of Peripheral Maritime Regions of the EEC. I would warmly congratulate the Conference for all the work it has done on this subject over quite a long time and with help from the Commission's envi ronmental services. It is because this document, the Charter itself, is so comprehensive, that my report commending it can be rather brief and, as I say, rather modest. That report which I present now was passed unanimously by the Committee on Regional Policy and Regional Planning in one sitting. I think that is a measure of the agreement between the members of that committee on the excellent work done by the Conference in drawing up the charter. Now what does the charter try to do? It really tries to point the way to reconciling a very big conflict \u2014 namely, the conflict between the need for proper economic development in areas which are sometimes remote, sometimes regions like Greece which are heavily dependent on tourism (my own constituency, being a rather remote coastal area, is also heavily dependent on tourism) and the needs of the environ ment. Those areas badly need to create jobs in other sectors as well. Yet, of course, there is also the need to protect the environment because without that environ ment those areas would lose their ability to attract tourists. So there is an inherent conflict here. It is a conflict which has exercised the minds of planners and academics, particularly in the northern part of Europe, for quite a long time. Yet northern Europe cannot afford to be smug about this subject, because if we have anything to pass on to other parts it is a result of the mistakes which we have made in northern Europe. We hope very much that Greece and countries like Spain and Portugal, which, we hope, are to join us in the Community, will not make the same sort of mis takes that countries like my own made some years ago. One of the main purposes of the charter is to try and achieve better coordination and dissemination of the research and of the expertise which has now gone for some years into just this sort of problem. One of the attractive features of this is that it can be done at very little financial cost to the Community. It really does need a great effort to have better coordination. That is essential. But I am certainly not advocating the spend ing of vast sums of money. The expertise is often there, it is just a question of making it more widely known and more widely available. A very important point in the charter is the recognition that this work cannot be done simply by bureaucrats, let alone by politicians. It does require an effort by the public at large, and that means that we have a role to play in stimulating public interest in this sort of issue. I believe that interest has grown remarkably over recent years. There is an increasing awareness \u2014 and let us be thankful for it \u2014 of the need to protect our envi ronment and particularly our coastline. But I believe we could do more in this regard, and the Charter sug gests that perhaps consideration should be given to having a European year of the coast so that we can focus attention on the many issues which are dealt with in this document. Then, of course, the Community itself has a very important role to play in many areas of importance. ",
        "17. 6. 82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/259 Harris This House has rightly exercised its mind over the need to have greater safeguards on shipping, greater controls, above else, on pollution at sea and in coastal areas. This takes up a lot of the Charter by drawing attention to what has already been done and the need to do more and to have more effective safeguards. This, I believe, is a good time to bring the Charter to the attention of the House in this way. Later this year Ministers from the European countries will be meeting in Madrid to look at this sort of issue, and the real purpose of the report of the Committee on Regional Policy and Regional Planning to the House today is to give the backing of this Parliament to the Charter and to draw it to the attention of the Ministers when they meet in Madrid. If you like, we are giving a political push towards, I believe, a very worthy objective. It is in that spirit that I commend it to the House and I hope that it will be passed unanimously tomorrow. Perhaps I might, in conclusion, mention one or two of the amendments which have been tabled. I am very grateful to the members of the committee who have tabled amendments and in particular I refer to one by Mrs Fuillet, who is a very valuable member of our committee. She quite rightly, I think, draws attention in dealing with coastal matters to the need to have a joint solution to fishery problems. I fully endorse the sentiments of her amendment; indeed, I hope that those sentiments will reach absolute fulfilment before long in negotiations on the common fisheries policy. I accept her amendment, but I believe she has tabled it to the wrong part of the report \u2014 for technical rea sons \u2014 and I hope, with your permission, Mr Presi dent \u2014 I give you notice of this \u2014 that it could, when it is considered tomorrow, be taken in a rather differ ent part of the report without altering the substance of the amendments. With those few words, Mr President, I commend the report most warmly to the House and again offer my congratulations to the Conference of Peripheral Mari time Regions, which has drawn up the charter. I hope that in this way we shall be able to do our bit in Parlia ment towards protecting what we all want to protect, that priceless heritage, the coastline of Europe. Mr President, it is only natural that a Greek Member should take part in a debate on the European Coastal Charter, since Greece is a Community country which, as you well know, with the exception of its northerq borders is surrounded on all sides by the sea and by small and large islands. I should like to thank the po litical group to which I belong for allowing me to speak on its behalf on this topic. It was no coincidence that this Charter was adopted in its final form on the Greek island of Crete in October 1981, and I entirely approve the ten main points of the charter contained in the second chapter. I shall not mention them here because time is short. I should only like to say that I am the last person in the House to disagree with the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection that the North Sea and the Mediterranean are being turned into a dump for refuse, 75% of which comes from the land and 25% from the sea. In Greece, in addition to the provisions of Article 24 of the new 1975 Constitution, which made it obliga tory for the State to protect the natural environment, a series of legislative measures have been taken and all the international Conventions designed to prevent sea pollution have been ratified. Recently, Greek ship owners launched an initiative to protect the marine environment and were supported by the State, by ship- workers' unions, by international organizations and above all by Greek shipbuilders, who, by sacrifices and financial contributions on every ship built, have contri buted about 100% above the cost. I am sure that this most recent attempt in Greece will meet with complete success, because the persons behind this project believe that the protection of the marine environment should become a matter of public concern and are doing everything within their power to bring this about. Finally, on behalf of our Danish colleagues and of Mr von Hassel, who is absent, I should like to ask that Amendment No 5, by Mr von Hassel and Mr P\u00f6ttering, be adopted and that the Community protect the shores of the North Sea so as to avert the danger of damage from storms. President. \u2014 I call the Group of the European Peo ple's Party (Christian-Democratic Group). Mr Bournias. \u2014 (GR) Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Harris, the rapporteur, very cordially for mentioning Greece and its tourism. I should like to say that we are endeavouring to save Greece's superb tourist potential from a number of domestic exploiters and unscrupulous entrepreneurs but also from certain less desirable categories of tourists. I should like to congratulate Mr Harris on his report, which he pre sented with such modesty. President. \u2014 I call the Commission. Mr Narjes, Member of the Commission. \u2014 (DE) Mr President, I should like to begin by congra tulating the rapporteur and the Committee on Regional Policy and Regional Planning on its very interesting report on the European Coastal Charter. The report represents a significant political initiative on the part of the House. In that respect I fully agree with the rapporteur. For some time now, the relevant departments of the Commission have been working on an outline of a ",
        "No 1\u00ad286/260 Debates of the European Parliament 17.6.82 Narjes global action programme for the European coastal regions designed to guarantee the coherence of action deemed to be necessary in this sphere. The close colla\u00ad boration with the Conference of Peripheral Maritime Regions was of immeasurable help. The European Coastal Charter, before the House today, is in many ways an expression of the common interests shared by the CPMR and the Community. The Commission fully endorses the attached motion for a resolution. The delicate balance between the economic development of coastal regions on the one hand, and the preservation of the natural ecological equilibrium, on the other, is becoming increasingly endangered, for a number of reasons. The natural eco\u00ad systems of coastal regions must be protected against the detrimental effects of industrialization and urbani\u00ad zation, whilst at the same time guaranteeing the economic development of these regions with a view to combating unemployment and stemming the exodus of young people. The Commission is especially pleased that a first ac\u00ad tion programme has been added to the Charter. I can only echo the sentiment, expressed in the report and reiterated today by the rapporteur, of wishing to see a reconciliation, through integrated action at Com\u00ad munity level, of the apparent conflict between environ\u00ad mental protection and economic development. Indeed, I can state that the Commission, in close colla\u00ad boration with the Secretariat of the CPMR and, in particular, with reference to the four new environmen\u00ad tal\u00adprotection lines of the 1982 budget, is working on the coordination and attainment of certain pilot pro\u00ad jects such as 'Operation coastal impact'. This covers the areas enumerated in paragraph 8 of the motion for a resolution, namely, knowledge, planning and con\u00ad trol. Finally, a word on the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Pro\u00ad tection. The Commission considers the inclusion of an ecological compatibility clause in regional and agricul\u00ad tural policies to be of great importance. The adoption by the House of this motion for a resolution would immeasurably encourage the Community as a whole to continue its efforts in this field. I would add that, real\u00ad istically, the achievement of the various objectives is dependent upon the provision by the Member States of the necessary administrative and budgetary means, as outlined in paragraph 9 of the motion for a resolu\u00ad tion. President. \u2014 The debate is closed. The vote will be taken at the next voting time. 19. Budgetary contribution to the ECSC President. \u2014The next item is the report by Mr Nord, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the propo\u00ad sal from the Commission to the Council (Doc. 1\u00ad262/ 82) for a decision with regard to a contribution to the European Coal and Steel Community out of the gen\u00ad eral budget of the European Communities (Doc. 1\u00ad313/82). I call the rapporteur. Mr Nord, rapporteur. \u2014 (NL) Mr President, last week, on Tuesday 8 June to be exact, the Council approved the extension of the quota regulation for the production of a number of steel products. This regula\u00ad tion is part of the Community policy to expedite the restructuring of the steel sector. It was started in October 1980. Shortly afterwards, on 24 June 1981, it was supplemented by a social contribution in the form of temporary social aid under Article 56(2) (b) of the ECSC Treaty. The total programme covers 212 mil\u00ad lion ECU, of which 50 million are provided by con\u00ad tributions from the Member States to the ECSC budget. The delays which have arisen between the agreements to grant these sums and the actual availa\u00ad bility of the money have shown once more how unsa\u00ad tisfactory ad hoc sums are as a method of financing multiannual requirements. And so it happened that an agreement was reached at the end of 1981 between the Council and Parliament that an amount of 62 million \u25a0' ECU be included in the general EC budget for 1981 as an EC contribution to the ECSC budget. At the same time, an amount of 50 million ECU was included in the draft budget for 1982 for the same purpose. The Council is expected in the draft 1983 budget to take over the Commission's proposal in the preliminary draft to add a further 50 million in the general EC budget for 1983, so as to cover the total requirement of 212 million. This should have been the end of the affair as far as the European Parliament is concerned. However, according to Article 205 of the EEC Treaty, the Com\u00ad mission must implement the budget and thus transfer to the ECSC the amounts written into the budget. The Council, however, does not agree and considers \u2014 and is here unfortunately followed by the Commission \u2014 that an additional legal basis is necessary for the EEC to be able to spend these sums. It is admittedly agreed that there is no difficulty in the ECSC receiv\u00ad ing these sums, as Article 49 of the Treaty stipulates that the ECSC may receive gifts. But according to the Council \u2014 and again, unfortunately, according to the Commission as well \u2014 there are difficulties in spend\u00ad ing this amount without an additional separate legal basis. On 28 June 1979, the Commission submitted its first proposal along these lines to the Council. In 1980 and 1981, new and revised proposals followed. These led to a Council decision on 23 February 1982 where\u00ad by the 62 million ECU in the 1981 budget were trans\u00ad ferred to the ECSC. A new proposal is now submitted to us on the 50 million in the 1982 budget and the 50 million proposed for the 1983 budget. ",
        "17.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/261 Nord I would point out that this proposal, contrary to the decision of 23 February 1982, leaves it to the budget ary authority to determine the exact amount of the transfer. But that is just a detail, for the main issue is that in the opinion of our Committee on Budgets and in line with the view adhered to so far by Parliament, this whole proposal is completely superfluous. That is why, in the resolution presented to you by the Com mittee on Budgets, paragraph 1 repeats for the ump teenth time the principle that the budget forms a suffi cient legal basis for the transfer of budget funds to the ECSC. Paragraph 2 recalls that there is absolutely nothing to prevent the ECSC from receiving gifts, and paragraph 3 states that we do not wish at the moment to instigate a major conflict, as the problem of the additional legal basis is dealt with in the concertation programme of the three Presidents on the classifica tion of budgetary expenditure. We hope that a formula will be found in that forum to avoid such discussions and conflicts in the future. That is why we have no wish to start a conflict now, but the Committee on Budgets strongly wishes to reiterate our standpoint. We believe that this is the only correct standpoint and we have never really heard any con vincing arguments from the other side. We have only ever heard that they disagree with us, without any very convincing explanation. Mr President, the Committee on Budgets is by no means against the social aspects of the Community programme. It merely considers it superfluous to ask for another Council decision for it and believes the decision of the budgetary authority to use these amounts for the ECSC budget sufficient to transfer the said amounts from the EC budget to the ECSC budget. The result of the proposal from the Com mittee on Budgets is, Mr President, that you are being asked to reject the proposal from the Commission to the Council because it is a superfluous proposal and we have no need of it. Mr Narjes, Member of the Commission. \u2014 (DE) On behalf of the Commission, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his effective and concise presentation. We appreciate the rapidity with which Parliament has dealt with this matter, and I aim to be equally brief by limiting my remarks to the essentials. The Commission's overriding concern at present is that of placing at the disposal of the European Coal and Steel Community the means to finance special aid to relieve the plight of workers in these sectors. Legal considerations have led the Commission to the un avoidable conclusion that such a measure is condi tional upon prior Council approval, pursuant to Article 235 of the Treaty of Rome. The sums in ques tion are still listed under heading 65 of the general budget. At its meeting of 8 June 1982, the Council gave a very positive reception to the measure. In compliance with the obligation to consult Parliament prior to the reaching of a final decision and its formal enactment, I have come before the House to sound out its opinions. However, in view of the evident misgivings and doubts expressed in the House today as to the necessity of a specific decision from the Council, the Commission would be happy to accept the solution contained in the committee's motion for a resolution, in which Parlia ment leaves to the Council the responsibility for taking a new decision on this question should it consider this necessary. This would confirm that the responsibility for the implementation of budgetary decisions on the granting of aid lies solely with the Council. President. \u2014 The debate is closed. The vote will be taken at the next voting-time. President. \u2014 I call the Commission. (The sitting closedat 11.45p.m.) 1 For the agenda for the next sitting, see the Minutes. ",

Explanations of vote Mr Gerokostopoulos. \u2014 (GR) Mr President, I shall vote for the motion for a resolution contained in the report by Mr Hopper, but I feel I must state my reservations on the text before us, since it has not given sufficient emphasis to certain extremely serious matters, to which I should like to refer. Firstly, the Mandate is more wide-ranging and can only be put into effect if its three chap ters are developed at the same time together with an attempt to bridge the development imbalances within the Community. Secondly, it is urgently necessary to reinforce the rules of Community preference, the implementation of which is currently giving rise to many doubts about the correctness of the policy which the Community is pursuing in certain areas. Thirdly, there is an equally pressing need for the presentation and adoption of direct and specific measures to tackle the problem of the Mediterranean countries, \u00e0 problem which will become even more acute with the future enlargement of the Community, to which we naturally have no political objection. Enlargement will create unbearable pressures mainly in certain southern regions, where even now the efforts to adapt require restructuring measures and reforms for which they are not sufficiently prepared. Fourthly, ways and means of partially tackling this problem and of bridging the gulf between the North and the South were proposed by this House with the adoption on 7 February 1982 of the report by Mr P\u00f6ttering, which proposed, among other things, the setting up of a development fund for the Mediterranean regions. Mr Bord. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, much has occurred since 1981 when the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs asked Mr Hopper to draw up the report on the mandate of 30 May 1980. With tenacity, realism, intelligence, Mr Hop per has tried to adapt his report to the changing realities, but in spite of his praiseworthy efforts this has proved difficult. To such an extent that our representatives on the Com mittee on Economic and Monetary Affairs requested that an act be passed stating that the mandate of 30 May was completely outdated, that the Council exonerates the Commis sion from continuing to execute it, and that accordingly there was no longer any need to discuss the report. The Commission rejected this proposal and, after many vicissitudes and delays, Mr Hopper's report has finally been presented and submitted today to the vote of Parliament. By force of circumstances, and in spite of the efforts of its author, the report is too gen eral, mixing agricultural problems, budgetary problems and other Community issues. Mr President, this report has one positive aspect, namely the will to develop new Com munity policies in line with the initial objectives of the mandate; an economic policy, industrial and energy strategies, a technological policy, some of which have been adopted, ",
        "17. 6. 82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/265 in particular by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. We welcome this. However the most significant amendments, Mr President, and particularly amendment No 1, have been rejected and we regret this. Furthermore we wish to draw the attention of our fellow members, and also of the Coun cil and of the Commission, to certain as yet unofficial but nonetheless disquieting infor mation whereby preparations are underway for the planned negotiations next autumn on budgetary contributions. The contribution keys envisaged appear completely unaccepta ble. We wish to express, now, Mr President, our total reservations with regard to any pro posals along these lines which might be presented by the Commission to the Council. Mr Nyborg. \u2014 (DA) I very much regret having to vote against this report since, firstly, it strikes me that, as has already been mentioned, considerable time has passed since the mandate of the 30 May was issued. Secondly, I must admit that Mr Hopper has done a major piece of work. However, his nationality shines through and he should basically be regarded as the wrong person for work of this kind. Finally, I should like to say that I am tired of constantly having to discuss the British contribution to the European Community. If one has agreed to certain rules of play, one must observe them, and not insist that one joined on the wrong terms. Mr Fernandez. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, the Hopper report opposes the principle of 'fair return'. That is a good thing, but it does not rule out the possibility of new blackmail on the part of Great Britain. According to the agreement of 30 May 1980 the EEC shouldtake over 65% of the British budgetary deficit. In reality the other Member States have taken over 84% of the deficit in 1980 and more than 100% in 1981. Great Britain has enjoyed an additional gain of 1 000 million ECU more than agreed under the mandate. In 1982 it was reimbursed 850 million ECU and, while this sum is lower than that demand by it, it is still far too much. It is time to demonstrate greater firmness in the face of the exorbitant claims of Great Britain, so that it shows more respect for Community principles. We do not accept that France should pay for the major part of the reduction in the 1982 contribution as certain information would appear to indicate. The other problem concerns that of foreign policy. The Community must defend the commercial, agricultural, monetary and financial interests of Member States on the basis of existing common policies. Furthermore the report does not take sufficient account of employment problems, and more specifically of what we stated in our amendments. For these reasons, Mr President, the French Communist and Allies Group will not vote in favour of the Hopper report. Mr Protopapadakis. \u2014 (GR) Mr President, I shall vote for the Hopper report because, with things as they stand at the moment, this is the best anyone can do. However, I would express serious concern that, apart from the fact that the report leaves unsolved many problems to which other speakers have referred, it also leaves open a wound which threatens the future of our Community. This wound is the disagreement which exists between Parliament, the Commission and the Council on the questions with which the report deals. There are many problems confronting Europe. But how can we hope to achieve a united Europe when we institutions, whose mission it is to serve this European unity, occupy ourselves with a never-ending dispute which has turned into a childish squabble between us, instead of cooperating constructively to solve the problem of Europe? With this reservation I am in favour of the Hopper report and hope that peace is quickly restored to Parliament's relations with the Commission and the Council before it becomes necessary for an arbitration body to intervene. ",
        "No 1-286/266 Debates of the European Parliament 17. 6. 82 Mr Bonaccini. \u2014 (IT) Mr President, let me endorse what other Members have said in congratulating Mr Hopper for the assiduous and able manner in which he performed his work. However, I would just like to say that we have missed an excellent opportunity. We could have had a debate on a proposal by Mr de Ferranti on the subject of paragraph 32 but the opportunity has slipped by without any discussion. Our opinion of the Hopper report cannot be divorced from a more general opinion on the attitude of the Council and the Commission with regard to the whole issue raised by the mandate of 30 May and on the conclusions which the Council has thought to reach. It is for this reason \u2014 and not with the idea of criticizing Mr Hopper's work \u2014 that we shall be abstaining in the vote, another reason being that we do not feel that the battle is over for the revival of the Community and of the policies which were being requested with the mandate of 30 May. Mr Alavanos. \u2014 (GR) Mr President, the Communist Party of Greece disagrees pro foundly with the report by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the 30 May Mandate. This report is based on the motion that the crisis in the Community can be tackled by means of a new substantial shift of political and economic power from the national level to the supranational bodies of the Community. Something of this kind would be particularly negative for my country, which is already faced with the grave con sequences of its entry into the Community. I should like to refer in particular to the points in the report. Firstly, the call for the decision-making procedures to be made more effective. This seeks to deprive the Member States of their right of veto. Secondly, the 'increase in own resources', which involves transferring a larger amount of national resources from national to Community administration. Thirdly, the setting up of a new body at European level to develop Community procure ment policy, which further limits the Member States' right to intervene in their economic development via the policy of State supplies. Fourthly, the enlargement of the Community to include Spain and Portugal, which will aggravate the problems facing the agricultural economies in the Member States. Fifthly, the call for stricter discipline as regards State aids, which goes against the coun tries with less developed economies, which are obliged to create a favourable basis for the development of their national production. It is clear that the measures provided for in the report are diametrically opposed to the feelings of Greek workers on the way in which the negative consequences of Community membership should be tackled. They are also diametrically opposed to the measures pro posed by the well-known communication from the Greek Government to the EEC con cerning certain protective measures for Greek industry and exemptions from the rules on competition. Beumer motion for a resolution (Doc. 1-216/82) : adopted Explanations of vote Mr Schwencke. \u2014 (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, even if the President of the Council of Ministers, Mr Tindemans, and the President of the Commission, Mr Thorn, have tried to dispel our Committee's misgivings about the European Foundation, the over whelming majority of our Socialist Group cannot approve the present plan for the Euro pean Foundation. ",
        "17. 6. 82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/267 We remain convinced that a directly elected Parliament cannot accept any new European institution which does not guarantee the full participation of Parliament. We have only vague promises that the European Parliament will be involved in the programme of the Foundation. As long as this is not mentioned in the Agreement establishing the Founda tion we must adhere to the principles stated in our motion for a resolution which we ask you to support: firstly, this is an agreement between the ten Member States \u2014 not an agreement on the basis of Article 235 \u2014 which excludes our participation; secondly, there will be a danger that the Foundation could duplicate work on cultural policy done by the Parliament and the Council of Europe; thirdly, no attempt will be made to benefit from the Council of Europe's experience of cultural policy since it is not represented on the 40 member Council of the Foundation. The Committee's warning still applies: the contribution to the financing of the Founda tion, being non-compulsory expenditure, should not be guaranteed as long as the rights of the European Parliament in this Foundation are not guaranteed. I therefore ask the House to support Mr Beumer's motion for a resolution as far as possible. Mr Forth. \u2014 I am unable to support either the report or the idea of a European Founda tion. We have a term in the English language, 'quango', which indicates a useless public body which serves no function whatsoever. This Community is already overburdened with many quangos, usually with the name 'foundation', which perform no identifiable task whatsoever but cost a lot of public money and I am disappointed that the people of this House have not shown greater imagination in finding better uses for public money than to set up things called foundations with ill-defined tasks to produce unread reports out of which no result will come whatsoever. My second objection is this: it really is time the Community started to demonstrate its value by its actions, not by setting up bodies which are dedicated to telling everybody how good the Community is. And until this House learns to distinguish between actions and words. I, for one, will be quite unable to support this kind of move and for that reason. Mr President, I shall vote against this report to signify my complete lack of support for this concept of the foundation.

Explanations of vote Mrs Carettoni Romagnoli. \u2014 (IT) Mr President, we are pleased with the Michel report because it is what it was supposed to be, the follow-up to Parliament's vote on the Ferrer\u00f2 report. This report, then, rounds things off and is not something completely new. We are therefore happy that a large number of amendments have been withdrawn, even though some of them in fact seemed interesting and worthy of attention. This fact aside, we still have one major concern. The fact is that we are fighting a losing battle when it comes to hunger, whether you look at the basic structure of the problem or the actual situation. On the general issue of development we are also at a crossroads. I am afraid there is going to be no way out unless something is done about the basic facts. These basic facts are primarily the issue of hunger, which runs counter to every develop ment model, good or bad. Life comes first, of course. Secondly, there is the bad showing of the model followed in the last ten years. A new development policy is being worked out in fact. Thirdly, resources are inadequate. And finally, there is no coordination between bilateral Community action and multilateral action outside the Community. ",
        "No 1-286/268 Debates of the European Parliament 17. 6. 82 As another member of the group said earlier, what is needed is a new political course, which for the time being is not apparent. We have to be frank about it \u2014 there are no signs of any new course. In our view, it should be based on the realization that if survival for the developing countries means physical survival, then in the case of the developed nations it means social and political survival. This, Mr President, Mr Commissioner, is the thinking behind the vote in favour by the Italian Members of the Communist and Allies Group. Mr Romualdi. \u2014 (IT) Mr President, while the Members on the right of the Italian politi cal spectrum are aware of the paramount need to tackle the problems of hardship which are still the scourge of entire regions in the Community \u2014 let me quote Ireland and southern Italy as examples \u2014 at the same time we cannot fail to be aware of the dramatic scale of the problem of hunger and underdevelopment in the world, and we shall be vot ing for the Michel report. Hunger in the world is a humane and political problem, because the repercussions of this struggle are political as well as humane. This debate has again confirmed my belief that the struggle against hunger is more of a problem of will and organization than of resources. This is true not only in the case of development cooperation but also in the case of immediate and urgent food aid which is needed \u2014 as Mr Pannella says \u2014 to avoid a holocaust of five, ten or twenty million men, women and children who are dying at the momentrTo win the race against death, which Mrs Focke talked about yesterday, it is not enough to allocate funds and to supply wheat, rice, milk, butter, fruit juices or medicines. We need organized distribution, means of transport, equipment, and bodies of willing and able people who are ready to do all this. Mr C. Jackson. \u2014 Mr President, there is much merit in the Michel report, and my group believes it is of major importance that the House and the European Community does all it can to defeat the scourge of hunger and starvation in the world. It is not often that I come to Mr Pannella's defence, but today I was appalled that two groups decided that because Mr Pannella had tabled a considerable number of amend ments no amendments from any source would be supported, regardless of merit. I believe that raises an important issue of principle. That Mr Michel, as our rapporteur, should reject all amendments is not. I believe, a proper exercise of his function as rapporteur. I cite in particular Amendment No 159 by Mr Irmer, which was a direct reflection of views already expressed by this House. The result is that this House is in effect not producing a report as good and as well considered as it would have done had the two groups done their duty, if I may put it like that, in considering the merits of these important amend ments which have been lost and which, I believe, would otherwise have been supported. I refer particularly here to one, on which we had a roll-call vote, relating to the vital issue of population increase. In our view, this House has a duty to consider amendments. It is the practice of this House to consider reports in committee and then present them to the House, where, \u00e0s we all know, important reports and other reports are, as a matter of practice, amended and thereby frequently improved. Because of this, Mr President, my group will not vote for the Michel report. We shall, instead, abstain. Mr Glinne. \u2014 (NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Socialist Group supported the compromise on the Michel report in the Committee on Development and Coopera tion. The Group did not therefore submit any amendments itself because the resolution in question was an excellent description of the aims of a policy to combat hunger. For this reason it also voted against all the amendments tabled. Mr Alavanos. \u2014 (GR) Mr President, as has appeared from the speeches by many Mem bers, the dreadful problem of mass hunger is directly linked with the reform of the terrible international distribution of labour, world trade and more generally the radical reorgani zation of international economic relations. ",
        "17. 6. 82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/269 We, the representatives of the Communist Party of Greece, consider that without pro found social changes it is practically impossible to achieve a real solution'to the problem of hunger within historically acceptable time scales. This view is completely based on the les sons of history, on the enormous progress made towards solving both the problem of nutrition and similar problems by peoples such as those of the present-day Soviet Union, China, Cuba, Vietnam and Ethiopia \u2014 in addition to the price they paid and are still pay ing as a result of the legacy of colonialism and the hostile attitude of the developed capi talist countries. , This position of ours is not a reason, of course, for not voting for the Michel report, despite the fundamental reservations we have as regards both its logic and the effective ness of the measures it proposes. After all, the report by Mr Michel has been a positive exception during a part-session which has produced plenty of extreme reactionary resolu tions, such as those on EEC-USA relations, Afghanistan and the basic tolerance towards the mass murder committed by Israel against the Lebanese and Palestinian peoples. Mrs Poirier. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, as we said yesterday the fight against hunger is un deniably an emergency measure to save lives, attack the roots of the evil and promote the deep structural reforms which this immense human problem calls for. We regret that our debate could not be as extensive as necessary, even though we had previously envisaged a major debate on all development issues, a debate which is more over still necessary. I also regret some reactions from the gallery and some individual behaviour, particularly when such a serious subjet calls for gravity, restraint and I will even say reticence. As regards Mr Michel's report, in our opinion it does of course contain some elements worthy of interest, but it is inadequate as regards content. Let me just quote two main points : the action by the Community and the Member States of open global negotiations within the United Nations on the one hand and secondly, the Communities's attitude in the negotiation of product agreements. During this debate it was stated often that the EEC's attitude in its relations with the developing countries should change. We welcome this new demand. Since our amendments to this effect were not adopted, we cannot vote in favour of the report and we will abstain. Mr Pannella. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, the press and public opinion must not be mislead by the dubious intrigues which Parliament has been subjected to during these few days by the other institutions. In paragraph 4 the report denounces the lack of implementing decisions to carry out Parliament's proposals and resolutions. Mr President, by these exaggeratedly cautious decisions we assume responsibilty for mil lions of deaths and make ourselves the accomplice of a policy of death. This lack of imple menting decisions is a breach which should be denounced. The Michel report is content to regret it. Thus, Mr President, I will abstain, while making it clear that Parliament points an accus ing finger at the other two institutions and proclaims their very grave responsibility in this matter. Mr Irmer. \u2014 (DE) Mr President I will vote for this report but I have great sympathy for Mr Jackson's view. What we did with the amendments today was irresponsible. None of the spokesmen of the Groups read them or considered whether they were good or right. The recital states 'Having regard to the annual report of the Court of Auditors of the European Community for the financial year 1979'. I proposed that 'and 1980 and the special report' should be added. We devoted a lot of time to these reports here in April at a very productive meeting. We tabled motions on this point which were unanimously approved. ",
        "No 1-286/270 Debates of the European Parliament 17. 6. 82 Now the honourable Members simply refuse to include this because they maintain it is really a technical improvement! I think that this type of behaviour is irresponsible. We run the risk of making ourselves look ridiculous. I will nonetheless vote for the report because I agree with its content. : Mr De Goede. \u2014 (NL) Mr President I entered my name on the list of speakers yesterday. Yesterday's debate on combatting world hunger revealed differences of opinion but for tunately also agreement. Agreement on the need to offer greater help than at present. Dif ferences of opinion as to how such aid should be structured in the long and short-term We supported the amendments aimed at increasing and extending aid. It is essential to have a more structured approach than occasional food aid. We would have liked even more appeals to the Commission and Council to be included in the Michel report. It is most regrettable that such appeals are so necessary. Mr Pisani may rest assured that this report is not Parliament's final word on the matter. We will support Mr Michel's report. Thank you very much. Rabbethge report (Doc. 1-202/82) /adopted The rapporteur was : \u2014 in favour of Amendments Nos 3, 4, 9 and 12; \u2014 against Amendments Nos 2, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19. Explanations of vote Mrs Squarcialupi. \u2014 (IT) Mr President, as rapporteur for the Committee on the Environ ment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, I wish to say I welcome this Commission proposal which directs research towards the developing countries. There are imperfec tions, of course, and these have been pointed out. The funds which have been set aside are laughable when compared with the needs, but we must look on this proposal as a first step and we welcome the commitment which was voiced by Mr Pisani of the Commission. Technology has to match the needs of the developing countries and it must be mastered as soon as possible by these countries. For example, we should see to it that effective sub stances are found to boost productivity, food productivity, but at the same time must not be harmful to health. I am talking about pesticides. Many of them are carcinogenic and there has been a lot of talk about this. The problem has to be tackled from both the scien tific and the political angles so that we can avoid the continual dilemma of whether to feed the starving or make do without substances which are definitely harmful. Research needs technology right away but first of all we have to make professional train ing a number one priority so that research to benefit the developing countries is carried out by those involved, so that there is no brain drain or waste of the intellectual resources which these countries vitally need for their own survival and progress. By way of conclusion, let me say that the Italian version needs to be checked as it contains several errors. Alber report (Doc. 1-219/82) /adopted The rapporteur was: \u2014 in favour of Amendments Nos 10, 17, 18, 36, 38, 41 and 46; \u2014 against Amendments Nos 34, 35, 37, 39, 42, 43, 44, 45 and 47. ",
        "17. 6. 82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/271 Explanations of vote Mrs Squarcialupi. \u2014 (IT) Mr President, my explanation of vote would undoubtedly have been different if I had not heard a surprising view to the effect that local authorities have nothing to do with us. Just one week ago I was at a Community conference, attended by the relevant Commission officials, on refuse disposal in the Ten Member States of the Community. It is up to local authorities \u2014 at municipal, provinical or regional level \u2014 to arrange for the disposal of household and industrial waste. In short, it is their job to deal with the cleaning and the conservation of the environment in the area for which they are responsible. When Mr Alber said that this matter was none of our business, I must confess to being absolutely amazed, especially as I know that Mr Alber is greatly concerned by these problems. I am talking about the day-to-day routine at local government level. It is not central government which keeps the streets clean; this is the job of the local authorities and I think that, where this is concerned, they ought to have been given more attention in this resolution of ours. Although the amendment in question was rejected, I nevertheless give my support to the Alber resolution dealing with a Commission programme which, to my mind, deserves the utmost attention. Mr Skovmand. \u2014 (DA) We in the People's Movement against the European Community intend to vote agains this report, riot because we are opposed to action in the environmen tal sector \u2014 indeed, quite the reverse is true, but because we are uneasy about the form of environmental policy advocated by the European Community, since we are afraid that it would result in the quality of the environment in Denmark being lower than it would otherwise be. The Commission has two main interests in the environmental question. Firstly, they are concerned that no technical barriers to trade should come into being and secondly they are concerned that the Commission should have as much say as possible regarding the policies of the individual countries. We have our doubts about both of these interests, since they have a stifling effect on the environmental authorities in the individual countries and the entire environmental debate, and because a bureaucratic machinery has been built up which at best considerably slows down any efforts to set in the environment, and in certain cases even forms an obstacle to absolutely essential measures. This is true, for example, in the case of lead emissions from motor vehicles which result every year in brain damage to a large number of children, and which both could and should have been banned long ago. But thanks to the European Community, this has not been done, nor are the Member States at liberty to impose such a ban off their own bat. The report before us will only strengthen this bureaucracy and its influence and for this reason we must oppose it. ",

        "18.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/273 President. \u2014 Mr von der Vring, I have noted Mr Prag's statement. (Parliament approved the Minutes) 1 2. Privileges and immunities of Community officials President. \u2014 The next item is the report by Mr Lega, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets (Doc. 1-321/ 82), on the proposal from the Commission to the Council (Doc. 1-1005/81) for a regulation amending Regulation (EURATOM, ECSC, EEC) No 549/ 69 determining the categories of officials and other servants of the European Communities to whom the provisions of Article 12, the second paragraph of Article 13 and Article 14 of the Pro tocol on the Privileges and Immunities of the Communities apply. I call the rapporteur. Mr Lega, rapporteur. \u2014 (IT) Mr President, this motion for a resolution, presented for urgent debate, concerns a proposal for a regulation applicable to Community officials who have terminated their service following a procedure for permanent cessation of their duties, a procedure approved by Parliament at its sit ting of 10 April 1981. This proposal, which we have limited to a maximum of 25 A3 officials \u2014 while the Commission would have liked to extend the procedure to cover all Community officials \u2014 was adopted in order to allow the Com mission to recruit Greek officials. With this proposal, the Commission seeks to grant to officials who have terminated their service exemption from national taxation by extending, through amend ment of the Staff Regulations, the privileges and immunities provided for in the appropriate Protocol. It seems to me that this measure is a logical outcome of what we have already established. I therefore urge Parliament to adopt the opinion of its committee, which is in favour of extending immunities and privi leges to the above mentioned number of officials. President. \u2014 I call the Commission. Mr Dalsager, Member of the Commission. \u2014 (DA) Mr President, the motion for a resolution on which Par- For documents received, membership of committees, peti tions and Procedure without report, see the Minutes of Proceedings of this sitting. For reports without debate and the votes taken at voting-time, see Annex. liament has been asked for its opinion is related to the motion for a resolution on certain measures for the termination of service of certain Community officials in consequence of the enlargement of the Community, on which Parliament delivered its opinion in April 1981. The Commission decided to amend its proposals in the light of Parliament's opinion. According to the proposal on the termination of service, Parliament, Council and Commission can adopt measures to ter minate the service of a limited number of A3 officials following the accession of Greece. This termination of service will take place on a voluntary basis, and the officials affected will receive a monthly allowance equal to 70% of their basic salary, and at the same time still be covered by the social security provisions. The proposal before us today concerns the taxation of this monthly allowance. Under Article 13 of the Pro tocol on the Privileges and Immunities of the Euro pean Communities, salaries, remunerations and emol uments paid by the Community are exempt from national taxes. The same protocol defines the groups of Community officials covered by the exemption. Our proposal aims at ensuring that officials whose ser vice has been terminated and who receive a separation allowance will be exempt from national taxes. It is therefore a routine proposal of a technical nature. Moreover, Parliament adopted a similar regulation regarding termination of service in 1968 and in 1973. Finally, I wish to stress the urgency of the matter. The Council is unable formally to adopt either this propo sal or the regulation itself on termination of service until Parliament has delivered its opinion. More than 15 months have elapsed since the accession of Greece, and there is an urgent need to hire Greek officials in A3. Finally, the regulation which provides derogations from the normal Rules to enable Greek officials to be recruited expires at the end of the year. President. \u2014 The debate is closed. 1 3. Community energy strategy President. \u2014 The next item is the report by Mr Pintat, on behalf of the Committee on Energy and Research (Doc. 1-303/82), on the communication from the Commission to the Council (Doc. 1-1065/81) on an energy strategy for the Community: Nuclear aspects. The debate also includes the following oral question, with debate, by Mr Purvis, Mr Seligman, Mr More- land, MrJ.M Taylor, Mr Kellett-Bowman, Mr Prout, Mr C.

        "No 1-286/274 Debates of the European Parliament 18.6.82 President Subject: Contracts to import coal from third countries 1. Will the Commission state what negotiations have been or are taking place with third coun tries on contracts to import coal into the Community? 2. What plans do the Commission have for fur ther discussions on contracts for importing coal? 3. Does the Commission intend to put forward proposals for Community private or public investment in coal transport infra-structure and coal developments in Canada, USA, Aus tralia or South Africa? 4. What r\u00f4le the is being played by EEC com mercial energy companies in assuring the ade quacy and security of imported coal supplies, and is the Commission satisfied with the scale of such arrangements? 5. Will the Commission ensure that negotiations with third countries will not be to the detri ment of the Community's coal industry? I call the rapporteur. Mr Pintat, rapporteur. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in its communication to the Council on an energy strategy for the Community, the Com mission has summarized very well the problems posed and the means deployed by the Community to meet them. The section of the study entitled 'The nuclear aspects' is particularly important, because it deals with an alternative to oil consumption for the generation of electricity immediately available. The shortfall shown by the European programme in relation to estimates (50% of the target fixed in 1974) now leads us to assess the external consequences of the cost of energy produced for the balance of payments and employment. We must therefore take advantage of the brief respite afforded us by the state of oil sup plies to launch new European programmes and thus be enabled to meet, in the best possible conditions, the next oil crisis. True, the anti-nuclear movements have played their part, but the delays or cancellations affecting numer ous nuclear projects can also be attributed to a lack of political will and of clearly stated and sustained choices. The lull we have been experiencing in the oil sector should be used energetically to launch programmes and thus prepare Europe's energy future. These new European nuclear programmes will have to be fol lowed closely, and the Commission's announcement that it will increase the rate of publications on outline programmes on this subject has been greatly welcomed by our committee. We propose updated publications every two years. The launching of new nuclear programmes also involves recourse to the reprocessing of irradiated fuel, a vital stage in the nuclear-fuel cycle; industrial mas tery of the reprocessing of fuel from light-water plants has already been demonstrated. The various international anti-proliferation agree ments concluded by the Commission are very satisfac tory, particularly those concluded with the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency. Likewise, the efforts made by Member States at national and Community level, as well as by other countries, with a view to improving safety have been very effective, since more than 200 high-power reac tors have operated for over 10 years without a major radiation accident. There have also been good grounds for satisfaction in the results obtained from radio-pro tection and the monitoring and protection of the envi ronment. In conclusion, we welcome being presented with such a document by the Commission which sets out all the efforts made to develop this energy. This is the moment for countries such as ours to reflect on the vital need to launch new important programmes in this area. What we are experiencing is, I repeat, only a brief respite on the oil market, a temporary phase of high production which must be put to good use. Everyone knows that what we want is a renewal of economic expansion in our countries and that energy consumption is proportional to economic expansion. The fight against unemployment necessitates the pro duction of abundant and cheap energy. That is the aim of this report, which, once again, we warmly welcome. President. \u2014 I call the Socialist Group. Mr Petersen. \u2014 (DA) Mr President, although there is a divergence of views within the Socialist Group on nuclear energy, we are unanimous in totally rejecting the Pintat report. It is quite simply a bad report, particularly as it takes the form of an uncritical and biased plea on behalf of nuclear energy. For that reason, we have decided that it would be futile to table amendments, since we reject the whole report as it stands. The Socialist Group also unanimously rejects the Commission's communication on which it is based, since it contains a whole series of unacceptable points. I shall confine myself to mentioning some of them. To begin with, we do not agree with the Commission's statement that the construction of nuclear power-sta tions in the Community is 50% behind the target set in 1974. The Commission states that it regrets this. We ",
        "18.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/275 Petersen feel that one should rather ask whether this statement can stand up to closer examination. Many things have happened since 1974. There was the crisis, which had a considerable impact on energy consumption. There were also energy-saving measures, and if one takes these two things into account the 1974 figures have been bypassed by events. Moreover, the Member States do not share the Commission's view, even those Member States which are in favour of nuclear energy. Secondly, I should like to point out that the Commis sion makes a blanket statement that electricity pro duced by nuclear power-stations is cheaper than that produced by coal-fired stations. This is an extremely bald statement which will not stand up to closer exam ination; moreover, the Commission puts forward no valid argument nor any proof whatsoever to justify its claim. There is an element of truth in the claim if one is simply considering running costs, but investment costs must also be taken into account. If, in addition, one takes into account the lifespan of nuclear power- stations, the security problems, accidents and the future dismantlement of the stations, will one arrive at the same figures? Taking all these factors into consid eration, one is forced to conclude that the Commis sion is making an uncritical propagandistic statement when it says that electricity produced by nuclear power-stations is cheaper than that produced by ther mal stations. Moreover, we know that France, which is the country that has constructed the most nuclear power-stations, grants enormous investment subsidies in this area. Therefore the price paid in France is a political price; in fact there is no way it could be anything else. Then there is the problem of storage, which the Com mission merely touches on as though it were already solved. But this difficult problem has not yet been solved, although the Commission prefers to ignore it, just as it ignores the problems of reprocessing and breeder reactors. In short, we feel that on this difficult topic the Com mission has produced a facile communication which gives a very superficial analysis of the problems involved. Moreover, Mr Pintat goes beyond the posi tions adopted by the Commission. In fact, even more than the Commission Mr Pintat puts forward no argu ment to justify this new impulse, which, he claims, should be given to the use of nuclear power-stations. It would be difficult to convince the adversaries of nuclear energy that such a programme is justified. Turning to the Pintat report, I should like to say that Mr Pintat sutes that it is absolutely necessary for countries without hydrocarbons to develop an exten sive nuclear programme. As everyone knows, four Community countries do not have nuclear power-sta tions \u2014 namely, Greece, Ireland, Luxembourg and Denmark. We in Denmark are grateful to Mr Pintat for his advice, but we want a solution to the problem of storing nuclear waste before embarking on a nuclear programme \u2014 if in fact we ever do so. There are three alternatives to building nuclear power-sta tions: massive recourse to renewable energies, energy-saving and the use of energies which are cur rently being wasted \u2014 namely, waste heat. If Parlia ment and the Commission took a genuine interest in renewable energies, it would be possible to point the way towards a Community energy policy. There is still a lot to be done in the area of energy-saving, as Den mark has shown. The Committee on Energy and Research recently visited Denmark and was able to see for itself that the recovery of energy in the form of heat is highly developed and will shortly supply 40% of urban heating. In paragraph 2 of his resolution, Mr Pintat stresses the possibility of switching from oil to electricity where heating is concerned. That is something I would not recommend, since it is uneconomical to use electricity for heating, in view of the fact that the efficiency fac tor is only Vi. As the Committee on Energy observed at \u00c5rhus, in Denmark, the development of a heat- recovery system would give an effeciency factor of 2 h. In my capacity as a Danish Social-Democrat, I should like to make a number of remarks on the Pintat reso lution. Mr Pintat calls for the creation of a European network: I should like to point out to him that Den mark already cooperates with other Scandinavian countries in this area \u2014 namely, Norway and Sweden \u2014 so that such a proposal is totally superfluous where Denmark is concerned. Mr Pintat states that the Commission should take measures vis-\u00e0-vis the Member States to encourage them to prospect for uranium. I believe that the Com mission is intelligent enough not to wish to intervene, even to try to intervene, vis-\u00e0-vis Member States, and in particular Denmark, even if uranium is found in Greenland. Indeed, an agreement between Greenland and Denmark stipulates that uranium deposits shall be jointly exploited and that any decision shall be taken by both parties. A little further on, Mr Pintat says that Euratom loans should be increased. An increase from 1 000 to 2 000 million ECU is, in his view, insufficent. I should like to point out again that four Member States do not have nuclear power-stations. That is why I see no reason for increasing the amount. Finally, Mr Pintat wants to see a Community contri bution to information on nuclear energy and safety. No, Mr Pintat, that is something we should leave to the political parties and to the governments of the national States! In any case, one cannot make any contribution to this sort of information if it is based on such fragile foundations as those proposed by the Commission, which Mr Pintat has not only taken over but extended in his report. ",
        "No 1-286/276 Debates of the European Parliament 18.6. 82 Petersen The Socialist Group is willing to discuss, on a scien tific basis, the use of nuclear energy as a possible solu tion for those countries that wish it. However, on the basis of the position put forward by the Commission and by Mr Pintat, there is no ground for trying to give a new impetus to nuclear energy. For that reason, we are totally opposed to Mr Pintat's report and to the Commission's proposal. IN THE CHAIR: MR LALOR Vice-President President. \u2014 I call the Group of the European Peo ple's Party (Christian-Democratic Group). Mr K. Fuchs. \u2014 (DE) Mr President, ladies and gen tlemen, unlike the previous speakers, I strongly sup port,\u00b7 on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party the Pintat report and the Commission communi cation on nuclear energy. I wish to congratulate Mr Pintat for his precise, clear and unequivocable report, which can really help us to reach a decision on this dif ficult question. In particular, he has avoided indeci- siveness and half-heartedness. From a political point of view, both are important, since they lead either to immobility or illusion and neither offers any guidance for the future. The Pintat report and the Commission communication set out clearly the r\u00f4le which nuclear energy can play in solving the energy problem. It also lays down the essential conditions. The Euro pean People's Party shares this view. We insist that we must not allow ourselves to be misled by the momen tary oil surplus, that we should, under no circum stances compromise the future of energy supply by failing to face up squarely to the problem of nuclear energy simply for the sake of a quiet life. Nuclear energy cannot, of course, solve the energy problem, but neither can this vital problem be solved without nuclear energy. We are concerned that, for lack of political will, only 50% of the target set out in the programme will be achieved. The most pressing need in the energy sector is to invest much more money than in the past; and this applies to nuclear energy. The report, therefore, rightly calls for the doubling of Euratom loans. An amendment by our group seeks to go even further. More information, along the lines of that given by the Commission, is obviously necessary, and there is clearly a need to compare energy sources. There is no need to shy away from this. What we need to do is to identify not only the conditions but also the advan tages involved in the use of nuclear energy. Safety is clearly the first priority. It is the first rule. The Commission states that it is a conditio sine qua non, and I should like to point out that during the years that it has been considering nuclear energy, the European Parliament has placed particular emphasis on this aspect. This is borne out by the fact that most of the report is devoted to the research and develop ment programme, and in committee the EPP Group submitted a further amendment on this point. We also wish to examine the effects on the environ ment, but in my view nuclear energy holds far fewer dangers than, for example, coal and oil. Clearly we must take economic factors into account. If we wish to combat unemployment, we must begin by making our economy more competitive. At the moment it is not competitive and as a result, jobs are at issue. When Mr Petersen says that he doubts whether nuclear energy is cheaper, I am obliged to reply that undertakings know how to choose between alternatives and they do not choose the most expensive, but inevitably opt for the alternative which offers better competitive advantages. This is enough to show that nuclear energy is superior to other forms of energy. Our countries can build up the uranium stocks required for the future. This would be of great value to us in a crisis situation. To this end, however, I believe that the Euratom Treaty must be revised. As provided for in Chapter 6, it must be adapted to the current situation and current structures. But world uranium reserves are finite: therefore they must be put to the best possible use. This means recy cling, since 97% of it can be reused. It also means improving technology. Fast-breeder reactors are up to sixty times as energy-efficient as ordinary light-water reactors. It would be a disaster not to continue the progress in the direction of high-temperature reactors. Moreover, the reprocessing and combustion of nuclear fuels made possible by fast-breeder reactors greatly reduces the problem of finally disposing of nuclear waste. From a technical point of view, the problem of final disposal has been solved. What is lacking is the politi cal will. I believe that the Commission's proposal and the Pintat report open up the proper road for the future. Nuclear energy can make a decisive contribution to one of the foundations of our energy programme \u2014 diversification. Future progress depends on having a variety of alternative sources of energy. Taking all these factors into consideration, the Group of the European People's Party welcomes the Commission's proposal and will vote for it. (Applause) President. \u2014 I call the European Democratic Group. ",
        "18.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1\u00ad286/277 Mr Seligman. \u2014 We all in this group welcome Mr Pintat's excellent report, and we have no further amendments to make, because it is a very clear, com\u00ad prehensive and powerful report. Since the first nuclear power\u00adstation was built in Britain at Calder Hall in 1956, the world has experienced 2 000 nuclear power\u00adstation\u00adyears of nuclear power and it has built over 260 nuclear power\u00adstations, and during that period not a single person has lost his live as a result of a nuclear reactor accident. This is because, of all meth\u00ad ods of producing energy, nuclear power is the most safe, the most studied and the most well\u00adengineered energy that exists. Every nuclear power reactor is built according to the Russian\u00addoll principle: that is to say, the core of the reactor is separated from the outside environment by a series of barriers. It is defence in depth. That is why opponents of nuclear power have got it wrong. They are doing a great disservice to their fel\u00ad lowmen. If they have their way, we shall enter the next century with a major deficit of energy and people will die, not from radiation, but from hunger, cold and even from a possible energy war. That is why we wel\u00ad come the initiative taken by Viscount Davignon for the Commission to enter more positively into the nuclear scene, and we welcome his intention to bring up to date Chapter 6 of the Euratom Treaty. Chap\u00ad ter 6 has never worked properly, and bureaucratic control under that chapter can hinder the free move\u00ad ment of raw materials and supplies, particularly in a rapidly changing market situation such as has occurred in recent months. Chapter 6 specifies equal access. Well, we do not know really what this means. Does it mean that every\u00ad one has to purchase on exactly the same basis? This would be a restraint on competition. We prefer the word 'non\u00addiscrimination' to 'free access'. The Com\u00ad mission has tried to revise Chapter 6 three times in the past and failed, so we must make sure that the Com\u00ad mission has success this time. We must get rid of bur\u00ad eaucratic monopoly in nuclear supplies. With regard to nuclear safety, this Parliament has already made its position quite clear in the Fuchs reso\u00ad lution on the 1990 objective and in the Lizin resolu\u00ad tion and on many other occasions. We all want increased safety in nuclear power and in waste dis\u00ad posal, but we do not want more Community regula\u00ad tions. We do not want more socialist bureaucracy strangling progress. We want safety to be the responsi\u00ad bility of the operating authority in each case. If we have more regulations the operator can just say, 'well, I followed the regulations to a T, but something went wrong. It is not my fault. This is what we did. It is your fault for getting the regulations wrong'. This is what happened at Three Mile Island:, the operating utility blamed the Nuclear Regulating Authority for not covering the situation in their regulations. We do not want the American situation to be duplicated in Europe. We want safety to be squarely placed on the shoulders of the operating company or authority, as it is now. Finally, the opponents of nuclear power say we do not need any more electricity at this time, we already have spare capacity. Well, as Mr Fuchs said, this is a tem\u00ad porary situation due to world recession and electricity demand is bound to pick up. What we do want, of course, is cheaper electricity, Mr Petersen says that cheapness of electricity is pure pro\u00ad paganda. Well, I know it is not, because my group only last week visited the North of Scotland Electricity Authority and there we saw the daily cost sheets of that authority. It was quite clear that one of their oil\u00ad fired power\u00adstations was costing 2 \u00b7 4 pennies per kilo\u00ad watt\u00adhour. One of their coal power\u00adstations was cost\u00ad ing 1 \u25a0 8 pennies per kilowatt\u00adhour. Their Magnox reactor, Hudson B, a nuclear reactor, was costing 1 \u00b7 2 pennies and their advanced gas\u00adcooled reactor, their latest one, was costing 0 \u00b7 79 pennies per kilowatt\u00adhour. There is the proof: three\u00adand\u00ada\u00adhalf times cheaper than oil! That is practical experience, so this is not propaganda. That is why France and Japan are push\u00ad ing ahead as fast as they can with nuclear power. Mr President, finally, our friends the Green People may not know it, but they are sabotaging the standard of living and future prosperity of their fellow citizens. By depriving Germany, for instance, of nuclear power to meet their energy requirements, they are forcing them to become dependent on imported Russian gas supplies. Whether the Green People know it or not, they are the unwitting tools of Communist imperial\u00ad ism, and I hope that the Socialist Group opposite will not join them in that effort. (Applause) President. \u2014 I call the Communist and Allies Group. Mr Veronesi. \u2014 Mr President, we Italian Communists have voted for and supported the motion for a resolu\u00ad tion and the report presented by Mr Pintat in the Committee on Energy and Research. We hereby con\u00ad firm that support. This support is the fruit of a conscientious examina\u00ad tion and deep reflection: we leave absolutely nothing to chance. It is important in this debate not to lose sight of the general background. In the year 2000, the world population will have increased by a further 2 billion people. There will still be a great deal of hun\u00ad ger and poverty and, if we are to be consistent with all we have said in the past few days, we must prepare to help those people towards emancipation and develop\u00ad ment. Energy is the fundamental starting\u00adpoint for carrying out these tasks and solving these problems. All sources ",
        "No 1-286/278 Debates of the European Parliament 18.6.82 Veronesi \u2014 all without exception, both renewable and conven tional \u2014 must be rationally used if we wish to face the problems we say we want to solve. That is why \u2014 whether we like or not \u2014 we feel that a fundamental r\u00f4le will be played by nuclear energy. The prudence, skill and sense of responsibility with which the technology has been carried forward are sufficient grounds today for looking towards an implementation of these programmes. Countries are very different one from another, but the general situation in the world makes it absolutely essential to have a large-scale strategy which is geared to the future and which provides guarantees against energy shortages. We are under no illusions as to current trends on the traditional fuels market, this being a purely temporary phenomenon. We shall be confronted with new ten sions and we shall encounter serious difficulties in dealing with problems of energy production in our countries. I should like to conclude with a methodological obser vation, which I address to the Commission. It is important, if at all possible, that these debates on energy and the various energy problems should be taken together. Conducted separately, the overall character of the problem dealt with is always lost sight of. We have already discussed security of supplies, waste products, alternative energies, coal; we have dealt with all these questions! We must not lose sight of this general background, against which we have condensed all the exigencies for a sound and sensible exploitation of energy resources in Europe and throughout the world. Convinced of its value, we therefore confirm our intention to vote for the Pintat report \u2014 offering our congratulations to Mr Pintat \u2014 and we shall vote for the motion for a resolution. (Applause) President. \u2014 The non-attached Members have the floor. Mr Eisma. \u2014 (NL) Mr President, we are certainly less enthusiastic than the rapporteur and Mr Fuchs, Mr Seligman and Mr Veronesi about this proposal from the Commission. I shall not take more than 3 minutes to explain this attitude. We are not in favour of the construction of fast- breeder reactors for a number of reasons, including political, safety and economic considerations. We are opponents of the 'plutonium economy', and this means, in our view, that energy from nuclear fission is no solution in the long term. With conventional light- water reactors, the uranium is used up after 30 or 40 years. Over the long term, our efforts should be directed towards meeting our energy requirements from the sun, light and nuclear fusion. As we have already pointed out in the debate on the budget for research into nuclear fusion, some months ago, we have far fewer objections to nuclear fusion. For the short term, Mr President \u2014 that is to say, in the next 30 to 40 years \u2014 the energy shortage must be offset by coal, processed natural gas and savings. Sav ings are indeed possible \u2014 up to 30% if we are really determined. Conventional nuclear plants can make a contribution, but they are not strictly necessary, although some say that they are cheaper. At all events, so longeas the problems with the disposal of radioac tive materials and the safe dismantling of old plants are not solved, we feel there is no justification for building new nuclear plants. The saying 'with time comes counsel' is dangerous here \u2014 if not for us, then at least for our children and grandchildren. We do not agree, therefore, with the policy as set out in the Commission's communication to the Council on the nuclear aspects of an energy strategy for the Community. A less considered docu ment on the subject of nuclear energy I have not read for a long time. The steadily increasing protests by the people against the construction of new nuclear plants have clearly escaped the Commission. We should therefore vote with conviction against Mr Pintat's enthusiastic report. President. \u2014 I call Mrs Weber. Mrs Weber. \u2014 (DE) Mr President, I should like to begin by dealing with what Mr Seligman said. I find somewhat cavalier the statement that, without nuclear energy, the Russians will be able to export Commun ism to Germany through the gas-pipes! I wonder where many of the countries represented in this Chamber buy their uranium. I have heard it rumoured that there are deposits even in South Africa. We in Europe have for too long been presented with this kind of report on nuclear energy which in cavalier fashion simply sweeps under the carpet actual and pos sible problems. I regard this as an enormously danger ous way of proceeding, particularly when dealing with people, who, initially, are not totally opposed to nuclear energy but who sincerely and intelligently ask how the problems involved in the use of nuclear energy can be avoided and where one can reach a re sponsible and intelligent decision. It is precisely these views which make it difficult to arrive at a correct decision. Such triumphalist reports, which simply ignore every problem which not only the European public but also scientists have been discuss ing for thirty years, make it impossible even for those ",
        "18.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/279 Weber who were originally in favour of nuclear energy to reach a decision. Where are safety questions, such as hair-line cracks and Harrisburg, mentioned? These are irrefutable facts. Where are health problems mentioned? Where is any attempt made to deal with continuous exposure to low-level radiation, which, even in the Community, is being studied? Where is the whole environmental problem, the heat-pollution of water, the influence on climatic conditions, the effect of radiation? What about profitability? Surely you are not trying to hoodwink us into believ ing that nuclear energy is cheaper? If nuclear energy were really so ridiculously cheap, why are the Member States increasingly shifting the enormous cost of research to the Community? As Mr Petersen has pointed out, these costs are not included. Shutting- down costs are not included, nor are the research costs. Even the French do not include them. I regard ' as suspect this way of dealing with so important a problem. Turning now to the last problem, which the supporters of nuclear energy take less seriously than those who are opposed to it. I am still convinced that it is neces sary to elicit the support of the people of Europe for the task of ensuring energy supplies and in particular for acceptable energy supplies. This way of proceeding is the worst possible way of persuading people to accept a particular form of energy supply. You cannot ignore the fact that at least 30% of the population is against nuclear energy . .. (Pros tests) ... Yes, that is the question which always arises, whether one should take advantage in this way of the majority one has or believes that in a democracy one should respect the will of the minority. That is what democracy means to me. As far as I am concerned, democracy also means that, when a large minority has serious reservations concerning the future of our society, one should at least consider their wishes and take them into account when making political deci sion. I believe that as long as the people of Europe do not accept nuclear energy to the extent that is demo cratically desirable, one should abandon such trium- phalist reports. For that reason, I support Mr Peter sen's statement that a report of this sort should be categorically and decisively rejected. (Applause) President. \u2014 I call Mr Normanton. Mr Normanton. \u2014 Mr President, the Pintat report merits the unanimous endorsement of those Members who have been elected to this House with the sole object of serving the best interests of those who elected them, as well as their children and their chil dren's children. In connection with energy, safety, as I see it, means freedom from injury to health and damage to the envi ronment. Security means, as far as I am concerned, freedom from interruption or the threat to interrupt the certain, assured, constant availability of energy at the lowest practical cost to the user. We should never forget in this House that, like freedom in a democratic society, public and politicians alike, or rather too many of them, tend to take for granted the energy available to us in its many forms today. Like freedom, we only appreciate the value of energy when it is no longer available to us, or when we have to pay an exorbitant, intolerably high price for it. The rise in oil prices which broke in 1973 and its devastating impact on the lives of every man, woman and child for whom we were elected to this House could have been anticipated and, I believe, mitigated, had governments of Member States \u2014 all Member States of the Community \u2014 acted in a responsible and timely fashion in the matter of nuclear power for elec tricity generation. The fact that we didn't is, I believe, a very serious indictment of political leadership, or rather the lack of it, in this field. Had programmes for the construction of nuclear power-stations right across Europe been only 15% greater in number or faster in rate of completion, then three million more men and women would today be employed and the monetary recession, in which we limp from one crisis to another, would have been significantly smaller. Nuclear electri cal power is the cleanest, safest, cheapest and most reliable means of generating power, however one may assemble and compare the available statistics. In only one of our Member States has government dis played vision, judgment and resolution in turning from words which mean nothing to deeds, which mean in its case the initiation of a programme for the construction of nuclear generating stations on a scale unprece dented in European industrial history. Its aim is to turn its economy into one which is far less dependent on imported oil and therefore political blackmail in respect of price or supply. France deserves the applause of every Member of this House for the ben efits which its nuclear programme will bring to this Community as a whole. The French economy and those millions who are engaged in it will reap as rich a harvest in the form of increased competitive capability as France has reaped over many years in the field of agriculture. This, I believe, is the salient point of political import ance to be read into the Pintat report. It is also the main point being made by the Commission in its policy paper that is before us. Last week, Mr President, accompanied by Mr Cluskey and Mr Irmer I visited the Comunit/s Joint Research ",
        "No 1-286/280 Debates of the European Parliament 18.6.82 Normanton Centre at Ispra. It is here that Mr Pintat's plea for increased study of and attention to ever-higher stand ards of safety is being followed up for the benefit of all the citizens of Europe. We also met there and had dis cussions with the staff working on the Super Sara pro ject. The Joint Research Centre is faced with a great challenge. It has a great opportunity to restore the reputation which was so regrettably tarnished when the Court of Auditors and our Budgetary Control Committee descended upon it in recent years. I do assure the House, however, that the Committee on Energy and Research will be playing a major part in future in monitoring and reporting on progress in the two areas of research to which Mr Pintat refers in this report. I strongly support Mr Pintat's report. President. \u2014 I call Mr Petronio. Mr Petronio. \u2014 (IT) Mr President, the reductions in oil prices and the greater availability of this energy source at the moment should not make us over-optim istic, for these two factors are proof of a dangerous stagnation in world economic activity. If we consider this situation as structural, we should be prepared for a zero growth-rate for quite some time, and therefore for a progressive increase in unemploy ment. But since the fight against unemployment is one of our Community's top priorities, since this is also true of the fight against inflation and since, finally, the success of both these battles is tied above all to a restoration of the balance-of-payments situation and a substantial reduction of the oil deficit, we need to con sider the present breathing-space on the oil market as no more than a short-term phenomenon. We must therefore take advantage of this brief respite, the dura tion of which we cannot predict, to prepare ourselves for a foreseeable shortage and thus for higher costs of oil products, things which are bound to happen because of the growing needs of the third World and as a result of the hoped-for revival of world economic activity. Otherwise we shall remain helpless, contenting our selves with zero growth \u2014 the pessimistic outlook and deplorable state of affairs projected by the famous Club of Rome on the basis of one of its reports, though contradicted by other reports drawn up by the brilliant Paris group. We must therefore adjust our selves to an expected fall in population growth and an appreciable diminution of consumption, particularly at the expense the Third World, or else push decisively for the post-industrial revolution, toward a highly technological and computerized society. In our opi nion, what we must do in practical terms is take advantage of the breathing-space on the oil market to organize our response to the third energy challenge which will be issued sooner or later and which will constitute a further shock for our economy. As to the dilemma between coal or nuclear energy, account must be taken of the fact that electricity pro duced by burning coal costs, as we have been told by the Committe on Economic and Monetary Affairs, between 30 and 90 percent more than that obtained from nuclear plants. In addition to research into the liquefaction and gasification of coal and on all the other alternative sources, from solar energy to bio- mass, it is also necessary therefore to develop a nuclear programme, which must indeed be considered a vital necessity. Our vote will thus be in favour of the Pintat report for the reasons I have briefly outlined, but it is also intended as an encouragement to the Commission to give practical consideration to the establishment of a European electrical network capable of meeting mini mum and maximum supply demands whenever neces sary. This would enable States without nuclear plants to obtain supplies from States possessing such plants. My final observation concerns the problem of safety, which must be solved if we are to avoid, as far as pos sible, the threat of anti-nuclear barricades which we have heard about in Denmark. It is true that 200 high-power reactors have operated for ten years without any serious accidents, but this is not enough. We must insist, on the one hand, on rapid progress with Ispra's Super Sara research project, which is of the greatest importance because it is unique, and, on the other hand, seek the best methods for storing radioactive residues and demonstrate their efficacy. President. \u2014 I call Mr Protopapadakis. Mr Protopapadakis. \u2014 (GR) I also support the Pintat report, because I believe that we need unlimited and abundant energy and that the use of nuclear energy is a valuable means of meeting this need. Without abun dant energy, it will be impossible to maintain the cul ture which we in Europe have created, nor can we entertain the hope that other countries can attain an equally high living standard. Consequently, there are social and cultural, as well as economic, reasons for promoting the use of nuclear energy. Indeed artists and philosophers and those ecologists who are opposed to nuclear energy use the very same energy to develop their ideas and their artistic or philosophical talents. A lack of energy would consequently affect them as much as others, and in fact perhaps even more. I would also stress that an abundant supply of energy is an important element in safeguarding world peace. With regard to the fears concerning the dangers involved in the use of nuclear reactors, I wish to state that, although many people regard the report as unsat isfactory, I have complete trust in nuclear-power tech- ",
        "18.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/281 Protopapadakis nologists and am convinced that they would not per mit projects to be undertaken which constituted a dan ger to mankind. Those who have no trust in these scientists should say so openly and demand that the universities close down the faculties at which nuclear- energy technologists study, since, in their view, these scientists are monsters and a danger to humanity. Needless to say, I reject this view. On the contrary, my support for nuclear energy is based on my trust in these people. Nuclear-energy technologists are men like us. They also have children whom they love, and they are also concerned about the fate of their chil dren's children. Let us, therefore, trust science and the scientists and not seek to put politics in their place! President. \u2014 I call Mr Sherlock. Mr Sherlock. \u2014 Mr President, I must first of all draw to your attention to the fact that I am not speaking in my r\u00f4le of draftsman of the opinion of the Entertain ment Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection. (Laughter) That was a Freudian one, was it not? Because on this occasion it really was more like an entertainment com mittee. The small and, I thought, fairly sensible and sensitive report I had produced was in fact brutally done to death on a burning deck whence almost all but I had fled. There was a very considerable Socialist majority, which brings me to my first point, that I cannot imag ine why those who seem to think they feel the pulse of humanity so warmly should take such a cold attitude towards the topic of providing energy for the reasonably foreseeable future. (Applause) It totally passeth my comprehension. But one thing does come well into my comprehension, and that is that those of us who seem to be at the two poles of this nuclear argument might just as well not waste time by talking to one another. No conviction will ever be car ried across this House, I am certain. I have made a few points. One was from a consumer point of view, because the committee is concerned with consumer affairs; and that is that whatever the method of accountancy \u2014 and there are some curious methods of accountancy employed \u2014 at least there is a reasonable realization that a plateau is predictable for the pricing of electricity from nuclear sources and that it is unlikely to be hoisted by many of the factors which do interfere with other forms of electricity production. It is also 100% clear to me, who have watched people cough themselves to their bronchitic deaths in the Bri tish atmosphere, polluted very largely by the fuels of fossil origin, that without any doubt nuclear power is the cleanest, healthiest, neatest, sweetest way of pro ducing electricity. Of that I am certain beyond a peradventure. Shortly we shall be hearing the same Socialist cabal crying its eyes out at the prospect of acid rain, from the burning of fossil fuels, falling on the Norwegians \u2014 crocodile tears, I think. Another matter I draw attention to is the need to edu cate those who are left in the middle and at least give some of them a chance to form their own opinion without being too much pushed from either side by those who argue about these matters. My final point about the environment is that it is alright for us who are mostly pushing around in mid dle-class sort of situations, thinking about green fields and all the rest of it; but the environment for a great many of our population, including some of those who are foolish enough to vote for those opposite, is a fairly small room in which they spend a large part of their life, where they want to press a switch and know that the warmth will come on. They also want to know it will come on at price which they can reasonably afford. This is the environment which most of us are thinking about most of the time. Finally, I would like to invite someone with more artistic ability than my own to invent a sticker for the motor-cars which at the moment are carrying the pretty one which in one of the parent languages reads, 'Atomkraft? Nein, danke'. I would like one with a ici cle drawn on it and the motto around, 'Who is going to be a cold little girl?' (Laughter and applause) President. \u2014 I call Sir Peter Vanneck. Sir Peter Vanneck. \u2014 Mr President, I am, as you know, the security hawk of my group. It is for this reason, because I am so keen on the Community being strong economically as well as militarily, that I support this resolution. The Russians are as keen to debilitate us in the one field as in the other. Opponents to nuclear power in Europe are playing the Russian game, whether they know it or not. Mr Veronesi showed his sense of balance: I wish the Socialists, including Mrs Weber, would do likewise. In going forward, the choice in providing the energy the free world needs is between the theoretical pollu tion of nuclear energy and practical pollution from coal. The radiation Mrs Weber receives on a flight from Strasbourg to Paris is ten times that which she receives in a year from nuclear power. And let us not forget, as Mr Seligman has said, we have had in the ",
        "No 1-286/282 Debates of the European Parliament 18.6. 82 Vanneck West 2 000 nuclear reactor-years of safe \u2014 i.e., non fatal \u2014 operation. The airlines cannot say the same. The pollution, including radiation from coalburning, is becoming intolerable, not only to us in the Com munity but from as far afield as Norway, as Dr Sher lock has wittily emphasized. Nuclear energy is the long-term solution because it is the only available technology to fill the energy gap. Solar and fusion techniques are not yet really labora tory-proven, still less industrially proven. I would say to the Socialists, the conviction which par liamentarians show in encouraging nuclear energy is the test of their sincerity in wanting to end unemploy ment. (Protests from the Socialist benches) If Socialists oppose nuclear energy, ergo they are unwilling to use a helpful tool for combating unem ployment. They are the victims of their lack of politi cal logic. Socialists should show political leadership in educating public opinion about the safety of nuclear power relative to the risks of other industrial activities instead of following a cheap-jack line to attract un educated votes. (Further protests) Finally, Mr Seligman quoted the figure of 0 \u00b7 79 pence per kilowatt-hour for advanced gas-cooled reactors against 2-12 pence per kilowatt-hour for oil. I would say to Mrs Weber, who questioned that, that that does include commissioning and waste-disposal costs. I hope this Assembly will join in supporting the Pintat report. (Applause) President. ment. I call Mr Boyes to make a personal state- Mr Boyes. \u2014 Mr President, as a representative of the constituency adjacent to Sir Peter Vanneck's, I would ask him if he would he like to withdraw the fact that people who voted for me were uneducated people. Would he like to withdraw that remark, please? President. \u2014 I call Mr Purvis. Mr Purvis. \u2014 Mr President, I hope the Commission has noticed that there is a little footnote on the agenda referring to an oral question signed by myself and var ious of my colleagues which may not seem directly related to the Pintat report, but it relates specifically to the coal question. As we have heard from many speakers, there is a very direct relation, because the Commission's proposal for the energy balance in Europe over the next 15 to 20 years \u2014 even if it is all achieved on the nuclear side, the alternative energy side and every other side \u2014 will apparently result in the use of coal in the Community more than doubling. Where is that coal to come from? They estimate that indigenous coal production will stay mostly static around the level of 250 million tonnes per annum, as hew coalmines replace old coal mines. That means that something like 350 million tonnes are going to be imported. What steps has the Commission taken, or is it satisfied that the private sector is taking the necessary, steps to ensure that that balance of supply is available to us? It is still set on the targets that it presented eighteen months ago? Are the predictions of indigenous coal supply still the same and what overseas supplies are they prepared to assure us will be available? If that is the case, what steps are they taking to improve the infrastructure? I wonder if it has ever been really thought out in a straightforward manner, what effect this will have on the environment in terms of pollution caused by the burning of all that coal, what rail transport will be required, what enormous expansion of port facilities will be needed, and the stockyards, not just for the coal in transit but presum ably for 90 days' stocks, i.e., 250 million tonnes of coal. What about the provision of new power-stations to burn that coal and transmit the energy by wire? All these things have not really, as far as I can make out, been faced, and I would appreciate the Commis sion doing so. If they say \u2014 as they have said in our committee once or twice \u2014 they do not have the staff to do it, will they consider commissioning outside con sultants to go into this in some depth? President. \u2014 I call the Commission. Mr Natali, Vice-President of the Commission. \u2014 (IT) Mr President, I begin by replying to the debate that has taken place on the Pintat report and assuring Mr Purvis that the Commission is not unaware that this debate also includes a question which, if I am not mistaken, bears his name as the first signatory. As regards the Pintat report, I wish to say in all sincer ity that my congratulations to its author on the work he has done are not a matter of pure form. We have the distinct impression that he has completely grasped the salient features of this communication from the Commission on the nuclear aspects of a Community energy strategy. I should add, in all justice, that he is not the only one to have done so: others, too, have underlined these features in the course of this debate. What, in fact, are these salient features? ",
        "18.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/283 Natali The first, as has been pointed out by Mr Fuchs and Mr Veronesi, is that the contribution of nuclear energy must be assessed within the framework of a compre\u00ad hensive energy strategy and compared with that derived from other sources of energy. Let me say in passing: only too often the mistake has been made of considering this form of energy in isola\u00ad tion \u2014 doubtless because of the existence of a separate atomic energy treaty \u2014 and this has encouraged an all too emotional and dogmatic dispute which is not con\u00ad ducive to an objective view of the matter. Mr Peter\u00ad son, I hope, will not take it amiss if I say that in his speech I detected, perhaps, an echo of this emotional and even dogmatic conflict. \u03b9 The second of the features brought out by the report is that, for the first time since nuclear energy has assumed industrial proportions, the Commission has submitted an organic document which, albeit in con\u00ad cise and sometimes unavoidably summary form, deals with all the important aspects of the nuclear problem : economic, industrial and development questions, ques\u00ad tions of research and supply, safeguards to ensure the peaceful use of nuclear materials, safety and the dis\u00ad posal of radioactive waste. The third feature \u2014 and here I particularly have in mind Mr Petersen, Mrs Weber and Mr Eisma \u2014 is that the Commission, while mindful of the positive and, I would even say, essential aspects of nuclear energy, does not underestimate the problems that have to be faced. One only has to read the paragraphs relat\u00ad ing to the reprocessing of irradiated nuclear fuels, the safety of workers and of the population at large and the protection of the environment to see that we are not approaching this problem over-optimistically of vaingloriously but in a spirit of responsibility as \u2014 to take up a term used in the debate by, I think, Mr Nor- manton and Mr Petronio \u2014 a 'challenge' which can\u00ad not be ignored. As a Communtiy, we certainly have all the means required to meet it: growing internal cohe\u00ad sion and enhanced cooperation on an international scale. Dealing briefly with the motion for a resolution, I would assure Mr Pintat and the honourable Members that we shall fully meet our commitments as regards implementing and extending the operations already in progress and the launching of new initiatives: here I referto paragraphs 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 17 of the motion for a resolution. I should like to say to Mr Seligman, who is present and who dealt, among other things, with the relative need for supplies, that we shall submit as soon as pos\u00ad sible a proposal on Chapter 6 of the Euratom Treaty. Obviously, as laid down in that Treaty, the European Parliament will have to be consulted, and this will be done as soon as possible. I should like, therefore, to point out, with regard to paragraph 16 of the motion for a resolution, that the Commission has already had an opportunity, during the debate on the Walz report, to state its position on this subject. Speaking generally, therefore, I would remind the House that the new arrangements for applying Article 37 of the Euratom Treaty are dealt with in Mr Calvez' amendment providing for a new paragraph 17A. This amendment has our support, since it points out that we have submitted a proposal concerning new arrangements for applying Article 37 with reference to the disposal of radioactive effluents capable of polluting the waters, soil and air-space of a neighbouring Member State. I dwell on this point because our proposal constitutes a response to a call made repeatedly by the European Parliament, which, during the debate on the Walz report, was given an undertaking by the Commission which has now been carried out. Referring still to paragraph 16 of the motion, I should like to recall what my colleague Mr Davignon had occasion to say at the sitting of 17 February during the debate on the Walz report. First of all, Mr Davignon pointed out that the call on the Council to amend its decision on Euratom loans (which, pursuant to Article 203, can only be done unanimously) so as to make them conditional on the positive outcome of a Community consultation procedure could only lead to another blockage in the decision-making process. Mr Davignon emphasized the Commission's undertaking \u2014 which I hereby confirm \u2014 that when exercising its own responsibility for determining the conditions of eligibility for Euratom loans, it would take account of the position of the European Parliament. I now pass, Mr President, to the problems raised in the question by Mr Purvis and others. As regards the powers of the Coal and Steel Com\u00ad munity relating to trade policy, these powers, which are governed by Chapter 10 of the Treaty, are rather limited, and from now on no possibility is foreseen of entrusting to the Commission the conduct of negotia\u00ad tions with third countries for contracts for the import of coal into the Community. Naturally, within the framework of regular consulta\u00ad tions with third countries on energy problems, the Commission takes into consideration the export potential of these countries' coal-mining industry and their infrastructure with the object of reducing poten\u00ad tial pressures on European importers. This is the line we have adopted, and we propose to stick to it. Then there is the question of investing money in all the various stages of coal production in order to ensure regular supplies of coal to the Community. Members will know that certain financial instruments are already in existence, but at present there is no intention of strengthening these instruments in rela\u00ad tion to the countries named in the question \u2014 that is, ",
        "No 1-286/284 Debates of the European Parliament 18.6.82 Natali if I am not mistaken, the United States, Canada, Aus tralia and South Africa. As regards the r\u00f4le that can be played by EEC com mercial companies in assuring the adequacy and secur ity of imported coal supplies, this falls within the area of national import measures, above all those taken by the coal-producing countries. I agree on the desirability of incorporating a discus sion on coal into a general debate on questions of energy. I would only point out that we have just been debating a Commission document on the nuclear aspects of our energy strategy. In the document on coal in the Community's energy strategy, submitted on 10 February, we propose a con sultation procedure for European companies con cerned with coal supplies and an examination of man agement procedures in the event of crises at Com munity level. In our view, these mechanisms may help to maintain Community supplies at an adequate level from different sources. As for the last question, concerning the need for pro tecting the Community's coal industry, I need hardly remind you that under the ECSC Treaty Member States can fix their own customs duties on coal imported from third countries and may introduce a system of import licences. The coal-producing coun tries consequently have the means of protecting and maintaining their own coal production. In its communication of 10 February 1982, however, the Commission pointed out the economic and finan cial costs of such protection for the governments con cerned and also for consumers, and these governments are in fact now encountering ever greater difficulties in financing this support. The Commission has submit ted proposals which would have reduced the burden on these governments, but they failed to gain the Council's approval. (Applause) President. \u2014 I call Mr Radoux to speak on a point of order. Mr Radoux. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, very briefly on a point of order. We are all familiar with the conditions under which we vote on a Friday morning, and I shall not expatiate upon the matter. But whatever you say in reply, I consider that it just is not responsible conduct on our part to take the vote now on a subject as important as the one we are about to vote on, when this House has over 400 Members \u2014 even if after wards you establish how many took part in the vote. President. \u2014 All Members have their views on that. We are all expected to be here on the Friday morning when the House sits. I call Mr de Courcy Ling. Mr de Courcy Ling. \u2014 Mr President, Mr Radoux has drawn attention to a rather serious state of affairs, and I think on behalf of my group, it would be wise if we emphasized it by having a roll-call vote. President. \u2014 I call the rapporteur. Mr Pintat, rapporteur. \u2014 (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I wish to thank all those who have spoken for the quality of their contributions : this debate has proved extremely interesting. I should like to reply very briefly to some of the argu ments relating to the thesis put forward by Mr Peter sen and his political friends. Obviously, this report has never maintained that all the energy consumed should be derived from nuclear sources. Clearly, this cannot cover the energy requirements of motor-cars, aircraft or many other sectors. Mr Petersen maintains that electric heating is uneconomical, but to this it should be added that all fuels are equally so. I would remind you that all fuels are equally so. I would remind you that according to the Carnot principle only a very small yield can be expected from burning coal. If we have no more steam engines today, that is because, as a result of the Carnot cycle, the yield is much lower than in the case of electric locomotives. Mr Petersen also maintained that I had said coal-fired power-stations were much more expensive than nuclear power-stations. I never said that. What I spoke of was the cost price, not per power-station, but per kilowatt-hour, and this, according to the fuel used and the investments required \u2014 I have here the figures for my own country \u2014 amounts to 15 centimes for nuclear power, 25 centimes for coal and 45 centimes for oil. Mr Petersen also asserted that Electricit\u00e9 de France received state subsidies: I would point out that it receives no subsidies from the French Government but borrows widely on the international Euro-currency market. I would also point out to Mr Petersen that the con sumption of energy is going to increase very consider ably between now and the end of this century. All the experts are agreed on this, first, because of the econo mic expansion we hope for in the fight against unem ployment, then because of the increase \u2014 2 000 mil lion people more \u2014 to be expected in the world population between now and the end of the century, and finally because of increased consumption in coun tries of the third and fourth worlds, which at present are in a state of penury. Those who for years have attended, as I have, world congresses on energy problems will know that the ",
        "18.6.82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/285 Pintat most fervent champions of nuclear energy are the countries of the third and fourth worlds, who consider that 'it is the duty of the industrialized countries to consume nuclear energy; they can do so and leave us the coal and the oil that are available'. At a time when we are rightly engaging in.the fight against world hunger, it would be selfish of us not to use nuclear energy in our own countries, since this would mean condemning to hunger countries of the third and fourth worlds which are in great need of energy for the fertilizers needed to produce their food. One last remark provoked by a speaker who was argu ing that a choice has to be made between fast-breeder reactors and fusion. In my view \u2014 and some of us have had an opportunity of visiting Calder Hall, thanks mainly to the good offices of Mr Seligman \u2014 such a choice is quite superfluous, because fusion, which Europe is doing a great deal to promote and which is now fairly well advanced, cannot, even if its proves successful, be put to industrial use before the third decade of the next century; whereas using uran ium in a fast breeder instead of a classical reactor makes it possible to multiply the world's energy reserves fifty-fold. The use of fast breeders would obviate all problems with regard to world supplies of uranium. That is the reply I wanted to make very briefly to Mr Petersen and his friends. President. \u2014 The debate is closed. 1 lation (EEC) No 1430/79, on the repayment or remission of import or export duties. I call the rapporteur. Mrs Lenz, rapporteur. \u2014 (DE) Mr President, I will keep it short. The report before you concerns a rather technical matter in which Commission and Parliament, in the citizens' interests, are agreed on the need to modify a regulation on the repayment of import or export duties. All we are concerned with is the adjust ment of a regulation making possible repayments which under the present r\u00e9gime had not been possible in this form. Under the new arrangement, these repay ments will be allowed under certain conditions and so facilitate imports and exports between our various countries. Having been informed by the Commission that the Member States would not withhold their approval, the committee gave the proposal its unanimous support. President. \u2014 I call the Commission. Mr Natali, Vice-President of the Commission. \u2014 (IT) On behalf of the Commission, I offer my sincere thanks to Mrs Lenz for her report, the committee for its unanimous opinion and the Parliament for the approval which it will assuredly give to this proposal.

On 19 June 1981, the Christian Democrats and the Conservatives prevented the imple mentation of this information system and so helld up the introduction of this necessary consumer protection for one year. My assent to this report today is mainly based on the fact that, apart from a few cosmetic improvements, it differs in no way from the previously so hotly-disputed draft report of Mrs Seibel-Emmerling.

Explanations of vote Mr Horgan. \u2014 Mr President, I wish to indicate that I shall be voting against this motion for a number of reasons: principally because voting for this proposal will, in the short and certainly in the medium term, lead to an increase in taxation on the already hard-pressed population of Europe, and it will do so because, if this view of competition in air transport is adopted in the form in which it is before us today, the inevitable result will be subsidies by national governments to national airlines to stop them going the way of Braniff and Laker \u2014 those so-called pioneers of free enterprise. And, secondly, because I believe that the ideology of competition and of a spurious freedom of choice, which is available only to those with the ability to pay, is particularly ill-suited to an essential public service such as air transport. Mr Lalor. \u2014 Mr President, I shall be voting against this resolution. Speaking to the House last night, I did ask that we look at this matter objectively and consider that both the Commission and the committee bringing in this report were acting too speedily and not taking into consideration the experience of the big airlines over the last couple of years. I said that I should be voting against this resolution this morning unless certain of the amendments that had been submitted were passed which would basically change the content of the report. This has not happened. We have only had one reasonable amend ment accepted. The rest have been refused. One of the reasons why I am voting against, Mr President, is that it was said somebody could not speak on this resolution yesterday because he could not afford to fly here. I want to indicate that the reason why he was not here is that anyone who wanted to speak for it is still in cloud-cuckoo-land, where he was flown by Laker Airlines and now cannot get back. Herman report (Doc. 1-189182): adopted The rapporteur spoke \u2014 in favour of Amendment No 1, and \u2014 against Amendments Nos 2, 3 and 4. Explanations of vote Mrs Salisch. \u2014 (DE) Mr President, I am sorry, but I can't do it this time in writing, because I should like my colleagues to hear the criticism I have to make. On a report whose title includes the word 'employment' the Committee on Social Affairs and Employ ment has not been consulted, and that I find deeply regrettable. So much for my formal criticism. As regards the substance, I would say that here we are offered a correct analysis but the consequences drawn in the motion for a resolution are, in my view, inadequate. The rapporteur himself speaks of a serious threat to employment, but does not draw the consequences. ",
        "No 1-286/288 Debates of the European Parliament 18.6.82 The motion for a resolution is, I would say, unfavourable to industry: there are no recom mendations for social control; all mention of workers' participation has been abandoned; nothing much is said about the reduction of working hours. As a result, it fails to come up to what has already been decided on these subjects in this House. Therefore I shall abs- tian. Mr Herman, rapporteur. \u2014 (FR) I should like to point out to Mrs Salisch that the opinion of the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment has been asked for and been given. This committee informed us that it had already adopted an attitude on this subject in con nection with an earlier report.

Explanations of vote Mr Protopapadakis. \u2014 (GR) Mr President, I shall vote for the Harris report because I believe that coastal protection is, perhaps, one of the most important topics with which we are called upon to deal. Since, however, the report deals with a very wide topic \u2014 an immeasurably wide topic, I would say \u2014 I fear that certain coaslines such as those of the Greek islands will be lost sight of in this enormous area, because they have no political power to protect them and set them apart from other areas. These islands are in danger of being ruined by tourism, since not all our visitors from the north are committed to protec tion of the coastline. This leads to disrespect for, and arrogance towards, the local popula tion, pollution of the beaches and large- and small-scale thefts. One may speak of petty theft in the case of disappearance of objects needed for every day use which one has for gotten to take with one, and of large-scale theft when articles of archaeological value are involved. There is also traffic in drugs. These points, which are dealt with in the text we are voting on, must be stressed and taken into account by the responsible authorities, so that the Greek Islands can be properly pro tected, not only for the sake of the local population, but also for tourists who appreciate the islands and wish to see them in their natural beauty.

        "18. 6. 82 Debates of the European Parliament No 1-286/289 Lega report (Doc. 1-321/82): adopted Pintat report (Doc. 1-303/82): adopted Explanations of vote Mr Kallias. \u2014 (GR) Mr President, in view of the urgent need for abundant and cheap energy on the one hand, and the dangers involved in the use of nuclear energy on the other, I wish to express the wish that the least dangerous energy sources will be developed so that they can at least meet the energy needs of the smallest countries, and that the dan gers involved in the use of nuclear energy can be diminished over the years. For this reason I shall abstain, despite my very high esteem for Mr Pintat's work and for the important arguments which he has brought forward in support of his views. Mr Skovmand. \u2014 (DA) Reading the Commission's communication to the Council on an energy strategy for the Community (nuclear aspects), one could almost believe that it was written by the nuclear industry itself, so enthusiastic and uncritical is it as regards nuclear energy. Although it begins with a few pious words on alternative sources of energy, it goes on to say, without putting forward any evidence, that they will not be able to play any part until after the year 2000. Consequently, the only alternative at the moment is to develop nuclear energy. The Commission's communication states that nuclear power is the cheapest form of fuel for generating electricity. It goes so far as to assert that it will remain the cheapest form of fuel even when one takes into account the cost of nuclear-waste storage and the cost of dismantling nuclear power-stations in the future. The Commission undoubtedly receives its information from the INFCE. There is no mention of the fact that other studies have reached different conclusions. In the Commission's view, there is only one problem where nuclear energy is concerned \u2014 namely, the fact that there are still some people who have not grasped the advantages of nuclear energy, particularly the Danes. Both the Commission's document and the Pin tat report suggest that steps must be taken to inform these stupid people of the benefits of nuclear energy in order to induce the Danish Government to modify its policy in this area. The Popular Movement against Danish Membership of the EEC regards this continual pressure on Denmark as unacceptable. For this reason, we shall vote against the report.
