        "EN 2 EN COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE COUNCIL EDF Performance Review and Proposal for the Release of the Remaining Conditional Balances of the 9 th European Development Fund I NTRODUCTION For the initial period of five years under the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement, commencing 1 March 2000 and covering the period from ratification until the end of 2007, the Community\u2019s financial assistance to the African Caribbean and Pacific countries (ACP) comprises an initial amount of \u20ac13.5billion from the 9th European Development Fund (EDF). Of this total, \u20ac1billion shall be released on the basis of a performance review that shall assess the degree of realisation of commitments and disbursements 1 . The present Communication confirms that the reforms set in motion by the Commission in 2000 resulted in improved performance over recent years measured in terms of the degree of realisation of commitments and disbursements 2 , and that this positive trend has been further strengthened by the mid-term review process conducted in 2004. It concludes that the 9th EDF, including the balances transferred from the previous EDFs, will be entirely committed by the end of 2007 without even allowing the Community to fully comply with its international commitments and to respond to new international initiatives. The Communication will therefore recommend the adoption of the three attached draft decisions (i) on the release of the 2 nd instalment of \u20ac250million of the Water Facility, (ii) on the release of a further \u20ac18million for funding of the national indicative programme of Timor Leste as soon as it becomes full member of the ACP Group in 2005 and (iii) on the release of the \u20ac482million conditional balances, and of the two complementary draft decisions regarding the transfer of the released funds to the regional cooperation and integration instrument to allow for the intra-ACP funding of the 2 nd instalment of the Water Facility and the intra-ACP use of part of the \u20ac482 million conditional balances. 1. EDF F INANCIAL P ERFORMANCE The performance of the EDF in 2003 has been the best ever. The high level of the commitments can be partially explained by the fact that 2003 was the first year of the implementation of the 9th EDF. However, the level of disbursements was also significantly higher than it had ever been. This positive evolution in disbursements was not only due to non-recurrent \u201cone-shot\u201d operations, but was already noticed in previous years and is being confirmed by the provisional figures for 2004 (see Annex 1 for more details). These encouraging results are achieved despite the fact that, in a number of ACP countries, 1 ACP-EC Partnership Agreement, signed in Cotonou on 23 June 2000, Financial Protocol, Annex I, 7 and the EU Declaration on the Financial Protocol (Declaration XVIII) attached to the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement. The Internal Agreement (OJ L 317, 15.12.2000) specifies that this performance review shall be undertaken by the Council in 2004 on the basis of a proposal from the Commission. 2 Commission Staff Working Paper SEC(2005)242 makes a more qualitative assessment of these reforms, further illustrating the structural nature of the improved performance, both quantitatively as well as qualitatively.

This compares to an average gross commitment level of \u20ac3 656 million over the last two years (2003-04). 2. T HE 2004 M ID - TERM R EVIEW During 2004 mid-term reviews (MTRs) have been undertaken in all ACP countries for which a Country Strategy Paper (CSP), the basis of the EDF programming exercise, has been signed 3 . The Cotonou Agreement explicitly provides that these mid-term reviews may lead to a change of the strategy (change in the CSP focal sectors), and/or to a revision in the country allocation (upwards or downwards or between the programmable resources and the indicative resources for unforeseen needs). To decide on the possible adjustment of the country allocations, two main criteria, complemented by \u2018special considerations\u2019, were used: \u2022 Assessment of the country\u2019s financial performance in implementing Community aid; the indicators used were the average commitment, contracting and disbursement rates over previous years and the theoretical years required to absorb remaining balances; \u2022 Assessment of the country\u2019s performance in the focal sectors (and macroeconomic support where appropriate); 3 For nine countries the CSP had not been signed at the start of the exercise: C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Guinea, Haiti, Liberia, Somalia, Sudan, Togo and Zimbabwe. Five small Pacific countries were not reviewed because they became new parties to the Cotonou Agreement and only recently started to benefit from EDF funds: Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Niue and Palau.

        "EN 4 EN \u2022 Special considerations: assessment of country\u2019s progress in institutional reforms and poverty reduction as well as specific circumstances affecting the country\u2019s needs, vulnerability and performance since the start of the CSP programming process; these included post-conflict situations, factors related to the implementation capacity at the country level (e.g. the status of the devolution process, temporary staffing problems in the Delegation and/or NAO office), etc. The MTR exercise was conducted with a view to achieving global financial equilibrium 4 . The financial proposals which have been submitted to the EDF Committee in fall 2004 and on which final Commission Decisions are foreseen in December can be indicatively summarised as follows: \u2022 For 17 countries no change in envelopes is proposed. \u2022 For 13 countries a transfer between the envelope of programmable funds and the envelope for unforeseen needs) is proposed, leaving the amount of total resources unchanged; in most cases this has been a transfer from the underutilised envelope for unforeseen needs to the envelope for programmable funds which, consolidated, increase by \u20ac226million (of which 62% in favour of least developed countries. \u2022 For 17 countries, a net increase in allocations is proposed (in many instances, this includes a transfer between envelopes); the net increase amounts to \u20ac766million (a \u20ac989million increase in the envelopes for programmable funds, partly offset by a \u20ac223million decrease in the envelopes for unforeseen needs), of which 97% in favour of least developed countries. \u2022 For 15 countries, a net decrease in the total allocation is proposed (two of which involve a cut in the A envelope); the net decrease amounts to \u20ac432million (with a net increase of programmable funds of only \u20ac33million) of which 84% concerns least developed countries. Consolidated this means a net increase of 17.6% in programmable funds, or \u20ac1 248million, overwhelmingly (91%) going to least developed countries with a high absorption capacity and satisfactory economic and political performance. These transfers from overestimated, unused, allocations for unforeseen needs and from poorly performing countries will further sharpen the focus on poverty and increase the global absorption capacity of the 9th EDF, reinforcing the positive commitment and disbursement trend. 3. F ORECASTS 2004-2007 The most recent forecasts for commitments and payments under the EDF were prepared in parallel with the performance review and communicated to the Council in October 2004 5 . 4 Financial equilibrium is reached by taking into account adjustments made in the envelopes for those countries for which the amount of the 9 th EDF was not notified or notified late, i.e. the 242,6 M\u20ac resulting from Decision C(2003)2471 regarding Haiti, Liberia and Togo, plus a further net decrease of 96,8 M\u20ac approved by the EDF Committee in September 2004 for countries for which the CSP has not been signed yet. 5 COM (2004)763, 19.11.2004.

        "EN 5 EN They are based on the consolidation of the implementation pipeline of each national and regional indicative programme and intra-ACP intervention, carefully screened in September and October on the basis of the data produced by the Delegations\u2019 and Headquarters\u2019 services. In line with the forecasts adopted by the Council in November 2003, they confirm that the 9 th EDF, including the balances of all previous EDFs and the first instalment of \u20ac250million of the Water Facility, financed out of the conditional one billion, will be fully committed by the end of 2007, the period covered by the 9th EDF (for details, see table in Annex 2). The 2006 end-of-term review will allow correction of existing forecasts and a final reallocation of funds, further increasing the prospect that, by the end of 2007, all the remaining balances will be committed. The only option for the Community to respond to its international obligations towards the ACP and to some unmet obligations resulting directly from the Cotonou Agreement is therefore through the release of the balances of the conditional one billion. 4. P ROPOSALS FOR THE USE OF THE C ONDITIONAL B ALANCES Based on the conclusions of the Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the future development of the EU Water Facility and on a preliminary EDF performance review, the Council agreed on 22 March 2004 to consider earmarking an amount of \u20ac500million out of the conditional \u20ac1billion in support of an European water initiative for the ACP Countries 6 . The Council further agreed that half of this amount could be released immediately and that by March 2005 a decision would be taken on the mobilisation of a second instalment of \u20ac250million and on the use of the remaining \u20ac500million in the light of the outcome of the mid-term review of the country strategy papers conducted in 2004 and of a more detailed EDF performance review. The joint ACP-EC Council of Ministers, meeting in Gaborone on 06 May 2004, endorsed this approach 7 . The 2004 mid-term reviews led to a reallocation of resources between ACP countries based on performance, without requiring additional funding. The end-of-term review will focus even more on the absorption capacity of the beneficiary countries and no additional funding of national indicative programmes is expected to be required on top of the funds liberated from the envelopes for unforeseen needs or from programmable envelopes of poorly performing countries. Similarly, the Investment Facility is slightly behind schedule and will not require additional funding. It is therefore proposed that a higher-than-proportional share of the conditional balances be used to respond to some of the unmet international ACP-EC commitments. 4.1. Water Facility The implementation modalities of the Water Facility have been carefully prepared in close consultation with the member States. As a result, a financing proposal for \u20ac247 million was submitted to the EDF Committee and received a favourable opinion at its November 2004 meeting. A call for proposals has been launched under a suspensive clause after a very 6 Council Decision 2004/289, 22.03.2004. 7 Decision 1/2004 of the ACP-EC Council of Ministers of 6 May 2004 on the use of the reserve of the long-term development envelope as well as resources from the Investment Facility of the 9 th EDF for the establishment of an ACP-EU Water Facility.

        "EN 6 EN positive discussion at the EDF Committee meeting of October 8 . The interest gathered from all stakeholders in various international fora increases the likelihood of a very positive preliminary response to this call, which will be confirmed in early 2005 on receipt of the preliminary proposals. It is expected that fundable project proposals for an amount well exceeding the amount of the call will be submitted, entirely justifying the immediate release of the second instalment of the Water Facility. Such an early release would allow for an early launching, still in 2005, of the second call for proposals, building on the experience and the lessons learned from the first one. Two draft decisions for adoption by the Council are therefore attached, one proposing the release of a further \u20ac250million from the conditional 9th EDF resources, and another regarding the transfer of the released funds to the regional cooperation and integration instrument in order to allow the financing of the second instalment of the Water Facility from the intra-ACP envelope. 4.2. Residual conditional balances For the remaining \u20ac500 million of the conditional billion, the Commission made a very strict and prioritised selection of proposals on the basis of the obligations resulting from the Cotonou Agreement and of the ACP-EC commitments that have not yet been met internationally, taking into account the principles of urgency and poverty focus, concentration of aid and absorption capacity. A proposal by the ACP group for the creation of an ACP-EC Disaster Facility to assist ACP countries in disaster prevention/disaster preparedness and post- crisis management has not been included as the existing instruments already allow the Commission to address these issues. However, the ACP Secretariat and the Commission have undertaken steps to examine how to further enhance the existing response mechanisms and to examine any complementary measures to strengthen ACP-EC co-operation and intra-ACP solidarity in case of natural disasters. Obligations resulting from the Cotonou Agreement 1. CDE-CTA Under the 9th EDF, \u20ac90 million and \u20ac70 million have been reserved out of the envelope in support of long-term development for the financing of the budget of, respectively, the Centre for the Development of Enterprise (CDE) and of the Centre for the Development of Agriculture (CTA). These amounts were deemed to cover the budgetary needs of these two joint ACP-EC institutions for the five-year period of the first financial protocol (2000-2005). As the absorption capacity of both institutions is satisfactory and there were no balances from previous EDFs, both institutions will run out of funding by the end of 2005. Under the existing implementation modalities of the CDE and the CTA the annual budgetary needs are estimated at respectively \u20ac18 million and \u20ac14 million. It is therefore proposed to earmark \u20ac64 million out of the long term development envelope released from the remaining conditional resources to cover their functioning during 2006-2007, in compliance with Annexes I and III to the Cotonou Agreement. 8 \u20ac3 million have already been committed in the framework of the intra-ACP technical cooperation facility for information, communication and evaluation purposes. ",
        "EN 7 EN 2. Timor Leste In 2003, the joint ACP-EU Council approved the accession of Timor Leste to the Cotonou Agreement 9 . While the initial development needs of Timor Leste were taken care of under the EC budget, there is no provision for further funding beyond 2005, when Timor Leste is expected to ratify the Cotonou Agreement, as this would be incompatible with the existing ALA regulation, which does not allow ALA funding in favour of ACP Group member countries. Based on Articles 62(2) and 94(1) of the Cotonou Agreement, the Commission therefore proposed to top up the 9th EDF with \u20ac18 million, which corresponds to the pro rata amount which would have been earmarked for Timor Leste, if the normal aid allocation criteria for the 9th EDF had been applied. There was no unanimity among member States for this proposal and the Council \u201cexpressed willingness to consider positively the use of the \u2018Conditional Billion\u2019\u201d to meet the needs of Timor Leste, considering, on the basis of the elements referred to above, that at present there are no unearmarked funds available under the 9th EDF 10 . It is therefore proposed to earmark \u20ac18million out of the long term development envelope released from the conditional balances to cover the national indicative programme of Timor Leste during the period 2006-07. International commitments 1. Energy Facility At present, over 80% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa have limited access to modern forms of energy. The social and economic development of poor communities is limited or even deadlocked by the present unsustainable use of wood and other form of biomass for energy purposes. Recognising the importance of improving energy access for the poor, the EU launched the EU Energy Initiative for poverty eradication and sustainable development (EUEI) at the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in Johannesburg in 2002. The objective of the EUEI is to contribute to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) through the provision of adequate, sustainable, environmentally-sound energy services to the poor. In this connection, the Commission has recently adopted a proposal to set up a \u20ac250 million Energy Facility in the ACP region 11 . The modalities for the establishment of this Energy Facility will follow the model of the Water Facility and it will also be prepared with the active involvement of member States and other stakeholders. In its conclusions, the Communication to the Council and to the European Parliament suggests that this new initiative be funded from the remaining balances of the conditional billion. Considering the high expectations generated by the launch of the EU Energy Initiative, the crucial contribution of energy to the achievement of the MDGs, and the critical importance for the poor of access to cost-effective and environmentally sound energy services, it is therefore suggested to finance the proposed ACP/EU Energy Facility with an indicative 9 Decision 1/2003 of the joint ACP-EU Council of Ministers of 16 May 2003. 10 Council document 13890/04 of 04 November 2004 on the Outcome of Proceedings of the ACP Working Party of 26 October 2004. 11 COM(2004)711 of 28 October 2004 on the future development of the EU Energy Initiative and the modalities for the establishment of an Energy Facility for ACP countries. ",
        "EN 8 EN amount of up to \u20ac250million from the conditional balances and to transfer the totality of this amount to the intra-ACP envelope for this purpose. 2. Commodity risk management Further to the recent dramatic falls in the price of internationally traded agricultural commodities and the dependence of a very large number of poor people on the competitive production of those commodities for employment and income, the international community has called for special attention to be paid to this problem, including in the context of the multilateral trade negotiations and of the negotiation of economic partnership agreements between the EU and the ACP regions. In response to this challenge, the Council adopted in April 2004 an EU Action Plan prepared by the Commission, which includes a proposal to facilitate producer access to commodity risk insurance and trade finance 12 . The purpose of the present initiative is to complement the World Bank technical assistance and the foreseen Commission capacity building programme in this area 13 with an international financing facility to support ACP countries accessing market-based instruments for commodity risk management through the temporary co-financing of their premiums. This will contribute to reduced vulnerability of the ACP beneficiary countries to commodity shocks (price fluctuations as well as natural disasters) and to a development of commodity risk instruments for further uptake. A joint EU-ACP Committee on agricultural commodities will oversee the design and the implementation modalities of the programme. It is proposed to earmark an indicative amount of up to \u20ac25million from the remaining balance of the conditional billion to contribute to the international commodity risk management financing facility as explicitly provided for in Article 68.5 of the Cotonou Agreement, and to transfer the amount to the intra-ACP envelope for this purpose. 3. Sanitary and phyto-sanitary measures At the EU level, a new regulation on \u201cOfficial Feed & Food Controls\u201d will enter into force in January 2006 14 . This new regulation will require third countries to provide detailed information about the general structure and management of their feed and food sanitary and phyto-sanitary control systems and to provide sufficient guarantees that products destined for the EU market meet EU safety standards. To maintain their access to the EU markets and cope with these new regulations, the ACP countries will have to make significant investments. Article 12 of the Cotonou Agreement on the coherence of Community policies provides that, in such cases and at the request of the ACP, consultations should be held so that account may be taken of their concerns about the impact of these measures.A preliminary impact study of the new regulation, conducted under the supervision of an inter-service group on SPS-related issues for developing countries, concluded that the ACP may need up to \u20ac300 million to help them strengthen their basic capacity to match the new EU requirements. With the support of 12 COM(2004)89 of 12 February 2004 on Agricultural Commodity Chains, Dependence and Poverty \u2013 a proposal for an EU Action Plan.

",
        "EN 9 EN the Secretary General of the ACP, a more detailed impact study has been launched, but an initial envelope of \u20ac30 to 40 million would make it possible to tackle the most burning issues, pending the next programming exercise. It is therefore proposed to put aside an indicative amount of \u20ac30 million from the remaining balance of the conditional billion to contribute to the initial phase of a capacity-building programme to help the ACP adapt to the new EU SPS rules and to transfer the entire amount to the intra-ACP envelope for this purpose. 4. African Union Considering the increasing importance of the African Union (AU), in peace-keeping and conflict prevention, as well as in promoting regional integration and good governance, and the positive reception by the Council of the Communication on an enhanced EU-Africa dialogue 15 , it seems appropriate to move towards a more strategic support to the AU institutions and to reserve an additional amount for a pan-African support programme within the framework of the \u201cVision and Mission of the African Union and Strategic Plan for 2004- 2007\u201d adopted by the summit of the African Heads of State and Government in Addis Ababa in July 2004. This programme will, among others, aim at increasing the effectiveness and operational capacity of the AU institutions, at enhancing civil society participation in these institutions and at strengthening their involvement in pan-African problems. To contribute to a pan-African support programme, it is proposed to earmark an indicative amount of up to \u20ac50 million from the remaining balance of the conditional billion, and to transfer the amount to the intra-ACP envelope for this purpose. 5. The Education for All Fast-Track Initiative (FTI) The Education for All Fast-Track Initiative (FTI) is a global partnership, launched in mid- 2002 to help low-income countries reach the education Millennium Development Goal of giving all children a complete primary education by 2015. It is one of the first instruments that makes operational the Monterrey consensus on effective partnerships between donors and developing countries to make official development assistance more effective. The FTI primarily relies on existing funding mechanisms in partner countries. However, the FTI Partnership also created two new facilities: an FTI Catalytic Fund which helps, on a temporary basis, countries that cannot mobilise enough domestic resources to establish a track record, so as to help them leverage additional long-term support, and a facility for FTI programme preparation to help countries with insufficient internal capacity prepare an education sector plan. As it proved impossible to provide support to the FTI in a systematic way via the 2004 national mid-term review exercise, it is proposed to contribute an indicative amount of \u20ac63million to the Fast-Track Initiative from the remaining balances of the conditional billion, and to transfer the amount to the intra-ACP envelope for this purpose. 15 COM(2003)316 of 23 June 2003 on the EU-Africa Dialogue and the GAERC Conclusions of 21 July 2003.

One decision proposes the release of \u20ac18million to be allocated to the financial envelope for long-term development, in order to meet the obligations resulting from the Cotonou Agreement for Timor Leste. The two remaining decisions propose on the one hand the release of the balance of \u20ac482million for complementary support to the CDE and the CTA until the end of 2007, for the launch of the new EU Energy Facility, to contribute to the Commodity Risk Management Fund, to set up the first phase of a comprehensive sanitary and phyto-sanitary capacity-building support programme in the ACP in order to respond to the EU new feed and food regulations, and to assist the African Union in setting up a pan-African support programme to the African Union and the Education for All Fast Track Initiative and on the other hand to transfer the released funds up to an amount of \u20ac416 million to the regional cooperation and integration instrument in order to allow the financing of those activities from the intra-ACP envelope except the support to the CDE and the CTA which is funded out of the long term development envelope.

        "EN 11 EN ANNEX 1 EDF financial performance The performance of the EDF in 2003 has been the best ever. The high level of the commitments (\u20ac4 127 million) can be partially explained by the fact that 2003 was the first year of the implementation of the 9th EDF. However, it is important to note that the level of disbursements was also much higher than ever before. This positive evolution was not only due to non-recurrent, one-shot operations, but was already noticed in previous years and is being confirmed by the provisional figures for 2004.

In addition, the EIB, which manages in an entirely autonomous way the funds of the 9th EDF for the new Investment Facility, committed \u20ac366 million. This brings total commitments in 2003 to \u20ac4 127 million. In the past, only one year recorded a figure of the same order of magnitude, namely 2000 with total commitments of \u20ac4 007 million (of which roughly \u20ac 1 000 million for debt reduction). The level of the EDF commitments has traditionally shown a cyclical pattern, with high levels of commitments in the first years, followed by a levelling off. The historic level of commitments in 2003, even after deduction of the special contributions to the HIPC debt reduction initiative and the Global Health Fund for the fight against AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, could therefore partially be explained by the fact that it was the beginning of a new commitment cycle, following the entry into force of the Cotonou agreement.

        "EN 12 EN This dip in the 2004 figure may be explained to a certain extent as a repercussion of the huge effort made in 2003, shifting attention from programming to implementation issues, but it may also be a reflection of the major staff redeployment resulting from the final stage of the devolution exercise 17 . The programming pipeline, assessed in a series of regional seminars in early 2004, re- examined during the mid-term review process and permanently updated until the end of October 2004 by EuropeAid, in consultation with the Delegations, confirms that the level of commitments will pick up again sharply in 2005. Based on the most recent figures, the EIB had also to review downwards its 2004 forecasts for the implementation of the Investment Facility (down to \u20ac335million from an initial estimate of \u20ac500million), but maintains its initial forecasts for 2005, based on the existing portfolio of contacts.

Total commitments in 2004 may therefore be overestimated by up to \u20ac250 million. This uncertainty can be explained by the seasonal factor which still survives in a lesser form despite the various reforms initiated in recent years, whereby a large stock of commitments are being prepared in the first half of the year, \u201cwaiting\u201d for decision after summer break, with a high volume of commitment decisions taken in the last quarter of the year (the commitment rate at the end of August 2004 was over 45% of the year objective, against on average of less than 25% in the previous years). Small delays in the decision making process may then result in a commitment being carried over to the next year. 17 ACP related implementation support staff in EuropeAid decreased with one third in 2004; this was more than compensated by a reinforcement of the Delegations in the context of devolution but the exceptionally high staff turnover rate during this transitional period affected the normal implementation of the project cycle.

As can be seen from the table on the financial situation under point 1.4, the Intra-ACP reserves have seen the highest increase relative to the initial allocation, due to pressing international commitments and the rapid disbursement mechanisms often attached to these initiatives. The table below shows that the high commitment level of intra-ACP funds can be partially explained by their use for the funding of special initiatives in 2003 and 2004 (HIPC debt reduction, Peace Facility, Global Health Fund), but the present pipeline of programmes under instruction confirms that most of the balances will be committed by the end of 2005. By the end of 2005, the first instalment of the Water initiative, decided by the Council in April 2004, is also expected to be fully committed.

This is due to the very high level of commitments in 2003 following the entry into force of the Cotonou Agreement and the beginning of the new commitment cycle (9 th EDF). However, thanks to the high level of disbursements, the coefficient that expresses the number of years necessary to absorb the RAL was reduced from 4.41 (end 2002) to 3.88 (end 2003). This positive trend started in 2000 when, at its worst, the period needed to absorb the RAL was over five years. The lower gross commitment rate in 2004, combined with a normal level of decommitments on older programmes and a further increase in disbursements, will lead to a stabilization or even a slight decrease of the RAL in absolute terms by the end of 2004, and a further decrease in the number of years required to absorb it.

In the light of the outcome of the mid-term reviews of the country strategies and of the Council\u2019s performance review of the EDF, the Council has to decide by March 2005 on the mobilisation of a second instalment of EUR 250 million for the Water Facility and on the use of the remaining EUR 500 million of the conditional EUR 1 billion referred to in Article 2(2) of the Internal Agreement for purposes to be agreed. In 2003 the joint ACP-EU Council approved the accession of Timor Leste to the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement. While the initial development needs of Timor Leste were covered under the EC budget, further funding beyond 2005 when Timor Leste is expected to ratify the Cotonou Agreement is not foreseen, as this would be incompatible with the existing ALA Regulation which does not allow ALA funding in favour of ACP Group member countries. Based on Articles 62(2) and 94(1) of the Cotonou Agreement, the Commission therefore proposed to top up the 9th EDF by an amount of EUR 18 million, which corresponds to the pro rata amount which would have been earmarked for Timor Leste had the normal aid allocation criteria for the 9th EDF been applied. In discussion in the ACP Group in the Council of Ministers, there was no unanimity among Member States for this proposal and the Council \u201cexpressed willingness to consider positively the use of the conditional billion to meet the needs of Timor Leste, considering that at present there are no unearmarked funds available under the 9th EDF\u201d 28 . 28 Council Document 13890/04 of 4 November 2004 on the Outcome of Proceedings of the ACP Working Party of 26 October 2004.

        "EN 40 EN EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM The Financial Protocol attached as Annex 1 to the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement, signed in Cotonou on 23 June 2000, establishes in its paragraph 2 a ninth EDF for African, Caribbean and Pacific countries of a total amount of up to \u20ac 13.5 billion. As specified in the EU Declaration on the Financial Protocol - Declaration XVIII under the Final Act of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement \u2013 within the overall amount of \u20ac 13.5 billion, only \u20ac 12.5 billion were made available upon the entry into force of the Financial Protocol (April 1 st 2003). According to the Internal Agreement, the remaining \u20ac 1 billion is to be released and distributed to the envelopes for long term development, regional cooperation and integration and for the Investment Facility on the basis of a performance review of the EDF by assessing the degree of realisation of commitments and disbursements. This performance review is to be undertaken in 2004, on the basis of a proposal from the Commission, in accordance with Declaration XVIII attached to the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement as well as Article 2(2) of the Internal Agreement between Representatives of the Governments of the Member States on the Financing and Administration of Community Aid under the Financial Protocol to the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement. On 22 March 2004 the Council agreed on the establishment of an \u2018EU Water Facility for ACP countries, to consider an amount of EUR 500 million out of the conditional EUR 1 billion referred to in Article 2(2) of the Internal Agreement for this Water Facility and to release a first allocation of EUR 250 million. This decision was taken on the basis that the level of commitments and disbursements at the end of the year 2003 in conjunction with forecasts for the period 2004 to 2007 presented by the Commission indicated that ninth EDF resources for ACP countries could be fully committed, and a first tranche of the conditional billion be released on the basis of the performance to date. In the light of the outcome of the mid-term reviews of the country strategies and of the Council\u2019s performance review of the EDF, the Council has to decide by March 2005 on the mobilisation of a second instalment of EUR 250 million for the Water Facility and on the use of the remaining EUR 500 million of the conditional EUR 1 billion referred to in Article 2(2) on the Internal Agreement for purposes to be agreed. Against this background, the Commission proposes that the Council adopt the enclosed decision on the position to be adopted by the Community within the ACP-EC Council of Ministers regarding the transfer of \u20ac185 million from the reserve (unallocated resources) of the 9 th EDF long-term development envelope as well as \u20ac41 million from the 9 th EDF Investment Facility, to the allocation for intra-ACP co-operation, to be used for the second allocation of the ACP-EU Water Facility. Together with the above-mentioned increase of \u20ac24 million of the intra ACP allocation, this will lead to a total amount of \u20ac250 million for the second allocation to the Water Facility. ",
