        "K. whereas, in spite of the fact that, pursuant to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, each child shall be registered immediately after birth, according to Unicef ( 1 ) over half of all births in the develop- ing world \u2014 excluding China \u2014 are unregistered (more than 50 million children); whereas these invisible children, together with millions of orphans and street children are the most vulnerable to trafficking, becoming easy prey for illegal adoption or for use in the trade of human organs; whereas conflicts, disasters and post-conflict and post-disaster situations likewise expose children to greater risks of exploitation in trafficking in human beings, L. whereas the causes of illegal immigration are different from those of trafficking in human beings, and therefore these issues should be treated separately, M. whereas the US Department of State \u2018 Trafficking in Persons Report 2005 \u2019 showed that of the estimated 600 000 to 800 000 people trafficked each year, approximately 80 % are women and girls, N. whereas most women and girls who are trafficked are subjected to different kinds of exploitation, in particular sexual exploitation, which is the primary purpose for trafficking, forced labour and organ trafficking, O. whereas the 2005 ILO ( 2 ) report estimates that 80 % of victims of trafficking are women and girls; whereas the report also estimates that between 40 to 50 % of all victims are children; whereas, accord- ing to the report, 56 % of victims specifically in forced labour are women and girls; whereas 98 % of those trafficked into sexual exploitation are women and girls, P. whereas the sex industry is based on the principle of supply and demand; whereas the 2003 report of the International Organisation for Migration recognizes that \u2018 growing consumer demand is undoubtedly one of the factors contributing to the phenomenon of forced labour in the sex industry \u2019 , Q. whereas the UN Report of the Special Rapporteur on the human rights aspects of the victims of trafficking in persons, especially women and children, entitled, \u2018 Integration of the human rights of women and a gender perspective \u2019 states that \u2018 while the human rights of women and children are violated in many forms of trafficking, sex trafficking is a particular form of trafficking in which the human rights of women and children are violated as women and children \u2019 , R. whereas access to the labour market of the EU is complicated or even restricted and overregulated, while at the same time there is a clear demand for labour, which factors result in illegal migration, smuggling and trafficking, S. whereas handling the issue of supply of services is a high political priority; whereas the existence of labour exploitation is often widely tolerated by public opinion, T. whereas the demand for low-cost, undocumented and docile workers in the EU contributes to the illegal trade of trafficking in human beings; whereas the existence of such a workforce may drive down costs but does so at the expense of human dignity and whereas it undermines labour standards, health and safety measures, fair pay and local and/or state income through a failure to pay taxes and social contributions, U. whereas the high profits from human trafficking are often laundered, enabling other organised criminal activities, including bribery and fraud and allowing perpetrators to gain illegitimate economic, social or even political power, ( 1 ) \u2018 The State of the World's Children 2006: Excluded and invisible \u2019 , Unicef 2005.

        "V. whereas demand for services provided by trafficked people, for example, the demand from men who wish to purchase or who purchase women and children for sexual purposes, in combination with poverty, social exclusion and lack of viable alternatives for decent work, is the main driving force behind trafficking in human beings, and without strengthening the political will and making a joint effort in order to reduce such demand, it will be almost impossible to stop or even substantially reduce trafficking ( 1 ), W. whereas the lack of sustainable economic and social prospects, high levels of unemployment and the spectre of constantly growing poverty in certain countries of origin, together with the level of eco- nomic and social development existing in Europe, contribute to a climate which makes it easy for criminal organisations to profit from trafficking, X. whereas strengthening law enforcement by criminalising traffickers and middlemen is a crucial aspect of the fight against trafficking; whereas law enforcement should also include the possibility of confiscating the proceeds of crime; whereas it is necessary to strengthen labour inspections, including punishment of labour exploitation and illegal work; whereas the creation of a network of national labour inspec- tions, harmonising the penalisation of labour exploitation could lead to a reduction in these offences; whereas, to ensure the effective investigation and prosecution of cases of trafficking it would be useful to set up specially equipped and trained units within national police forces and prosecutors' offices, Y. whereas the prompt identification of victims is crucial in the fight against trafficking, 1. Addresses the following recommendations to the Council: Legal framework and law enforcement (a) trafficking in human beings must be tackled by means of a coherent policy approach (migration, gender, employment, social, development, external, neighbourhood and visa policy) and consequent criminalisation, at least reaching the standards of EU legislation in accordance with Framework Deci- sion 2002/629/JHA; (b) calls upon the European Community to sign and ratify the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings as soon as possible; urges the Commission to initiate without further delay the internal procedure making it possible for the European Community to sign and ratify this Convention; likewise asks the Council to take the decision to sign and ratify the Conven- tion, (c) the Commission and Member States should adopt a strategy for implementing the Action Plan, (d) the Council and Member States should strengthen the human rights-based, gender-equality and vic- tim-centred approach in implementing the Action Plan, (e) considers that an anti-discrimination approach to trafficking is required in addition to a human rights approach and that, therefore, references to equality and non-discrimination are critical, (f) Member States should, if they have not already done so, ratify and implement all relevant interna- tional Conventions, including the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, its supple- mentary Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children and the Protocol Against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, the UN Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, the UN Convention on the Protection of the Rights of all Migrant Workers and their Families, the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings, International Labour Organisation Conventions and core labour standards, in particular No 29 con- cerning forced labour, No 182 concerning the prohibition and immediate action for the elimination of the worst forms of child labour, and those relating to freedom of association, labour inspection and employment agencies, ( 1 ) Gabal, I.

        "(g) Member States should implement as soon as possible Framework Decision 2002/629/JHA and Direc- tive 2004/81/EC and, at a minimum, ensure that victims of trafficking, whether or not they coop- erate with the competent authorities during investigations and as witnesses in criminal procedures, are granted short-term residence status, including a reflection/recovery period for victims lasting no less than 30 days, and access to information on the legal and administrative procedures in a language that the victims understand, together with free legal assistance, (h) Member States should make full use of Council Framework Decision 2005/212/JHA of 24 February 2005 on Confiscation of Crime-related Proceeds, Instrumentalities and Property ( 1 ), in particular Arti- cle 3 thereof, as a part of fight against trafficking in human beings, (i) Member States should shoulder their responsibility for victims of trafficking in human beings, by giving them the opportunity to receive assistance, either in returning to their home country if they so desire or in remaining in the Union ( 2 ); they should also receive assistance and encouragement to cooperate with the competent authorities during investigations and as witnesses in criminal proceed- ings, (j) Member States should consider the introduction of mechanisms to encourage, support and protect informants who may face reprisals, (k) Member States should adopt measures to ensure that the identification of victims of trafficking, especially children, is carried out by trained law enforcement agency staff qualified in the prevention of trafficking, by making a more consistent distinction between smuggling and trafficking in human beings; government agencies should develop guidelines to ensure that, when undocumented migrants are interviewed, the appropriate questions are asked so as to ensure that victims of trafficking can be identified as such, (l) Member States should minimise the risk of organ trafficking in Europe including by reducing demand, promoting organ donation more effectively, maintaining strict legislation as regards living unrelated donors, guaranteeing the transparency of national registers and waiting lists and establish- ing legal responsibility for irregularities, (m) Member States should improve the analysis of the current situation by implementing uniform meth- ods to collect comparable data relating particularly to the routes of trafficking and victims' profiles in accordance with existing protocols and Community legislation on data protection, (n) Member States should implement consistently Article 4 of Framework Decision 2002/629/JHAto ensure that legal persons can be held liable for offences committed for their benefit by any person, acting either individually or as part of an organ of the legal person, who has a leading position within the legal person, connected with trafficking in human beings or using the services of victims of trafficking, (o) Member States should adopt measures to ensure that the kidnapping and transport of persons, including housing and keeping them and the transfer of control over them, is defined in law as a crime and considered an imprisonable offence, (p) considers that good company practice, which includes requiring sub-contractors to fulfil their con- tractual and legal obligations (supply-chain compliance), has an important role in reducing demand, and the role of companies, as well as other social agents, is vital in ensuring the application of all existing labour and social laws and in particular making sure that workers receive the benefits to which they are legally entitled; welcomes the Athens Declaration, which seeks to ensure that compa- nies do not tolerate forced labour, (q) takes the view that extremely severe penalties must be imposed on companies found to have been employing cheap labour supplied through human trafficking, particularly where the companies con- cerned have been acting fraudulently, (r) Member States should adopt the necessary measures to ensure that the financial penalties imposed under criminal law or of an administrative nature on legal persons found guilty of trafficking shall include the confiscation or seizure of the proceeds of trafficking, with a view, as a matter of priority, to ensuring compensation and reparation for the victims for the financial, physical and psychological damage suffered, ( 1 ) OJ L 68, 15.3.2005, p. 49.
