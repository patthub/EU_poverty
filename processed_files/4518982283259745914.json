        "\u25bc B COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 980/2005 of 27 June 2005 applying a scheme of generalised tariff preferences THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 133 thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament ( 1 ), Having regard to the Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee ( 2 ), Whereas: (1) Since 1971, the Community has granted trade preferences to developing countries, in the framework of its scheme of gener- alised tariff preferences. (2) The Community's common commercial policy is to be consistent with and consolidate the objectives of development policy, in particular the eradication of poverty and the promotion of sustainable development and good governance in the developing countries. It is to comply with the WTO requirements, and in particular with the GATT Enabling clause of 1979 ( 3 ). (3) A communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament and the European Economic and Social Committee of 7 July 2004 entitled \u2018 Developing countries, inter- national trade and sustainable development: the function of the Community's generalised system of preferences (GSP) for the ten-year period from 2006 to 2015 \u2019 sets out the guidelines for the application of the scheme of generalised tariff preferences for the period 2006 to 2015. (4) This Regulation is the first Regulation implementing those guidelines. It should apply until 31 December 2008. (5) The scheme of generalised tariff preferences (hereinafter referred to as \u2018 the scheme \u2019 ) should consist of a general arrangement granted to all the beneficiary countries and territories and two special arrangements taking into account the various development needs of similar-situated developing countries. (6) The general arrangement should be granted to all beneficiary countries unless they are classified by the World Bank as a high-income country and where they are not sufficiently diver- sified in their exports. (7) The special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance is based on an integral concept of sustainable development as recognized by international conventions and instruments such as the UN Declaration on the Right to Development of 1986, the Rio Declaration on Envir- onment and Development of 1992, the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work of 1998, the UN Millennium Declaration of 2000 and the Johannesburg Declaration on Sustainable Development of 2002. Consequently, developing countries which due to a lack of diversification and 2005R0980 \u2014 EN \u2014 05.06.2007 \u2014 001.001 \u2014 2 ( 1 ) Opinion delivered on 9 March 2005 (not yet published in the Official Journal).

        "\u25bc B insufficient integration into the international trading system are vulnerable while assuming special burdens and responsibilities due to the ratification and effective implementation of core inter- national conventions on human and labour rights, environmental protection and good governance should benefit from additional tariff preferences. These preferences are designed to promote further economic growth and thereby to respond positively to the need for sustainable development. Under this arrangement ad valorem tariffs are therefore suspended for the beneficiary countries, as well as specific duties (unless combined with an ad valorem duty). The special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance should excep- tionally apply before the entry into force of the whole Regulation to conform with the WTO ruling on the special arrangements to combat drug production and trafficking. (8) Developing countries which already fulfil the criteria under the special arrangement for sustainable development and good governance at the time of entry into force of this Regulation should benefit from this arrangement as quickly as possible. They should therefore be provisionally listed as beneficiary countries. They should continue to benefit from the preferences if upon their application the Commission confirms their qualifi- cation by 15 December 2005. (9) The Commission should monitor the effective implementation of the international conventions in accordance with the respective mechanisms thereunder and should assess the relationship between additional tariff preferences and the promotion of sustainable development. (10) The special arrangement for the least developed countries should continue to grant duty-free access to products originating in the least developed countries, as recognised and classified by the United Nations. For a country no longer classified by the United Nations as a least developed country a transitional period should be established to alleviate any adverse effects caused by removal of the tariff preferences granted under this arrangement. (11) Preferences should continue to be differentiated according to the sensitivity of products, differentiating between non-sensitive and sensitive products, to take into account the situation of the sectors manufacturing the same products in the Community. (12) Tariff duties on non-sensitive products should continue to be suspended, while duties on sensitive products should enjoy a tariff reduction to ensure a satisfactory utilisation rate while at the same time taking into account the situation of the respective Community industries. (13) Such reduction should be sufficiently attractive in order to motivate traders to use the opportunities offered by the scheme. As far as ad valorem duties are concerned, the reduction should therefore be a flat rate of 3,5 percentage points of the most favoured nation (MFN) duty rate. Specific duties should be reduced by 30 %. Where duties specify a minimum duty, that minimum duty should not apply. (14) Duties should be totally suspended where preferential treatment for an individual import declaration results in ad valorem duties of 1 % or less or in specific duties of EUR 2 or less as the cost of collecting such duties might be higher than the revenue gained. (15) For the sake of coherence of the Community commercial policy, a beneficiary country should not benefit from both the Community's scheme and a free trade agreement, if that agreement covers at least all the preferences provided by the present scheme for that country. 2005R0980 \u2014 EN \u2014 05.06.2007 \u2014 001.001 \u2014 3 ",
        "\u25bc B (16) Graduation should be based on criteria related to sections of the Common Customs Tariff. The graduation of a section for a bene- ficiary country should be applied when the section meets the criteria for graduation during three consecutive years, to increase predictability and fairness of graduation by eliminating the effect of large and exceptional variations in the import statistics. (17) The rules of origin, concerning the definition of the concept of originating products, the procedures and the methods of admin- istrative cooperation related thereto, laid down in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code ( 1 ), apply to tariff preferences provided for by this Regulation to ensure that the benefit of this scheme goes only to those whom the scheme is intended to benefit. (18) The reasons for temporary withdrawal should include serious and systematic violations of the principles laid down in the conventions listed in Annex III so as to promote the objectives of those conventions and to ensure that no beneficiary receives unfair advantage through continuous violation of those conventions. (19) Due to the political situation in Myanmar, temporary withdrawal of all tariff preferences in respect of imports of products origi- nating in Myanmar should remain in force. (20) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission ( 2 ), HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: CHAPTER I GENERAL PROVISIONS Article 1 1.

The preferential arrangements provided for in this Regulation may be temporarily withdrawn, in respect of all or of certain products, origi- nating in a beneficiary country, for any of the following reasons: (a) serious and systematic violations of principles laid down in the conventions listed in Part A of Annex III, on the basis of the conclusion of the relevant monitoring bodies; (b) export of goods made by prison labour; (c) serious shortcomings in customs controls on export or transit of drugs (illicit substancesor precursors), or failure to comply with international conventions on money-laundering; (d) serious and systematic unfair trading practices which have an adverse effect on the Community industry and have not been addressed by the beneficiary country. For those unfair trading practices which are prohibited or actionable under the WTO Agreements, the application of this Article shall be based on a previous determination to that effect by the competent WTO body; (e) serious and systematic infringements of the objectives of regional fishery organizations or arrangements to which the Community is a member concerning the conservation and management of fishery resources. 2. Without prejudice to paragraph 1, the special incentive arrangement referred to in Section 2 of Chapter II may be temporarily withdrawn, in respect of all or certain products included in this arrangement, originating in a beneficiary country, in particular if the national legislation no longer incorporates those conventions referred to in Annex III which have been ratified in fulfilment of the 2005R0980 \u2014 EN \u2014 05.06.2007 \u2014 001.001 \u2014 10 ",

Article 17 1. The preferential arrangements provided for in this Regulation may be temporarily withdrawn, in respect of all or of certain products, origi- nating in a beneficiary country, in cases of fraud, irregularities or systematic failure to comply or to ensure compliance with the rules of origin of products and the procedures related thereto, and to provide the administrative cooperation as required for the implementation and the control of the respect of the arrangements referred to in Article 1(2). 2. The administrative cooperation referred to in paragraph 1 requires, inter alia , that a beneficiary country: (a) communicate to the Commission and update the information necessary for the implementation of the rules of origin and the control of respect thereof; (b) assist the Community by carrying out, on request of the customs authorities of Member States, subsequent verification of origin and communicate its results in time; (c) assist the Community by allowing the Commission, in coordination and close cooperation with the competent authorities of the Member States, to conduct Community administrative and investigative cooperation missions in that country, in order to verify the authen- ticity of documents or the accuracy of information relevant for granting the benefit of the arrangements referred to in Article 1(2); (d) carry out or arrange for appropriate inquiries to identify and prevent contravention of the rules of origin; (e) comply or ensure compliance with the rules of origin in respect of regional cumulation, within the meaning of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93, if the country benefits therefrom; (f) assist the Community in the verification of conduct where there is a presumption of origin-related fraud. The existence of fraud may be presumed where imports of products under the preferential regimes granted under this Regulation massively exceed the usual levels of exports of the beneficiary country. 3. The Commission may suspend the preferential arrangements provided for in this Regulation in respect of all or of certain products, originating in a beneficiary country, where it considers that there is sufficient evidence that temporary withdrawal would be justified for the reasons referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, provided that it has first: \u2014 informed the Committee; \u2014 called on the Member States to take such precautionary measures as are necessary in order to safeguard the Community's financial 2005R0980 \u2014 EN \u2014 05.06.2007 \u2014 001.001 \u2014 11 ( 1 ) Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against imports from countries not members of the European Community (OJ L 56, 6.3.1996, p. 1).

Following the consultations, the Commission may decide, within 1 month and in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 28(5), to initiate an investigation. Article 19 1. Where the Commission decides to initiate an investigation, it shall publish a notice in the Official Journal of the European Union announcing the investigation, and notify the beneficiary country concerned thereof.
