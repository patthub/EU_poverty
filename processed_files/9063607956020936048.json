        "WOMEN OF EUROPE N' 58 \u00ad Jan./Feb./March 1989 p. 3 8 MARCH: INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY Since the UN General Assembly's 1977 proposal to adopt an International Women's Day, many countries in Europe and the rest of the world have chosen 8 March as the day to honour women. As the festivities have grown from year to year, women have a chance to take stock of the progress that has been made, especially in the area of equal rights. Numerous demonstrations, cultural events, exhibitions, and seminars are held to mark the date across the world. Women of Europe starts off this issue by informing its readers of some of this year's more original Women's Day initiatives. INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS European Commission. The European Commission's \"Positive Action Programme\" has been operating for a year. Its goal is to achieve equal presence, opportunity, treatment and chances for advancement within the Commission. In a joint message, Jacques Delors, Commission President, and Cardoso e Cunha, the Commissioner responsible for Personnel and Administration, expressed the hope that the efforts to achieve equality within the Commis\u00ad sion would continue. The European Communities Women's Solidarity Network celebrated International Women's Day by holding a round table on affirmative action and equal opportunity that was chaired by Raymonde Dury (MEP). To mark the first anniversary of the Positive Action Plan, Mr De Torres, Deputy Director\u00adGeneral of DG IX, reviewed the progress made within the Commission, while Marie\u00adClaude Vayssade, MEP, painted a picture of \"equal opportunity at the dawn of 1992\". Christiane Scrivener, the Commissioner responsible for Indirect Taxation and the Customs Union, and Ms Lalis, standing in for Vasso Papandreou, Social Affairs Commissioner, sketched the role of a \"target\" woman and her responsibility in the march towards equal opportunity. UN: Xavier Perez de Cuellar, Secretary\u00adGeneral of the United Nations Organisation, recommended redoubling efforts to promote sexual equality, including those made within the context of development\u00adrelated problems, where women play a crucial role. BELGIUM The Comit\u00e9 de Liaison des Femmes (Women's Liaison Committee) and Universit\u00e9 des Femmes (Women's University) (la, Place Quetelet, 1030 Brussels) held a day of \"celebration and reflection\" on the theme \"Humour and Media\". Debates about radio, television, and immigrants were interwoven with short plays, shows, and a crafts exhibition. Eight short films by Belgian film\u00ad makers and the full\u00adlength \"7 pieces, cuisine, salle de bain... \u03b1 saisir\" (Seven rooms, kitchen and bath...a steal) were shown to illustrate the section on humour and the cinema. The organisers used humour as a weapon to denounce the under\u00adrepresentation of women in the media. ",
        "p. 4 Women of Europe N' 58 - Jan./Feb./March 1988 The February issue of the magazine Vie feminine came with two cards to be sent by readers to \"weave a network of solidarity\". One was to be sent to a friend, the other to a women's movement with which the magazine is in contact, whether in Poland, Zaire, or elsewhere, to celebrate 8 March ( Vie feminine, Service Courrier, 111 rue de la Poste, 1210 Brussels). Wishing to unite International Women's Day and the opening of the campaign for the European elections in one and the same symbol, the women members of the Flemish-speaking Christian Socialist Party convened the press for the unveiling of a statue by May Claerhout depicting women in the building of Europe. The statue was unveiled on Het Klein Strand, a beach at Ostend. FRANCE The women of Amiens are regrouping. Since the 1983 creation of the Commission Extra-municipale des Droits des Femmes (Extra-municipal Women's Rights Committee), they regularly build their International Women's Day celebration around themes such as \"Jobs Have No Gender\" or \"Amiens Women from Here and There\" that highlight the obstacles to achieving true equal opportunity (C.E.D.F., H\u00f4tel de Ville, F-80027 Amiens Cedex). IRELAND Message: The Council for the Status of Women insisted in its 8 March address on the importance of changing attitudes towards women so that laws on equality will be respected de facto and not just de jure. It also called on all European governments to take urgent measures to combat poverty and inequality (C.S.W., 64 Lower Mount Street, Dublin 2). Rape: Ireland's feminist organisations chose 8 March to demonstrate in Dublin against the failure to redefine rape in the Government's new bill. The Council for the Status of Women applauds, among other aspects, the recognition of certain types of rape (within the marriage, by adolescent attackers, etc.) but deplores a number of oversights in this new bill and has suggested some amendments that it feels are imperative (C.S.W., 64 Lower Mount Street, Dublin 2). ITALY Demonstrations and special events built around the themes of violence, abortion and equal rights took place around the country. In Rome, women MPs met with the President of the Senate; in Turin, International Women's Day was on the agenda of the Regional Council meeting; in Milan, a ceremony was held in the lyric theatre to confer the City of Milan's award for women who have contributed to making equal rights a reality on South African singer Miriam Makeba for her anti-apartheid commitment; in Bologna, a specialised women's rights library was inaugurated; and in Palermo, the municipality rendered homage by making taxis free for all women on 8 and 9 March. The Members of the FGCI (Federation of Italian Communist Youth) held demonstrations and sit-ins across the country to \"re-affirm the need for a law against sexual violence perpetrated against minors\", as well as women's right to self-determination with regard to abortion. \"Le donne incontrano l'Europa nel segno della parit\u00e0, per l'affermazione della differenza' (Women meeting Europe under the sign of equality, defending the difference) was the slogan of the demonstration held in Rome on 8 March to honour Marisa Bellisario, the CEO of ITALTEL who died last year. Bellisario was one of the best known women managers in Italy. ",
        "WOMEN OF EUROPE N\" 58 - Jan./Feb./March 1989 p. 5 UNITED KINGDOM The members of the Wales Assembly of .Women sent a message of \"friendship and wishes\" to women all over the world while calling for joint action to solve the problems of pollution, development, justice and peace (Wales Assembly of Women, Elizabeth Charles, 5 Queen Street, New Quay, Dyfeel SA45 9P4). CHURCH The Vatican broadcast a message condemning \"the negation of woman's dignity\". In a speech to 200 Italian Catholic women active in politics and social affairs, Pope John Paul II stated that women's \"indispensable contribution\" to the building of society and the Church must be better understood and valued. ALGERIA Algerian women demonstrated in force for the first time in their capital to call for equal rights and the abrogation of the \"family code\", which they deemed a step backward. The Prime Minister received a delegation of demonstrators, who were thus able to inform him of their demands directly. These included the abolition of polygamy, the right to work and equal treatment in divorce. ARGENTINA The Union de Mujeres de la Argentina (Argentine Women's Union) called a huge demonstration at the Plaza de Mayo in Buenos Aires to \"defend democracy with bread, without political persecution\". This year, International Women's Day was an occasion for Argentine women to demand the \"right to life and political, trade union and social activism without political persecution\" as well as true equal opportunity and more balanced family rights (Lavalle 1370 - 3er Piso, Buenos Aires). THE CHANGING EUROPEAN COMMUNITY The New European Comission Having introduced his new Commission to the European Parliament in January (see Parliament section), Commission President Jacques Delors used his turn on the floor at the February Plenary Session to present his agenda for the year. He hoped for the opening of a European-wide democratic debate on internal border control issues; tax harmonisation; and a much-needed increase in the Member States' political, economic and social cohesiveness and cooperation. The other priorities included environmental, educational and training problems; Europe's global responsibilities; and relations with the developing countries. ",
        "p. 6 Women of Europe N\u00b0 58 - Jan. /Feb. /March 1988 Womenin Agriculture; The European Seminar of Women Farmers, which is sponsored each year by the European Council of Young Farmers and the Women's Committee of COPA (Committee of Agricultural Organisations in the European Community), in collaboration with the Women's Information Service of the European Commission, was held this year at Mytilene (Greece) on 11-14 January. The 200 participants and numerous speakers, who included Maria Kypriotakis, Greece's Under Secretary for Equality, and Marietta Giannakou, Vice-Chairwoman of the European Parliament's Committee on Women's Rights, focused on the economic and social conditions of women farmers and their role in farm management. They examined the changes in the Common Agricultural Policy and the CAP and their impact on smallholdings, discussed the professional status and participation of women in agricultural associations and unions, and stressed the need for solidarity and exchange amongst themselves. The women farmers examined once against the issues of recognition and guarantees of their rights, notably in the context of the next modification (in 1991) of the Directive on the self- employed. ! To coincide with this seminar, the latest supplement to Womenpf 1 \u00cd Europe (No. 29) is on Womenin Agriculture. i * Reminder: A seminar on the European status of family agricultural operations took place at Belgirate in October 1988. Paola Grossi, Head of the Confederazione Nazionale Coltivatori Diretti's legal department included a series of questions in the final report concerning the management, inheritance, social coverage, tax, and vocational training problems and problems regarding participation in economic organisations that are encountered by smallholdings of this type. Mrs Grossi stressed in particular the need for recognition of the work perforeed by members of the household (CEPFAR, European Centre for Advancement and Training in Agricultural and Rural Areas, rue de la Science 23/25, 1040 Brussels, Tel.: 230 3263). * Euro-Barcaeter published a special edition in February 1988 on \"Europeans and their Agriculture\". 1992: THE BIG DATE * The Member States' national, regional and local organisations concerned with vocational training for women will now be able to exchange information through the IRIS network (named after the female messenger of the gods in Greek mythology, who was quicker than her colleague, Hermes). IRIS offers the possibility of information and document exchange, access to a data bank, participation in meetings, and on-site observation of pilot training projects. The network has guaranteed funding through 1992 (Janet Smith, IRIS Information Office, Square Ambiorix 32, 1040 Brussels, Tel.: 230 7106). * Eight major European dailies {CorrieredellaSera, TheIndependent, Le Monde, El Pais, S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, NR\u00c7, Handelsblad, De Standaard and Le Soir) have united to give companies a chance to recruit the men and women they will need for 1992 more easily. Since January 1989 they all publish the same \"European company career announcements\" in their Saturday issues. (Information: M. Schouppe, Tel.: 217 7750 in Brussels) ",
        "WOMEN OF EUROPE N' 58 - Jan./Feb./March 1989 p. 7 * Target 1992, a monthly newsletter on Europe without Frontiers that was launched in April 1988 with a circulation of 30,000, now has a circulation of more than 100,000.

Poverty: International Conference: Work and Social Protection: Their role in Preventing the Impoverishment of Families in Europe. Brussels, 5-8 July 1989 This Conference, which is being organised by the Family Law Centre of Catholic University of Louvain, has been included among the activities of the European Commission's new Programme to Combat Exclusion and Poverty. It will stress the importance of prevention and the family and especially European dimensions of poverty and economic insecurity. Taking work as the central axis, the Conference will develop five main themes, namely, guidance and training as prerequisites for entry or return to the work force; policies for entry or re-entry into the labour market; protection against exclusion from the labour market; methods of reconciling family and occupational demands; and improving social security and social assistance in relation to work and the family. The aim is to produce recommendations on Community and Member State social policies. (Information: Centre de Droit de la Famille, Facult\u00e9 de Droit U.C.L., Place Montesquieu 2, 1348 Louvain-la-Neuve, Tel.: 010/47 47 30. Conference languages: English and French. More than 80 European experts will be attending.) * According to Eurostat, there were 15.8 million registered unemployed in the Community in 1988. This twelve-month mean was down 1.7* from 1987. The real unemployment rate (without seasonal adjustment) was 10.3% versus 10.6* in 1987. However, the real unemployment rate rose for women from 13.2 to 13.4*. whereas it fell for men from 8.9 to 8.3*. * The European Commission has published its Reporton the implementation of theCouncil Resolution on action to combatfemale unemployment. This report concludes that, besides training (diversification of occupational choices), raising awareness and sharing responsibilities (the spread of parental leave in most of the Member States), relatively few specific measures have been taken to help women. Moreover, the measures that have been taken are usually of limited scope. According to the report, the rise in female unemployment is a sign of a structural problem of job market segregation that calls for measures aimed specifically at the female work force. * The European Commission has also published (in Supplement 5/88 of Social Europe) a review of its achievements in the areas of education, training and youth in 1987 (Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Education, 200 rue de la Loi, 1040 Brussels). ",
        "p. 8 Women of Europe N* 58 - Jan./Feb./March 1988 Health: The Commission has sent on a draft Recommendation to the Council of Ministers calling for a Community-wide ban on smoking in public places based on the findings of a survey in which 77* of the respondents (65* of the smokers and 84* of the nonsmokers surveyed) were in favour of such a measure. The Commission defended its position on grounds of health and safety (such a ban, it reasoned, would have prevented the fire that killed 31 persons in the London underground last year). Education: The Commission has put forward a proposal for a programme to improve Europeans' mastery of foreign languages. With an estimated budget of 250 million Ecus for the first phase (1990-1994), the LINGUA programme will finance grants for continuous education for teachers, student exchange programmes and the development of teaching materials. Special attention will be paid to universities. Financial assistance will also be available for the promotion of corporate language teaching. Award: The 1988 European Journalism Award, an honour conferred by the European Commission for the past twenty years on the best journalists nominated by the Association of European Journalists, has gone to Huguette Vandevyv\u00e9re of La Voix du Nord (Lille) and Henk Aben of the Algemeen Dagblad (Rotterdam). Huguette Vandevyv\u00e9re has always defended the idea of a united Europe. \"Today, everyone - or almost everyone - calls himself European... It wasn't like that only 20 years ago, when I first met the European journalists...That is when I began to believe, to hope in a united Europe,\" she stated in accepting her award. E U R O P E AN P A R L I A M E NT At its March Plenary Session the European Parliament adopted a general Resolution concerning the European Commission's programme of work for 1989 and a Resolution put forward by the Committee on Women's Rights demanding in particular that the programme include a specific chapter on sexual equality. The Resolution (which 42 MEPs nevertheless voted against) also calls for a Directive on affirmative action (including quotas); a Directive on equality with regard to the taxation of income; a Directive to harmonise maternity legislation in line with the more advance national legislation; a Community job classification system that does not undervalue women's work; a Directive on flexible work schedules; and a third equal opportunities programme. Answering a question from Hedy d'Ancona on this last point, Commission President Delors confirmed the Commission's intention to do just that, for, as he pointed out, it would be paradoxical if nothing were done to improve women's status at the very moment that the Community was getting ready to adopt a Bill of fundamental social rights. The Internal Market - a Challenge for Women This is the theme of the forum attended by national parliamentarians that was held in Brussels on 22-23 February by the Committee on Women's Rights. Committee Chairwoman Hedy d'Ancona (Dutch Socialist) expressed her delight at having the opportunity to have such \"direct contact\" with the women members of the Member States' Parliaments and hoped that such a meeting ",
        "WOMEN OF EUROPE N' 58 - Jan./Feb./March 1989 p. 9 would become an annual tradition. In addition, in the meeting's conclusions she asked the European Commission to set up a unit to study the impact on women of all measures being considered to complete the Single Market. D'Ancona regretted that Directives concerning women were usually watered down as they went through the Council of Ministers, as well as the fact that the Council has done nothing since its June 1984 Resolution promising measures to combat female unemployment. Finally, she felt, that, given current demographic trends, Europe will soon no longer be able to afford the luxury of leaving women outside the labour market. Yvette Roudy (French Socialist, currently member of the National Assembly, Chairwoman from 1979 to 1981 of the European Committee's Ad Hoc Committee on Women's Rights) spoke in favour of the creation in each Member State of a \"strong, permanent\" institutional structure where parliamentarians, experts and association representatives would be able to discuss the implementation of Community Directives. Another national MP, Ms Trees Merckx, gave the Belgian legislature good marks regarding direct discrimination, which has disappeared from the texts, but stressed the continued risks of indirect discrimination. In the \"European camp\", French Socialist Marie-Claude Vayssade, Rapporteur on the implementation of Community Directives concerning women, found a \"world of difference\" between legislation, which has been updated almost everywhere, and reality. Belgian Socialist Marijke Van Heaeldonck, Rapporteur on 1992's impact on women, contended that little attention had been paid to women in preparing 1992. For example, no one seems to have thought of the consequences of worker mobility on families. Yet, as the MEP pointed out, family law, which currently varies from one State to the next, will have to be compatible within the \"European Legal Area\". Marietta Giannakou. from Nea Demokratia (Greece), took up the issues of her report on women in decision-making centres, exhorting women to vote for women and not replicate the \"macho mentality\". Two Commissioners also testified before the Forum. Vasso Papandreou announced that she intended to launch a new action programme for equal opportunity in the '90s that, in her opinion, would bring about a real \"social reform\". Papandreou heavily underscored the importance of education, terming a situation in which women with trained skills or university educations could not find suitable jobs \"a waste of vast resources\". Jean Dondelinger, who reviewed the public information and communication initiatives taken by the Commission over the last ten years, was pleased with the progress that had been made in this area. Declaring that \"the dialogue between women and the (Community) institutions must be interactive\", he stressed that the Community' \"equal opportunities\" policy was one of the Community policies most able to show how the project of a united Europe, a People's Europe, was a project of change, a project for a society of greater justice and solidarity. The proceedings of the Forum will be published at the end of April in all of the Community's languages.

        "p. 10 Women of Europe N\" 58 - Jan./Feb./March 1988 Plenary Sessions: During its January plenary session the European Parliament heard Commission President Delors review the new Commission's major policy guidelines, with emphasis placed on Social Europe, People's Europe and the Community's role in the world, as well as on completing the Single Market. In February the Parliament adopted a report by Fernand Herman (EPP, Belgium) calling for progress in achieving a European Union and a (if possible Community-wide) referendum to be held on this issue. It also adopted a string of interesting reports drafted by women and covering the following topics: - education (Jessica Larive, Dutch Liberal): The European Parliament calls for a medium-term programme and the strengthening of existing programmes; - young people (Nicole Fontaine, EPP, France): The European Parliament would like to see the creation of a Community youth card; - sports (J. Larive): The European Parliament calls for a 1990-92 action programme that includes measures to encourage women to practice sports and takes the implications of 1992 for sports into account; - the CAP and the Third World (Katharina Focke, SPD, Germany): According to the European Parliament, part of the savings produced by the cuts in farm subsidies that will come out of the Uruguay Round should be used to help the developing countries; leisure (Caroline Jackson, British Conservative): The European Parliament has amended the draft Directive on package trips; - foodstuffs exported after nuclear accidents (Undine-Uta Bloch von Blottnitz, German Greens): The European Parliament rejected the Commission's proposals, which it considers too permissive; - dismantling nuclear power plants (U. Bloch von Blottnitz): The European Parliament approved the schedule for 1989-1993; - protection of animals: The European Parliament adopted the reports of Carole Tongue (British Labour) on using animals for experimentation, Marcelle Lentz-Cornette (EPP, Luxembourg) on protecting the brown bear; and C. Jackson on banning the use of jaw traps (as well as a report by Carlo Alberto Graziani, Italian Communist, on protecting wolves). Once again, due to the overloaded agenda, there was not enough time to discuss the report of Dutch Green Nel Van Dijk on women's health. The number of women in the European Parliament will not change as a result of Christiane Scrivener's move to the European Commission, for her replacement is another woman, Monique Badenes, who joins the EPP. Welcome! Committee on Women's Rights The Committee heard Christiane Scrivener report on the European Commission's tax proposals (one of the most delicate areas of the Single Market). The Committee members asked some very specific questions. For instance, Vera Squarcialupi (Communist Group) asked how Italian women will be able to manage their budgets if meat is taxed at 19*. When, Dutch Socialist Ien van den Heuvel wanted to know, will environmentally-harmful products be taxed accordingly? The Committee also heard a talk by Jo Walgrave, Chairwoman of the European Advisory Committee on Equal Opportunities, who expressed concern over the effects of 1992 on the situation of women. Walgrave also announced that her Committee would step up its work on chi Ideare, which she said was a political as well as social problem. ",
        "WOMEN OF EUROPE N* 58 - Jan./Feb./March 1989 p. 11 Finally, the Committee listened to representatives from COPA's Women's Committee, who reiterated t h e ir plea for a status for farmers' wives. A good example: The European Parliament specifies in i ts announcement to f i ll the position of head of i ts Paris Information Bureau that it is looking for a new head (male/female) for i ts bureau. It adds that the European Parliament applies a policy of equal opportunity for i ts male and female personnel. In order to correct the imbalance in \"A\" category jobs, it strongly urges women to apply. COUNTRY TO COUNTRY... FACTS, INSTITUTIONS, LAWS AND MILITANT ACTIVITIES B E L G I UM A woman, Raymonde Dury, Member of the European Parliament, has been chosen to head the French-speaking Social Party list in the June European elections. Women and Revolution: As part of the bicentennial celebrations of the French Revolution, Bank Brussels Lambert is sponsoring an exhibition on \"Women at the Time of the French Revolution\", from 31 March to 15 May inclusive, Place Royale No. 6, 1000 Brussels. More than 120 works of art (mainly paintings, drawings, prints, furniture and china), as well as period clothing and jewellery, illustrating the role played by women in public and daily life are on display. The exhibition also includes an audio-visual presentation financed by the Women's Information Service of the European Commission. People's Europe: Belgium's \"big chief\" of \"borderless\" Europe is a woman, Anne-Marie Delvaux, Director-General at the Ministry of Justice. The Rhodes Summit in December 1988 had urged each Government to appoint one person to handle the internal security problems (crime, terrorism, drugs) that would be caused by the dismantling of the Community's internal borders. The first meeting of the officials selected for this task in the twelve Member States took place in Brussels in February. Elections: As a democrat, Interior Minister Louis Tobback feels that it is \"scandalous\" that only 20 of the 502 burgomasters (i.e., mayors) appointed after the last local elections are women. His ministry has drafted an interesting report, the Beyens report, describing the typical Belgian burgomaster: a 53-year-old male civil servant, employee or professional. (By the way, the youngest burgomaster is currently a woman, 25-year-old Dominique Jeanmoye, of Heron.) Helpmate spouses: The country's associations of spouses who pitch in without pay have won a major victory. As a result of the tax reform that went into effect on 1 January, the self-employed will be able to assign a fraction of their incomes to their helping wives, as long as the wife does not earn more than BFr350,000 on her own. Thus, says the doctors' spouses association, Association des conjoints-aidants de m\u00e9decins (ASCAM, 113 rue Roi Albert, 4200 Ougr\u00e8e, Tel.: 041/37 44 92), the self-employed (shopkeepers, craftsmen, professionals and farmers) will be able to assign ",
        "12 Women of Europe N* 58 - Jan./Feb./March 1988 a real taxable income to their spouses, who will thus become taxpayers in their own right. Besides ASCAM, two other associations of this type exist in Belgium, one in the food sector (ASCALIM), the other in the building trades (ASCATIB). In Flanders, doctors' wives are the only ones to have mobilised, under the initials VEMEA. Affirmative action: The Secretary of State (Junior Minister) for Social Emancipation, Miet Smet, has begun to see some results of the awareness- raising campaign she launched in July 1987 to encourage equal opportunity for women in employment. Affirmative action schemes will soon be instituted in companies with more than 100 employees and some twenty companies with a combined work force of more than 50,000 have already signed pacts with the Government under which the Secretary of State's office offers them the services of experts to guide their affirmative action efforts (and this number should double quickly). The companies that have signed up include IBM, Monsanto, Siemens and GB/Inno/BM. In addition, a special unit has been set up within the Industrial Relations Department of the Ministry of Employment and Labour to have affirmative action schemes included among the points on the collective bargaining tables. Womenandpower: The Interfederal Committee of the Socialist Party's women's section {Commission interfederale des femmes du Parti socialiste) held a colloquium on women and power during which Viviane Jacobs, the Socialist Party's delegate for women's rights, stated that the Party has been \"running in place\" since the institution of quotas in the early '80s. The Secretary of State (Junior Minister) for Europe 1992, Anne-Marie Lizin, felt that power was measured by the number of decisions made. MEP Raymonde Dury encouraged women to be less timid. Language: During a meeting of the Chamber's Committee for the Interior, General Affairs and Civil Service, Laurette Onkelinx questioned the Interior Minister about the introduction of feminine forms of the names of trades, positions, ranks and titles. The language, she claimed, has to change if the Government does not want to look ridiculous. She cited the case of a notice on an office door that read, \"Monsieur le Directeur est en cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9\" . Music: \"Women also compose\" is the name of the concert held in Brussels this year to make known piano compositions written by women in Germany, Belgium, France and the Netherlands in the last three centuries. The programme of the piano recital given by Wally Karveno and sponsored by the European Commission's Women's Information Service contained works by thirteen women ranging from Elisabeth Claude Jacquet de la Guerre (France, 1664-1729), who played her compositions for harpsichord for the Sun King's court and became a rival of Couperin, to Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Brent, born in France in 1935, winner of the Rome Prize, teacher at the Conservatoire national sup\u00e9rieur in Paris, and the composer of many works. Maternity: * To avoid one of the causes of discrimination in hiring, namely, the possibility of pregnancy, Social Affairs Minister Philippe Busquin has proposed that the current maternity leave system, in which the future mother's employer bears the cost alone, be replaced by a maternity fund to which all employers would contribute based on the total number of employees (both men and women) on the payroll. * The leader of the PSC MPs, Michel Lebrun, has submitted a bill that, if adopted, would allow men to take an eight-week paternity leave following the birth of a child if the mother was unable to take care it. ",

The participants also discussed the results of a survey carried out by the Free University of Brussels that found that most women would like to have more children than they actually do (which requires more possibilities allowing them to combine the roles of mother and working woman). Countdown 1992: The Institut europ\u00e9en interuniversitaire de l'action sociale (179 rue du D\u00e9barcad\u00e8re, 6001 Marcinelle, Tel.: (071) 36 62 73) will be holding a colloquium on \"women in 1992\" at Marcinelle on 24-25 May. The Women's University: {Universit\u00e9 des femmes, place Qu\u00e8telet la, 1030 Brussels, Tel.: 219 6107) offers a seminar series on education on Thursday evenings for the first half of 1989. One of the topics tackled, that of co-ed classes, gave rise to some interesting remarks. Thus, according to Patricia Piron, a psychotherapist specialising in teen-agers, it is easier to speak about emotions in classes that are not co-ed. Co-education is not necessary the solution to all problems, according to another teacher, Fran\u00e7oise Hecq, who found that the pupils in her all-girl and all-boy classes were \"much more spontaneous\". Nadine Plateau, a language teacher, wondered if separating the sexes might not be appropriate in certain circumstances. Research: The Dutch-speaking Women's Studies Centre {Centrum voor Vrouwenstudies, Frei Universiteit Brussel, 2 Pleinlaan, 1050 Brussels), which was set up in 1987, has announced its first publication, covering such a variety of subjects as work, medicine, science, teaching, and the women's movement. Soroptimists: The Antwerp Soroptimists' Club (Bea Rabe, p/a Sorqptimist Club Antwerpen, J. Ratinckxstraat 1, Bus 3, 2600 Berchem, Tel.: (03) 517 4166) has published, with the support of the Secretariat for Emancipation, a brochure with the title Een Vrouw in de Kijker (A woman on focus) aimed at encouraging girls finishing secondary school to choose studies leading to careers of responsibility and leadership. This interesting brochure contains information gleaned from twelve women who were invited to describe the phases in their careers to the Club. These women include a woman director of Fabrimetal, the Vice-President of Sigma Coating Holding, a museum curator, the managing director of INBEL, the dean of the ULB's Faculty of Social Science, Political Science and Economics, and a Kredietbank attach\u00e9^ e! ).

The first two days of the conference focused on discussion of education and employment strategies based on proposals made by scientists, political figures, labour-market-related organisations, and representatives of the Labour Ministries' main departments. Proposals concerning new life-styles, the Community and Internal Market, and the legislation on jobs and education for the unemployed were also put forward. The third day was devoted to the subject of women in managerial positions. Five women holding either private-sector or government executive positions were invited to explain the problems related to career advancement for women. The Council of Equality also presented a thought-provoking book at the conference called Are women up to working? and a study of the barriers and opportunities for women to reach executive positions.

Draft legislation on equal ...opportunity and .pay: Two new proposed amendments to Denmark's equal opportunity and equal pay laws are being studied in the Folketing (Parliament). The Danish National Women's Council (DKN) has stressed that the Labour Ministry's bills do not reverse the burden of proof for women claiming to be the targets of discrimination. The DKN would like the principle of reversing the burden of proof into consideration in both the equal opportunity law and the equal pay law. Denmark's Labour Minister has supported the reversal of the burden of proof in Community draft legislation. Women's. Festival in Copenhagen: A Women's Festival will take place in Copenhagen on 10-11 June 1989 as a result of the strong interest raised by the Nordic Forum, a Scandinavian conference on women, held in Oslo in 1988. Following the example of the Nordic Forum, seminars, workshops and cultural exhibitions will be held during the festival. National Danish Women's Council turns90: The DKN celebrated its 90th birthday in early mark. The event was marked by a conference, held in the wake of the Council's annual General Assembly, during which the issue of women's economic independence, especially their situation vis-\u00e5-vis the national retirement scheme in coming years, was brought up. Bente Rosenbeck, a researcher specialised in women's issues and member of the DKN's executive board, reviewed the Council's long and fascinating history. The DKN also put forward a new programme on children's roles in society that raised, among other things, the problem of improving childcare possibilities. The DKN now has 41 member organisations representing a total of 1 million individuals. It has served as an umbrella organisation for Danish women's associations and organisations specialised in equal opportunity matters. Most of the political parties' equal opportunities committees currently belong to the DKN. In addition, more and more trade unions are setting up equal opportunity committees, which is triggering interest in the DKN.

The programme also includes a chapter on \"combating all forms of exclusion\" consisting of measures to encourage the inclusion of women who live alone in government or social services, an experiment with relais-amiti\u00e9 \u00e0 domicile (home \"friendship\u00adrelay\" visits) for elderly women, and information on contraception; and a chapter on access to positions of civic and political responsibility that will start with a \"mobilisation campaign\" on the role of women in city management. Politics: As a result of the 19 March municipal elections, Catherine Trautmann, Socialist,\u00ad 39 years old, has become the first woman mayor of a city of more than 100,000 inhabitants \u00ad Strasbourg. * A \u0392 VA survey published in the 26 January issue of Paris Match shows that the public tends to have confidence in female politicians. 80* of the men and 89* of the women surveyed felt that if women succeeded, it was because of their abilities, whereas 13* of the men and 5* of the women answered that it was because of their \"charm\". In addition, 28* of those polled were \"shocked\" by the fact that very few women pursued major political careers, versus 69* who were not. Finally, 40* of the male respondents said that they would encourage their partner or spouse if she wanted to go into politics, 34* would try to talk her out of it, and 9* would \"forbid\" it completely. * The end\u00adof\u00adyear issue of the Bulletin de l'Association Nationale des Fran\u00e7aises \u00e2 1'\u00e9tranger contains information on women and politics in Germany with special attention paid to the problem of quotas. * Concerning quotas, the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration nationale des \u00e9lues socialistes et r\u00e9publicaines (12, Cit\u00e9 Malesherbes, 75009, Tel.: (1) 4526 5050) has published \"Une autre place pour les femmes\" (Another Place for Women) by R\u00e9gine Saint\u00adCriq, which is both a census of the Socialist women elected to office at all levels of government and an investigation of what they feel to be the obstacles in the way of their political advancement within the party. According to this report, a mandatory 30* quota for women is required in the beginning, instead of the 20* quota that is not even met. There is also a need to familiarise women with the media. What do women elected officials have to say about quotas? Most of them feel that they are \"a necessary evil\"; 59* believe that they still have a reason for being and 46* that they should be raised (according to 39*, to 50* or more).

The SPD (Ollenhauerstra\u00dfe 1, 5300 Bonn 1) has published the record of the debate on quotas that took place at the 1988 party congress. * In commenting on the 40th anniversary of their organisation, CDU women (Konrad-Adenauer-Haus, 5300 Bonn) declared that the CDU wants \"neither token women nor quota women\". Equality: The SPD submitted a bill in the Bundestag aimed at achieving equality between men and women in society, at work, and in the home. The draft includes a general equality clause and calls for changes in labour laws (especially as regards legal sanctions in cases of discrimination), measures for the advancement of women in civil service jobs over a limited period, and measures to reward companies that treat men and women as equals.

For example, women make up 98* of the electronics industry's workers but only 3.3* of the engineers. Schools: According to the 1988 statistics, more than half of Germany's teachers are women, but very few schools have women principals.

Attitudes: Since January 1989, more than 70,000 posters asking men, \"Are you strong enough for equality?\" have blossomed on the Federal Republic's walls. This national campaign to change mentalities and for more equitable sharing between men and women was launched by then Minister Rita S\u00fcssmuth (Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Jugend, Familie, Frauen und Gesundheit, 5300 Bonn 2). Abortion: A complaint has been lodged against the Green and Social Democratic MPs who joined the \"Down with 218\" campaign (the Federal Article making abortion a crime) supported by more than 200 women, men, and doctors and the four women ministers of Schleswig-Holstein. Hamburg's five women ministers and junior ministers have asked Ursula Lehr, Hamburg's Minister for Youth, the Family, Women and Health, to take action to protect women who decide to have abortions from negative public pressure.

Their coordinating committee is waiting for the main political part ies' response. Women and Politics: With the help of the National Centre for Social Research (EKKE, Sofocleous 1, 10559 Athens), the General Secretariat for Equality conducted an investigation of women's political attitudes that revealed that, while 68* of the women surveyed refused to pattern their voting behaviour after that of their husbands, 48* of them admitted that they actually did vote consistently for the same parties as their husbands. Only 5* of the women over 45 said that they did not vote like their husbands, compared with 20* of those under 30. In addition, 75* of the women felt that politics was not men's business only, and more than 50* thought that things would be better if women were more active politically.

The Talent Bank's staff add that, when asked why more women are not appointed to higher bodies in its administration, the Government constantly replies, \"We would like to, but we never find them\".

A new Social Assistance Allowance Scheme for such groups along the lines of the current non-contributory scheme for widows and abandoned wives is to be introduced in October. * A heated discussion over the Government's proposal to make payments granted under the Children's Allowance Scheme means tested from next year on. The AIM Group for Family Law Reform attacked the proposal (the payments have been made up to now on a universal basis) because the allowance is the only money that a non-earning wife is entitled to receive into her own hand.

The case breaks ground in that it is the first one of its kind in Ireland to establish that sexual harassment is a matter of intention and psychological effect and can be symbolic in form as well as verbal or physical. The chief executive of the Employment Equality Agency (Mount Street, Dublin 2), Sylvia Meehan, has issued a statement welcoming the decision. Sexual abuse of children: The Irish Parents Together Group has called for change in the Child Sex Abuse Law to enable more prosecutions to be brought in child sexual abuse cases. According to a spokesman for the Irish Association of Social Workers (Liberty Hall, Dublin 1, Tel. 724 698), which has joined forces with the parents on this issue, only a handful of the 500 confirmed cases of sexual abuse of children reported in 1987 ended up in the courts. \u00c7hild\u00e7are: In a report on Childcare and Equal Opportunities, which is available for 3 punts from the Government Publications Sales Office, Molesworth Street, Dublin 2), the Employment Equality Agency defines the right to childcare facilities as a crucial issue in the achievement of equal opportunity at work. The report, which was prepared by Dr. Ann McKenna, recommends, among other things, that parents' childcare costs be considered a legitimate employment-related expense for income tax purposes and that the cost of providing workplace nurseries should be eligible for corporate tax relief. What's in a name? Women's Identity is the title of a book being prepared by Ellen J. Cahi\u00ef\u00ef (42 Hillside Park, Rathfarnham, Dublin 16), long-time WHO staff member turned consultant.

Can you describe the main phases of action intended to promote equality between men and women in Europe?\" A good initiative that reaches young people and deserves to be copied. ",
        "p. 24 Women of Europe N\u00b0 58 - Jan./Feb./March 1988 Rape: The debate on the bill against rape, originally scheduled to be adopted by the Chamber in February, is likely to be prolonged due to the unexpected approval of an amendment that abolishes an article allowing class action suits in rape cases to support the victims. One of the key stumbling blocks in the discussion is whether the decision to prosecute rapists may be made by the magistrate's office or only by the victim herself. The problem is particularly important with regard to the victims of sexual violence within the marriage, who rarely prosecute. However, a \"revolutionary\" \"rape non-assistance\" amendment put forward by Green Gianni Lanzinger was adopted during the debate. This amendment makes witnesses of a rape who fail to intervene liable for prison sentences (a condition which would require a change in the penal code). Parental leave: The Joint Senate and Chamber Group of Women Communist MPs (via Botteghe Oscure 4, 00186 Roma) has put forward two bills aimed at 1) extending the duration of parental leaves to six months (not necessarily in a row) for each parent until the child's sixth birthday (the leave would be doubled in the case of a handicapped child or single-parent family); and 2) extending to men all of the rights recognised for women concerning absence from work to help their children. Housewives : More than 2,000 delegates of the federation of Italian housewives, Federcasalinghe, descended on Rome to present the Government with a series of demands such as the allocation of a \"social pension\" for women over 65 and the creation of a \"women's card\" granting a 10* discount on the prices of staples (not applied at the cash register, but paid into a bank account to constitute a \"retirement fund\"). The proposals were illustrated by Federation President Federica Gasparrini, who reminded her listeners that there are currently about 11,000 \"housewives\" in Italy. Useful address: Federcasalinghe, Via dei Cappuccini 6, Roma. Employment: The economic and social research centre CERES {Centro Ricerche Economiche e Sociale, via Nomentana 201, 00161 Roma) devoted the last issue of its publication Tendenze della occupazione to female employment, in which it stressed the inability of the production system to provide jobs for women between the ages of 25 and 45 and women with post-secondary school degrees meeting their qualifications. Mentalities: The Italian Federation of women in the arts, professions and business, FIDAPA {Federazione Italiana Donne Arti Professioni Affari, via Domenichino 45, 20149 Milano) held its 20th National Congress under the banner \"Why not a Woman?\" Social Affairs Minister Rosa Russo Jervolina regretted the fact that such a question still had to be asked in this day and age. FIDAPA President Tatiana de Bartolomeo stressed the need for women to be ready to face the challenges that will arise when the Community's internal borders disappear. Constitutiqn: To mark the 40th anniversary of the Italian Constitution, a number of organisations of partisans and resistance workers banded together to hold a colloquium in Milan on \"reading the Constitution in the feminine to know and verify values, victories and weaknesses\", during which Nobel Prize winner Rita Levi Montalcino gave a talk on \"women, ethics and science\". Management: The association Donne in Carriera (via Santa Maria alia Porta 1, 20123 Milano) has organised a series of seminars on \"management principles: appropriate, effective leadership\". The aims are to verify one's own leadership abilities, including the ability to motivate fellow workers. ",

This strikes a blow for equal opportunity and the re-int\u00e9gr\u00e2tion of women who stopped working to take care of their children. Exhibition: The Lombardy chapter of the Italian National Women's Council {Consiglio Nazionale Donne Italiane, Coordinamento regionale per la Lombardia, via Trebbia 9, 20135 Milano) has set up an exhibition called \"Europe is Woman: the long march towards equality, from Rome to 1992\" to illustrate the gains made for and by women through the dialogue linking Community institutions, Italian institutions, and women's associations. The exhibition includes one section on the European Community and its work to advance women; a second section on Italian institutions, laws, and initiatives to advance women; a third section on the activities of the CNDI and affiliated associations; and a fourth section on the ten-year history of Women of Europe. The exhibition will travel to other Italian cities. It was organised by Maria Pia Roggero and Lorenza Minoli, drawing on the scientific studies of Maria Weber and Antonietta Confalonieri. Europe 1992: * The Soroptimist Club d'Italia (via Adelaide Ristori 20, 00197 Roma) conducted a survey of how its members thought 1992 would affect women. Most of the respondents felt it would improve career possibilities, the quality of life, and leisure, but feared that the amount of time spent together as a family would be reduced as a result of population dynamics, freedom of movement, etc. The club's previous President, Linda Longoni Brambilla, writes in the magazine Soroptimist that the movement must suggest the changes - even structural ones - in its members' activities that this phase of change requires. * The magazine Famiglia Cristiana (via Giotto 36, 20145 Milano) has published a supplement called \" 1992-appuntamento con l'Europa\". Starting with the February issue it also comes with a monthly booklet on Europe 1992. European Elections: The women of the European Left held a conference called \"Europe: We Want it that Way\" in Milan in February. They adopted a manifesto stating that solving women's problems must occupy a central position in political decision-making. Culture and equal opportunity: CRAS FORM, an association for the development of culture and training (via Maria Adelaide 12, Roma, Tel.: 360 5511), is a new women's organisation created to teach the value of culture and training as determinants of equal opportunity, individual freedom and social solidarity. Carla Ravaioli, Alida Castelli, Gioia Longo, Marcella Pompili Pagliari, and Licia Mampieri Saura are founding members. The association has already launched initiatives eligible for European Social Fund aid, notably courses for \"equal opportunity operators\" in Basilicata, Calabria, Marche, and Sardinia. Army j Pol ice : * A group of women from the PSI and DC want to put forward a bill allowing women to enter military academies and take up military careers (but not take part in combat). * Nine young women who applied for the position of traffic policeman in Salerno but were turned down because they were too small, despite their brilliant test scores, have taken their case to court.

The first training course for women heads of companies offered by the Association for Women's World Banking (c/o Maria Grazia Randi, Corso Europa 14, 20122 Milano) has come to a successful close. Twenty-eight women participated in the three-month course, which will be repeated. The Scuola politica femminile Europea (viale Piave 21, 20123 Milano) organised earlier this year, with the collaboration of the Federation of European Liberal Parties, a seminar on \"the political work of women in Europe\" that was attended by several Euro-Parliamentarians.

The Italian Women's Centre {Centro Italiano Femminile, via Carlo Zucchi 25, 00165 Roma) took time during its 21st National Congress to study the need to find new terms for describing the status of women. It also elected a new slate of officers: Maria Chiaia, President; Maria Rosaria Bosco Lucarelli and Amabilia Diotallevi, Vice-presidents; and Maria Angela Giorgi Cittadini, General Secretary. Italy's National Association of Women Voters {Associazione Nazionale Donne Elettrici, via Principi di Savoia 16, Lecce) has set up a women's hotline in Lecce, Punto d'Ascolto Donna (Tel.: 0832-40132) manned by sociologists, lawyers, gynaecologists, and social workers to answer the questions of women in difficulty. An exhibition on \"Women and the Belle Epoque in the Alinari Studio\" gives viewers a chance to admire portraits of women made by the famous family of photographers between 1895 and 1910 (Alinari, via Alibert 6, 00187 Roma).

        "WOMEN OF EUROPE N' 58 - Jan./Feb./March 1989 p. 27 L U X E M B O U RG Labour: The Chamber of Deputies' Finance and Budget Committee has drafted a report examining the possibilities of improving the entry into or return of women to the work force. In particular, it decries certain types of discrimination in the social security scheme that reflect overly traditional notions of the family (for example, no widower's or orphan's pension is granted upon the death of a wife or mother). According to the report, the legislation on alimony in the event of divorce cases must also be overhauled and an attempt made to offer women the best possible combination between work and their family duties. (The Committee feels that while the State is in a position to do this for its female civil servants, the private sector is less able to do so). According to the report, 34.8* of Luxembourg's women worked in 1987, up from 32.5* in 1981, while the number of women working in the 20-to-24 age group rose over the same period from 68.5% to 82.4*. The report ends on an optimistic note: If more and more women work, they will be able to count more and more on their own rights. Non- traditional occupations: A young Luxembourg woman, Lea Linster, who is the chef of the restaurant of the same name at Frisange (17 route de Luxembourg) has won the Golden Bocuse. Linster, who was the only woman among the 26 nominees, declared that women have \"an innate, even hereditary, sense for cooking\", whereas, in the case of men, it is rather a skill that they have mastered (see also the section on France). .Paternity: The Luxembourg Psychology Society {Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 luxembourgeoise de psychologie) and Training Centre for One-Parent Families {Centre de formation pour familles monoparentales, 47 avenue de la Libert\u00e9, Luxembourg, Tel.: 490051) held a seminar led by French psychoanalyst Fran\u00e7oise Hurstel on \"being a father today\". According to Hurstel, the rise in the number of one-parent families calls for thought on how to be a child-rearing father. What is more, the shift from the notion of \"paternal power\" to \"parental authority\" shared by father and mother blurs the notion of fatherhood even more. Inner Wheel (c/o Andr\u00e9e Wolter, 9 rue du Lyc\u00e9e, 4217 Esch-Alzette) is the name of a women's solidarity and friendship movement composed of the wives, daughters and widows of Rotary Club members.

The report, which was based on a survey of 823 companies and some 17,000 workers, found a difference pay rates at all levels except the bottom. In addition, only 1.5* of the companies offered extended parental leaves and daycare facilities. The same Minister called the attention of the Committee for Equal Treatment of Men and Women to the fact that 71* of lower-level jobs are filled by women (in contrast, women hold only 6.7* of top-level positions). What is more, 47* of the female labour force, compared with a mere 5* of the male work force, have part-time jobs. * The Centre of Aid for the Unemployed of Northern Brabant has published a brochure aimed at girls in particular, as well as, more generally, women job-seekers, that indicates the projects, training possibilities, and employment measures in effect in Northern Brabant. The brochure is designed for future workers in the socio-cultural sectors, teachers and municipal employees and can be obtained for HFL12.5 (postage not included) from Provinciaal Steunpunt Werkloosheid, Postbus 558, 5201 AN Bois-Le-Duc (Tel.: 12 43 25). Poverty: The Women's Platform for Economic Independence has just published a brochure on women and poverty in the Netherlands ( Vrouwen en Armoede in Nederland) based on the Dutch contribution to the \"European Days on Women and Poverty\" held in Brussels in November. A number of women were interviewed to learn how they were sucked into the spiral of poverty, how they coped with this poverty, and the extent to which money became an obsession for them. The main conclusion drawn in this interesting publication is that the poverty of women and their financial and legal dependence are two sides of the same coin. The brochure, which also contains 14 recommendations for government action, is available from the Breed Platform Vrouwen voor Economische Zelfstandigheid, Postbus 13174, 3507 LD Utrecht.

        "WOMEN OF EUROPE N* 58 - Jan./Feb./March 1989 p. 29 P O R T U G AL Administration and Equality: A recent ministerial order has extended equal treatment for men and women to the Portuguese public administration. The order is intended to guarantee equal opportunity and equal treatment in both admission to and the performance of public service. The new legislation applies to civil servants and officials of the central, regional, and local administrations and autonomous territories, as well as to social welfare institutions. How time is spent: Portuguese men watch an average of 5 hours of television a day, or twice as much as women do, while one third of a Portuguese woman's day is taken up by her children and household chores, according to a study conducted by the Directorate-General for the Family (Pra\u00e7a de Londres 2, 1000 Lisboa). The mother is also the one who takes care of the children if they fall ill (83* of the women respondents versus 1* of the men) or takes time off from work to take them to the doctor's (65* of the women compared with 2* of the men). According to the survey, three out of ten women devote themselves exclusively to the family and household activities, whereas most of their husbands (9 out of 10) have paid work outside the home. Housewives: The National Women's Rights Department of the Portuguese Socialist Party (Largo do Rato 2, 1200 Lisboa) has asked the Deputy Prime Minister to take measures so that the housewife will no longer be considered a \"second-class citizen\". It also called attention to the importance of revising the tax reform which, in its present state, \"unjustly penalises\" housewives. Local power: The Social Democratic Party {Partido Social Democrata, Rua Buenos Aires 39, 1296 Lisboa Codex) held a seminar on local power that was attended by hundreds of women PSD members. The seminar was aimed at galvanising women to participate in local power structures and exchanging experience. Christian women: The participants in a colloquium organised by the Centre of Christian Thought (Centro de Reflex\u00e3o Crista, rua Casthilho 61 - 2' D, 1200 Lisboa) decried the clearly masculine, discriminatory slant in theology, the liturgy and the ecclesiastical organisation of the Catholic church. As \"Christ's disciples\", the Christian women expressed the desire to find room in the church to deepen their faith, to find a chapel where the presence of women would be welcomed and \"revealed\". WomenFarmers: The women attending the \"5th Encounter of women farm workers of the district of \u00c9vora\" were quick to point out the forms of discrimination against women that still exist in agriculture. Basically, they do not have the freedom to choose their own occupations and are the first to be hit by unemployment. Film: More than 40 films from twelve European countries were shown at the first International Festival of Films by Women Film-makers held in Lisbon. The festival generated considerable interest in the public and media and the important role played by women's productions in the development of cinematography was stressed throughout. ",

The report denounces the \"negative discrimination against work by women that is engendered by the current system\" while hypothesizing that, as more and more women work, the economic independence of women will lead to \"individualisation\" of the family members that will unavoidably be reflected in the system of taxation. Employment: According to a study carried out by Maria Amalia Peinado Lopez for the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, Spanish women earn up to 18* less than men. In addition, there are much fewer women on the labour market than men. While 56.2* of women between the ages of 20 and 24 work (versus 66* of men in this age class), only 31.9* of women between the ages of 35 and 39 work (whereas the figure climbs to 97* for men in this age class). In addition, working women are concentrated in the services and agriculture (where they generally are not paid for their work). Non-traditional jobs: A group of working women from Paterna, a small town near Valencia, has built a low wall in a park to protest the local government's discrimination against women with regard to access to what are considered \"men's\" jobs. Having placed their last brick, the women then held a demonstration to demand the right to work in traditionally male domains. Civil service: As already mentioned in issue No. 57 of WoE, the Ministry of Public Administration (information available from Instituto de la Mujer) has published its figures on women in the civil service showing that women make up only 34.7* of Spain's civil servants. What is more, there is not a single woman in the Architectural and Engineering Corps and only 6.5* of the country's university professors, 4* of its diplomats, 3.2* of government agricultural and forestry engineers, and 1.1* of the doctors employed by the social security administration are women. In addition, with the appointment of two female ministers, there is a grand total of 30 women (9.1*) among government decision-makers (most of them are director- generals; there is one woman Secretary of State (Junior Minister)). Poverty: For the recent \"Day against the F\u00e9minisation of Poverty\", a number of trade unions, feminist groups and other organisations collected data on the situation of women in Spain from which it appears that the female unemployment rate is higher than the male unemployment rate (28.2* versus 16.6*); half of the unemployed women are long-term unemployed and, what is more, collect lower benefits than men; 42* of working women work on the \"black\" economy; widows' pensions are less than half the minimum wage; and 40* of Spain's immigrants are women who either do not work or, most of the time, are cleaning women with a precarious, unprotected situation. Health: A \"European Meeting on Women and Health\" will take place at Madrid's medical school on 22-25 July. The points on the agenda include critical analysis of health and family planning policies and regulation of the pharmaceuticals industry; women's views on their own health; maternity, abortion, mental health, etc.; experiments conducted in self-awareness and mutual aid groups; and the need for solidarity and coordination to achieve ",

T HE U N I T ED K I N G D OM Margaret Thatcher: In an interview for the magazine She, Mrs. Thatcher says that women should take on greater responsibility at work and calls for more women to be nominated to public appointments. The Prime Minister also suggested that several women should get together so that, while one looks after the children, the rest could go out to work part time. The National Childminding Association (8 Masons Hill, Bromley, Kent BR2 9EY) says that its 30,000 members are \"horrified\" by this suggestion, adding that it violates the 1948 Nurseries and Childminders Act, which makes it illegal to care for a child under five who is not a close relative for two or more hours a day for pay. Equality: \"The volatile combination of massive skill shortages, fewer school leavers, increased international competition and the free European market of 1992 provides a once-in-a-lifetime chance to bring equal opportunities firmly into the mainstream of British life,\" says the Equal Opportunities Commission (Overseas House, Quay Street, Manchester m3 3HN) in introducing its strategy for the 1990s. Its 17-point strategy focuses on enabling women and men to be effective, responsible employees and family members, removing the barriers that prevent women from participating in the full range of training opportunities, narrowing the gap between men' and women's earnings, and increasing fiscal and pension equality. Countdown 1992: Six of the fifty-three motions submitted to the 59th TUC Women's Conference (Congress House, Great Russell Street, London WC1 B3KS, Tel. 636 4030) held in Blackpool on 8-10 March concerned the effects of the Single Market on women. Motion 16 noted that \"in many areas of interest to women, the United Kingdom falls badly behind other European countries.\" In Motion 19, the conference warns that the need for a unanimous vote in the Council of Ministers on all issues relating to social provision and workers' rights will enable individual governments to frustrate moves to improve the position of working people. Europeanelections: The 300 Group, founded in 1980 to promote the participation of women in politics, has launched an appeal for a major push to get women into the European Parliament (as well as the House of Commons and local government). In an open letter that gives credit to the EC for its efforts to better the position of women, its founder, Lesley Abdela, notes that \"The parties are all hunting for good candidates\" and calls on all women to stand and/or vote. Maternity: * The Maternity Alliance claims that expectant mothers living on social security benefits cannot afford to buy the kind of food recommended by doctors to produce healthy children. The pressure group has thus called on the Government to give extra support to pregnant women. This followed a House of Commons all-party report showing that infant mortality rates are increasing in the UK, particularly among the poor. ",

The MPs also called for higher status and better pay for nursery teachers. The Committee pointed out that the need for nursery schools is more pressing today than in 1972, when then Education Minister Margaret Thatcher made an unfulfilled promise to make nursery provision available to 50* of all 3-year-olds and 90* of all 4-year-olds. Today, those children who do attend nursery school do so for only 15 hours a week. What is more, the schools are closed during school holidays, which is of little help to working parents. Flexibility: The Trustee Savings Bank has joined the growing number of banks to offer career breaks to their staff. It now offers career breaks of up to five years to male and female employees with a guarantee that returners will get back jobs at the same grade. In exchange, staff on career breaks must be prepared to keep in touch with the bank and keep up to date on changes in the world of banking. Management: Women in Management (66 Marryat road, Wimbledon, London SW19 5BN, Tel. 946 1238) announces a number of important events in its WIM Newsletter to mark the group's 20th anniversary. Language: In a new report called \"Making Women Visible\", the Church of England recommends using non-sexist language in church services. For example, \"sons of God\" would become \"children of God\" and, in the marriage service, \"no one\" would replace \"no man\" in \"That which God has joined together, let no man divide\". Exclusion: \"Men Only: An investigation into men's organisations\", by Barbara Rogers (Pandora Press), is a fascinating account of the way men use rules to exclude women from their activities, whether in school, clubs, the armed forces, church, or financial institutions.

Forty- three percent of the Italian men admitted that they \"never cooked\" (53* according to Italian women). Germany did better - 44* of the men said that they never cooked, a statement corroborated by 46* of their wives.
