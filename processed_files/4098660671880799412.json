        "1 Executive Summary This is the last report of a series of three reports for the period 2011-2012. It aims at pursuing the inventory and analysis work of the foresight exercises initiated by the Local and Regional Authorities (LRAs) in the European Union. The report analyses 10 relevant territorial foresight exercises developed recently by Local and Regional Authorities from Member States of the European Union. The selection of these cases is related to their connection with EU policies and strategies and with their geographical origin. The reports inspects several aspects of these cases in order to draw transversal lessons about the topics covered, the methods used, the points of interests of the selected foresights. In particular, it tries to assess whether the European policies and strategies impact on the content of the foresights and if, in return, elements could be useful for feeding these policies. This monitoring report covers the period from April 2012 till September 2012. ",
        "2 1. Introduction This report is the third of a series of three for the period 2011-2012. It aims at pursuing the inventory work initiated in two previous reports about the usefulness and added value of territorial foresight, as a tool for decision making for Local and Regional Authorities (LRAs) as well as a support mechanism for the Committee of the Regions (CoR) in the framework of its political and consultative functions 1 . The report elaborates on ten additional cases of territorial foresight led by LRAs and analyses the process and content of these new cases. The articulation between these cases and the policies and strategies built up by the European (and sometimes) national institutions is one of the points of attention explicitly required for the research, even if this articulation is not often easy to track or to evidence. The report relies on analysis of the selected cases. The completed grid of each case can be found in annex to this report. 1 Report CDR/CDP/49/2010 \u201cAn Initial Assessment of Territorial Forward Planning/Foresight Projects in the European Union. Territorial Foresight and European Multilevel Governance\u201d, Committee of the Regions, 2011.

        "3 2. Presentation of the selected studies Ten studies in the field of territorial foresight commissioned by European LRAs are analysed in this report: 1. Development of Innsbruck\u2019s Holistic Energy Identity in 2050 Involving Past, Present and Future Activities (Austria, 2012); 2. Caen-Metropolis Territorial Consistency Plan (France, 2009); 3. Danube-Iller Region: Prospects to 2030 (Germany, 2010); 4. Crete 2025 (Greece, 2008); 5. Amsterdam 2040 (Netherlands, 2011); 6. BINSAL, Beira Interior Norte - Provincia de Salamanca (Portugal, Spain, 2012); 7. Burgos Strategic Plan 2020 (Spain, 2011) 8. Ashford Borough Council\u2019s Local Plan to 2030 (United Kingdom, ongoing); 9. Scotland 2030 (United Kingdom, 2010); 10. Wales\u2019 Public Services 2025 (United Kingdom, ongoing). The criteria for the selection of the studies were the following ones: 1. Forward planning/foresight projects led in the 27 countries of the European Union with the best possible EU-27 coverage 2. Studies commissioned by LRAs 3. Recent forward planning/foresight projects 4. Multidimensional (rather than sectoral) exercises which take into account all the dimensions of a territory: economic, social, cultural, environmental... 5. Time horizon of the exercise of 10 years minimum 6. Projects using foresight techniques (workshops, scenario-building...) 7. Participatory projects 8. Study leading to an action plan The 10 studies selected do not meet the eight above-mentioned criteria but they meet at least five of them. In the analysis, a particular attention was paid to the connection of the foresight studies identified with EU policies and strategies, implemented or in preparation. A particular attention was also paid to the possible link of the selected cases to other foresight studies undertaken at global, European and national level. 8 out of the 27 countries of the European Union are represented in this selection. ",
        "4 3. Comparison of the identified studies\u2019 themes and objectives in link with EU policies and strategies The analysis of the ten selected cases is summed up in tables that can be found in annex to this report. We compare hereafter the content of the sections of these grids to try to draw lessons from the cases, in particular about their links to EU policies and strategies. The grid is made up of the following sections: 1. Title 2. Member State 3. Date 4. Project promoter 5. Publication\u2019s reference and type 6. Key words 7. Geographic perimeter 8. Time horizon 9. Contact details and Internet links 10. Summary of the process 11. Objectives of the stakeholders 12. Method 13. Topics addressed 14. Main recommendations 15. If action plan: indicators and governance 16. Connection with EU policies and strategies 17. Impact of the crisis 18. Assessment (strengths and limits) a) Description: Member State, date of the study This third selection of cases allows us to extend the geographic coverage to two more countries: Greece and the Netherlands. If we sum up the two previous reports and this one, the distribution is the following one: 1. Austria: 5 case 2. Belgium: 2 cases 3. France: 5 cases 4. Germany: 2 cases 5. Greece: 1 case 6. Netherlands: 1 case 7. Poland: 1 case 8. Portugal: 1 case 9. Romania: 2 cases 10. Spain: 2 cases 11. Sweden: 1 case 12. United Kingdom: 5 cases ",
        "5 13. Macroregional: 2 cases (1 case with Denmark, Finland and Sweden; 1 case with Portugal and Spain). 14 out of the 27 countries in the European Union are represented through the three reports. Western Europe is better represented than Central and Eastern Europe. Three countries in Western Europe are missing (Italy, Ireland, Luxembourg) while 10 countries in Central and Eastern Europe are missing (Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Slovakia, Slovenia). It would be worth pursuing the monitoring on territorial foresight to achieve a wider geographic coverage. b) Project promoter (level of governance) Level of governance Cases Local level of governance Innsbruck, Caen, Amsterdam, Burgos, Ashford Regional level of governance Crete, Scotland, Wales Several regions or parts of regions Danube-Iller region, BINSAL The ten cases were initiated by LRAs: five by local authorities, three by regional authorities and two by authorities representing a cross-border region between two countries (Portugal and Spain in the BINSAL case) or between two regions (Bavaria and Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg in the Danube-Iller Region case). If the project promoters are local or regional, stakeholders from other tiers of governance are implied in the projects. In the Caen-Metropolis territorial consistency plan, the French State provides a financial and methodological support; in the \u201cDanube-Iller region: prospects to 2030\u201d, the institution responsible for the process was created by two regions, Bavaria and Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg; in the BINSAL case, the project is funded by the ERDF (European Regional Development Fund). The partnership dimension of territorial foresights already seen in the previous reports is confirmed. In the projects launched by the local level, three of them are initiated by metropolitan areas (Caen metropolis, city of Amsterdam, Burgos city), which can be interpreted as a sign of the metropolisation process and of the rising power of cities. c) Keywords Categories Key words Cases Population and migrations Ashford, Scotland, Wales, Danube-Iller region Employment Ashford, Burgos Education \u2013 training Danube-Iller region, Burgos Health Income and consumption Demography and society Social protection ",

Nevertheless, even if several dimensions are taken into consideration in the selected cases, most of the time, one dimension prevails as shown in the above table, which follows the classification adopted in the two previous monitoring reports. \u201cCrete 2025\u201d is a technology foresight focused on the development of the agrifood industry; \u201cDevelopment of Innsbruck\u2019s Holistic Energy Identity to 2050\u201d is an energy foresight; and \u201cWales\u2019 Public Services 2025\u201d is a reflection over the future of public services built upon a large participation. In \u201cCaen-Metropolis Territorial Consistency Plan\u201d and in \u201cDanube-Iller Region: Prospects to 2030\u201d, the foresight is the result of a ",
        "7 local will to adopt a positioning with regard to bigger metropolitan regions; Greater Paris for Caen-Metropolis, and Stuttgart and Munich for the Danube-Iller region. The scope is wider as a territory project is at stake. Economic development is a core subject in several cases, in particular in \u201cCaen- Metropolis Territorial Consistency Plan\u201d, in \u201cDanube-Iller Region: Prospects to 2030\u201d and in \u201cAshford Borough Council\u2019s Local Plan to 2030\u201d, as well as employment prospects and job creation in \u201cBurgos Strategic Plan 2020\u201d and in \u201cAshford Borough Council\u2019s Local Plan to 2030\u201d. Energy and mobility concern most of the cases, be it \u201cAmsterdam 2040\u201d which aims to provide an investment agenda that will transform the city into a modern-efficient metropolis; \u201cDanube-Iller Region: Prospects to 2030\u201d through the theme \u201cinfrastructures\u201d (better rail connections with Stuttgart, electrification of rail lines in the south) and \u201ceconomy\u201d (renewable energies, energy storage, electro-mobility); or \u201cScotland 2030\u201d that recommends to invest in the renewable energy sector. d) Geographic perimeter Case Surface and population Development of Innsbruck\u2019s Holistic Energy Identity in 2050 Involving Past, Present and Future Activities 104,91 km\u00b2 120,000 inhabitants Caen-Metropolis Territorial Consistency Plan 900 km 2 333,500 inhabitants Danube-Iller Region: Prospects to 2030 5,460 km 2 960,000 inhabitants Crete 2025 8,336 km 2 601,131 inhabitants Amsterdam 2040 1,815 km\u00b2 2,289,762 inhabitants (metropolitan area) BINSAL, Beira Interior Norte - Provincia de Salamanca 16,500 km 2 460,000 inhabitants Burgos Strategic Plan 2020 108 km 2 180,000 inhabitants Ashford Borough Council\u2019s Local Plan to 2030 580,62 km\u00b2 118,000 inhabitants Scotland 2030 78,772 km\u00b2 5,116,900 inhabitants Wales\u2019 Public Services 2025 20,779 km 2 3,064,000 inhabitants The surface and the number of inhabitants are very different. Nevertheless, sparsely populated areas are not represented. Innsbruck with 120,000 inhabitants has the smallest population in the sample. ",
        "8 Four territories with large rural areas are present: \u2014 Caen-Metropolis, \u2014 Danube-Iller Region, \u2014 Crete, \u2014 Scotland. Four project promoters are cities: Innsbruck, Caen-Metropolis, Amsterdam and Burgos. Amsterdam is the largest metropolitan city. e) Time horizon Case Time horizon Development of Innsbruck\u2019s Holistic Energy Identity in 2050 Involving Past, Present and Future Activities 2020 and 2050 Caen-Metropolis Territorial Consistency Plan 2030 Danube-Iller Region: Prospects to 2030 2030 Crete 2025 2025 Amsterdam 2040 2040 BINSAL, Beira Interior Norte - Provincia de Salamanca Long term Burgos Strategic Plan 2020 2020 Ashford Borough Council\u2019s Local Plan to 2030 2030 Scotland 2030 2030 Wales\u2019 Public Services 2025 2025 For 4 out of 10 territorial foresights examined, 2030 is the time horizon. Taking into consideration the starting date of these foresights, 20 years are anticipated. The most remote horizons concern cases focused on infrastructures like \u201cAmsterdam 2040\u201d, and energy like \u201cDevelopment of Innsbruck\u2019s Holistic Energy Identity in 2050\u201d. 2020 and 2050 are very used time horizons in energy foresight because of the European energy objectives to 2020 and 2050. The time horizon of the foresight phase is different from the time horizon of the action plan, which in general does not extend beyond the length of the mandate of elected representatives. ",
        "9 f) Objectives of the Stakeholders Case Time horizon Development of Innsbruck\u2019s Holistic Energy Identity in 2050 Involving Past, Present and Future Activities As part of a broad stakeholder process, Active Innsbruck aims to lead to a Smart Energy Vision 2050, a Roadmap 2020 and Beyond derived from this, and an Action Plan 2012-2015. Caen-Metropolis Territorial Consistency Plan The objective of the Syndicat mixte Caen- M\u00e9tropole is on the one hand to adopt a territory project setting out Caen-Metropolis\u2019 ambitions both at national and European level, and on the other hand to coordinate sectoral policies with regard to urban and transportation planning, housing, economic development and commercial installations. Danube-Iller Region: Prospects to 2030 The objective of the Danube-Iller association is to find a successful positioning in the long run for their region, in a context of competition with the metropolitan regions of Munich (located in Bavaria) and of Stuttgart (located in Baden- W\u00fcrttemberg). The study must lead to recommendations allowing to shape a positive future for the regional policy and development. Crete 2025 The main objective is the development of traditional food and agricultural biotechnology products in a way that will enhance the overall Cretan economy and make it a reference point in research, education and policy making in the industry of food and agricultural biotechnology products in Southeast Mediterranean. Amsterdam 2040 The main objective is to provide the basis for the city\u2019s investment agenda. The main goal is the transformation of Amsterdam into a metropolis that will be economically strong, sustainable and still attractive and accessible for newcomers. BINSAL, Beira Interior Norte - Provincia de Salamanca Promote and stimulate an institutional structure of lasting cross-border cooperation between the project partners, which allows a knowledge generation channel. Burgos Strategic Plan 2020 The objective of the process is the elaboration of the strategic plan in the horizon 2020. This way, the new Plan 2020 aims to promote the enhancement of resources, job creation and internationalization in Burgos through the articulation of nine strategic lines. These strategies can be translated in several initiatives for the short term, focusing on different domains. Ashford Borough Council\u2019s Local Plan to 2030 This project is the review process of the previous Ashford Core Strategy. This review is seeking to understand and gather views upon the economic growth potential of the Borough over the next 20 years and the consequences of this in terms of future planning. The Council\u2019s Cabinet has made clear its intention that the future development strategy for the Borough should emphasize economic development and the creation of jobs. Scotland 2030 To consider the possible forms of sustainable communities in Scotland by 2030. In this analysis the definition of sustainability is broad including ",
        "10 costs of transport, telecommunications, energy, water and demographic evolution. Wales\u2019 Public Services 2025 Wales Public Services 2025 is a one-off programme aiming to engage politicians (of all parties), public service professionals and workforce (from all sectors), academia, business and civil society in exploring ways forward for public services in Wales. In the cases analysed, the objectives of the stakeholders is either an objective of local or regional development, or an objective of sectoral development. The first objective corresponds better to the purpose of territorial foresight, but transversal sectors such as energy or leading sectors such as agrifood in \u201cCrete 2025\u201d can also require a systemic approach. Seven cases respond to an objective of local or regional development: \u2014 \u201cCaen-Metropolis Territorial Consistency Plan\u201d, \u2014 \u201cDanube-Iller Region: Prospects to 2030\u201d, \u2014 \u201cAmsterdam 2040\u201d, \u2014 \u201cBINSAL, Beira Interior Norte - Provincia de Salamanca\u201d, \u2014 \u201cBurgos Strategic Plan 2020\u201d, \u2014 \u201cAshford Borough Council\u2019s Local Plan to 2030\u201d, \u2014 \u201cScotland 2030\u201d For Caen-Metropolis, a local level of governance uses a planning document imposed by the national State as an opportunity to define its own strategy and its positioning. Three cases respond to an objective of sectoral development: \u2014 \u201cDevelopment of Innsbruck\u2019s Holistic Energy Identity in 2050 Involving Past, Present and Future Activities\u201d, \u2014 \u201cCrete 2025\u201d, \u2014 \u201cWales\u2019 Public Services 2025\u201d. g) Methods Case Methods Development of Innsbruck\u2019s Holistic Energy Identity in 2050 Involving Past, Present and Future Activities \u2022 Normative foresight \u2022 Mix of experts\u2019 foresight and participatory foresight according to the step of the process \u2022 Quantitative foresight \u2022 Thematic foresight (transversal theme) \u2022 Vision / Roadmap / Action plan Caen-Metropolis Territorial Consistency Plan \u2022 Exploratory foresight for two themes (demography and distribution of development in space \u2022 Mix of experts\u2019 foresight and participatory foresight according to the step of the process \u2022 Qualitative and quantitative foresight \u2022 Systemic foresight \u2022 Scenarios / Vision / Legal requirements Danube-Iller Region: Prospects to 2030 \u2022 Identification of trends and analysis of their impact \u2022 Participation limited to local decision makers, administrative and political institutions due to the complexity of the study ",

Demography is a major topic in territories. Caen-Metropolis is facing a decreasing population growth; the population in the Danube-Iller region should stagnate by 2025 while the metropolitan area of Amsterdam is home to an increasing urban population and the Ashford Borough has a fast-growing population. Demography can be linked to qualifications like in the \u201cCrete 2025\u201d where there is an emigration of the current research staff, or to jobs growth and housing like in \u201cAshford Borough Council\u2019s Local Plan to 2030\u201d. The themes around sustainability like energy, mobility, housing are pervasive, in particular in \u201cDevelopment of Innsbruck\u2019s Holistic Energy Identity in 2050 Involving Past, Present and Future Activities\u201d, \u201cAmsterdam 2040\u201d, \u201cBurgos Strategic Plan 2020\u201d, \u201cScotland 2030\u201d, or \u201cWales\u2019 Public Services 2025\u201d. Governance is central in some exercises like \u201cBINSAL, Beira Interior Norte - Provincia de Salamanca\u201d that is a cross-border region between Spain and Portugal, like \u201cDanube-Iller Region: Prospects to 2030\u201d that is another cross-border region but within Germany between two L\u00e4nder , or like \u201cScotland 2030\u201d within the United Kingdom. i) Main recommendations The foresight exercises analysed lead to the formulation of recommendations or to a strategy. Four out of the ten cases should lead to action: implementation of the recommendations into action plans or legally binding requirements. But in some cases (\u201cCrete 2025\u201d, \u201cBINSAL\u201d, \u201cWales\u2019Public Services 2025\u201d), territorial foresight allows territories to reflect upon themselves, which can be considered as a sign of their rise in power in a decentralised context throughout the European Union. The one-track thinking is present in a large part of recommendations: \u2014 To give the priority to other means of transportation than cars (\u201cCaen- Metropolis Territorial Consistency Plan\u201d) ",
        "14 \u2014 To give the priority to development poles (\u201cCaen-Metropolis Territorial Consistency Plan\u201d) \u2014 To strengthen rural areas (\u201cDanube-Iller Region: Prospects to 2030\u201d) \u2014 To position oneself in the competition between regions (\u201cCaen-Metropolis Territorial Consistency Plan\u201d compared to Greater Paris and the metropolitan region of Le Havre and Rouen; \u201cDanube-Iller Region: Prospects to 2030\u201d compared to the metropolitan regions of Munich and of Stuttgart) \u2014 To create a local marketing (\u201cDanube-Iller Region: Prospects to 2030\u201d, \u201cCrete 2025\u201d) \u2014 To develop networks between economic stakeholders (\u201cDanube-Iller Region: Prospects to 2030\u201d, \u201cBINSAL\u201d; or between research stakeholders (\u201cCrete 2025\u201d) \u2014 To increase densification (\u201cAmsterdam 2040\u201d) \u2014 To protect green spaces (\u201cAmsterdam 2040\u201d) \u2014 To invest in the renewable energy sector (\u201cScotland 2030\u201d) Nevertheless, in each territory, their combination is specific. And often, it is up to territories to find innovative solutions for their implementation. The room for manoeuvre of territories is sometimes narrow on major trends like metropolisation or depopulation of rural areas. Some territories foresee a monitoring of the implementation of the recommendations in order to evaluate their effects and impacts. j) Connection with EU policies and strategies The following EU policies and strategies are expressly mentioned: \u2014 The objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy, and in particular the climate and energy package and its 20-20-20 targets (\u201cCaen-Metropolis Territorial Consistency Plan\u201d, \u201cBINSAL\u201d, \u201cBurgos Strategic Plan 2020\u201d) \u2014 The principles of the Leipzig Charter on Sustainable European Cities (\u201cCaen- Metropolis Territorial Consistency Plan\u201d, \u201cAmsterdam 2040\u201d) \u2014 The Lisbon Strategy (\u201cDanube-Iller Region: Prospects to 2030\u201d) \u2014 The European Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET-Plan) establishing an energy technology policy for Europe (\u201cDevelopment of Innsbruck\u2019s Holistic Energy Identity in 2050 Involving Past, Present and Future Activities\u201d) In addition, the Danube-Iller Region wants to have a regional representative to the EU institutions to assert one\u2019s interest, to gain visibility, to establish contacts, to integrate networks, and to get information and European funding. It is worth mentioning as it is the first time that such a will is expressed since we monitor territorial foresight exercises for the Committee of the Regions. In \u201cCrete 2025\u201d, the need to exploit more efficiently the National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF), which is the reference document for the programming of European Funds at national level for the 2007-2013 period, is expressed. The exercise \u201cBINSAL, Beira Interior Norte - Provincia de Salamanca\u201d is funded by the ERDF (European Regional Development Fund) in the framework of the \u201cOperational Programme for Cross-border Cooperation: Spain \u2013 Portugal, 2007-2013\u201d (POCTEP), ",
        "15 under the \u201cCompetitiveness and Employment\u201d line, in accordance with the Lisbon Strategy objectives. Even if they are not explicit, links with the Europe 2020 Strategy can be found in education (\u201cScotland 2030\u201d), employment (\u201cAshford Borough Council\u2019s Local Plan to 2030\u201d), R&D (\u201cBurgos Strategic Plan 2020\u201d). k) Impact of the crisis Case 2008 financial and economic crisis Development of Innsbruck\u2019s Holistic Energy Identity in 2050 Involving Past, Present and Future Activities Not mentioned Caen-Metropolis Territorial Consistency Plan Not mentioned Danube-Iller Region: Prospects to 2030 The first works on the study began in 2007, so the financial crisis was just starting. Together with several Professors from Ulm University the topic of financial crisis was discussed intensively. As conclusion, assumptions on the upcoming crisis were not integrated into the study, not knowing how/when/or if at all, these effects will have had an impact. Even more, as the Danube-Iller region does not highly depend on the international financial sector, but on medium sized businesses within the production sector, the financial crisis was not to be expected to have a very big impact. Crete 2025 Not mentioned Amsterdam 2040 The impact of the crisis is not apparent in the Amsterdam plan, but one can translate the division of the implementation agenda into two categories (the plans that can be realized over the coming decade and those that can be realized thereafter) as an impact of the crisis. BINSAL, Beira Interior Norte - Provincia de Salamanca The economic crisis has not been widely considered in this foresight process, only slightly during the SWOT analysis phase of the scenario process and the interviews with the stakeholders. Burgos Strategic Plan 2020 The new current situation, motivated by the economic crisis is the main starting point of this process; in fact, this situation, specially negative and deep in Spain, is one of the challenges that the new Strategic Plan 2020 must face. Overcoming this crisis and improving the competitive situation of the city of Burgos is essential for its future in the horizon 2020. Ashford Borough Council\u2019s Local Plan to 2030 The economic crisis is considered within the macro-economic risks considered, both for the UK and Europe and the Eurozone within the process. Its effects and impacts on the market competition and market pressures are explicitly mentioned and considered. Scotland 2030 The financial and economic crisis is taken into consideration into the first scenario (low public spending) and into the second scenario (banking crisis, liquidity crisis). Wales\u2019 Public Services 2025 Not mentioned ",
        "16 The impact of the crisis is either considered in the action plans (\u201cAmsterdam 2040\u201d) or in the foresight itself (\u201cAshford Borough Council\u2019s Local Plan to 2030\u201d, \u201cScotland 2030\u201d). In the Burgos case, the crisis is at the origin of the revision of the strategic plan. For \u201cCrete 2025\u201d, the exercise is older than the crisis. l) Assessment (strengths and limits) As experienced in the previous reports, identifying territorial foresight exercises remains a challenge as they are local or regional initiatives intended to be used primarily within territories. The strengths and limits vary according to the cases. The ten cases are visible on the Internet and most initiatives implement a five-body governance comprising 1) the State, 2) local and regional authorities and elected officials, 3) economic players (employer\u2019s unions and industry representatives), 4) social players, 5) associations and experts. The weight of experts is heavier when the foresight deals with a technical issue (energy or technology foresight) while the weight of elected officials increases when the stake of the foresight is to define a territory project. In processes with an exploratory foresight phase, scenarios can be more creative integrating ruptures, like the collapse of international trade in \u201cScotland 2030\u201d as the scenarios were built by master students. But in general, they remain classic like in \u201cCaen-Metropolis Territorial Consistency Plan\u201d, in which they are the result of the work of elected representatives. But the lack of quantitative objectives in \u201cScotland 2030\u201d puts in question its possible link with action, and its practical implementation. In \u201cAshford Borough Council\u2019s Local Plan to 2030\u201d, scenarios are the combination of forecasts derived from a model. The strategic significance of an energy foresight like \u201cDevelopment of Innsbruck\u2019s Holistic Energy Identity in 2050 Involving Past, Present and Future Activities\u201d is weaker than in cases in which a desirable future is chosen among possible future like in \u201cBINSAL, Beira Interior Norte - Provincia de Salamanca\u201d, as the vision for Innsbruck in 2050 must correspond to quantitative and dated targets set by upper levels of governance. Nevertheless, it is closer to action and goes up to the definition of a roadmap and an action plan. It is not always possible to know if other foresight studies undertaken at upper levels of governance were used during the exercise. In \u201cBurgos Strategic Plan 2020\u201d, the report Megatrends: Tailwinds for Growth in a Low-Growth Environment published by the from the Boston Consulting Group in 2010 was used, while in \u201cDanube-Iller Region: Prospects to 2030\u201d the following reports published by Prognos were used: Deutschland Report 2035 , the World Report 2035 , the Zukunftsatlas Regionen . In \u201cCrete 2025\u201d, the foresight is based on several studies funded by the European Commission, of general scope like the Foresight and the Transition to Regional Knowledge-Based Economies published in 2004 in the framework of the Blueprints for Foresight Actions in the Regions project, which in particular provides a synopsis of the global trends; or thematic like EU Agri-Food Industries & Rural Economies by 2025 \u2013 Towards a Knowledge Bio-Economy \u2013 Research & Knowledge-Transfer Systems published in 2006. In addition, most exercises are based on forecasts from ",
        "17 upper level of governance like Der demografische Wandel in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. Herausforderungen und Chancen published by the Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg region in 2009 and used in \u201cDanube-Iller Region: Prospects to 2030\u201d. The duration of some exercises going beyond two years like \u201cCaen-Metropolis Territorial Consistency Plan\u201d or \u201cDanube-Iller Region: Prospects to 2030\u201d, based on a significant work on data, deserves to be emphasized. The absence of a European database gathering territorial foresight exercises and capitalising this information leads to the loss of critical information. ",
        "18 4. Trend discussion room According to the previous report 2 commissioned by the CoR, linking territorial foresight exercises, main trends and strategic domains would call for the establishment of \u201ctrend discussion room\u201d at the junction of LRAs and major EU policy-making actors. The main functions of this arena would be: \u2022 to exchange and disseminate information on global major and emerging trends; \u2022 to ensure a common understanding of the direction and intensity of these trends and, therefore, of their relative importance; \u2022 to develop a shared list of strategic domains that could serve as a basis for relevant and agreed policy instruments and responses. This third report can be used to deepen the thinking initiated on the development of a trend discussion room, which should part of the foresight platform of the Committee of the Regions in preparation. We would suggest, as an initial stage, to consider the issue of the scale of governance. In our view, and this is open to discussion, LRAs\u2019 foresights tend to develop information which is relevant for any type of trend and topic. What makes a distinction is the nature of the response developed, which is different according to the scale considered. For instance, it would be interesting to demonstrate what could be done from a micro level \u2013 urban center oriented perspective. A similar reasoning can be applied for the agglomeration level, the regional level and, possibly, some macro- category including inputs from technological foresights. One option is therefore to organize an exchange and learning process starting from some global trends, for instance, ageing or mobility, and to show how, in different types of territorial contexts (small city, urban centre / meso-level of the urban region / regional level / private and technological actors), foresights exercises bring some useful information, valid for all and some specific responses, valid in similar types of contexts. A new sorting of the foresight exercises analysed so far in our previous works could be initiated and scrutinized according to this reading grid: 1.which lesson or good practice does this case provide that would be useful for all in terms of, e.g. mobility => consolidation of the trend, validation or discussion about the issues, what is at stake? 2. what is valid for this scale and context of governance which would not be valid for other contexts? => evidencing and discussion about good practices, useful policy responses. 2 Report CDR/CDP/49/2010 \u201cAn Initial Assessment of Territorial Forward Planning/Foresight Projects in the European Union.

Several studies as well as environmental and urban development plans prepared in the previous years provide evidence. The most recent step in this direction was formalised through the \u201cEnergy Development Plan\u201d for Innsbruck (IEP) in the years 2008-2010, including a so called \u201cVorbildszenario\u201d (model scenario) for heat supply in the building (residential and commercial) sector by 2025. Following the same direction, the project Active Innsbruck was initiated to tackle energy issues not yet explicitly addressed in the Energy Development Plan (such as transport and electricity generation) and to prepare a concrete action plan. The project examines technical and architectural concepts to increase the energy efficiency of buildings (thermal renovation, window concepts). There is also a search for \u201cintelligent\u201d connections between buildings and the electricity grid. Also under ",
        "23 focus are the possible uses for renewable energy production in buildings and facades. OBJECTIVES OF THE STAKEHOLDERS As part of a broad stakeholder process, Active Innsbruck aims to lead to a Smart Energy Vision 2050, a Roadmap 2020 and Beyond derived from this, and an Action Plan 2012-2015. METHOD This process defines the Smart Energy Vision 2020 / 2050, the Roadmap 2012-2025 and Action Plan 2012-2015. Vision developed until 2020 / 2050 The vision of a holistic energy identity for 2050 is made possible when considering the urban system in its entire complexity, including all interactions between the aspects energy, buildings, supply and disposal networks, mobility, information and the human factor. All stakeholders were invited to participate in the development of a long-term qualitative energy vision for the city of Innsbruck while considering the objectives defined in the IEP for 2025. This was done during FORUM 1 which took place on September 26 th , 2011. About 80 experts und citizens contributed to the process in answering the questions \u201cHow should the city look like in 2050?\u201d and \u201cHow can I contribute in this development?\u201d. The emerging vision focused around the topic of \u201cliving in a post-fossil society\u201d, in a city characterized by high quality of life, careful resource handling, diversity in landscape and society, yet simplicity with regard to technology systems. These qualities are reflected in the topics mobility, energy and buildings. As its unique feature, the city aims to position itself as a centre for research and education in energy innovation and climate adaptation in the Alps. This vision is also illustrated by a figure showing the desired qualities of Innsbruck 2050. Roadmap 2025 The \u201cmodel scenario\u201d proposed in the IEP was broadened to include transport and electricity generation topics. Also, a roadmap was developed including both technological and non-technological aspects. The roadmap covers a time frame between 2012 and 2025 and includes measures and projects in the categories \u201cflagship projects\u201d, \u201ccommunication\u201d and \u201cframework conditions\u201d for each topic. This roadmap describes the necessary steps towards Smart City Innsbruck 2050, but is still to be considered as non-binding recommendation and basis for discussion. In-depth discussions took place during two expert working group meetings on the topics of buildings (residential and commercial use), public buildings and facilities, renewable energy / energy networks and mobility. The thematic classification was defined in a way to be most suitable to the available structures of the IEP. The discussions were followed by an assessment of the proposed measures and projects and a simplified risk analysis in order to set up a basis for selecting measures and projects (action plan). Action Plan for 2012-15 The action plan 2012-2015 mainly consists of detailed presentations of selected flagship projects. Each of them is described in terms of specific targets, responsibilities, implementation time frame, financing concept and contribution towards achieving the overall targets. The projects ready for implementation have detailed financing plans since they have already been initiated prior to the Smart City project. Other projects are still in the conceptual or feasibility study phase. The action plan and selected measures and projects were presented and discussed with stakeholders at FORUM 2 which took place on February 28 th , 2012. TOPICS ADDRESSED The following contents have been analyzed: \u2022 Buildings \u2022 Energy networks \u2022 Other urban supply and disposal systems \u2022 Mobility \u2022 Communication and information \u2022 City and regional systems ",
        "24 MAIN RECOMMENDATIONS The roadmap towards 2050 includes mainly recommendations; it must be considered as non-binding recommendations and basis for discussion. IF ACTION PLAN: INDICATORS AND GOVERNANCE (WHO? HOW?) The action plan includes specific targets, responsibilities, implementation time frame, financing concept and contribution, so it can be more easily monitored. CONNECTION WITH EU POLICIES AND STRATEGIES This process aims at specific targets, in accordance with European strategies, mainly as for sustainable and smart growth, with special focus on sustainability and resource efficiency. The exercise is clearly linked to the Europe 2020 Strategy, its EU 20-20-20 targets and the European Commission\u00b4s \u201cStrategic Energy Technology Plan\u201d (\u201cSET Plan\u201d). IMPACT OF THE CRISIS No explicit link with the financial crises of 2008 and 2011 are being mentioned by the study. ASSESSMENT (STRENGTHS AND LIMITS) Some of the strengths of the project: \u2022 Continuation of project work with core team and steering committee \u2022 Detailed description of concrete measures by implementation teams in the fields \u201cincentives\u201d and \u201cinformation and awareness rising\u201d (as a next step) \u2022 Realisation of first flagship projects according to action plan (as a next step) \u2022 High level of participation; expert working groups meetings.

This SCoT demarche was selected by the French Ministry of Sustainable Development and benefited from its methodological and financial support as a \u201cSCoT \u2013 Grenelle\u201d. According to the Grenelle 1 law (Grenelle 1, 2009) and the Grenelle 2 law (Grenelle 2, 2010), SCoTs must develop the sustainable approach in the territorial planning documents. This territory was selected because it proposed an experimentation on two themes: \u2022 the integration of the green and blue belt into the SCoT (promotion of biodiversity) \u2022 the articulation of the Climate energy plan (PCET) with the SCoT (less land consumption, fight against climate change through a new transport policy and a new housing policy).

OBJECTIVES OF THE STAKEHOLDERS The objective of the Syndicat mixte Caen-M\u00e9tropole is on the one hand to adopt a territory project setting out Caen-Metropolis\u2019 ambitions both at national and European level, and on the other hand to coordinate sectoral policies with regard to urban and transportation planning, housing, economic development and commercial installations. A SCoT is a land planning document composed of a PADD and a DOG. The PADD lays down the guidelines for social and economic development, the environment and urbanism with a time horizon of 15 to 20 years. It is the main document of the SCoT, as it constitutes the political project, the vision and the strategy for the territory. The DOG sets out the rules and quantitative objectives, which must be respected by the municipalities. SCoTs were created in France by the SRU (Solidarit\u00e9 et Renouvellement Urbains) law in 2000, which introduced sustainable development into national legislation, and fostered strategic planning at local level. METHOD This SCoT is an experimental project taking into account the objectives of the Grenelle 1 and 2 laws. Compared to a classic SCoT, greater emphasis is placed on the promotion of biodiversity and the fight against climate change. The foresight exercise, which took place during the first, the second and the third step of the process, was participatory and aimed to build a common vision of the future of the territory. During the construction of the diagnosis, several possible futures were examined; the desirable future (the vision) was then chosen and presented in the PADD. The PADD and the DOG must allow to find alternatives to some dynamics of the \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d scenario. The construction of the shared diagnosis was the most participatory step. Six workshops were organised for each of the four following themes: \u2022 Environment and spatial planning \u2022 Mobility and commuting \u2022 Metropolitan economic development \u2022 Housing, services and equipments For each workshop, the urban planning agency gave main data in the beginning. External speakers were invited. A broad place to debate was left. The minutes and the presentations were put online the following month. It allowed to define dynamics and challenges for the territory. On the basis of this diagnosis, four exploratory scenarios were elaborated for demography and four exploratory scenarios were built for the distribution of the development in space, during meetings between elected representatives. The choice of the desirable scenario (the PADD) among the possible scenarios was guided by the three fundamental objectives defined in 2004, when it was decided to launch a SCoT process: \u2022 To improve the visibility of Caen in France and in the North Western Europe. \u2022 To give an impulsion to a new development model in line with the Grenelle laws. ",
        "27 \u2022 To elaborate an easily applicable SCoT so that it constitutes a project really shared. TOPICS ADDRESSED The topics addressed are demography, urban and transportation planning, housing, economic development and commercial installations; their interactions and their environmental impact. The ambition of the process is to lead to a territory project and to adopt a positioning with regard to the Greater Paris project, as, in the Greater Paris, project some parts of the Normandy are integrated into Greater Paris. Caen Metropolis has numerous assets: \u2022 It is the major urban centre in the Lower Normandy region. \u2022 Its agriculture that represents 73% of its territory, is highly productive. \u2022 It is located on the European axis between the UK and Spain, along the Channel, and near the two world-cities, Paris and London. \u2022 Its quality of life is high thanks to its equipments, its coastline of 20 km, its numerous historic monuments... \u2022 Except from the train, its means of transportation are efficient. And there is a hope that a new railway line between Paris and the Normandy could be created. \u2022 Due to a de-industrialization crisis, the economy becomes tertiary and is transformed into a knowledge-based economy. It is dynamic and creates jobs, in particular in the city of Caen. \u2022 It is a major administrative and commercial centre in the region. \u2022 The tourism activity could be developed. But some trends call for a new development model: \u2022 The population growth rate decreases and the growth is much stronger in peri-urban areas than downtown. \u2022 New jobs are created in the agglomeration, but the number of new buildings in the agglomeration is diminishing and housing is more and more dispersed. In consequence, the territory is more and more dependent on cars. \u2022 There is a degradation in water quality due to agriculture and soil sealing. \u2022 The territory \u2014 in particular transports, the residential/tertiary sector and agriculture \u2014 is dependent on fossil fuels. Thus, the territory is subject to socio-economic risks. That has also negative effects on the level of greenhouse gas emissions. \u2022 The territory is vulnerable to flooding. MAIN RECOMMENDATIONS The strategy set out in the PADD, is based on one ambition: that Caen-Metropolis sustains its position in the North Western Europe. This position will itself be based on: \u2022 economic competitiveness as a precondition \u2022 eco-responsibility \u2022 urban hospitality and quality of life The strategy aims to: \u2022 give the priority to other means of transportation than cars \u2022 give the priority to development poles \u2022 support an architectural and urban ambition throughout the territory IF ACTION PLAN: INDICATORS AND GOVERNANCE (WHO? HOW?) The DOG, which is the translation of the vision of the PADD into localised quantitative objectives, is not an action plan. But it contains legal requirements with which municipalities must comply. In particular, The DOG foresees: \u2022 To reduce the pace of the consumption of space - 25%, that is a maximum of 3,000 hectares for urbanisation by 20 years, among which 1,800 mainly for housing \u2022 To produce more densely populated and socially mixed spaces A minimum density for any operation on a land of more than 1 hectare (between 20 and 50 dwellings/ha) \u2022 To organise social diversity A minimum proportion of social housing for any operation on a land of more than 1 hectare (20 or 25%) \u2022 To diversify urban forms A minimum proportion of collective or intermediate housing in new buildings (from ",
        "28 40% to 80%) Tools have been implemented to follow up on the one hand if the requirements of the SCoT were compatible with other urbanism documents, and on the other hand how the requirements of the SCoT are taken into consideration by the municipalities. An analysis grid was defined to check the compatibility with the other urbanism documents. To contribute to the good understanding and to the implementation of the requirements of the SCoT by elected representatives, consultancy firms and land use planners, test municipalities have been selected to raise concrete cases subject to interpretation. In addition several documents have been published: \u2022 a booklet based on the typology of the municipalities \u2022 information sheets on the guidelines of the SCoT \u2022 a guide on the a good practices of land planning in the spirit of the SCoT An interactive map will be soon available on the SCoT website: by clicking on a municipality, the guidelines applying to the municipality, will appear. CONNECTION WITH EU POLICIES AND STRATEGIES Local elected representatives want to give to the SCoT an external consistency from the local to the world level. For the European level, the following texts are taken into account: \u2022 the objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy \u2022 the principles of the Leipzig Charter on Sustainable European Cities complemented by those of the Marseille Statement by the ministers in charge of urban development IMPACT OF THE CRISIS The 2008 economic and financial crisis is not mentioned in the documents analysed. But the deindustrialization crisis that the metropolis has faced for the last 30 years is mentioned. ASSESSMENT (STRENGTHS AND LIMITS) Visibility and Transparency of the entire process on the website. External context, be it regional, national or European, is integrated in the reflection and in the strategy. The will to articulate the SCoT Caen M\u00e9tropole with other forward- looking documents such as the PCET or the other SCoTs in the region, guides the demarche. The articulation between the SCoT Caen M\u00e9tropole and the PCET is realised for two themes: mobility and buildings. This SCoT is both a territorial marketing instrument and a strategy based on a significant work on data. ",

That expertise was edited by the Ministry of Economics Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and the Ministy of Land Development and Environment Bavaria, co-authored by Augsburg University and the Danube-Iller region ( Regionalverband Donau-Iller ). It dealt with the effects of the Science City being built in the late 80s, researching the potential of further settlements, cooperations between industry and science and regional development. Unfortunately it covered only the greater area of Ulm/Neu-Ulm, but not the whole Region Danube-Iller. Keeping in mind the outputs of the 1994 study, the regional assembly of the Danube- Iller region initiated the study Region Donau-Iller: Perspektive 2030 in November 2007. In November 2008, the consulting firm Prognos in cooperation with Ulm university were chosen to carry out the study. The results of the study must be the basis for the update of the regional plans. ",
        "30 OBJECTIVES OF THE STAKEHOLDERS The objective of the Danube-Iller association is to find a successful positioning in the long run for their region, in a context of competition with the metropolitan regions of Munich (located in Bavaria) and of Stuttgart (located in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg). The study must lead to recommendations allowing to shape a positive future for the regional policy and development. METHOD The process took place in 3 steps: Step 1 \u2013 Collection of data and analysis Step 2 \u2013 Options, potentials, development opportunities Step 3 \u2013 Recommendations for action The first step was organised around seven themes related to the competencies of the municipalities and of the region: \u2022 Economy (macro and micro) \u2022 Demography \u2022 Education and training \u2022 Research and development \u2022 Health service \u2022 Infrastructures \u2022 Culture, leisure, quality of life The information and analyses on these themes come from: \u2022 A collection of public and private statistical data on the region, its Kreise and its independent cities. The data on the region were compared with the data on Baden- W\u00fcrttemberg, Bavaria, Germany and the metropolitan regions of Stuttgart, Munich and Rhein-Neckar. In addition time series analysis was conducted and existing population prospects were used. \u2022 An analysis of existing studies. \u2022 Experts\u2019 interviews. \u2022 An online survey of companies in the region. The second step was based on a SWOT analysis that allowed to identify the main trends and to analyse their impact on the region. In the third step, the results of the work on the recommendations were completed by four workshops gathering decision makers from the region so that the practicability of the recommendations could be checked. It was also a way to disseminate the results of the study. TOPICS ADDRESSED After a general comparison of the Danube-Iller region with the metropolitan regions of Munich, Stuttgart and Rhein-Neckar, each of the seven themes (Economy / Demography / Education and training / Research and development / Health service / Infrastructures / Culture, leisure, quality of life) is examined: \u2022 Current state in the Danube-Iller region \u2022 Comparison with the three neighbouring metropolitan regions \u2022 Trends and prospects to 2030 \u2022 Consequences of the trends and prospects To outline prospects to 2030, developments that are highly expected to occur in near future were highlighted. One of those assumptions was the demographic development being integrated in several chapters of the study, as by 2025 there should be a stagnation of the population in the Danube-Iller region. As for economics, upcoming trends and expected developments were considered. The opportunities for the Danube-Iller region are the following: \u2022 Long-term growth in technology-intensive industry and knowledge-intensive services. \u2022 Better rail connections with Stuttgart (project Stuttgart 21) and electrification of rail lines in the south. \u2022 Growth prospects linked to better connections with the metropolitan region of ",
        "31 Stuttgart and to the extension of the transalpine long-distance network. \u2022 Opportunities for Ulm and Neu-Ulm as a location for meetings, congresses and big companies. \u2022 Potential for the economy and tourism activity thanks to Allg\u00e4u airport. \u2022 Potential for the economy and for science in renewable energies, energy storage and electro-mobility. And the identified threats are the following: \u2022 Growing shortage of skilled workforce in particular for the local technology-intensive and knowledge-intensive industry because of an insufficient supply of high-level education. \u2022 Better railway connections to Stuttgart (project Stuttgart 21) could increase the number of commuters going to Stuttgart. \u2022 Traditional sectors will suffer more from structural change. \u2022 Rural areas will suffer from a lack of services, a population decrease, and less public services. \u2022 Less attention from investors, the Federal and the State government and from the EU to a small, cross-border and \u201cnot metropolitan\u201d region. MAIN RECOMMENDATIONS The strategic recommendations for the future are: \u2022 To improve the Danube-Iller region positioning in the competition between regions by building this common strategy \u201cDanube-Iller region 2030\u201d, by exchanging more information, by becoming a regional pole, by having one representative to the EU institutions in Brussels. \u2022 For economic development and regional marketing, to network economic development activities and to create a local marketing for the entire Danube-Iller region. \u2022 For education and science, to extend the supply of colleges, to improve the cooperation between the university and colleges, to build non-university research facilities, to create an education network between schools, economy and science. \u2022 For infrastructures and demographic change, to have a quality initiative for health service (in particular in rural areas and small municipalities struck by demographic ageing), to create a regional rail system to link towns and the countryside, to have a strategy for retail trade, to have strategies to strengthen rural areas. IF ACTION PLAN: INDICATORS AND GOVERNANCE (WHO? HOW?) Above-mentioned recommendations were linked to the institutions responsible for their implementation. Among them, the actions to be undertaken by the Danube-Iller association are being implemented now, in particular: \u2022 A working group has been set up, in which the persons responsible for economic development in the administrative districts ( Landkreise ) are cooperating. Two events took place already, the next is scheduled within the next six months. \u2022 A cooperation between regional universities has been initiated. A first result is a common course guide to be published shortly. It will be part of a marketing strategy for better development of the potential of higher education in the Danube-Iller region. \u2022 A better public transport system is considered and a strategy for regional retail is under preparation. All the recommendations/actions are regularly controlled by the Danube-Iller association. If further actions need to be launched, they are proposed. CONNECTION WITH EU POLICIES AND STRATEGIES This territory wants to have a regional representative to the EU institutions to assert its interest. Thus, it will gain visibility, increase its weight in Brussels, establish contacts and networks, get information and European funding. For the economical strategy within the study, the basic \u2018guidelines\u2019 from the Lisbon Strategy were considered. The study aimed at the endogenous economic structure and checked it for future compatibility. In those ranges, in which potential threats were found, recommendations were elaborated. Doing so, the region can contribute to the Lisbon Strategy. ",
        "32 IMPACT OF THE CRISIS The first works on the study began in 2007, so the financial crisis was just starting. Together with several Professors from Ulm University the topic of financial crisis was discussed intensively. As conclusion, assumptions on the upcoming crisis were not integrated into the study, not knowing how/when/or if at all, these effects will have had an impact. Even more, as the Danube-Iller region does not highly depend on the international financial sector, but on medium sized businesses within the production sector, the financial crisis was not to be expected to have a very big impact. Nevertheless, unemployment grew in the Danube-Iller region in 2008 and 2009 even if the unemployment rates are always among the lowest in Germany. ASSESSMENT (STRENGTHS AND LIMITS) Significant work to collect and analyse data. Participation is limited. The main target group for this study was not the general public due to the complexity of the study. It aimed mainly at local decision makers, as well as administrative and political institutions. The study was actively disseminated to about a hundred mayors, delegates (all levels up to Europe), administrative authorities and economic representatives and to local financial institutions. This was accompanied by several presentations, even this year there was a presentation of the study. The part with the SWOT analysis is quite common among LRAs in Germany. But developing a strategy and recommendations along with implementations means a high effort over a long period of time (between 2 and 10 years depending on the topic) and is not seen very often. The main foresight studies utilized in this case, are the population forecasts of the Federal Statistical Office (Wiesbaden) and the Statistical Offices of the Federal State of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and Bavaria, in particular Der demografische Wandel in Baden- W\u00fcrttemberg. Herausforderungen und Chancen , Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg statistisches Landesamt, Reihe Statistische Analysen, 1/2009, 85 pages. Prognos AG is specialized in economic foresight studies for Germany, Europe and industrial countries. Their main basic reports are the Deutschland Report 2035 and the World Report 2035 . Basic information (extract in English, general in German) on their web page. Unfortunately the complete study results are not available to the public: http://www.prognos.com/English-Version.562.0.html The Prognos Zukunftsatlas Regionen is another main report: http://www.prognos.com/Zukunftsatlas-2010-Regionen.753.0.html Using and combining several socio-economic indicators in the status quo, the Zukunftsatlas determines the regional sustainability of approximately 400 administrative districts in Germany. In general, these specific main studies and the context information were incorporated into the survey Danube-Iller 2030 by the Prognos team. ",

The main advantages of Crete (compared to other Greek regions) are the universities and the research institutes, but the private sector does not interact with research and technology development programmes. The main aspects of Crete can be summarized as follows: Internal analysis strengths: -High skilled research staff. -Close relationships and good cooperation between research centres and universities. -Climate is appropriate for rural development. -International relationships. Internal Analysis weaknesses: -Absence of a central planning for the regional policy on agriculture, R&D and innovation. -Small number of firms that have no interest in R&D -Low level of entrepreneurship. -Small funding from the private sector for R&D. -Low level of foreign investments. -Great distance from the Central European markets. External Analysis strengths: -Geographic position that facilitates cooperation with South Eastern Europe, Middle East and North Africa. -Connection between the tourism and the food sector. -Increased interest in biotechnology and biomedical research. -Shift of consumer interest in organic products, which can be the base for innovation in specialized markets. -R&D in renewable energy and environmental R&D. ",
        "35 External analysis weaknesses: -Competition in tourism with neighbour countries. -Competition in agriculture with low-wage countries. -Bureaucracy The aforementioned analysis concludes that Crete achieves low levels of participation and networking, as well as research and innovation. Then follows the construction of 3 possible scenarios for Crete in 2025 Scenario 1: \u201cScientific and social division\u201d In this case unemployment reaches high levels and there is immigration of scientists. The main aspects of this first scenario are: -Isolation of research and education. Research comes mainly from universities and is concentrated into high-technology. -Low levels of private investment in innovation. SMEs do not hire scientific staff because scientists immigrate. -Slow growth in the Crete's key sectors (tourism, agriculture, constructions) due to high competition with lower-cost competitors. EU's strategy for environment has resulted in higher prices in these sectors. -Isolated research centres with no specified research area, neither agriculture, nor biotechnology. Research centres are not in the focus of attention in Crete since there are every day\u2019s problems that need to be solved. Scenario 2: Innovation in the participation of private sector Public sector's and private firms' participation that is geared to the needs of the local sectors. It broadens the number of centres and contains private funds for research. Main aspects: -Research activity focuses on local needs. There are leader SMEs in tourism, agriculture, low and medium scale technological applications. The new sectors on which the public research concentrates on are: renewable energy, communications, organic farming etc. -The government gives incentives to private sector, via financial instruments targeting at investment in research. There are public research centres that plan the research policy and in this way they can understand better the needs of each sector. -There are leader enterprises because of the research that has updated their products and procedures. In parallel, there are no education programmes for the employees and thus new experienced, high-skilled staff needs to be hired from Athens or developed EU countries. -Only high-technology spin-offs that are connected with universities and research centres are supported and the gap between \u201cwell-informed\u201d groups and the rest of the population widens. This causes migration flows for the Cretans that do not have a high quality education background. Scenario 3: \u201cInnovative and cohesive society\u201d This scenario promotes networks. Integration of regional authorities, private sector, academic institutes, Research and Technological Development centres and citizens in order to form a regional strategy that focuses on Crete's advantages and promotes education and innovative entrepreneurship. The main elements of the 3 rd scenario can be summarized as follows: -Focus on education. Universities are linked with enterprises in order to cover the technology transfer gap. There is an active link between society and technology. ",
        "36 -Spin-offs. There are the required infrastructure and the necessary programmes that allow young people to develop their ideas in new enterprises. Business incubators and other actions that support enterprises in their first steps. Provision of the proper space for the creation of Scientific Parks. -Development of new R&TD programmes for the surveillance of the local needs. Banks finance technological updating procedures and there are periodic scientific reports on technological issues. -The research activities support low and medium level technology. In cooperation with South East Europe, Middle East and North African countries, Crete starts the building of infrastructure for high technology. -The research policy is based not only on high technology that will provide long-term development and innovation, but also on low and medium level technology that supports local firms. OBJECTIVES OF THE STAKEHOLDERS The main objective is the development of traditional food and agricultural biotechnology products in a way that will enhance the overall Cretan economy and make it a reference point in research, education and policy making in the industry of food and agricultural biotechnology products in Southeast Mediterranean. METHOD The workshop for shaping scenarios held in Crete on 8 of July 2008 and 27 persons (mainly from the academic and research area) participated. At first there was a presentation of the current situation in Crete and of the 3 scenarios about Crete in 2025. The participants were divided in 3 groups: a)academicians and researchers, b)representatives of the public sector and c)representatives of entrepreneurship. Each of the 3 groups presented its proposals about the future of Crete in 2025.The proposals were presented to all the participants, who voted the most desirables. Finally based on the voting results, the required actions for the achievement of the vision concluded. TOPICS ADDRESSED \u2022 Biotechnology and biomedical. \u2022 Technology transfer. \u2022 Traditional products. \u2022 Focus on both high-technology but also on medium- and low- level technology. \u2022 Networks and participation of SMEs, researchers and academicians, social partners and citizens. \u2022 R&D in the food sector. \u2022 Innovation MAIN RECOMMENDATIONS Crete should follow the path of traditional nutrition and products of agricultural biotechnology, increase the participation of SMEs and regional authorities, improve networks, research and seek innovation. For the achievement of the \u201cvision\u201d for Crete in 2025, it is necessary to realize the following: -The creation of a new network of entities that will lead to the establishment of a Bio-Food Intelligence Centre. o A Unit of Strategic Planning and Priorities. Coordination at a regional level, with regional authorities as key players, and the participation of academic and research institutes, business representatives, local government that will set measurable goals. o A centre for the development and promotion of Crete to the rest of Greece and abroad of the Cretan image, ",
        "37 \u201cBrand name Crete\u201d. o Networks of research laboratories, technology transfer organizations and the establishment of a common platform for actions. -A design centre for new products that will foster diversification of products and promote alternative uses for traditional products (e.g. pharmaceutical). Targeted funding through the establishment of an independent Regional Fund for Research and Development which will plan the priorities and will manage financing through simplified procedures. The target will be the sustainable development of the regions. -Education and Training (cid:131) Design of training and lifelong learning programmes for producers and industry professionals. -Promotion of the local particularities and traditions (cid:131) Promotion of the Cretan image in international fairs. (cid:131) Recording biodiversity. (cid:131) Recording Cretan cultural tradition. These will transform Crete into a balanced and sustainable region with a Bio-Food Intelligence Centre at the heart of scientific attention. IF ACTION PLAN: INDICATORS AND GOVERNANCE (WHO? HOW?) No action plan was adopted and no measures have been taken until now in the direction of the foresight recommendations. CONNECTION WITH EU POLICIES AND STRATEGIES The connections with the EU policies are not explicitly expressed, apart from the need to exploit more efficiently the National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF) allocations. The NSRF is the reference document for the programming of European Union Funds at national level for the 2007\u20132013 period. -The modernization of the educational system proposed in the \u201cCrete 2025\u201d project is in accordance with the EU's objective. The promotion of the training programmes and education at all levels and the link between universities and labour market is one the main goals set by the Europe 2020 guidelines. -The improvement of SMEs environment by the promotion of clusters and their internationalization can be found in both the \u201cCrete 2025\u201d project and the EU agenda. -The closer cooperation between the stakeholders is an EU objective that is also stated in the current project by the closer cooperation between academicians, researchers, SMEs, local and regional authorities. -Life-long learning is the target of both the EU agenda and the examined project. IMPACT OF THE CRISIS There are no explicit links with the crisis. ASSESSMENT (STRENGTHS AND LIMITS) Strengths: - Connection between tourism and the food sector that facilitates the food sector development and provides incentives for innovation . ",
        "38 High level in research and academic centres. -Crete is a \u201cfast follower\u201d that can, with the proper policies, adapt to the necessary environment for being a leader region in the South East Mediterranean. Limits: -There is no link between academic and research centres with the social partners. -Cretan enterprises are small and do not create networks in order to perform better and achieve higher funding. -Lack of incentives for attracting researchers and this results in the emigration of the current research staff. The use of scenarios is oriented on how Crete should invest on biotechnology and the absence of quantified indicators complicates the evaluation of the assessment. The economic crisis has redefined the investment priorities and the consumption patterns and as a result the recommendations of the exercise may be in need of review. Certain foresight studies were used by the Crete 2025. The \u201cForesight and the Transition to Regional Knowledge-Based Economies\u201d published in 2004 in the framework of Blueprints for Foresight Actions in the Regions funded by the European Commission, outlines the main thrusts of the EU policy developments and provides a synopsis of the global trends. \u201cEU Agri-Food Industries & Rural Economies by 2025 \u2013 Towards a Knowledge Bio Economy \u2013 Research & Knowledge Transfer Systems\u201d defines strategic research and knowledge-transfer systems required to build a knowledge-based bioeconomy. \u201cAgro \u2010 Food Industries & Rural Economies: Competitiveness & Sustainability \u2013 The Key Role of Knowledge\u201d(Downey 2005) links the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and other policy developments with the Europe\u2019s agrifood sector .

For the achievement of this vision, there are seven spatial tasks in the implementation agenda that will transform the city into a modern energy- efficient metropolis: 1. Densify. More intensive use of space will increase the customer base for amenities and will facilitate the management of energy and transportation. 2. Transform. The business parks will serve two functions: residential and business. 3. Public transportation on the regional scale. Extension of the metro line and more \u201cPark and Ride\u201d facilities around the A10 highway. 4. High-quality layout of public space. More space for cyclists and pedestrians, as well as increasing diversity and quality of the shops on the main road of the city and refurbishing the street-level frontages. 5. Invest in the recreational use of green space and water. 6. Converting to sustainable energy. The existing houses should be converted to more energy-efficient. Moreover an important step towards energy-efficiency is the collection of solar energy on the rooftops, construction of a closed heat- transfer system to transport residual heat and the installation of wind turbines. 7. Olympic Game Amsterdam 2028. The city of Amsterdam is capable of providing the required space for the Olympics, such as Olympic Stadium, Olympic Village and swimming accommodations. OBJECTIVES OF THE STAKEHOLDERS The main objective is to provide the basis for the city\u2019s investment agenda. The main goal is the transformation of Amsterdam into a metropolis that will be economically strong, sustainable and still attractive and accessible for newcomers. METHOD The realization of the structural vision lasted three years and passed through three main phases. First Phase - Reconnaissance. Expertise and ideas (2008-2009) The objective of this first step was to determine the important topics for the future of Amsterdam. A \u201cMemorandum of starting points\u201d consisted of the main points and trends for the spatial planning. Citizens, interest groups and the private sector discussed about the contents of this project, while the guiding framework was the \u201cDevelopment Scenario for the Amsterdam Metropolitan Area\u201d. The \u201cwithin 30 minutes\u201d campaign ",
        "40 stimulated people to participate more actively in the procedure. Second Phase - Integration into a well-balanced narrative (2009-2010) The aim of the second phase was to define a well-balanced project taking into consideration all the stakeholders. The citizens were consulted through the website \u201cwithin 30 minutes\u201d. The basis for this second phase was \u201cThe Pillars for Amsterdam\u2019s Spatial Development\u201d, which defines ten main points for the structural vision. It ended in January 2010 with the issue of the \u201cDraft Structural Vision for Amsterdam in 2040: Economically strong and sustainable\u201d. Third Phase - Ratification: Responding and moving the procedure forward (2010) A period of twelve weeks was given to everyone to express his opinion about the project. These opinions were answered by the Structural Vision\u2019s project managers in a \u201cMemorandum of Responses\u00bb. In October 2010, after the public consultations, the newly installed City Executive addressed the definite proposal for the Structural Plan. The Structural Vision was ratified by the City Council on 17 February 2011. TOPICS ADDRESSED \u2022 Green spaces and water \u2022 Energy-efficiency \u2022 Increasing urban population in the metropolitan area of Amsterdam \u2022 Public transportation MAIN RECOMMENDATIONS \u2022 Active participation by the citizens, interest groups, public sectors and organizations in the planning. \u2022 Intensification of land use. \u2022 Plans must satisfy the rules of law and be a result of mutual agreements between municipalities within the Amsterdam Metropolitan Area. \u2022 Structural plans have to respect the cultural heritage and the history of Amsterdam. \u2022 If the conditions change, the municipal Council can diverge from the plan. \u2022 The green spaces require robust protection. \u2022 Densification within the current city boundaries. IF ACTION PLAN: INDICATORS AND GOVERNANCE (WHO? HOW?) \u2022 The implementation agenda divides the plans into two categories: the ones that can be realized in the next decade and the ones that require longer time. \u2022 70000 additional dwellings with the required amenities such as schools, shops etc \u2022 Port-city project: 13000 to 19000 new dwellings in the section of the port that lies within the A10. \u2022 Hosting the Olympic Games of 2028 \u2022 Extra marinas on the Ij lake for recreational use. \u2022 Development in the area of Schiphol, Zuidas and the Southern flank. CONNECTION WITH EU POLICIES AND STRATEGIES The guidelines and the strategies described in this spatial plan are in accordance with the Leipzig Charter, such as the aim to improve the existing building stock and to promote energy-efficient methods. There are also explicit links between the Leipzig Charter and the objectives of traffic management, amelioration of the transport mode and cycling and pedestrian infrastructure. IMPACT OF THE CRISIS The impact of the crisis is not apparent in the Amsterdam plan, but one can translate the division of the implementation agenda into two categories (the plans that can be realized over the coming decade and those that can be realized thereafter) as an impact of the crisis. ASSESSMENT (STRENGTHS AND LIMITS) It has its roots on the \u201cDevelopment Scenario for the Amsterdam metropolitan area 2040\u201d, in which the municipalities underlined the need to transform the city of Amsterdam into a metropolis. In Amsterdam there are 4 major trends: \u2022 The roll-out of the city centre \u2022 The interweaving of the metropolitan landscape and the city \u2022 The rediscovery of the waterfront \u2022 The internationalization of the southern flank These trends promote a \u201cmetropolitan logic\u201d for the city of Amsterdam and they conform and forward the Structural Vision. Moreover, the public was actively involved in the planning of the Structural Vision. ",
        "41 One can assume that the active involvement means that the project has the acceptance of the public and as a result, the required policy measures that need to be taken for the attainment of the Vision will not raise complaints. Limits: \u2022 The pessimistic short-term perspectives due to the economic crisis are inconsistent with long-term planning. \u2022 The plan does not include short-term targets and this raises concerns on whether it is possible to implement and evaluate the project step-by-step.

This territory covers all stakeholders of the Province of Salamanca and Beira Interior Norte (Almeida, Celorica da Beira, Figueira de Castelo Rodrigo, Guarda, Manteigas, Meda, Pinhel, Sabugal, Trancoso). Its area is approximately 16,500 km\u00b2, with 460,000 inhabitants, of which 115,000 are Portuguese and 345,000 Spanish.

CP: 34002 \u2013 PALENCIA Tel: 979 710 626 Fax: 979 165 515 http://www.captbinsal.com/ SUMMARY OF THE PROCESS Salamanca and the region of Beira Interior Norte form a border province in a peripheral region. The peculiarities of this region generated several weaknesses or disadvantages which, in turn, translate into problems of competitiveness in their economies, demographic problems such as depopulation and aging population, fragility of the production that make it more difficult job creation, weak social capital, difficulties in access to services, infrastructure and support for entrepreneurs and marketing of products, as well as problems caused by the rooted perceptions on the concept of border. There are also many competitive advantages that should be put in value. The great human, corporate, social and economic development potential in the area, offers the opportunity to work in different strategies, actions and projects to revitalize the social and economic sectors of the territory, promoting networking and multidisciplinary dialogue and strengthening the cross-border cooperation strategies from an inclusive and collaborative perspective among various public and private actors in the territory. The Center for Territorial Analysis and Foresight (CAPT) intends to \"activate a territorial intelligence\u201d to lead the economic development of the BINSAL territory. This territorial intelligence must be the result of the input from the various stakeholders engaged in the territory as well as other external actors that also bring freshness and enrich the future vision of the region. This foresight project arises from the work carried out by over a hundred experts in various fields related to territorial development during the second half of 2011 and the first half of 2012. Within it, and from the various foresight methodologies applied in the exploratory foresight, the different possible scenarios for the future of the territory are built. The construction of these scenarios \u2013 Trend / Likely Scenarios and Desired Scenarios \u2013 allows, through foresight strategic planning, to organize and to align the efforts of various actors in the territory towards the most desirable scenario within those that are likely. OBJECTIVES OF THE STAKEHOLDERS \u2022 Promote and stimulate an institutional structure of lasting cross-border cooperation between the project partners, which allows a knowledge generation channel. ",
        "43 \u2022 Provide a useful and practical platform to enable communication between partners, participants and experts involved, under a common format, based on project priorities. \u2022 Integration and institutional coordination of all agents of the territory and that are part of the BIN \u2013 SAL project. \u2022 Propose cross-border rural development initiatives focused on creating economic activity and employment with a foresight approach. \u2022 Streamlining the social and economic sectors of the territory, promoting networking and multidisciplinary dialogue, through the interrelation of the various actors involved. \u2022 Conduct a survey of all cross-border rural development initiatives focused on the creation of economic activity and employment with a foresight and exchange of experiences approach. \u2022 Disseminate among the largest number of people, organizations and institutions, both in the BIN - SAL territory and the rest of Spanish and Portuguese territory, results, progress and achievements of the project. \u2022 Continue improving the quality of life in the border region that is integrated into this project through the involvement of all participants, with the efficient knowledge management, innovation, available resources and implementation of sustainability criteria. METHOD The BINSAL territory foresight project is divided into two distinct phases by their purpose and results: \u2022 The first stage is the exploratory proposal of the territory. This step was performed through the combination of different prospective methods, in which there has been a temporal and functional correlation, being the result of one of them the starting point of the next. The methods used were: \u00b7 Delphi method (Interviews + rounds of questionnaires) \u00b7 Structural Analysis, \u00b7 Morphological Analysis, \u00b7 Game Actors Analysis. \u2022 The second stage is the foresight strategic planning of the BINSAL territory. It defines the strategic lines, objectives and actions that will help develop the territory. This was done using the following tools: \u00b7 Definition of current scenarios and desirable trends obtained in the first phase of the methodology (exploratory foresight). \u00b7 Interdisciplinary groups \u00b7 Foresight workshop TOPICS ADDRESSED The following fields of study and topics were identified: SOCIAL CAPITAL \u2022 Search for new inhabitants \u2022 Social Capital. Encouraging associations \u2022 Identity/Culture/Traditions \u2022 Policies to fix population RAW MATERIALS \u2022 Agriculture \u2022 Farming \u2022 Gastronomy \u2022 Agro food industry \u2022 Endogenous resources HERITAGE AND TOURISM \u2022 Environment \u2022 Natural heritage, landscape and forestry \u2022 Quality and active tourism INNOVATION AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP \u2022 Change of mind by actors \u2022 Promote self-employment \u2022 Promote existing good practices \u2022 Information, awareness raising ",

Promoting business associations as a way of living together and establishing relationships. Promoting cross-border strategies that help stimulate and raise the entrepreneur spirit. Giving value to endogenous resources and marketing them to activate economic activity. Promoting entrepreneurship and self-employment policies exploiting the potential of the territory. Enhancing quality and sustainable tourism across borders. IF ACTION PLAN: INDICATORS AND GOVERNANCE (WHO? HOW?) The following categories of indicators have been designed for the follow-up of the process, they are monitored by the Center for Territorial Analysis and Foresight (CAPT): \u2022 Indicators of participation. \u2022 Indicators of diffusion. \u2022 Indicators of action. \u2022 Indicators of financial budget. \u2022 Indicators specific foresight strategy. CONNECTION WITH EU POLICIES AND STRATEGIES This territorial foresight exercise is funded by the ERDF in the framework of the \u201cOperational Programme for Cross-border Cooperation: Spain \u2013 Portugal, 2007-2013\u201d. As for the contents themselves, the main strategic lines are directly related to the Europe 2020 strategy: \u2022 Dynamism, motivation and improving cross-border human capital \u2022 Recovery of raw materials and endogenous products of the territory \u2022 Conservation of natural and cultural heritage and promotion of sustainable and quality tourism \u2022 Innovation and entrepreneurship \u2022 Improvement of mobility and communications \u2022 Public and private cross-border cooperation IMPACT OF THE CRISIS The economic crisis has not been widely considered in this foresight process, only slightly during the SWOT analysis phase of the scenario process and the interviews with the stakeholders. ASSESSMENT (STRENGTHS AND LIMITS) The BINSAL territorial foresight exercise has successfully used different foresight methods (structural analysis, Delphi method, morphological analysis, actors\u00b4 games analysis, scenarios\u2026) with a high quality. These methods have really contributed to the reflection on the future of the territory and to search for solutions, which is indeed the aim of the strategic foresight process. The participatory approach has also been very rich in this process, through interviews with experts, structural analysis or the Delphi method, so that the final proposal is the result of this shared reflection. On the other hand, even if the strategic lines, objectives and actions are coherent and seem to be the result of the debate, time horizons for proposals and scenarios are not clearly established. ",

In 2010 and in order to adapt to new situation, and look further (horizon 2020), this new process starts; it aims at developing the new strategy for the horizon 2020, counting on the collaboration and participation of a great number of agents and citizens. It has consisted of four main stages: \u2022 Stage 1: Analysis of world megatrends and benchmarking; diagnosis \u2022 Stage 2: Definition of main strategic lines \u2022 Stage 3: Initiatives\u2019 implementation plan and Communication plan \u2022 Stage 4: Monitoring of the Plan The methodology of this process has consisted of several methods and tools, getting the participation and the involvement of different agents. OBJECTIVES OF THE STAKEHOLDERS The objective of the process is the elaboration of the strategic plan in the horizon 2020. This way, the new Plan 2020 aims to promote the enhancement of resources, job creation and internationalization in Burgos through the articulation of nine strategic lines. These strategies can be translated in several initiatives for the short term, focusing on different domains. METHOD In each of the steps, different methods have been developed, as it is described in the following diagram: ",
        "46 Stage 1: Analysis of world megatrends and benchmarking; diagnosis and vision \u2022 During this first step, 90 world megatrends were identified; these trends were divided in 4 different groups: Terra (social trends), Econo (business development, investments, talent and innovation trends), Tech (new technologies and sciences trends) and Meta (transversal trends). \u2022 25 trends were selected out of the identified 90 world megatrends, for being more applicable to Burgos city, highlighting 12 of them due to their highest potential impact on the city. \u2022 A regional benchmarking was developed as well, in order to identify the best practices as for the analysis of megatrends. This benchmarking includes some interesting examples, as Bilbao, Baden- W\u00fcrttemberg or Madrid. \u2022 Finally, this step counted on the participation of several local social and economic agents and institutions, through individual and group interviews, in order to compile the existing different visions. Stage 2: Definition of main strategic lines \u2022 In this second stage the main policy options were identified, along with the main challenges that Burgos will have to face in the future. Therefore, the main strategic lines and initiatives were selected. ",
        "47 Stage 3: Initiatives\u2019 implementation plan and communication plan \u2022 After the identification of strategic lines and initiatives, an implementation plan was developed, along with a communication plan, addressed to the involved agents and to the citizens. Stage 4: Monitoring of the Plan \u2022 This last stage will ensure the monitoring of the plan, through the definition of indicators. TOPICS ADDRESSED Main topics include the following ones: \u2022 Social trends: - Demography - Consumption trends - Mobility - Urbanization \u2022 Economy trends: - Economy and employment - Financial flows \u2022 Technology trends: - Platforms and connectivity - Internet - Natural sciences and health - Energy and electricity \u2022 Transversal trends: - Sustainability - Governance ",
        "48 MAIN RECOMMENDATIONS Even if no recommendations are included within the Plan, each of the nine strategic lines includes a great number of actions and initiatives to be implemented in the horizon 2020. IF ACTION PLAN: INDICATORS AND GOVERNANCE (WHO? HOW?) In order to ensure the monitoring of the Plan, and the achievement of the defined objectives, a specific monitoring plan has been developed. This plan includes Integrated Information Systems, along with a Planning and Strategic Management Unit. This monitoring tries to promote the involvement of different agents, maintaining several working groups for that. CONNECTION WITH EU POLICIES AND STRATEGIES This process has considered from the very beginning the world and international trends and their potential impact on the city of Burgos, considering specially the European framework, and different European regions as references to be considered. As for the existing connection with EU policies and strategies, the 20/20/20 environmental Plan is specially mentioned, as one of the desired targets. In addition to this, even if the European Strategy 2020 is not explicitly mentioned, smart, sustainable and inclusive growth is aimed in this process. On the other hand, other strategy connections can be found, related to the following domains: - Innovation and R&D - Resource efficiency New skills and jobs IMPACT OF THE CRISIS The new current situation, motivated by the economic crisis is the main starting point of this process; in fact, this situation, specially negative and deep in Spain, is one of the challenges that the new Strategic Plan 2020 must face. Overcoming this crisis and improving the competitive situation of the city of Burgos is essential for its future in the horizon 2020. ASSESSMENT (STRENGTHS AND LIMITS) The following main strengths can be identified: - It is an integrated process, including several and different stages. - International panorama is considered in a very important way, as well as its impact on local and regional situation. - Participation and involvement are promoted, among social and economic agents, as well as among citizens. - Monitoring of the process and its results is promoted, through the involvement of a great number of stakeholders. As for the limits, the following ones should be highlighted: - The strategic plan does not include a schedule or timing for its completion, apart from the horizon 2020. - The methodology does not include innovative dynamics or methods. As for other foresight studies used in this foresight exercise, the main one was the Boston Consulting Group report \u201cMegatrends: Tailwinds for Growth in a Low-Growth Environment\u201d (http://www.bcg.com/documents/file47063.pdf).

OBJECTIVES OF THE STAKEHOLDERS This project is the review process of the previous Ashford Core Strategy. This review is seeking to understand and gather views upon the economic growth potential of the Borough over the next 20 years and the consequences of this in terms of future planning. The Council\u2019s Cabinet has made clear its intention that the future development strategy for the Borough should emphasize economic development and the creation of jobs. METHOD The following methodology will be carried out: Strategic Employment Options (March 2012): \u2022 The analysis of strategic employment options tries to give assistance in establishing a \u2018jobs- led\u2019 growth target for the Borough and consider future demand for employment land to 2030. \u2022 This report considers and sets out four scenarios for economic growth in Ashford Borough to 2030. It is intended to provide an evidence base to inform the setting of jobs targets, and to help the Council to make policy decisions. \u2022 There are a range of factors which have been considered in developing economic scenarios for the Borough; factors influencing development of economic scenarios, as the following figure shows: ",
        "50 \u2022 This analysis has involved the development of a \u2018baseline\u2019 economic scenario for Ashford using Cambridge Econometrics\u2019 Local Economic Forecasting Model (LEFM). It takes account of macro-economic factors and future growth expectations for different economic sectors. Economic and demographic forecasts (June 2012): \u2022 This second stage has assessed the labour supply required to meet the proposed job growth options in the previous stage (Strategic Employment Options) and also the level of housing required to support each growth option. The assessment has been carried out alongside an examination of changing needs within the existing population. In total, seven scenarios have been considered - four job-led scenarios and three demographic-led scenarios. \u2022 Scenarios 1 to 4 are economic job-led scenarios based on a future level of job growth. These forecasts assess the workforce needed to support the required level of job growth and the associated level of house building necessary to accommodate the changing population. The economic scenarios provide an indication of the different demographic and housing impacts of varying levels of job growth. \u2022 Scenarios 5 to 7 are demographic population-led scenarios based on future population trends. These projections assume a constant migration trend into the future. Whilst it is unlikely that a trend will continue indefinitely (as it is likely to be affected by future policy decisions) this type of projection can provide a useful indication of the Borough\u2019s changing demographic profile and housing needs. This includes an assessment of the Borough\u2019s resident-based labour supply and the number of jobs that could be supported by such a population. Public consultation on \u201cJobs and Homes to 2030 Working Paper\u201d Exploring a jobs-led future for Ashford Borough \u2022 This report introduces a discussion paper to be used to stimulate debate on the Borough\u2019s future and gathers responses from interested organisations and individuals. The paper\u2019s focus is principally on the future prospects for the Borough\u2019s economy in order to feed into the review of the adopted Core Strategy which will look to 2030. The paper also sets out possible consequences in terms of the number of new homes needed to provide for different levels of possible jobs growth and those needed to cater for changes in the existing population \u2013 particularly the predicted rapid increase in the proportion of older residents. These are complex and inter-related issues \u2013 a short leaflet will also be produced to summarise them for the public. The paper concludes with a number of questions for respondents to consider. All views received will be reported back in due course before a decision is made on the correct jobs and housing targets to plan for in the Borough. Definition of the Local Plan to 2030 \u2022 Next stages will develop the Local Plan to 2030. \u2022 Issues for a future debate will include how jobs and homes are distributed between Ashford town and the rural areas \u2013 it is not anticipated that the long standing general approach to rural restraint to help protect the Borough\u2019s countryside will change. Changes such as the new National Planning Policy Framework and the opportunity for local communities to encourage growth under the Localism Act may have some impact, but probably a limited one, on the ",
        "51 overall picture, and these will be assessed in later stages as the Core Strategy Review takes on a more spatial approach. \u2022 This last part of the process will involve several stages of public participation leading to an independent, public examination of the plan. TOPICS ADDRESSED The following topics are being addressed: - Jobs growth - Housing - Industries and markets - Economic performance - Competition - Macroeconomic drivers MAIN RECOMMENDATIONS Even if the process is not yet concluded, it includes some recommendations regarding the future monitoring of the Plan. IF ACTION PLAN: INDICATORS AND GOVERNANCE (WHO? HOW?) Even if the process and the Local Plan are not still completed, the output reports consider it really important the role for future monitoring and review. In fact, they recommend that the Council monitors future performance against the developed scenarios. A significant and sustained divergence of economic performance from these assumptions (such as over a five year period or more) could therefore trigger the need to review strategic planning policies. CONNECTION WITH EU POLICIES AND STRATEGIES Although the European Strategy 2020 is not explicitly mentioned during the process, it can be assumed that employment targets linked to a smart, sustainable and inclusive growth are specially considered, as for employed people and new skills and jobs. Innovation strategies or policies are as well reflected during the process, with a link to business and markets. IMPACT OF THE CRISIS The economic crisis is considered within the macro-economic risks considered, both for the UK and Europe and the Eurozone within the process. Its effects and impacts on the market competition and market pressures are explicitly mentioned and considered. ASSESSMENT (STRENGTHS AND LIMITS) As this initiative is an ongoing project and it is not yet finished, it is not possible to make the assessment of the process. However, the inclusion of forecasts, scenarios and public consultation is highly appreciated, counting on the participation of reference agents and stakeholders. Regarding other foresight studies used in this foresight exercise, the scenarios have been produced using the POPGROUP and Derived Forecast (DF) model. The POPGROUP and DF model is used by over 90 organisations including academic and public service staff in housing, planning, health, policy, research, economic development, and social services. The model is therefore widely used and accepted as the industry standard. The POPGROUP and DF model is currently owned by the Local Government Association with the technical maintenance undertaken by Edge Analytics. ",

Assumptions in the 1 st Scenario: Opportunities Missed - Scotland remains within the UK and faces low growth rates up to 2030. - Increased fuel world prices. - Persistent underinvestment in capital equipment, R&D, renewable energy, education, public infrastructure. - Intense rural depopulation. - Reduced public spending, diminishing role of the government, incentives for individual entrepreneurship, growing female managerial presence. - At the international level there is a shift of economic power to BRICs. Assumptions of the 2 nd scenario: Opportunities Taken - Scotland enjoys a higher degree of fiscal autonomy. ",
        "53 - The presence of a Sovereign Wealth fund, which can foster strategic investment. - Land use on the policy focus. - There is a trend away from the traditional/employment structures towards a more active role of the community in the decision-making process. - Localized renewables outputs and small exports of energy surpluses. - Local specialist products are the main actors in the global markets. - Communities are a fundamental policy-decision actor. - Scotland is an international broker for climate change initiatives and becomes a hub linking between the East and the West. Assumptions of the 3 rd scenario: Opportunities Uninvited - A worldwide computer hyper-virus in the early 20s affects the economic, logistic and social consistency that influences people\u2019s confidence in the traditional politico-economic structures. - Energy price is at high levels and the international trade has collapsed. - In Scotland the community is in the centre of the society. - Interactive technologies support the bottom-up leadership. - The role of the central government is more the one of an arbiter and gatekeeper. - Communities\u2019 target is self-sufficiency. - Broader definition of worth and merit. - This new community-based model pulls back the Scots of diaspora. - Rising importance is given to arts and culture and the role of religion is diminished. OBJECTIVES OF THE STAKEHOLDERS To consider the possible forms of sustainable communities in Scotland by 2030. In this analysis the definition of sustainability is broad including costs of transport, telecommunications, energy, water and demographic evolution. METHOD - Compilation of a data workbook. - The workbook consisted of case studies considered to be good examples of sustainability. - Three groups of master students were asked to identify relevant details and write the first three drafts of the workbook. Gaps in the research were filled by a senior researcher. - Identification of gaps and completion of the workbook. - The Forum researchers held sessions with several organizations, such as The Royal Society of Edinburgh, Scottish and Southern Energy, SEPA and Scottish Water. - 27 experts met for a 2-day scenario workshop were the key elements in need of change were recognized. -Based on this exercise, the scenario processes were drafted out. -These drafts were tested through 2 workshops and 4 standard scenario tests. TOPICS ADDRESSED The following topics have been addressed in this foresight exercise: -Fiscal autonomy -Renewable resources -Energy supply trading -Security issues, such as food security -Waste management -Education -Taxation -Demographic evolution -Empowered communities -Costs of transport -Female managerial presence -Individual entrepreneurship -Subsidiarity -New politico-economical structures MAIN RECOMMENDATIONS -Investment in the renewable energy sector. -Restructuring of the educational system with emphasis in the teaching of foreign languages as for instance Mandarin, which are believed to be used in the future for international communication. -UK strategic intervention in infrastructure in order to scale up industrially enterprises in environmental and energy sustainability. -Attention should be paid to micro-businesses as they are expected to emerge. -Restructuring of public service delivery. -Convert the energy of female entrepreneurship into wider sustainable economic benefit. -Reconsideration of the stereotypical views of women\u2019s senior positions in the society. ",
        "54 -Funding consistent investment in new skills. -Modernization of the education. -Investment in R&D and infrastructure for renewable energy. -More active planning of the rising cost of imports. -Political confidence. -Use of fiscal devolution to set up a Sovereign Wealth Fund, able to provide UK infrastructure. -Turning post-credit crunch disaffection into new capital partnerships -Investing in pre-school education -Use of interactive software for better governance. -Exploitation of natural resources. - Research collaborations. \u2010 Development of the social economy, based on local regulatory and fiscal regimes that favour enterprises of social value. IF ACTION PLAN: INDICATORS AND GOVERNANCE (WHO? HOW?) In Scotland 2030, there are not any quantitative indicators and no action plan has been adopted. CONNECTION WITH EU POLICIES AND STRATEGIES There are not explicitly mentioned any connections with the EU policies and Strategies, but one can identify several connecting links with the strategies and guidelines defined in the Europe 2020. There is a connection with European Union\u2019s objective to improve the education, and in the concrete case of Scotland 2030 to invest in pre-school education. There are also implicit links with the objective of energy projects and the establishment of an internal energy market and the promotion of renewable energy, as also the Scotland 2030 recommends the use of energy-efficient methods and of renewables. It can also be addressed that the emphasis given on the individual entrepreneur is in accordance with the challenges of Europe 2020. IMPACT OF THE CRISIS In the framework of the first scenario: -There is low public spending that results underinvestment. In the framework of the second scenario: -It is assumed that there is a rearrangement of the global economy with increasing power of the current emerging economies. -The banking crisis is assumed that discouraged short-term risks and promoted investment in industrial innovation and production. -the liquidity crisis has upgraded the role of new capital partnerships. ASSESSMENT (STRENGTHS AND LIMITS) In the Scotland 2030, one can identify several limitations and difficulties for the implementation of the aforementioned recommendations: -Ageing of the population. -Rural depopulation. -Discrimination regarding the women in higher leadership positions. -Lack of willingness from the politicians to hand over extra power to the citizens. -Empowered communities may act in predatory way failing to be constructively competitive. Strengths: -Scottish people have a tradition of individual innovation that can promote the individual entrepreneurship. In terms of methodology, the use of scenarios is at the same time creative and limited. The use of 3 scenarios is too limitative. Yet, these scenarios are less caricatured than it is often the case. Each one, even if it contains negative perspectives, generates possible positive effects and calls for a reaction of the communitarian structure which is rather typical in the United Kingdom. The lack of indicators or quantified objectives raises a question about the practical usefulness of the exercise. For the compilation of the final workbook that was used in the process, various sources were used, including several foresight exercises. The complete list of sources is accessible here: http://www.scotlandfuturesforum.org/assets/media/FinalWorkbookSources.pdf ",

Collaborative and open innovation: this methodology tries to be very participative and dynamic, getting the engagement of several experts and agents, as well as the engagement of general citizens. Anyone that wants to participate, can do it contributing through the funding of a workstream, paper or event, sharing each one\u2019s talent via a secondment or contributing in research. TOPICS ADDRESSED Although the process is not completed, the following topics will be addressed: - Public services - Demographic challenges - Fiscal challenges - Welfare challenges - Environmental challenges - Social challenges - Technology MAIN RECOMMENDATIONS As this initiative is an on going programme and it is not yet finished, no recommendations have been included. IF ACTION PLAN: INDICATORS AND GOVERNANCE (WHO? HOW?) As this initiative is an on going programme and it is not yet finished, no action plan has been completed. CONNECTION WITH EU POLICIES AND STRATEGIES Although the process is not yet completed, and no explicit mentions to European policies and strategies are included within it, a clear link can be observed in some domains. For instance, the consideration of the Europe 2020 strategy\u2019s objectives can be observed as the starting point of ",
        "57 this process, with regard to promoting a smart, sustainable and inclusive growth for the region. Some of the European flagships can be reflected within the initiative, highlighting these related to innovation, resource efficiency, social inclusion and actions against poverty.
