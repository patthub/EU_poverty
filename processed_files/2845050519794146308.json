        "3 1. I NTRODUCTION This document is a European Commission staff working document for information purposes. It does not represent an official position of the Commission on this issue, nor does it anticipate such a position. This Staff Working Document is a background to the Communication on \"The outermost regions of the European Union: towards a partnership for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth\" 1 . Its objective is to provide supplementary information and analysis on the issues raised in the main body of the Communication. 2. T HE KEY STAGES IN THE DEVELOPING PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE E UROPEAN U NION AND THE O UTERMOST R EGIONS Since 1999, the EU has formally recognised the geographical and economic specificity of the outermost regions (OR): remoteness, insularity, small size, difficult topography and climate, and economic dependence on a small number of products. These specific characteristics constitute serious obstacles to economic growth. Over the years, the EU has adopted different programmes and measures 2 in an effort to offset the negative economic impact of these obstacles in order to ensure that the OR can share in the benefits of the single market 3 . In particular, over the period since 2004, the Commission has been seeking to set EU actions in favour of the OR within a strategic framework. In 2004 4 , the Commission defined the key axes of a strategic approach which had three main strands: accessibility and reduction of the effects of the other constraints; improving economic competitiveness; and promoting regional integration with their neighbouring regions and territories. In September 2007 5 , the Commission recognised the need \"to continue the effort to adapt EU policies and for specific support whenever necessary\". The Communication also launched a public debate on the future of the European strategy for the OR and referred, inter alia, to four themes with long-term implications and critical to the OR (climate 1 COM(2012) 287 final, of 20.06.2012. 2 Numerous European initiatives take account of the specific nature of these regions, particularly in the areas of competition (for example, aid authorised in the areas of transport, energy, etc.), taxation (for example, dock dues in the French OR, the \"Arbitrio sobre las importaciones y entrega de mercanc\u00edas\" (AIEM) tax in the Canary Islands, and the reduced rate of excise duty on rum produced in these regions, on local beer in Madeira and on certain liqueurs produced and consumed in Madeira and the Azores), customs policy, agriculture, research, trade or transport, in order to try and offset the handicaps specific to the remote nature of these regions. 3 Since the latest EU enlargements, the OR as a whole are no longer part of the group of poorest regions. However, in relation to the EU average, and in terms of GDP per capita, most of the OR remain among the least prosperous regions of the EU (see Section 3). 4 Commission Communication: \"A stronger partnership for the outermost regions\", COM(2004) 343, 26.5.2004); (Commission Communication \u201con a stronger partnership for the outermost regions: assessment and prospects\u201d, COM(2004) 543, 6.8.2004. 5 Commission Communication \"Strategy for the Outermost Regions: Achievements and Future Prospects\" COM (2007)507 final, 12 September 2007.

        "4 change, demographic change and migration management, agriculture, and maritime policy). In October 2008 6 , the Commission drew the conclusions from the public debate and proposed a new paradigm vis-\u00e0-vis the OR: that of making the most of their unique characteristics. It identified certain sectors with growth potential and high added-value and gave examples of concrete actions and projects. In addition, and to develop the new paradigm, the Commission proposed to ensure that better use should be made of the existing EU instruments and put forward a series of measures for the 2007-2013 programming period, in the fields of climate change 7 , demographic change and migration management 8 , agriculture, maritime policy, strengthening partnership and other horizontal issues. Among the latter, it proposed to organise a bi-annual forum for the \"outermost Europe\" 9 and to launch an important fact-finding study on the factors for growth in the OR (see Section 5). Reflecting the partnership approach, the OR themselves have contributed constructively to the reflection on ways to improve economic performance and to break with the legacy of the past. In a memorandum adopted in 2009 10 , the OR proposed a review of the actions undertaken since 1999 in favour of the OR, taking into account their development within a changing European and global context. A year later, in May 2010, the commitment to contribute to the establishment of objectives and priorities within the framework of the Europe 2020 Strategy and for the post-2013 period, led to the signature of a joint memorandum on the part of the national authorities of Spain, France, Portugal together with their OR 11 . Meanwhile, the annual Conferences of the Presidents of the OR 12 , also attended by representatives of the three Member States, the Commission, the European Parliament and the Member State holding the rotating EU presidency, have 6 COM (2008) 642 final, 17.10.2008. 7 Study launched in March 2012 on climate change and the OR. Specific contract within CLIMA framework contract DG CLIMA.A.4/FRA/2011/0027. 8 \"Demographic and migration trends in the OR: impact on economic, social and territorial cohesion\", of May 2012, by the \"Institut National d'\u00c9tudes D\u00e9mographiques\" (INED). http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/activity/outermost/publications_en.cfm 9 The first forum took place on 27/28 May 2010. The second is scheduled on 2-3 July 2012. 10 Joint memorandum of the OR: \u2018The Outermost Regions up to 2020\u2019 (Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, 14 October 2009). The OR have also issued several joint contributions on different topics launched by the Commission: the Green Paper on the TEN-T (2009), the public consultation launched by the Communication from the Commission \"A sustainable future for transport: Towards an integrated, technology-led and user friendly system\" (2009); the public consultation on the Commission\u2019s working document on the future Europe 2020 strategy (2010); the consultation on the new European energy strategy for 2011-2020 (2010); the public consultation \"Towards a single market Act\" (2011). 11 \"A renewed vision of the EU strategy for the OR\", Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, 7 May 2010. 12 The last Conference (the 17 th ) took place in November 2011 in Martinique and resulted in a declaration focused on cohesion policy, agriculture, fisheries, R&I, energy, the single market and the \"Solbes\" report, state aids, impact on international agreements and the renewed EU strategy for the OR. ",
        "5 resulted in official joint declarations by the Presidents addressed to the European institutions. In June 2010 13 , the Council, in inviting the Commission to bring forward a communication on the OR, asked, firstly, for appropriate account to be taken of the needs and opportunities presented by the OR in its review of EU policies and, secondly, for work to continue on specific measures for these regions where appropriate, to reinforce partnership and to systematically evaluate the effects of the EU policies on the OR, in particular when carrying out impact assessment studies. In October 2011, Mr Pedro Solbes, delivered a report entitled \" Europe's Outermost Regions and the single market: the EU's influence in the world \" 14 . Mr Solbes put forward a series of recommendations on ways to integrate the OR into the single market by making better use of their assets and to attain the objectives of the EU 2020 Strategy. Finally, the MEPs from the OR in the European Parliament (EP) have also contributed to this debate and submitted to President Barroso in July 2010 the \"common platform\" of the Conference of the MEPs from the OR 15 . In addition, the most recent contribution on the EU strategy on the OR under Europe 2020 came in the form of an own initiative opinion of the European Parliament adopted on 18 April 2012 on the \" The role of Cohesion Policy in the outermost regions of the European Union in the context of EU 2020 \" 16 . 3. R ECENT SOCIO - ECONOMIC TRENDS IN THE OUTERMOST REGIONS With regard to overall economic performance in the OR, this has been generally disappointing over recent years against a background of the wider European and global economic recession, although there are important differences between individual regions. As the Union entered the recession in 2009 with a contraction of 4.3% in levels of GDP, the national economies of Spain, France and Portugal contracted, respectively, by 3.7%, 2.7% and 2.9%. In 2009, the contraction was strongest in the Canary Islands (-4%), followed by Madeira (-3.6%). The contraction in the Azores compared to the other OR was less marked in 2009 with growth of -1%. There are no growth figures available for the French OR. 13 3023rd FOREIGN AFFAIRS Council meeting, 14 June 2010. 14 In late 2010, in the course of re-launching the single market, Commissioner Mr Barnier asked former Minister of Agriculture and of Economy and Finance of Spain and former European Commissioner, Pedro Solbes Mira, to undertake a study on the place of the OR within the single market. This report is available at: http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/outermost_regions/index_en.htm . 15 The eight MEPs from the OR are gathered in the \"Conference of the MEPs from the OR of the European Parliament\". The \"common platform\" underlines the importance of taking into account the specificities of the OR both in the external and internal EU policies and, where necessary, of making the necessary adaptations. 16 Procedure reference 2011/2195(INI). The MEP rapporteur was Nuno Teixeira. ",
        "6 In the OR as a whole, average GDP per inhabitant in 2009 was no higher than the 2006 figure relative to the EU (see Annex V) . In three OR, it even fell compared to the EU average. With the exception of Madeira, GDP per head in all the other OR lies below the figure for the whole of the respective Member State. In a few cases, the gaps appear to be widening. In one case, French Guiana, average GDP per head is no higher relative to the EU average in 2009 than in 2000. At least some of the OR have potential opportunities arising from their proximity to countries that have not had the same depth of recession as the EU as a whole. However, these opportunities appear to be underexploited. For example, foreign trade for the French OR located in the Caribbean, situated close to the emerging countries of South America, remains weak (less than 8%). This can at least partly be explained by the difficulty of competing with producers in neighbouring countries, where salary costs, as well as social protection and other employment costs are often lower. Furthermore, the EU has been determined to resist short-termism and has insisted on maintaining the same high standards in terms of social and environmental rules in the OR as in the rest of the EU, but which do not apply in third countries. In general, between 2008 and 2009, the crisis caused a fall in imports and exports for the OR. The situation is slightly different in the Canary Islands, where the economy is more open to foreign trade, and also in the Azores and Madeira. With regard to the labour market, since 2000 employment rates for the age group 20 to 64 years have generally increased in the OR. In 2009 and 2010, however, some experienced a rapid reduction of employment. In the Canary Islands, the employment rate fell from 67% in 2007 to 55% in 2010. This is a drop of 12 % points compared to a drop of 7 % points at national level in Spain. During this period, the unemployment rate in the Canary Islands almost tripled between 2007 (10%) and 2010 (29%). Youth unemployment increased from 22% in 2007 to 52% in 2010. Female unemployment rose from 13% to 28% and long term unemployment went from only 2% to 12% between 2007 and 2010 (see Annex V). In the French OR, the effects of the crisis on the labour market were relatively muted. In Guadeloupe and Reunion, the employment rate dropped by 1 % point between 2007 and 2010, while in Martinique and French Guiana it increased by almost 1 % point. Unemployment rates in the French OR remain high, but did not change substantially between 2007 and 2010. The only exception is Reunion, where unemployment increased by 5 % points to 29% between 2007 and 2010 becoming the European region with the highest unemployment rate. Female unemployment rates are about 1 % point above the total unemployment rate and only increased in Reunion between 2007 and 2010. Youth unemployment is very high in the French OR (between 42% and 59%), compared to 23% for all of France. In Martinique and Reunion, the youth unemployment rate respectively increased by 14% and 7 % between 2007 and 2010. In the Azores and Madeira, employment rates are high (70% and 72%) and barely changed between 2007 and 2010. Unemployment rates in 2010 were around 7%, which are lower than in Portugal as a whole (11%), although the figures for 2011 are likely to increase and be similar to those in mainland. Youth unemployment was around 17% in 2010, also lower than the national figure of 22%. Female unemployment rates in 2010 were between 6% and 7% well below the national figure of 12%. ",
        "7 4. T HE NEW CHALLENGES : E UROPE 2020 AND THE OUTERMOST REGIONS The Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth contains five headline targets to be achieved by the EU as a whole, which are quantified through a number of indicators 17 . This limited set of EU-level targets is translated into national targets in each EU country, reflecting different situations and circumstances. While not regional as such, the targets have been analysed on a regional basis by the Commission in the Seventh Progress Report on economic, social and territorial cohesion (\"The urban and regional dimension of Europe 2020\") 18 . The aim is not that all regions should reach all the national or the EU targets 19 but that significant progress should be made in that direction. In assessing the position of the OR against the EU 2020 targets, and indeed for any region in the EU, the immediate constraint is that of the absence of certain statistical data below national level. As shown in the Seventh Progress Report, with regard to certain indicators, some of the OR 20 feature among the ten EU regions most distant from their respective national 2020 targets 21 . In this vein, the above mentioned study on demographic and migratory trends in the OR suggests that the Europe 2020 objectives are probably unrealistic for most of the OR within the timeframe, for example, in terms of improvements in schooling performances or employment rates. The same can be said for environmental targets (except as regards renewable electricity production in some OR). Most of the OR are behind the EU averages in a range of social and economic indicators. This is notably the case for education standards, employment rates, GDP per capita (except for Madeira and the Canary Islands), levels of health care and environmental protection with a tendency for the OR to be more sensitive to the impact of the economic crisis than the Member States to which they belong. 17 1) Employment (75% of the 20-64 year-olds to be employed); 2) R&D/innovation (3% of the EU's GDP - public and private combined - to be invested in R&D/innovation); 3) Climate change/energy (greenhouse gas emissions 20% (or even 30%, if the conditions are right) lower than 1990; 20% of energy from renewables; 20% increase in energy efficiency); 4) Education (reducing school drop-out rates below 10% and at least 40% of 30-34\u2013year-olds completing third level education); 5) poverty / social exclusion (at least 20 million fewer people in or at risk of poverty and social exclusion). 18 This report measures the distance of cities and regions to the national 2020 targets proposed in the national reform programmes. This distance to target depends on the disparities with the country, the ambition of the NRP and expected speed of change. http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/docoffic/official/reports/interim7/interim7_en.pdf 19 For some regions, the distance to the target is simply too great. Furthermore, for some issues it is not realistic or desirable that all regions reach the same target. For example, R&D is highly concentrated in part due to benefits of clustering research. 20 See Annex IV . 21 In tertiary education (the Azores), in early school leavers (the Azores and Madeira), in employment rate (Reunion, French Guiana and Guadeloupe), unemployment rate (Reunion, Canary Islands, Guadeloupe and Martinique), and risk of poverty or exclusion (Canary Islands). ",
        "8 On all three of the targets related to smart growth, the available data for Spanish and Portuguese OR show that they have a low score, considerably lower than for their respective country. R&D expenditure is only around 0.5% of GDP, which is probably linked to the lower shares of manufacturing in their economies. The share of population aged 30 to 34 with a tertiary education is some ten percentage points below the national average in the Canary Islands and the Azores, while in Madeira it is only slight below the Portuguese average. The early school leavers' rate is much higher in the Azores (49%) and Madeira (41%) than the (already high) rate for Portugal 32%, which makes the target of reducing it to 10% by 2020 seem particularly daunting. For these three indicators no data for regions in France are available. The employment rate is well below the national 2020 target in the Canary Islands (55% compared to 74%) and the four French OR (between 50% and 55% compared to 75%). In the Azores and Madeira, however, employment rates are quite high (70% and 72%) and close to the national average (71%) and target (75%). The Europe 2020 strategy also aims to reduce poverty and exclusion. At-risk-of-poverty- or-exclusion rates are unfortunately not available for the French OR. Nevertheless, it is likely that, where household income is only between 50% and 65% of the French average household income, poverty and exclusion rates are much higher than in mainland France. The Canary Islands have a household income which is 86% of the Spanish average. The at-risk-of-poverty rate is 31%, considerably higher than the Spanish average of 21% in 2010. The at-risk-of-poverty-or-exclusion rate is also higher than in the rest of Spain (35%) compared to 25% in 2010. The two Portuguese OR offer a contrast. The Azores had the same average disposable household income as all of Portugal in 2008. But it has a higher at-risk-of-poverty rate of 25% compared to 19% for all of Portugal in 2005. Madeira's disposable household income was 7% higher than that of Portugal as a whole in 2008. It had a lower at-risk-of- poverty rate of 17% compared to 19% in 2005. So while the Azores have a higher share, Madeira has a lower share of poor people. However, these figures do not take into account regional differences in cost of living. Over the next few decades, considerable efforts need to be expended to improve the social and economic cohesion of these regions. Education and employment creation through new investments are the key domains. These are of prime importance because education shapes opportunities for access to employment for young people arriving on the labour market and increased numbers of jobs is the only solution to maintaining effective dependency ratios at a socially affordable level. Job creation is a real priority. The recommendations of the European Commission to national governments in its communication called \"Towards a job-rich recovery\" 22 published on 19 April 2012, concern also the ORs issues. This proposal focuses on the demand-side of job creation, setting out ways to encourage hiring by reducing taxes on labour or supporting business start-ups more. It also identifies the areas with the biggest job potential for the future: the green economy, health services and ICT. 22 http://ec.europa.eu/news/employment/120419_en.htm ",
        "9 5. R ESULTS OF THE STUDY ON \"G ROWTH F ACTORS IN THE OUTERMOST REGIONS \" 23 A study entitled \"Growth Factors in the OR\" was launched by the Commission in 2009 to identify opportunities for economic growth in these remote territories of the EU. Its main objectives were: 1) to deepen the understanding of the process of economic development in the OR; 2) to identify strategies to improve competitiveness and reduce dependency on imports and external public transfers; and 3) to identify flagship projects in line with Europe 2020. The final report of the study points out that, despite their common structural constraints (remoteness, small-scale economies, low specialization, much higher living standards than their respective geographic neighbours, large flow of transfers from mainland, private and public consumption as main determinant of growth, insufficient private investments in competitive sectors, lack of qualified manpower and of specialised skills, lack of regional integration, etc.), the OR also have considerable endogenous potential such as in their exceptional biodiversity and marine ecosystems with potential for producing renewable energy, in advanced agro-environmental research and in climate change research. Traditional and emerging sectors 24 In recent years, official development strategies have begun to change, going beyond the old models of the past. Analysis on the ground (interviews with stakeholders and examination of official documents) demonstrates that new fields of development are being pursued, focusing on the potential of each region. At their current stage, which is an initial stage, these new fields cannot offset structural imbalances, particularly in terms of employment. However, the new approach, focusing on the strengths of the OR, can be seen as the most effective way of producing a model of growth that is less dependent and more competitive, provided that the OR succeed in developing these new fields in a competitive way. A strategy such as this leads to a development model that is similar in all the OR with comparable potential, which could lead to synergies and complementarities which are currently not apparent in any specific way. The current transition phase is based on a mix of old and new sectors, in which modern agriculture, tourism and private services are gradually increasing their competitiveness and gaining access to wider regional markets. In addition, the OR aim to develop new sectors in industry and advanced services (e.g. financial services, technology transfer, etc.). With this end in view, significant public investment has been made in research and knowledge. 23 Study carried out by Ismeri Europa, in cooperation with ITD.eu Europe, commissioned by the European Commission in 2009 (Contract No 2009.CE.16.0.AT.101) and delivered in March 2011. See: http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/docgener/studies/pdf/rup_growth/rup_growth_sum_en.pdf 24 Summary of the section of the study on added value sectors (traditional and emerging) and flagship projects. ",
        "10 In economic terms, the concept of growth potential is connected to untapped resources, both human and/or natural, upon which a region\u2019s production process can rely, developing new technologies and skills or a new form of organising production factors. This definition fits well with the strategy needed in order to put the potential of the OR to good use. The mix of endogenous resources, new technologies and the way that factors are organised may give rise to a competitive advantage in the production of certain goods and services. Potential growth in the OR may derive both from restructuring the traditional sectors of tourism, agriculture and fisheries and from new specialisations resulting from the application of research and innovation to old and new sectors. New skills, requiring high abilities, and well-focused, market-oriented applied research are necessary to sustain the process. Traditional sectors In the majority of the OR, a high proportion of the workforce is employed in agriculture, thus maintaining their unique environmental and cultural landscape and ensuring that the local food market is supplied as well as, to varying degrees, providing exports. Given the access and isolation problems, agriculture cannot be neglected if the OR wish to lessen their dependence on imports and preserve the landscape. Production and employment in agriculture are, however, on the decline and can only be strengthened through product differentiation and specialisation. This can be achieved with the support of the current investment in RTDI, by using new techniques and discoveries to expand the variety and quality of products and to strengthen integration and competitiveness within the agri- food manufacturing chain. Besides, the European Commission stressed \"the extreme richness of biodiversity and cultural heritage, the particular geology and location of these regions providing Europe with opportunities to push back the boundaries of our knowledge, helping to find new ways ahead to deal with the key challenges facing us such as globalization and climate change\" 25 . This strategy to develop the regional potential linked to climate, environment and local know-how is pursued by most OR, with differing results and impact on regional revenue. Specific opportunities have emerged from alternative uses for sugar cane, the production of new varieties of fruit and vegetables, livestock, fish farming, etc. These developments can be enhanced by more focused and more market-oriented research and by forms of clustering and networking designed to mobilise private-sector operators, who, in general, remain weak. The current balance between the support of existing production and the speeding up of changes in product types should be carefully considered by the authorities responsible for agricultural and fisheries policy. Tourism has significant potential in most OR and in some of them is a key sector for employment and external trade. It is based on an exceptional natural and cultural environment. The conflict between tourism and the preservation of the environment in coastal areas and greenbelt areas needs to be handled properly by the regions as a precondition for making tourism development sustainable in the long term and allowing a 25 Video-presentation of the European Commission on EU action to support its Outermost Regions, published on 19 March 2012. ",
        "11 real growth in alternative tourism products. Although tourism is well-developed in most cases, its products are still traditional and suffer from increasing external competition; its potential is based on product differentiation to adapt better to demand segmentation, in contrast to standard mass tourism products. This should increase quality and profitability and should allow the range of tourism products offered by the OR to occupy new niches. At present, areas of specialisation such as eco-tourism, social, cultural or wellnesstourism are still in the process of being developed. The restructuring of the range of tourism services on offer gives an opportunity to invest in new, smaller and more flexible establishments for hosting tourists, which are also more environmentally sustainable. In this respect, ad hoc vocational training is vital in most OR to ensure that products are differentiated and that their quality is upgraded. Emerging sectors A host of new sectors and products may emerge from the application of RTDI to the development of the biodiversity which is a feature of the natural environment in the OR, from forest to marine eco-systems. A list of applications is envisaged by local authorities in the sphere of health, natural medicine and cosmetics, and many other sectors, such as food, energy or materials for eco-construction and wood. Many dimensions of the green economy can be developed to make the most of the exceptional natural environment and marine biodiversity of the OR. The development of competitive advantages in the area of the green economy is the most promising prospect in terms of growth and employment opportunities; it is also the most demanding in terms of the conditions that need to be met, ranging from the availability of scientific and technological skills to the presence of RTDI targeted at the market, and the local exploitation of innovation through spin-offs from research. On the whole, these conditions have not yet been met and current regional RTDI policies fall short of extending the research value chain to reach business applications, or to create a critical mass for developing new products and services. This difficulty is, however, common to most of the EU\u2019s convergence regions, particularly those which do not have a knowledge-based industry able to lead the process. Policies of this kind are still too young and it will only be possible to perceive their results in the medium term, if the above conditions are met, and if the obstacles are overcome by fine-tuned initiatives. Regional policies need to focus human and material resources, make them more market- oriented, and not spread them over too many potential fields, preventing the emergence of the necessary critical mass. The OR have had serious problems in ensuring a regular supply of fossil fuels, and are penalised by high provision costs, due to difficulties in access and distribution. During recent years, the development of renewable energies has been pursued and favourable natural and environmental conditions exist for developing various sources of renewable energy, through wind power, solar and photovoltaic energy. In addition, in some OR there is a growing expertise in RTDI that can be drawn upon. Island status and small size encourage a wide-scale development of small plants, which could aim to satisfy a much greater share of demand, given the higher cost of traditional sources and their unreliability. Currently, a number of experimental plants and good practices may lay the foundations for a more organised and better planned development of the renewable energies that would be worth pursuing at regional level. Currently, environmental services dealing with water and waste are a problem, because these issues have not yet been resolved in a satisfactory way in most OR, despite efforts ",
        "12 to do so. Significant investments are needed to meet needs and provide the opportunity to create local skills and equipment that can be exported at regional level, provided that this is cost-effective. In the majority of the OR, maritime services and port activities can be developed in relation to cruise tourism and sailing tourism, ship maintenance and transit services. To make these developments financially sustainable they need to have a significant positive impact on the provision of local products and services. Most of these developments draw upon the geostrategic position of the islands in the Caribbean sea, in the Atlantic and in the southern Indian Ocean; however, they need to be supported, in most cases, by large investments which, if not properly accompanied or preceded by the appropriate feasibility and market studies, are in danger of ending up as under-utilised infrastructure and imposing a high opportunity cost, thus preventing the regions involved from investing in other infrastructure that may perhaps be more useful. At the same time, personal care services (health, medical and social care) are well developed and supported by skills and research. Their potential for growth in the OR is basically linked to the opportunity to export these services and the skills developed on the local market. The geographical regions where the OR are located have a much lower standard of such services, and this creates opportunities. The geopolitical location of the OR and especially of the French OR and the Canary Islands allows for the development of geostrategic investments to exploit their proximity to key markets in the Caribbean, Latin America, West Africa and the Indian Ocean. This potential needs to be developed through an initial phase of regional cooperation involving local stakeholders, firms and all private-sector operators; once this cooperation provides concrete opportunities to exploit the \u201cgateway\u201d function of the OR (production and external trade), external policies will need to take these opportunities into account. In conclusion, the potential of these sectors and products, and the conditions for their development briefly described above, allow a positive view of the future, provided that the policy choices resulting from them are followed by consistent, systematic implementation in the medium and long term, with a good balance between a radical improvement of the traditional sectors and the creation of a sufficient space for new products and sectors to grow. Finding this balance is probably the most delicate part of the strategy, because resistance and obstacles to change are likely to arise and the policy carried out needs to ensure that change does actually take place, and does so with sufficient speed. To that end, aspirations for change must be shared by the local stakeholders and by the social groups most closely involved, through the creation of appropriate partnerships. Currently, the new sectors are starting to emerge in different ways in the economies of the OR, but they have not yet reached any significant economic size and are not represented in a comprehensive set of \u201cflagship projects\u201d in which the local public and private stakeholders could invest their energies. In brief, the analysis demonstrates that the OR cannot be considered as a uniform whole. Disadvantages can be dealt with satisfactorily with appropriate policy approaches. Minimising disadvantages is therefore not only desirable but also possible. Flagship projects ",
        "13 The study has identified some flagship projects whose implementation would contribute to sustainable growth. Many of these flagship projects relate to the need for urgent interventions, mainly public, to realign the basic infrastructure of the OR to the level of that in the EU: transport, waste management and processing, tourism, education, etc. However, the list of projects reveals common features and needs: - Supporting economic diversification, through activities linked to innovation, and the structuring of key sectors (both traditional and emerging). - The wish to base future economic growth on local natural resources and assets (including agriculture, the sea and biodiversity). - The inclusion of environmental and energy concerns, in particular the need to ensure a greater self-sufficiency in energy through the development of renewable energies and the promotion of energy efficiency. - The rebuilding of the tourism strategy in regions that are already tourist-oriented (the Canary Islands, Madeira, Guadeloupe, Martinique) and a greater emphasis on the tourism sector in the other outermost regions (Azores, French Guiana, R\u00e9union), against the backdrop of the economic crisis, which has a negative effect on the attractiveness of the OR. 6. R ESULTS OF THE STUDY ON DEMOGRAPHIC AND MIGRATION TRENDS IN THE OUTERMOST REGIONS 26 A study entitled \"Demographic and migration trends in the OR: impact on economic, social and territorial cohesion\" was launched by the Commission in 2009 to contribute to enhancing knowledge of these phenomena by providing a tool able to offer for each OR: In more concrete terms, this study should (a) take stock of demographic change and migration (demographic situation, education, employment, economy, health, life conditions, environment and natural resources); (b) analyse the impact of demographic and migration trends, in the short and medium-term, on the economic, social and territorial cohesion; and (c) highlight the main demographic trends and their impact on the economic and social cohesion of these territories, in particular, the threats and opportunities posed by these phenomena, taking into account their specific constraints. 6.1. Current situation of the OR Demographic trends The OR are a very heterogeneous group and share similar characteristics with their mainland countries. The natural growth of the population compared to the EU average is below in Portugal and Madeira and only higher in Azores, Spain and the Canary Islands. In contrast, natural growth in France and the French OR is higher than the UE average because of higher fertility levels. The migratory flows have a strong effect on the shape 26 Carried out by the \"Institut National d'\u00c9tudes D\u00e9mographiques\" (INED), commissioned by the Commission in 2009, and delivered in May 2012. ",
        "14 of the age pyramids of the OR. The Spanish and Portuguese OR have become immigration destinations but the economic crisis deeply affected migration. Meanwhile, Martinique, Guadeloupe, and Reunion Island receive only moderate number of international migrants in contrast to French Guiana, and periodically St Martin, where the crisis has so far relatively little the effect. The flows of irregular migration had considerably decreased prior to the crisis and are currently low scale in Canaries. In French Guiana, St Martin (and, to a lesser extent, Guadeloupe), irregular migration seems less dependent on the economic climate and continues at a significant level. As regards the OR\u2019 \u2018internal\u2019 migration within countries or the EU, the French OR experience much higher \u2018pendular\u2019 migration with their mainland metropolises than the other OR. However, numbers of EU migrants, mostly retirees from Northern EU states, are higher in East Atlantic OR. The migration balance is slightly negative in the French Antilles, but it is highly positive in St Martin and French Guiana. It is somewhat positive in Azores and Madeira and it has recently witnessed a steep decline in the Canaries, due to above mentioned factors. Ageing is one of the major problems facing the French Antilles and the eastern Atlantic OR. In contrast, the main challenge facing French Guiana and St Martin is population growth. Meanwhile Reunion Island faces both ageing and population growth, but at more moderate levels. These population dynamics, and the structural changes the OR experience, have important consequences in several socio-economic domains: increasing needs in education services and job creations for populations experiencing rapid growth in the numbers of young people; the possible drop in the economically active population and rises in health costs for ageing population. Education In socio-economic terms, the eastern Atlantic OR appear more similar to the continent than the French OR to mainland France. In comparison to the continent, a far higher proportion of young people do not complete their secondary education and skill levels are lower. Illiteracy, failure or school dropout reflects a relative inadequacy of the education system, both in quantitative and qualitative terms. The intergenerational reproduction of poverty has an impact on the cultural environment and thus on the relationship to education. Education and the acquisition of skills remain severe problems in the OR. Despite the immigration of skilled people from the continent or from other parts of the EU, the proportion of young adults (30- 34) with higher education diplomas is lower than in the mainland states, partly owing to the sizeable emigration of educated native-born. Migration therefore has a highly selective influence on the skill levels of the working population in the OR. The most skilled leave the French OR whereas a majority of young people with few skills and less potential for finding employment remain in the region. This double selective process partly explains the high level of unemployment, the social exclusion of a high proportion of young people and the continuing need for training. ",
        "15 Employment The low education level of a sizeable section of the OR populations has repercussions on their opportunities within the labour market. In turn, this has an impact on the economic development of these regions. The situation has worsened since the 2008 crisis. Whilst employment remains higher in the Azores and Madeira than in Portugal or than the EU average, in the Canaries, in relation to Spain the economic crisis set off a fall in employment. As a result, unemployment levels in the Canaries are almost at the level of those in the French OR, with rates of about 50% amongst the young active population. Despite a recent increase, unemployment remains at moderate levels in Azores and Madeira. In 2010, apart from the Azores and Madeira, employment rates amongst the economically active population (20-64) were much lower than the EU average. The deficit in female employment rates is particularly strong in French Guiana, the Azores, Reunion Island and the Canaries shows show that it is possible to increase female employment. Reducing unemployment and the exclusion of young people from the labour market would be a means to increasing employment levels. Furthermore integrating young people into the labour market improves their personal social status and prevents them to fall further in \u2018social rupture\u2019 and violence. Employment structure in the OR, with its heavy reliance on the service sector, does not provide many opportunities for less-skilled people. What is at stake with the ageing of the population here is the future increase of effective dependency ratios, the burden falling on the actively occupied population. Such dependency ratios constitute a direct threat to the funding of social policies in the OR in a context in which social policy is decreasingly funded by central state. Economy Until 2000-2001, the GDP per inhabitant in the OR grew rapidly, with average rates of around 6%. (even 8% in the Azores and 11% in Madeira). French Guiana has been an exception, with far lower rates, not due to lower economic growth but to faster population growth than in the other OR. Economic growth slowed in all the regions after 2002, levelling off at around 4% annually until 2007 (but at 6.6% in Madeira). This growth, higher than in mainland states, reduced the gap between OR and the continent. From 2008 onwards, the crisis reversed the trend, except in the Azores and Madeira, and the difference between the EU and the OR started to increase again. The productivity is lower in the OR, especially in the French OR, economic convergence towards the EU averages is far from being achieved, apart from in Madeira, and is being further hampered by the financial and economic crisis. The economies of the OR are focused on the service sector, which represent over 80% of added values. In French Guiana and the Azores, this is slightly lower, at 75%. Whilst tourism plays an important role in the economies of Madeira and the Canary Islands, ",
        "16 with a rate of 4 tourists per inhabitant per year, the sector is little developed yet in the other OR. Agriculture and the food industry are the primary export sector in the OR. They count for 50% of exports on average, 70% for the Azores and Reunion Island, but only 15% for the Canaries. The low added value of these exports means that they cannot counterbalance imports. There is a deficit in trade balance in all the OR, with coverage rates scarcely above 50% in the Azores and Madeira, 22% in the Canary Islands and 10% or less in the French OR. Exports are principally directed to the continent and the proportion directed to neighbouring states remains minimal due to the fact that these are usually developing countries. Households and housing Growth in the number of households has been greater than that of the overall population. This growth is linked to ageing and to the numbers of young people leaving the parental home. The result is a decrease in household size. Whilst economic growth over the last two decades has helped in reducing the quantity of poor housing in the OR, there still remain a substantial proportion of dwellings lacking in the basic utilities (electricity, running water, sewage system). The proportion of social housing units is below or similar in mainland. However, the demand from eligible households is higher, owing to greater levels of poverty. Thus entitlements to public housing outweigh available stock. This is for example the case for single parent families in all OR (except for Azores), more frequent in the French Antilles and French Guiana. These households are proportionately more dependent on social assistance than others. Such living conditions have repercussions on children\u2019s education and often lead to intergenerational reproduction of social exclusion. Health The life expectancy at birth is less in the OR than on the continent, except for Martinique. Infant and maternal mortality rates are higher in the French OR than in mainland France. Mortality caused by cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, digestive problems and tumours is far higher in the Azores, Madeira and Reunion Island than on the continent. Endocrinal and metabolic diseases are a major problem, the rates of mortality as a result of these diseases being at least twice as high in all the OR as on the continent. These findings are a cause for concern, since cardiovascular and endocrinal diseases are chronic diseases, linked to life style and environment. Furthermore, the cost to the health system is high and preventative health measures are in their early stages in the OR. In the French OR, the extension of these \u2018lifestyle diseases\u2019 is taking place in parallel to the continuing prevalence of infectious diseases. The eastern Atlantic OR and Reunion Island are less affected than the continent by the HIV virus, the French Antilles, and French Guiana and St Martin especially, have high rates of HIV infection. Migrant groups are particularly affected. Alcoholism is more often a cause of mortality in OR than in the continent, notably in the French OR, and especially in Reunion; however, it remains a minor cause of death in the Canaries. ",
        "17 Similarly, in the French Caribbean OR (French Antilles and French Guiana), traffic accidents are a higher cause of mortality than on the mainland, but this is not so for the Canaries and Madeira. Part of the excess mortality in the OR can be attributed to the lower education levels. In the French OR, unemployment and social exclusion combine with this, as people delay consulting a doctor until their illness is at an advanced stage. All the OR populations would benefit from wider information campaigns on lifestyle-related diseases and risk behaviours and from health promotion measures. To this end, the capacity of public health actors need to be strengthened. Only the eastern Atlantic regions have similar health resources to those on the continent as regards hospital beds, as well as for the numbers of nurses per inhabitant. The situation is worse in the French OR. Demographic growth means that it will be difficult to catch up with the national levels. Environment \u2013 energy Energy consumption (fuel and electricity) per inhabitant has rapidly grown in the OR during the last two decades owing to the \u2018catching up\u2019 process. Economic growth in general has contributed to this. The OR are highly dependent on outside energy sources. This is the case for virtually all fuel supplies but less so for electricity, as some is produced locally from renewable sources: hydraulic, geothermal, wind power and solar. This policy development to renewable energy opens the way for new technology such as wave power. The aim is to move towards greater autonomy in relation to energy. In some OR, the EU 2020 objective of 20% of energy from renewable sources has already been surpassed as regards electricity production: 70% of French Guiana\u2019s electricity is generated from renewable sources, 33% for Reunion Island and 28% for the Azores. But the likelihood that similar progress can be made for fuel in sufficient quantities is slim. There is an insufficient land area for the production of bio-fuel. Production of bio-fuel from seaweed is still at the experimental stage. Provision of water does not present major problems. There are other problems such as water loss within the distribution networks; or contamination at times of heavy tropical storms. Furthermore, there is still no comprehensive collecting system of wastewater. Recycling, transformation of organic waste into compost and energy recycling (Madeira and Martinique, notably) are becoming more common. Lastly, tropical environments often fall victim to natural disasters. Islands will be increasingly vulnerable to rising sea levels. 6.2. The impact of demographic trends by 2020 and 2030 Demography Until 2020, the populations of the Antilles and Eastern Atlantic OR will grow moderately (3%). This growth will slow over subsequent years and even come to a halt or even decline in the Canary Islands and in Madeira. In contrast, growth will continue at a high level in Reunion Island and particularly in St Martin and French Guiana, with respectively 11%, 28% and 39% more inhabitants in 2020 than in 2010. ",
        "18 The population of the OR is characterized by a demographic ageing, with a slow drop of the proportion of young people and a rapidly increasing older population. The French Antilles will be the first regions to be concerned by the process. By 2020, 20% of their population will be aged 65 or over and the proportion will reach 28% by 2030. In the eastern Atlantic, the proportion will be approximately 15% in 2020 and 20% in 2030. By 2020, senior citizens will outnumber the young age groups in the French Antilles, the Canaries and Madeira, Azores joining the group by 2025. The age structures announce the continued growth of health spending linked to population ageing. French Guiana and St Martin will experience the opposite. The rapid growth of the population will result in a wide-based age pyramid, indicating that there will be an increase in perinatal health needs and in education. Reunion Island will combine both sets of specific needs. Education All the OR will continue to have sizeable education needs in order to increase skill levels. There is a general need to improve the quality of education at all level, to reduce illiteracy and falling behind at school. A real effort must be made to ensure that post- secondary studies available locally, outside the university system. In Portugal, compulsory education will have to be extended to the secondary level in order to increase skill levels. In particular in French Guiana, Reunion island and St Martin the growth in the number children will bring a challenge to the objective to provide universal compulsory education. Employment The ageing populations of the OR will affect the active population. It will result in a drop in numbers of economically active people in the Canaries and the French Antilles and from 2020 in the Portuguese OR. The economically active population thus will be smaller and older in age. The EU 2020 objective for an employment rate of 75% among the 20-64 year olds can only be met if there are sufficient jobs. In the Canaries, the economy must return to its pre-crisis level in order to achieve this objective. In the French OR, given the weak employment rates, the first stage could be to aim for the current EU average (69%) by 2020. It would be necessary to bring unemployment levels down to a structural minimum of 3% for the current EU average to be met in the French Antilles. For the same thing to happen in Reunion Island and French Guiana, unemployment would have to be totally absorbed. Only the Azores, and perhaps Madeira, seem in a position to achieve the EU 2020 objective, but this is only if austerity policies do not reduce employment. Ageing population and the weakness of employment rates in the French OR and in the Canary Islands will result in a worsening of effective dependency ratios. In the absence of any increase in employment by 2030, the French OR will have almost three dependant people for one in work. Such levels are incompatible with the drawing up of social policy measures. Employment growth therefore is vital in the French OR, and of reasonable importance in the Canary Islands. Households \u2013 housing ",
        "19 Over the next two decades, household growth will continue to outweigh population growth. Household heads will be older. Those aged 65 years or more will increase in all the OR and particularly in the French Antilles (from 25% in 2010 to 43% in 2030). In the Canaries, the Azores and Madeira, the proportion will reach 30%. Ageing and also divorce will accelerate the increase in the proportion of female-headed households. Such changes will accentuate the need for social assistance and also for training from women heading single parent households, who have particular difficulties in finding work. Continued growth in the number of households will have an impact on the demand for housing. The growth in the number of housing units will be accompanied by a rise in energy consumption and in household waste treatment. Demand for new housing offers an invitation to developing employment opportunities in two sectors, construction and environment, with the so-called \u2018green housing\u2019. Above all, it is an opportunity to give a new impulse to economic activities, trades and services. Health Future trends in health costs will be principally determined by the ageing population. The population aged 85 years and over will grow more quickly than 75 years and over group in French Antilles and in the eastern Atlantic. In the other OR overall population increase is expected. In general, health costs will rise due to overall ageing. All the regions suffer from a lack of medical personnel. This is one of the major challenges facing the OR. Increased investments in the training of medical personnel, in particular to help them to adapt to technogical changes (telemedicine, eHealth) and to ageing, will be crucial, and could be supported from the European Social Fund. Demographic changes could also allow some economies of scale. Recourse to modern techniques such as telemedicine, which will need considerable investment, appears as a major solution to combat unequal access to health care in the OR. Telemedicine represents a particularly useful solution in archipelagos and areas where the population is highly dispersed or insufficiently numerous to permit the presence of specialists. At the same time, investments in community-based care centres or hospitals may be necessary. For instance, to compensate for the shortage of medium- and long-stay hospital beds, a problem that specifically concerns the French OR, increased investments are required to reduce the need for patient transfers to mainland France. Environment \u2013 energy Islands environments are fragile. Their limited size means that large areas of their territory and coastlines rapidly can become polluted. Environmental protection, including that of sea life, is required so that the population can enjoy a healthy habitat, the biodiversity be maintained and so that the OR can be attractive tourist destinations. There is a need for greater efforts towards sustainable agricultural practices, sewage treatment and disposal of household and industrial waste. Population and household growth will result in increased energy demands. In past years, the main difficultly has been in maintaining the proportion of energy from renewable sources in the face of increasing demand. Investment has been made periodically to ",
        "20 increase the use of renewable sources, (ie: geothermal power stations or the recycling of bagasse). The demand for fuel could rapidly be decreased through the development of hybrid or electrically powered vehicles. Environmental conservation also calls for more efficient sewage and waste disposal systems. Improvement of the networks will need considerable investment. Urbanization programmes, counteracting the dispersal of the habitat, would facilitate such improvements. 6.3. Risks and opportunities: from handicaps to strong points Cohesion The demographic advantage of young age structures that the outermost regions hold over continental Europe is fast diminishing (except Reunion Island, St Martin and French Guiana). The dependency ratios will increase. Most of the regions are behind the EU average as regards social and economic indicators. This is notably the case for education standards, employment, the GDP (except for Madeira), health care and environmental protection. OR need a sustained effort in all domains in order to aim for better social equality and economic development. The effect of the economic crisis has been stronger than in the continent. The EU 2020 objectives are thus out of reach for most of the OR, be it in terms of schooling performances or employment, environmental targets (except for electricity production in some OR). Over the next few decades, considerable efforts must be done in the key domains (education and employment). Education shapes opportunities to access to employment for young people. Increased numbers of jobs is the only solution to maintain effective dependency ratios at a socially affordable level. Education is thus a priority target for investment. There are significant differences between the various sections of the population in terms of skill levels and access to employment. Furthermore single parent families have very vulnerable economic circumstances. The analysis has revealed that the French OR, particular French Guiana and, to a lesser extent, Reunion Island, are faced with a greater challenge to improve social and economic cohesion than the other OR. Risks and opportunities The major problems in most of the regions are linked to ageing. French Guiana and St Martin \u2013 have to face the opposite challenge of rapid population increase. Reunion Island is in the unusual position of being faced by both challenges at the same time. These three OR are the last European regions to be experiencing high fertility whilst beginning to feel the effects of ageing. Theoretically, demographic ageing implies that spending must be directed more towards the older groups rather than toward the young. This will be more complicated to achieve ",
        "21 in the OR because of the need to invest more in education and to increase the number of jobs. The challenges mentioned above can be considered as opportunity on which to base new initiatives, rather than risks. For example: ageing presents an opportunity to set up less costly management of dependant persons; housing demand should encourage activity in the building industry, use of new environmentally friendly technologies and new types of skill; public transport should be developed to ease youth\u2019s access to training and to reduce the isolation of the elderly. Numerous jobs can be created in the environmental protection sector. The demand for energy opens the way for creating new highly qualified jobs in the renewable energy sector. Demographic change can also allow economies of scale. However, some regions will find it difficult to catch up in terms of service provision and infrastructure. In the regions with highly dispersed population, telemedicine, small-scale and local production of energy, through solar or wind power are very good options. The OR should take advantage of these various challenges to position themselves as regions of excellence and contribute to the development of new technologies in partnership with the continent or with neighbouring states or regions. They can become laboratories for testing techniques and their specific application in tropical environments. The same logic can be applied to the prevention of natural risks, as well as to the production of high added-value products from agriculture or farm-fishing. These products and know-how could be exportable to developing countries and emergent countries in their geographical region. However, it is unlikely that the OR will ever achieve true independence in relation to food or energy supplies, owing to their limited surface areas and resources. It is preferable in this instance to talk of \u2018food security\u2019 or \u2018energy security\u2019 by encouraging as far as possible the development of local production combined with more diversification and the safeguarding of supplies at the regional level (regional connections or agreements). In the field of research and innovation (ie: biodiversity of renewable energy, etc), partnerships must be established with teams on the continent and international research centres, especially those located in neighbouring states, in order to achieve the status of \u2018regions of excellence\u2019. The same is applied for the commercialization of the results of these innovations. Individually, the OR do not have the sufficient capacity and resources to achieve this. The OR must be placed at the centre of regional cooperation policies in order to meet these challenges. These regions should have the means to improve their trade links with neighbouring countries, and have access to European funding in their regional partnerships. They also need legislation, adapted to the local context of small enterprises that can help small businesses participate in the research and development sector. Finally, it is necessary to improve the availability of statistical data to assist in planning and management of initiatives. 6.4. Main recommendations to face demographic challenges in the OR 1. Training schemes to assist access to employment; ",
        "22 2. Investment in the research and development the domains of food and energy security; 3. Development of health care services (to the elderly, in relation to chronic diseases and in promoting good health and preventing diseases); 4.

Agriculture, Fisheries and Food Culture of Azores Pineapple* Pineapple production in the Azores dates back to 1864, when it was brought from Brazil. Ananas comosus L. Merr is a monocotyledon from the Bromeliaceae family and the only CAM plant (succulent) with agronomical interest. It is originally produced in open-air fields in tropical areas. For it to be cultivated in the Azores, production was adjusted to a confined environment inside a glass greenhouse, where higher temperature and higher relative air humidity can be reached. Additionally, the Azorean pineapple is produced using biological means of production, without application of chemicals \u2013 namely flower induction is achieved via smoke application, in contrast to hormone (ethylene) application in open- air fields in tropical countries. Furthermore of being an agronomical product of interest, pineapple is also a touristic symbol of the ",
        "37 azorean islands and is therefore, a culture to be preserved, for all its historical and cultural value. Nevertheless, market globalization has brought large quantities of pineapple produced in tropical countries to our local and national markets at a cheaper price. Facing such competition, the Azorean pineapple production has been lowering progressively over the past 20 years. It is thus necessary to find improved techniques and use more cost-effective ways to produce a high quality product to meet consumer\u2019s demands and face competition.

In a holistic approach, research looks for complementary between some animal breeding output and the need of some crops as well as some interactions between different crops in order to reduce and halt the use of pesticides and chemical fertilizers. By the end, some crops associated with some local herbs will be suggested to the farmer, as some way to valorise the output of each activity of the farm. Indeed, production of methanol due to animal breeding output will be study. The first results on the economic sustainability of this kind of farms are very positive. Technical support to foster participation to EU framework program* Research team in Guadeloupe are far from the EU. Despite the excellence of the research developed, they are poorly known by European teams. Further, it is quite difficult to apply to EU framework program. Therefore, in order to foster the integration to the EER, a technical support is proposed to local research teams who would like to be part of an EU framework programme project or apply as a leader for a EU framework programme. Initiated by the regional council of Guadeloupe, the aim is to develop internal capacities at local level on EU framework programme in order to benefit from these financial tools and to reinforce the local research excellence.
