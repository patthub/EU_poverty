        "2 GlobalStat : Thematic Introduction GlobalStat links globalisation to sustainable and human development and analyses it as a phenomenon that goes beyond global economic integration. This broad perspective on globalisation reflects its impact on most different aspects of personal, societal, social, cultural, political, economic and environmental spheres of human lives and interactions. It also highlights the dense linkages between these different areas. The Phenomenon of Globalisation During the 1970s and 1980s, the concepts of \u2018economic and financial interdependence\u2019, \u2018global interdependence\u2019, \u2018internationalisation\u2019, \u2018liberalisation\u2019, \u2018universalisation\u2019 and \u2018westernisation\u2019 1 were widely used to refer to \u201cgrowth in the interaction and interdependence between populations in different countries\u201d 2 . Since the early 1980s, when \u201cnotions of the global appeared roughly simultaneously and independently in several academic fields\u201d 3 , phenomena such as \u2018globality\u2019, \u2018globalism\u2019 and/or \u2018globalisation\u2019 moved to the centre of research across disciplines and theoretical schools, resulting in various conceptualisations. Rooting in this conceptual cacophony, still today \u201cideas of globalisation tend to remain elusive\u201d 4 , if not confusing. The observed lack of clarity precluded an overarching definitional consensus on what globalisation is meant to be. Moreover, efforts to define the phenomenon still overwhelmingly \u201creflect [..] a specific historical context, a given theoretical perspective, certain normative commitments and particular political interests\u201d 5 . In the late 1980s and early 1990s 6 , the argument of \u201chyper-globalization\u201d 7 claimed the \u201cemergence of a single global market\u201d 8 transcending and integrating the world\u2019s major economic regions. While the \u201cneoclassical approach to globalisation assumes the realisation of a global competitive marketplace\u201d 9 as inevitable, the neo-Marxist perspective instead argues \u201cthe victory of structural forces of capitalism over the potential mediatory power of states\u201d 10 , caused by globalisation. Some academics based their analysis of globalisation on \u201cthe types of flows and perceptual connections that occur in spatially extensive networks\u201d 11 , identifying four principal dimensions of \u2018globalism\u2019 according to the kind of network involved: the economic and financial; the military or strategic; the environmental; and the socio-cultural. Others, among them most prominently J. Stiglitz, characterised globalisation as \u201cthe closer integration of the countries and peoples of the world which has been brought about by the enormous reduction of costs of transportation and communication, and the breaking down of artificial barriers to the flows of goods, services, capital, knowledge, and (to a lesser extent) people across borders\u201d 12 . However, other economists more strongly underlined the economic dimension of globalisation, measured by international trade volumes, foreign direct investments, portfolio and bank movements and technological diffusion as the key feature of globalisation. 13 The debate on globalisation also embraces the notion of \u2018spatiality\u2019. This perspective essentially sees globalisation as geographical change, qualified by a \u201ctime-space compression\u201d 14 and the \u201cstretching\u201d 1 Scholte, J. A.

        "3 of social relations that were once hindered by both territory and distance 15 . Here, globalisation is described \u201cas the spread of transplanetary \u2013 and in recent times more particularly supraterritorial \u2013 connections between people\u201d 16 and countries. Globalisation is hence a reconfiguration of social space that allows people and societies to live in their local, regional and national territories, creating trans- border spaces within a single world unit 17 . As such, globalisation involves a \u201cwidening, intensifying, speeding up and growing impact of world-wide interconnectedness\u201d 18 , that can be found in every sphere of human activity. 19 In the late 1990s and early 2000s, evolving economic and financial crises and increasing (economic, political, ecological and social) imbalances between advanced and developing countries provoked a shift in the debate. It assumed the disappearance of the predominant globalisation model already before the 2008 global financial crisis. 20 Contributions to globalisation theory that take up these shifts underline the unequal distribution of the benefits of globalisation among regions and countries of the world. 21 They particularly analyse how \u201cinequality grounded in [historically determined] social structures\u201d 22 can be influenced by or merge into \u201cnew forms of inequality generated by capitalist dynamics\u201d 23 . So, instead of increasing human well-being and reducing inequality through the effects of globalisation across countries, the differences between advanced and developing countries are viewed to still be considerable and particularly visible in areas such as equal participation in wealth, global justice and equity. This line of debate highlights that \u201cglobalisation today is not working for many of the world\u2019s poor [...]. To some, there is an easy answer: abandon globalisation. That is [yet] neither feasible nor desirable [...]. The problem is [however] not with globalisation, but [with] how it has been managed\u201d 24 . Consequently, rethinking and reshaping globalisation to enhance equity as well as participation and to improve global governance structures supportive to overall human development and well-being is identified as an essential feature of the sustainable future of globalisation processes. 25 The Sustainable Development Paradigm Ever since its baptism, the idea of sustainable development became one of the most popular, but also most contested terms both theoretically and in view of its operationalisation 26 . Being a prominent topic of reform debates after the 1970s economic, financial and oil crises, it initially most strongly reflected economic concerns about resource management and resource depletion. Institutionally, it was introduced into the global political debate by the 1972 United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm. Thereafter, it was prominently placed on the international agenda by the United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development in 1987. The Commission\u2019s final report, the so-called Brundtland Report 27 , forms the key reference point for the debate on sustainable development. It defined sustainable development broadly as the development that \u201cmeets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet theirs\u201d 28 . By doing so, it stressed the interrelation between economic growth, environmental sustainability and resource preservation and introduced the idea of inter-generational equity into the premises of economic activities. The Brundtland Report laid the ground for both the 1992 United Nations Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro that adopted a global action plan on environmental sustainability (the so- 15 Held, D./McGrew, A./Goldblatt, D./Perraton, J.

        "4 called Agenda 21) and the 2000 United Nations Millennium Summit that established eight explicit development goals (the so-called Millennium Development Goals that formed the basis for the current Sustainable Development Goals), one of which was the integration of the sustainable development concept into national policies and programmes (Target 7.A). The conceptual core of sustainable development is formed by its two key components: \u2018sustainability\u2019 and \u2018development\u2019. Defining \u2018development\u2019 has always been a contentious issue since the term refers to \u201ca web of key concepts [...] such as poverty, production, the notion of the state, or equality\u201d 29 . Its definitions have not been fixed over time, but rather followed the political and ideological competition of different systems of thought and action across countries and regions 30 : During the 1970s both neoclassical and neo-Marxist economists \u201cshared the view that development [was] something centred on a process of transformation in the productive sphere\u201d 31 . From the 1980s onwards, however, \u201cdevelopment has come to mean poverty reduction, provision of basic needs\u201d 32 , health improvements, human development, and, from a procedural point of view, a \u201cmultifaceted, nonlinear, adaptive and ongoing process\u201d 33 . \u2018Sustainability\u2019, on the other hand, has become one of the buzz words of present day policy-making and governance. In its conceptual origins it was characterised by the \u201ccombination of three [independent] dimensions, [...] namely, the environmental (ecological), economic and social dimensions\u201d 34 . As mentioned above, initially, sustainability assumptions more strongly focused on (environmental) issues of resource depletion as a constraint to economic growth. The concept of \u2018weak sustainability\u2019 reflects this early binary attention on the economy and the environment that originated in an extension of neoclassical growth models \u201cto account for non-renewable natural resources as a factor of production\u201d 35 . Since the beginning of the new millennium however, the need for a more integrated perspective on sustainability has been recognised. A broader conceptualisation was deemed necessary to reflect the interrelatedness of social, economic, ecologic, political, cultural, ethical and technological factors. Moreover, the relevance of an institutional component for a comprehensive sustainability framework came to the fore. 36 Linked to this conceptual broadening, the idea of \u2018strong sustainability\u2019 proposed a more critical analysis on natural resources\u2019 availability and substitutability. It claims the existence of critical thresholds for the consumption of natural resources to avoid resource depletion and/or exhaustion. The \u2018strong sustainability\u2019 approach prescribes preserving \u201cmany different environmental items\u201d 37 , or at least maintaining critical levels necessary to \u201ckeep reasonable levels of environmental resilience, i.e. the capacity of eco-systems to regenerate and return to equilibrium after shocks\u201d 38 . In this understanding, \u201csustainability refers, in a broad sense, to the notion of the durability and stability of dynamic processes in the long run\u201d 39 . It highlights the interconnection of co-existing natural and human systems over time. Conceptually, it not only embraces a multidimensional policy perspective on priorities. It also brings the temporal dimension of inter-generational (\u201cguarantee that the choice freedom of future generations is not compromised by myopic decisions of the preceding generations\u201d 40 ) and the social dimension of intra-generational (\u201cmeant to guarantee equal 29 Sachs, W.

In this multifaceted integrated perspective, sustainability is yet also viewed to be a tricky mission to accomplish. Based on the complexity and sophistication of its two key components, the concept of sustainable development is surrounded by a vibrant debate about its own inherent definitional ambiguity. Understanding sustainable development in the broad sense of a multidimensional integrated perspective that embraces both intra- and inter-generational considerations, a variety of policy areas are affected by and affect the concept, and globalisation in turn. Given that \u201cthe well-being of future generations compared to ours will depend on what resources we pass on to them, future well-being will depend upon the magnitude of the stocks of exhaustible resources that we leave to the next generations. It will depend also on how well we maintain the quantity and quality of all the other renewable natural resources that are necessary for life\u201d 42 . Yet, although both the \u201cdesirability and necessity of making development sustainable\u201d 43 are increasingly accepted, the measurement of sustainable development poses theoretical and technical challenges to be addressed 44 . Its multidimensionality and divergent views on risks to be faced as well as goals to be achieved complicate the development of a comprehensive and coherent measurement framework for sustainability at national, regional and global level. 45 Moreover, the heterogeneity of interrelated factors, uncertainties about projections and the lack of collective action 46 to define and provide at least a subset of agreed global public goods 47 in the economic, environmental and social domains of sustainability, require careful stock-taking. Therefore, analysis, research and a reliable statistical basis are fundamental to properly approach sustainable development. 48 GlobalStat: Structural Approach With these different aspects of globalisation and sustainable development in mind, an informed analysis of both phenomena and their drivers needs to pay attention to the interconnectedness of different areas that are relevant for both processes. GlobalStat takes this need as a starting point for collecting, harmonising and presenting data from a broad range of international statistical sources and on a broad range of topics. Accounting for the multidimensional and multilevel nature of the two phenomena hence stands at the heart of GlobalStat . GlobalStat \u2019s structure is sensitive to most relevant elements of globalisation and sustainable development that have repercussions on the overall performance of the international community, international organisations and institutions, multilateral fora, networks, actors and, in the end, the nation state. With this approach, GlobalStat seeks to contribute to a better understanding of the interrelations between human (living) conditions and trends in globalisation to provide the basis for a sustainable view on the latter. Directing the attention not only to economic and political aspects associated with globalisation, but also to its vital environmental, social and societal aspects, GlobalStat adds a broad perspective on globalisation to the public information process. Besides focusing on the economic, environmental, political, social as well as societal performance of nations, its declared \u2018beyond GDP approach\u2019 also provides information on the way human beings live, the freedoms they enjoy and the limitations they face. This perspective contributes to the analysis and overall understanding of the globalisation dimensions of political, economic, environmental, social and societal change and challenges for the future. In a nutshell, GlobalStat collects, unites and harmonises most important statistical resources 41 Ibid.. 42 Stiglitz, J./Sen, A./Fitoussi J.-P. (2009a), p. 61. 43 Neumayer, E.

Given that quality of life and human well-being include \u201cthe full range of factors that make life worth living, including those that are not traded in markets and not captured by monetary measures\u201d 49 both official statistics and subjective data are considered. In doing so, GlobalStat follows the insight that \u201cmeasuring all these features requires both objective and subjective data\u201d 50 . Moreover, global trends are taken up to highlight potential futures. This is a key facet of GlobaStat \u2019s broad perspective on globalisation, as sustainable development, based on its inter-generational component, \u201cposes the challenge of determining whether we can hope to see the current level of well-being at least maintained for future periods or future generations, or whether the most likely scenario is that it will decline. [So, presenting statistical data on globalisation and sustainable development] ... is no longer [only] a question of measuring the present, but of predicting the future\u201d 51 . GlobalStat \u2019s website provides all users with a comprehensive set of data and a facilitated access to data collected by many different sources. The main sources of information are UN level institutions and bodies. Country level data relate to a long period, which begins, wherever possible, in the 1960s and continues to the present day. GlobalStat presents the most important categories and indicators of existing databases as well as datasets. Its indicators are disaggregated as far as possible.

        "7 In view of its content, GlobalStat grows over time. Data is constantly amended and updated to keep the information provided up-to-date both in terms of areas covered and latest data available. Transparency and accountability of GlobalStat\u2019 s data collection and aggregation methods are essential to make data easy to use, understand and compare. Therefore, the comprehensive methodological guide outlined in the next chapter provides a full explanation of the statistical methodologies applied within GlobalStat . GlobalStat : Methodological Guide United Nations Membership & Country Classification by Geographical Regions GlobalStat provides data on the 193 sovereign nation states that are recognised members of the United Nations (UN). UN membership is based on compliance with the UN Charter (see Art. 4 UN Charter) and states are admitted to the UN by decision of the UN General Assembly upon the recommendation of the UN Security Council. To ensure political neutrality, GlobalStat \u2019s design is based on this country selection. The designations used by GlobalStat and the presentation of data hence follow the internationally agreed UN practice and do not represent the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of the database developers concerning the legal status of communities, countries, territories and areas or of their authorities, or in view of the delimitation of their frontiers or boundaries. Moreover, the integration of countries into groups or groupings follows established statistical practices and does not involve any assessment in view of their political or other affiliation by GlobalStat . Given that some official statistical bodies also offer data for state federations that ceased to exist in the 1990s, in some cases, in addition to the 193 UN member states, data for Czechoslovakia, Serbia and Montenegro, the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is provided until the date of their dissolution. The underlying motive for this extension is to provide as much data as possible even if this increases the complexity of data tables. This differentiation of data by the original sources results in two ways of displaying data and of calculating aggregates either in a static or a dynamic way (please see below). The static display of data shows all countries of the data set, from the beginning of the time series onwards, with no (former) state federations included. The dynamic way of displaying data offers data for (former) state federations until the date of their dissolution and displays data for their successor states only thereafter. The choice of either way of displaying data depends on the type of the data provided by the original sources. Annex I provides the full list of all 193 UN member states and four former state federations that form GlobalStat \u2019s sample. They are listed in alphabetical order under the continents they belong to. The composition of the continents follows the UN definition of macro geographical regions that broadly overlaps with the earth\u2019s geographic continents. Each country is grouped under one continent only. Moreover, their respective three-digit ISO 3166-1 numerical code is displayed under \u2018ID\u2019 52 . This three-digit code is used by the Statistics Division of the United Nation Secretariat for statistical processing purposes and might be useful additional information also for GlobalStat users. Groups and Aggregations GlobalStat gives an overview on the performance of the earth\u2019s macro geographic regions (continents) as defined by the UN and for various forms of global governance.

        "8 provides aggregate figures for the world, the five continents, eleven regional cooperation and integration communities as well as international organisations and for two development status groups. This portfolio of aggregations does not seek completeness; this means that the list of regional cooperation and integration communities is not exhaustive and that other cases exist and can be calculated by users based on the data provided by GlobalStat . The groups presented by GlobalStat represent a selection of key regional integration patterns with different characteristics. All these cases form important global and regional governance structures that influence the way in which nation states interact within the overall process of globalisation. Their integration into GlobalStat aggregate groups shall provide additional information about the performance of nations within functional contexts of global governance. Regional Cooperation, Integration Communities & Intergovernmental Organisations Regional cooperation and integration communities are key pillars of GlobalStat \u2019s data aggregation. They constitute central processes by which nation states engage in rules-based regional collaboration to support each other, increase stability, enhance development and foster prosperity. They form the regional structural, functional and political patterns of the global governance system and frame interactions between states within and/or between regions. Regional cooperation and/or integration communities hence form central patterns of the organisation of global politics. Typically, regional cooperation and/or integration take their starting point in economic and trade activities. Thus, aspects of political economy form important reference points for their existence. Apart from deeper cooperation in selected policy areas, regional integration also leads to institution- building and structural change within regional policy-making that in turn supports further and deeper integration. In this way, regional cooperation and integration also re-impact on globalisation. They not only contribute to an increase in economic activities between states and across world regions. They also facilitate the free movement of goods, capital, persons and/or labour across nation state borders and the development of common standards in the areas of collaboration. In most cases, regional cooperation and/or integration are treaty- or agreement-based processes that a) involve new structural and procedural forms of regional organisation of contacts between sovereign nation states and that b) evolve in parallel to the traditional national political systems. The degree and depth of cooperation and integration vary from community to community. They can be organised through different forms of supranational structures (leading to a deeper state of regional integration) or intergovernmental decision-making (structuring a form of collaboration in which national governments are key actors). In some regional integration communities, nation states opted for a mix of both patterns in order to share national sovereignty and operate through common institutions. In terms of focus and functions, regional cooperation and integration communities vary substantially between trade integration and support for economic growth in general; enhancement of peace, security and regional stability; public sector development and good governance; and political integration and civil society development. GlobalStat \u2019s selection of regional cooperation and integration communities as well as international organisations gives an overview on the variety of different regional integration patterns, aims, objectives and performances around the world. It provides insight into regional differentiation and differences of governance structures. In doing so, it offers information on the quality of regional cooperation and integration and allows for comparison between different communities and different stages of community-building. As mentioned above, the selection of groups does not provide a finite list of cases and, based on their different and diverse characteristics, comparability of results is naturally limited. GlobalStat provides aggregate data for the following regional cooperation and integration communities as well as international organisations. The full list of member states and the timelines of country membership to each of them is presented in Annex II. ",
        "9 African Union The Organisation of African Unity (OUA) was established on 25 May 1963 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. It was legally transformed into the African Union (AU) on 26 May 2001. The key priorities of the OAU are the promotion of unity and solidarity among African States as a response to the legacies of colonialism and apartheid. The African Union broadened its focus from supporting liberation movements under colonialist regimes and apartheid to the promotion of Africa\u2019s development and integration. Among its main objectives are the defence of territorial integrity and independence, the promotion of peace and stability in the African continent, the promotion of democratic principles, human and peoples\u2019 rights as well as the promotion of sustainable development to raise the living standards of African peoples. It comprises 55 members and has received a standing invitation to participate as observer in the UN. It does maintain a permanent office at UN Headquarters. Andean Community / Common Market of the South / Union of South American Nations The Andean Community (AC) is a customs union comprising the four South American countries, five associated members and one observer country. It was founded by the Cartagena Agreement in 1969. The Common Market of the South (MERCOSUR) was established with the Treaty of Asunci\u00f3n on 26 March 1991. It is a Latin American trade organisation that promotes economic cooperation among the countries of South America and aims at tariffs reduction and trade facilitation. It comprises six full and six associate members. The Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) is an intergovernmental union integrating the full members of the two previous integration communities (Andean Community and MERCOSUR) plus three additional countries (two of which also belong to CARICOM). UNASUR was established on 23 May 2008. It focuses on deepening regional integration in the fields of energy, education, health, environment, infrastructure, security, democracy as well as economic and social development. Among its priorities are the elimination of economic inequalities and the improvement of living standards. UNASUR currently comprises twelve member states. The Andean Community and UNASUR have received a standing invitation to participate as observer in the UN, but do not maintain permanent offices at UN Headquarters. Within GlobalStat , the three different regional integration communities are incorporated into one aggregate figure given that UNASUR was founded based on the two other communities. This means that, statistically, the group that represents UNASUR is the temporal continuation of the timelines for the Andean Community and MERCOSUR. In order to calculate a longer timeline of aggregate figures for Latin American regional integration, all three communities were hence grouped in one single aggregate to give insight into the quality of regional integration over time. This \u2018super\u2019-group is created only for technical reasons of aggregate calculation and does not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever concerning the legal status of regional cooperation and integration, communities, countries, territories/areas or of their authorities, as well as in view of the delimitation of their frontiers/boundaries by the database developers. Association of Southeast Asian Nations The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) was established on 8 August 1967 in Bangkok, Thailand. It is an intergovernmental organisation with its main priorities and aims listed in the ASEAN Declaration. They include economic growth, social progress and cultural development of a peaceful community of Southeast Asian Nations; the promotion of regional peace and stability through justice and the rule of law; assistance and collaboration in matters of common interest (largely in economic, socio-cultural, and scientific-educational as well as administrative-technical fields); and agricultural, industrial and trade cooperation. Particular attention is given to economic development in all domains in order to raise the living standards of the people within its member states. ASEAN is based on the principles of non-interference, peaceful conflict settlement, and renunciation of use ",

Caribbean Community and Common Market The Caribbean Community and Common Market (CARICOM) was established in 1973 as the result of a 15-years long process of regional integration among Caribbean states and territories, which started with the establishment of the British West Indies Federation in 1958 and the Caribbean Free Trade Association (CARIFTA) in 1968. Main aims of CARICOM are the improvement of living and working standards; the promotion and cooperation for sustainable economic and development; the expansion of trade relations with third countries; and the coordination of its member states' foreign and [foreign] economic policies, through the creation of a single common market. It comprises 15 member states and five associate members and has received a standing invitation to participate as observer in the UN. It maintains a permanent office at UN Headquarters. Central American Integration System The Central American Integration System ( Sistema de la Integraci\u00f3n Centroamericana /SICA) was established in 1991 through the Protocol to the Charter of the Organization of Central American States (ODECA), known as the Tegucigalpa Protocol. The Protocol amended the 1962 ODECA Charter and formally came into force in 1993. SICA aims at improving the integration of Central America. It provides an institutional framework for regional intergovernmental integration and foresees the set-up of a common market and a political union among its member states. Internal and regional democratisation is a key priority of the system, as is the establishment of a customs union and an area of free movement of persons, capital and services. SICA\u2019s main objectives are the consolidation of democratic institutions; the eradication of extreme poverty; the promotion of sustainable development; and the fight against violence, corruption, terrorism, drugs and arms trafficking. SICA currently comprises eight member states, plus nine regional and 17 extra-regional observers. It has received a standing invitation to participate as observer in the UN and maintains a permanent office at UN Headquarters. European Union The European Union (EU) is a regional economic and political integration community that originated in the 1952 European Coal and Steel Community as well as the European Economic Community, created by the Treaty of Rome in 1957. The 1993 Maastricht Treaty established the EU as a political union based on three key areas (European Communities; Common Foreign and Security Policy/CFSP; and Justice and Home Affairs/JHA). Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) was launched and also European citizenship introduced by the Maastricht Treaty. Treaty changes by the 2009 Lisbon Treaty constitute the latest step of the EU\u2019s constitutional development and its overall institutional structure. The EU focuses on a broad range of policies that can be assessed as a state- like agenda for a regional community characterised by deep transnational integration structures. It applies a mixture of supranational and intergovernmental instruments as well as governance modes and can be regarded as the politically most advanced and deepened version of the existing regional integration communities. It currently comprises 28 member states. Five countries hold accession candidate status and two are potential accession candidates. The EU has received a standing invitation to participate as observer in the UN and maintains a permanent office at UN Headquarters. League of Arab States The League of Arab States or Arab League is a regional intergovernmental organisation of countries in Africa and the Middle East, whose peoples are mainly Arabic speaking. It was established in 1945 in Cairo, Egypt. Its key aims are to strengthen cooperation between its member states and to ",
        "11 coordinate their policies in the fields of education, finance, law, trade, and foreign affairs. Since 2015, also the creation of a joint military force is on the League\u2019s agenda. Moreover, common affairs and interests are collectively considered, through joined political, economic, cultural, scientific and social programmes. The Arab League also serves as a forum for conflict settlement within the Arab world given that its founding protocol rules out the use of force to settle disputes between member states. The League currently comprises 22 member states and 4 observer countries. Syria\u2019s participation as a full member has been suspended since November 2011 so that the League currently only counts 21 active member states. The Arab League has received a standing invitation to participate as observer in the UN and maintains a permanent office at UN Headquarters. North Atlantic Treaty Organization The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is a task-specific intergovernmental political and military alliance based on the 1949 North Atlantic Treaty. NATO\u2019s primary aim is to secure freedom and safeguard security of its members through political and military cooperation and means, such as consultation on defence and security issues or (military or non-military) crisis-management operations. NATO currently has 29 member states. Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) originates in the Organization for European Economic Cooperation (OEEC) established in 1948 to run the US- financed Marshall Plan for the post-World War II reconstruction of Europe. The OECD itself was founded in 1961 as an international intergovernmental organisation to stimulate economic progress and cooperation. It offers governments a forum for experience-sharing and policy-learning. Among the organisation\u2019s key aims are evidence-based analyses and recommendations; the measurement of productivity as well as global trade and investment flows; the setting of international standards; and the identification of future and long-term challenges. It promotes the collection of information and data on a broad range of topics; provides governments with policy analyses for improving economic growth and financial stability; and generally targets the enhancement of economic and social well- being. OECD activities cover a wide range of policies from agriculture and fisheries, over corruption, chemicals, competition, development, governance, economic policies, education and research, environment, health towards finances, green growth, industry, migration, social security, taxes and trade. The OECD comprises 36 member countries. The OECD has received a standing invitation to participate as observer in the UN, but does not maintain a permanent office at UN Headquarters. Organization of American States The inter-continental Organization of American States (OAS) was established in 1948 by the Charter of the OAS. The Charter entered into force in December 1951 and witnessed several treaty revisions since the 1960s. The Organization roots in the International Conference of American States first held in 1889. It focuses on the promotion of solidarity between its member states; the maintenance of peace and justice in the region; the consolidation of democracy; peaceful conflict settlement; the strengthening of collaboration among members; and the promotion of development including the eradication of extreme poverty. Its thematic pillars are democracy, human rights, security and development. The Organization serves as a political, juridical and social regional governmental forum and employs political dialogue, cooperation (such as electoral observation, trade negotiations, natural disaster mitigation and development projects) and legal cooperation (such as on anti-corruption, criminal matters and cyber-crime). It has 35 member states of the Americas and 70 permanent observers. The OAS has received a standing invitation to participate as observer in the UN, but does not maintain a permanent office at UN Headquarters. ",
        "12 Development Status The development status of countries forms the other important pillar of data aggregation within GlobalStat . As globalisation, in a narrow sense, is largely defined as the increase of interweavement of economies in view of trade, financial transactions, capital flows and technological as well as innovation transfers, it is assessed to heavily impact (positively or negatively) on the development of countries. Hence, presenting data aggregated according to the development status of countries offers interesting insights into the differentiation in development across levels of development. Dominant criteria defining the development status of countries are economic development (in terms of GDP and GNI per capita) and trade patterns; the degree of industrial and technological development; infrastructural quality; as well as education, health and living standards. Nevertheless, no uniform official definition exists to qualify and/or classify countries according to their development status. GlobalStat provides aggregate data for the two groups \u2018Least Developed Countries\u2019 as well as \u2018Developed and Developing Countries\u2019, as defined below. In Annex II the full timeline of countries entering and exiting each group is provided. Least Developed Countries (LDCs) Within the UN system, \u2018Least Developed Countries\u2019 (LDC) is a precisely defined group of countries, whose composition changes over time. The establishment of the category of LDCs was approved by the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) and endorsed by the UN General Assembly in 1971. It stems from previous consultations within UN agencies and was advocated by the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in order to target financial support at least developed countries and areas around the world. The list of LDCs is reviewed every three years by ECOSOC\u2019s Committee for Development Policy (CDP) on the basis of graduation criteria, which have been amended various times since 1971. They include a measure of per capita income (GNI per capita); measures of human development (nutrition, health, school enrolment and literacy); and indicators of economic vulnerability (merchandise export concentration; instability of agriculture production; instability of exports of goods and service; victims of natural disasters). Currently, the group of LDCs includes 47 countries. The periodic UNCTAD reports on LDCs provide the UN with an instrument to signal the need for targeted support to overcome this group\u2019s structural problems. LDCs are granted concessions particularly in the areas of financing, technical assistance and preferential trade concessions. So far, five countries have graduated from LDCs status (Botswana in 1994, Cape Verde in 2007, Maldives in 2011, Samoa in January 2014, and Equatorial Guinea in 2017). Developed & developing countries (D&DCs) Within the UN system, there is no established convention to define countries and areas as \u2018developed\u2019 or \u2018developing\u2019. Generally, the UN defines Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, the United States of America together with the majority of European countries as \u2018Developed Countries\u2019, while the other UN members in Africa, the Americas, in Asia and in Oceania fall under the category of \u2018Developing Countries\u2019. For some specific statistical purposes, such as international trade statistics, Israel is defined as a \u2018Developed Country\u2019; the Southern African Customs Union is considered as \u2018Developed Region\u2019; and the successor states of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia are considered as \u2018Developing Countries\u2019. Countries of Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States are not included under any of the two categories. GlobalStat follows the UN practice in view of the application of the terms \u2018developed\u2019 and \u2018developing\u2019 countries that are ",
        "13 intended for statistical convenience and do not embody an assessment of the overall level of development of a particular country. Concerning aggregate data for \u2018Developed and Developing Countries\u2019 GlobalStat adopts a definition ex negativo : this means this group includes all countries that are not part of the \u2018Least Developed Countries\u2019 group at any given year. GlobalStat\u2019s Aggregation Rules GlobalStat \u2019s aggregation rules are set to yield estimates for a consistent set of countries from one period to the next and for all indicators. Small differences between sums of subgroup aggregates and overall totals and/or averages may occur because of the approximations used. In addition, compilation errors and data reporting practices of original sources may cause discrepancies in theoretically identical aggregates (for example between world exports and world imports). Although GlobalStat \u2019s criteria for calculation (see below) avoid publishing aggregate data which suffer from an excess of underlying missing data at the country level, provided aggregates should always be treated as approximations of unknown totals or average values. Aggregate figures are shown in the website whenever GlobalStat \u2019s calculation routines offer results. Missing aggregate data due to insufficient underlying original data are not shown and, in such cases, the respective group is not shown in the indicator website. A dynamic approach GlobalStat provides aggregates for a total of five continents, the entire world, two development status groups, eleven regional integration communities and international organisations. As outlined in the previous section, continents and development status groups are defined according to UN criteria. The definition of regional integration communities and political entities is taken from the original sources. Countries\u2019 regional classification is usually stable over time. Geographical boundaries are static over time, with the relevant exception of countries succeeding the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), which currently belong part to Asia and part to Europe. To keep trace of dissolutions, separations and the formation of newly independent states according to the UN timeline of states\u2019 recognition and admission, GlobalStat calculates dynamical regional aggregates in cases the original sources offer data in such a format (e.g. it includes Czechoslovakia in Europe until its dissolution in 1993, when Czech Republic and Slovakia stepped in). Membership to regional communities and organisations is dynamic by definition and changes over time due to admissions and withdrawals of countries from one year to another. Therefore, for any given year, aggregates for regional cooperation and integration communities as well as international organisations reflect the real group composition, considering only those countries that are members in the given years. This approach might make comparability over time delicate, but it guarantees that the composition of each group truthfully represents and measures reality at any point in time. Due to this dynamic definition, aggregates for entities are not calculated when the indicator is not released on a yearly basis (non-annual indicators). The same applies to continents, but only for the period 1990-2010 when the dissolutions of the four state federations explained above took place. Criteria for calculation Following international statistical practice, GlobalStat provides the calculation for aggregates if two conditions are met: - The indicator is available for more than one half of the members of the group, otherwise the aggregate value is not calculated (and set to missing) ( Condition 1 ); ",
        "14 - In case Condition 1 holds, the aggregate value is calculated only if the total population of member countries for which data are available represents at least two-thirds of the total population of the group ( Condition 2 ). Finally, aggregates for Asia and Europe are set to missing in those years in which the USSR (if present in the data set derived from the original source) has non-missing and non-zero values. This choice is made because the geographical borders of the USSR are shared between the two continents, but there is no way of disentangling the USSR\u2019s contribution to either continent in terms of the calculated indicator. However, publishing an aggregate value for Europe and Asia which excludes the contribution of the USSR\u2019s territories falling inside their continental borders would be distortive. Therefore, a prudential approach is adopted that considers Condition 1 and 2 as not satisfied for Asia and Europe every time the USSR appears with non-missing, non-zero values. Methods of calculation Condition 1 and 2 outlined above must always hold. Moreover, GlobalStat applies two types of calculation, according to the type of data available: - Aggregates of country-level data expressed as absolute values are calculated as sums. Missing values are not imputed. - Aggregates of country-level data expressed as ratios (rates, proportion, percentages) are calculated as weighted averages of the underlying indicator. Averages are weighted by total population counts or by the value of the denominator of the ratio. Missing values are not imputed. For non-annual series weights are calculated as period averages from the underlying annual values. Data Consistency Differences in the data collection practices and methodologies of the original sources may result in inconsistencies among the data displayed for the various indicators within GlobalStat . Therefore, when consulting GlobalStat , users should be aware of this \u2018multi-source\u2019 particularities of the database and be cautious when combining and comparing data of different indicators as they potentially vary according to their time series specificities, reporting intervals and data collection practices. Moreover, as GlobalStat relies on different official sources, updates and potential revisions over time may eventually introduce data inconsistency in some parts of the database. ",
