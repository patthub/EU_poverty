        "Foreword Sustainable development in the European Union 4 Foreword of First Vice President Timmermans and Commissioner Thyssen Our planet faces important economic, social and environmental challenges. To tackle these, the UN Sustainable Development Goals define global priorities and aspirations for 2030. This represents an unprecedented opportunity to eliminate extreme poverty and put the world on a sustainable path. The 17 goals reflect European values and provide a political opportunity to promote the European socio-economic model. The European Union has been strongly committed to reaching an ambitious outcome at UN level with a universal agenda for all countries, rich and poor alike, fully integrating the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainability. The European Union will continue to lead the way in achieving these goals. Our long-term policy agenda must bring about a systemic change in which economic growth, social cohesion and environmental protection go hand in hand and are mutually reinforcing. The 2030 Agenda will shape our internal and external policies, ensuring the EU plays its full part. This vision will define our actions, be it our growth strategy or social agenda, our energy and climate goals, our environmental ambitions or our research and innovation programmes. We want to make sure that all of our policies balance social, economic and environmental considerations and contribute to a good standard of living for all Europeans, within the limits of our planet.

The global Sustainable Development Goals will also help to shape the way we measure and report on progress. Eurostat has important responsibilities in this respect. This publication Sustainable development in the European Union \u2014 A statistical glance from the viewpoint of the UN Sustainable Development Goals provides an overview of where the EU and its Member States stand in the areas relevant for sustainable development, and in this way it will contribute to better informed decisions for a sustainable European future.

        "Foreword Sustainable development in the European Union 6 Foreword of Eurostat\u2019s Director-General The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and their related targets, approved in September 2015 by the UN General Assembly, provide a new policy framework worldwide towards ending all forms of poverty, fighting inequalities and tackling climate change, while ensuring that no one is left behind. Sustainable development has long been part of the political agenda of the European Union. This publication is released at the same time as the European Commission Communication on \u2018 Next steps for a sustainable European future: European action for sustainability \u2019. The Communication shows the significance of the SDGs for Europe and explains how the EU contributes to reaching them. This publication builds on Eurostat\u2019s long experience in monitoring the EU Sustainable Development Strategy. It provides a statistical glance at the current situation in the EU and its Member States, but now from the viewpoint of the SDGs. Each SDG is analysed through a limited number of indicators looking at the overall ambition of the goal in an EU context. I hope that this publication provides useful insights that will help achieve the SDGs from an EU perspective. Eurostat will continue monitoring progress towards sustainable development in the European Union and is committed to providing high-quality statistical information for this purpose.

        "Introduction: The EU and the Sustainable Development Goals About this publication Eurostat\u2019s publication Sustainable development in the European Union \u2014 A statistical glance from the viewpoint of the UN Sustainable Development Goals provides an overview of the current situation of the EU and its Member States on sustainable development in relation to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This is done in light of the \u20182030 Agenda for Sustainable Development\u2019 ( 1 ) adopted on 25 September 2015 by the UN General Assembly. The publication is structured along the 17 SDGs which are at the core of the 2030 Agenda. Sustainable development is a fundamental and overarching objective of the EU, enshrined in Article 3 of the Treaty on European Union. Since 2005 and up to 2015 Eurostat has regularly produced biennial monitoring reports of the EU Sustainable Development Strategy (EU SDS), based on the EU set of Sustainable Development Indicators (SDIs). The EU SDS was adopted by the European Council in June 2001 and was then renewed in June 2006 ( 2 ). Measuring progress towards sustainable development was an integral part of the EU SDS. Eurostat also monitors the Europe 2020 Strategy ( 3 ), which promotes smart, sustainable and inclusive growth in the EU. This publication is meant as an ad hoc publication, bridging Eurostat\u2019s series of monitoring reports of the EU SDS with future regular monitoring of the SDGs in an EU context, foreseen to start in 2017. It is released simultaneously with the Commission Communication \u2018 Next steps for a sustainable European future: European action for sustainability \u2019, which demonstrates the significance of the SDGs for the European Union and explains how the EU contributes to reaching them ( 4 ). This publication follows a strictly descriptive approach, presenting a purely statistical picture based on facts and figures.

        "Introduction: The EU and the SDGs Sustainable development in the European Union 10 cover all relevant EU policies in the context of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, neither all aspects of the SDGs. A brief presentation of the 2030 Agenda opens the publication. This is followed by 17 thematic chapters, one for each of the 17 SDGs. The overview of the indicators presented in this publication and notes on methods and sources are included in the annex. The publication presents data for the EU-28 as a whole and its individual Member States, and where available for the countries of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), candidate countries and potential candidates. In addition, comparisons between the EU and other major economies in the world (for example, the United States, Canada or Japan) are included when data are available. In general the analysis focuses on the situation in the most recent year for which data are available, except for a short textual description of EU-28 trends. For the analysis of trends, the period from 2000 or 2002 up to the most recent year for which data are available (generally 2014 or 2015) is considered. The publication includes 51 indicators, presented to reflect the broad objectives and ambitions of the SDGs, interpreted in an EU context. Each SDG is represented through up to four indicators. Contextual indicators are used in some chapters to provide further details on a specific issue, deepen the analysis and reflect the scope of the SDGs more broadly. The indicators have been selected taking into account their relevance from an EU perspective, country coverage, data freshness and quality. With a few exceptions, the indicators stem from already existing indicator sets monitoring EU policies, such as the EU Sustainable Development Indicators ( 5 ) and the Europe 2020 headline indicators. Some indicators from the UN global list ( 6 ) have also been included when relevant. The indicators do not aim at representing the importance of particular targets in the 2030 Agenda, as these are of equal significance. Elements of the 2030 Agenda that are less relevant for the EU because they focus on other parts of the world (for instance where targets specifically refer to developing countries) are not considered. The publication does not prejudge in any way the indicators that will be proposed for a future monitoring of the SDGs and the related targets. In addition, the indicators used in this publication do not cover means of implementation elements under each SDG, as their measurement is normally outside the scope of official statistics. One exception is made for SDG 17, which is solely focused on means of implementation and global partnership for sustainable development and for which one indicator on official development assistance and one on imports from developing countries are shown. This publication is based on official statistics which are available in Eurobase, Eurostat\u2019s online database. Data are obtained from official European Statistical ( 5 ) http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/sdi/indicators ( 6 ) The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development foresees that the goals and targets are followed up and reviewed using a set of global indicators, complemented by indicators at the regional and national levels. In March 2016, the UN Statistical Commission agreed as a practical starting point on an indicator list containing 241 indicators for global monitoring. This global indicator list has been developed by an Inter-Agency and Expert Group on SDG indicators (IEAG-SDGs) (for details see the next section \u2018The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development\u2019). The global indicators aim to monitor all 169 targets in all their aspects (and not directly the goals, as for Eurostat\u2019s publication), which thus results in a long list of 241 indicators. A selection of these indicators has been used for the \u2018 Sustainable Development Goals Report 2016 \u2019 prepared by the UN system for global monitoring. ",
        "Introduction: The EU and the SDGs Sustainable development in the European Union 11 System (ESS) sources such as the EU Labour Force Survey (EU LFS) or the EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU SILC) as well as administrative sources. External sources from other international organisations such as the European Environmental Agency (EEA), the World Bank and OECD are used for a few indicators as well as for presenting international comparisons on existing Eurostat indicators. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development builds on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) ( 7 ), the Rio+20 UN Conference on Sustainable Development ( 8 ) and the follow-up of the 2002 Monterrey Financing for Development Conference ( 9 ). The 2030 Agenda addresses poverty eradication and the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development together, underpinned by good governance. One of the components of the 2030 Agenda is the definition of a mechanism for follow up and review, which calls for the development of a global indicator framework. Keeping track of progress in a systematic and transparent way is essential for delivering the 2030 Agenda, by highlighting progress as well as challenges, by demonstrating good practices to accelerate implementation, by ensuring continued commitment, ownership and partnership, and by ensuring transparency, inclusivity and accountability to stakeholders. The 2030 Agenda provides for follow up and review at national, regional and global level. The development of an indicator framework for monitoring progress towards the SDGs is a technical process guided by the United Nations Statistical Commission (UNSC) ( 10 ). For that purpose, in March 2015 the UNSC established an Inter-Agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IEAG-SDGs) ( 11 ). In December 2015, the IAEG- SDGs submitted a report ( 12 ) to the Statistical Commission, including an Annex with a list of 241 proposed indicators ( 13 ) to measure global progress towards the 169 targets of the SDGs. The Statistical Commission agreed on the indicator list at its 47th meeting in March 2016, \u2018as a practical starting point [\u2026] subject to future technical refinement\u2019 ( 14 ). The IAEG-SDGs is currently working to refine the indicator list and to improve data availability. Progress in this respect will be presented to the 48th UNSC meeting in March 2017. In June 2016 the UN released a first SDG ( 7 ) Millennium Summit of the United Nations (2000), United Nations Millennium Declaration . ( 8 ) See: http://www.uncsd2012.org. ( 9 ) See: http://www.un.org/esa/ffd/monterrey/MonterreyConsensus.pdf ( 10 ) The United Nations Statistical Commission, established in 1947, is the highest body of the global statistical system. It brings together the Chief Statisticians from member states from around the world. It is the highest decision-making body for international statistical activities especially the setting of statistical standards, the development of concepts and methods and their implementation at the national and international level. ( 11 ) The IAEG-SDGs was established by the UNSC with the aim of developing a proposal for a global monitoring framework. It consists of technical experts from 27 UN Member States representing all UN regions and, as observers, representatives from regional and international organisations and agencies.

        "Introduction: The EU and the SDGs Sustainable development in the European Union 12 report ( 15 ) providing a benchmark for progress. The report gives an overview of progress on each of the 17 SDGs using around 50 indicators from the global indicator framework for which data are available. The 2030 Agenda also mentions the possibility that global indicators are supplemented by additional indicators for regional and national reporting. Member States may thus have to develop their own indicators sets, while indicators for thematic monitoring are already considered in a number of areas ( 16 ). Not all of the proposed global indicators are available yet, and data gaps exist not only in developing but also in developed countries. Filling these gaps requires financial resources as well as knowledge-sharing and investments in human capital. A High-level Group for Partnership, Coordination and Capacity-Building for post- 2015 monitoring (HLG), comprising representatives from national statistical offices, civil society and international organisations, is mandated by the UNSC to foster global partnership and promote capacity building in the monitoring of sustainable development indicators. The EU is actively contributing to the establishment of an SDG monitoring system at global, regional and national level. The EU will take the lead in reporting on implementation at EU level and measuring the progress being made internally, as well as the contributions the EU makes to global progress. The availability of quality data is essential for informed decision-making as well as for the accurate tracking of progress towards the 2030 Agenda. However, the monitoring of the SDGs represents a serious challenge even for Europe \u2014 arguably one of the most statistically advanced regions of the world \u2014 especially concerning data availability for measuring progress.

        "Overview of key trends This section provides an overview of the key trends across the 17 SDGs observed at EU level for the indicators analysed in this publication. A more comprehensive analysis of the current situation in EU Member States can be found in the following thematic chapters. NO POVERTY Almost every fourth person in the EU \u2014 23.7 % of the population \u2014 is at risk of poverty or social exclusion (2015 data). This is a slight improvement on the 2005 situation, when 25.8 % of the population were at risk. Of those at risk, almost one third or 38.4 million people are affected by more than one dimension of poverty. The most widespread form is relative monetary poverty , which affects 10.2 % of the population. Still, the rate of relative monetary poverty in the EU is lower than for other G20 Member States such as the United States, Turkey and Mexico ( 1 ). ZERO HUNGER Organic farming makes up 6.2 % of the EU\u2019s agricultural land (2015 data). The share has grown from 3.6 % over the past decade, with a slower rate of conversion in recent years. On agricultural land, the EU has an average nitrogen surplus of 51 kilograms per hectare (kg/ha), which can lead to environmental pollution (2013 data) ( 2 ). However, some countries such as Estonia, Bulgaria, Latvia and Austria have phosphorus deficits that could threaten soil fertility. The most intensive livestock production in the EU occurs in the Netherlands, Malta and Belgium at rates of 2.74 \u20133.57 livestock units per hectare (LSU/ha), while most Member States have a livestock density below 1.50 LSU/ha (2013 data).

        "Overview of key trends Sustainable development in the European Union 14 GOOD HEALTH AND WELL-BEING Girls born in the EU in 2014 can expect to live 83.6 years, which is 5.5 years longer than boys. Despite the observed gender gap, this is a steady increase for both sexes since 2004. Among the advanced economies globally, Japan has the highest overall life expectancy for boys and girls. 21.6 % of the EU population believe their health is very good and more than two thirds say it is good or very good (2014 data). These levels are similar to those reported in 2007. The share of the EU population reporting limited access to health care due to financial constraints has increased by 0.3 percentage points since 2008, reaching 2.4 % in 2014. QUALITY EDUCATION The EU\u2019s share of early leavers from education and training stands at 11.0 % (2015 data). This is an improvement of 4.3 percentage points since 2006. About one sixth to almost one quarter of 15-year-old EU children show insufficient abilities in reading, mathematics and science as measured by the OECD\u2019s PISA study (2012 data). The smallest share of low achievers is in science, which has shown the strongest progress since 2000, followed by reading and then maths, which has been improving the slowest. The EU\u2019s overall share of low achievers in reading, maths and science is similar to that of the United States, but exceeds the shares of low-achieving pupils in Japan and Korea. People who have completed tertiary education make up 38.7 % of the EU population aged 30 to 34 (2015 data). This means a significant increase since 2002 when only 23.6 % of the population had achieved this level. More people have also been taking part in adult education. In the EU, 11.7 % of women and 9.7 % of men aged 25 to 64 participate in lifelong learning (2015 data). This is a 4.0 and 3.1 percentage points improvement since 2002 for women and men, respectively. GENDER EQUALITY The EU\u2019s gender pay gap stands at 16.1 % (2014 data). This is an improvement compared to 2006 when the gap was 1.6 percentage points higher ( 3 ). Women hold 29 % of seats in national parliaments across the EU on average (2016 data). This shows positive, albeit slow progress since 2003 when the share was 20 %. The situation varies significantly between Member States. ( 3 ) The 2006 figure refers to the EU-27. ",
        "Overview of key trends Sustainable development in the European Union 15 CLEAN WATER AND SANITATION The biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) is an indicator of organic pollution in rivers and the effectiveness of water treatment. According to data from 18 Member States BOD fell by 20.4 % between 2002 and 2012, indicating a steady improvement in water quality. Although most Member States do not have a problem with access to sanitation and hygiene, in the few countries that are affected by this issue, about 12 million people or 2.4 % of the EU population still lack access to basic sanitation facilities within their households (2015 data). The situation has improved since 2005 when 3.7 % of the EU population ( 4 ) lacked basic sanitation facilities. AFFORDABLE AND CLEAN ENERGY Renewable energy makes up 16.0 % of gross final energy consumption in the EU (2014 data). The share has almost doubled since 2004 when it was only 8.5 %. The EU\u2019s energy productivity has improved by 26.2 % since 2000, reaching EUR 8.2 per kg of oil equivalent in 2014. Although the share of persons that cannot afford to keep their house adequately warm in the EU decreased by 1.5 percentage points between 2007 and 2015 ( 5 ), 9.4 % of the EU population is still unable to keep their home warm. DECENT WORK AND ECONOMIC GROWTH Real GDP per capita in the EU grew by 1.0 % per year on average between 2000 and 2015. This is comparable to growth rates in other advanced economies, such as the United States, Canada and Japan, but considerably lower than the rate observed in Russia. 70.1 % of people aged 20 to 64 are employed in the EU (2015 data). This is a substantial increase compared to 2001 when the employment rate was 66.9 %, but is still slightly lower than the pre-crisis level of 2008. Long-term unemployment has also deteriorated, reaching 4.5 % in 2015 \u2014 1.5 percentage points above the 2007 level. 15.8 % of young people aged 18 to 24 in the EU are neither in employment nor receiving further education and training (2015 data). This is one percentage point lower than in 2002. The share increased between 2008 and 2012 as a result of the economic crisis. ( 4 ) 2005 data refer to the EU-27. ( 5 ) 2007 data refer to the EU-27. ",
        "Overview of key trends Sustainable development in the European Union 16 INDUSTRY, INNOVATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE The EU spends 2.04 % of its GDP on R&D (2014 data). This represents a moderate improvement since 2000, when the EU\u2019s R&D intensity was 1.79 %. At the global level, other advanced economies such as South Korea, Japan and the United States still outperform the EU in terms of this indicator. The performance of EU Member States measured by the eco-innovation index ranges from around 50 in Bulgaria to 167 in Denmark (2015 data). Nordic EU countries as well as Ireland, Germany and Luxembourg can be considered as eco-innovation leaders, whereas central and eastern European countries as well as Greece, Cyprus and Malta lag behind. Employment in high- and medium-high technology manufacturing accounts for 5.7 % of total employment in the EU (2015 data) and shows a marginal decrease from 2008 (5.9 %). 95 % of EU enterprises have a fixed or mobile broadband access to the internet (2015 data). This is a considerable increase since 2007, when only 77 % of EU enterprises had access. REDUCED INEQUALITIES GDP per capita in the EU is EUR 26 500 (2015 data) ( 6 ), which represents an increase of EUR 3 600 compared to 2000. Regional GDP per capita dispersion (the ratio between the richest and poorest regions) ranges from 7.8 in the United Kingdom to only 1.6 in Finland (2014 data). The household gross disposable income per capita in the EU stands at 21 629 purchasing power standards (PPS) (2015 data). Nineteen Member States have decreased the distance to the EU average since 2004, but the EU still lags behind other advanced economies in the world such as the United States, Australia, Canada and Japan. High-income earners in the EU earn about five times more than low-income earners (2015 data). This distribution has barely changed since 2010. However, compared with other G20 countries, the EU still has the lowest income quintile share ratio . ( 6 ) The indicator is calculated using GDP in chain-linked volumes normalised to 2010 prices to show the development over time excluding inflation. ",
        "Overview of key trends Sustainable development in the European Union 17 SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND COMMUNITIES Between 2000 and 2014, the concentration of particulate matter (PM 10 ) to which urban population in the EU is potentially exposed has decreased by 21.6 % and stands now at 22.5 micrograms per cubic meter (\u00b5g/ m 3 ), which is well below the annual limit value of 40 (\u00b5g/m 3 ). The EU recycles (including composting) 43.5 % of its municipal waste (2014 data). This represents an important shift towards sustainable waste management compared to 2000, when only 25.2 % of municipal waste was disposed of in this way. However, about three quarters of Member States still recycle less municipal waste than the EU average. One in five or 20.4 % of people in the EU report \u2018high\u2019 or \u2018very high\u2019 levels of difficulty in accessing public transport (2012 data). Location appears to have a big impact as less than 10 % of people living in cities experience \u2018high\u2019 or \u2018very high\u2019 levels of difficulty in accessing public transport. RESPONSIBLE CONSUMPTION AND PRODUCTION EUR 2.00 of gross domestic product (GDP) are generated for every kilogram of material consumed in the EU (2015 data).

This is a reduction of 2.3 tonnes since 2000. On average the EU generates 1 806 kilograms (kg) of waste (excluding major mineral waste) per capita (2014 data), which is a favourable decline compared to 1 907 kg per capita in 2004. CLIMATE ACTION The EU reduced its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 23 % between 1990 and 2014. Compared with other industrialised countries, the EU is leading in GHG emission reductions after the Russian Federation. The global average near-surface temperature has increased significantly since the start of the 20th century and regularly hits new records. When compared to pre-industrial times, the average temperature over the period 2006 to 2015 has risen by 0.84\u00b0C ( 7 ). This means that almost half of the warming towards the 2\u00b0C threshold ( 8 ) has already taken place. In Europe , the current decade is the hottest on record, at 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial times. ( 7 ) EEA (2016), Global and European temperatures , HatCRUT4 data.

Nevertheless, the EU falls short of its target of allocating 0.7 % of its GNI to ODA. Most EU countries, which have all adopted individual ODA targets (0.7 % of GNI for those that joined before 2004, and 0.33 % for those that joined later), have not yet fully met their commitments. The EU collectively provides more ODA than the other members of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) combined ( 11 ). With imports from developing countries valued at EUR 834.9 billion in 2014, the EU is the world\u2019s most open market for developing countries. Fuels excluded, developing countries\u2019 exports to the EU surpass their exports to the USA, Canada, Japan and China combined. Considerable progress in this direction has been achieved since 2002, when EU imports from developing countries were valued at EUR 358.8 billion. The EU is also the largest importer of goods from least developed countries, the overall share of imports from these countries being 2.3 % in total EU imports.

        "1 No poverty Sustainable development in the European Union 22 Rationale for the indicators presented SDG 1 includes the goal of halving the number of people living in poverty based on national definitions. In the EU, three main aspects are considered: monetary poverty, limited access to labour markets and material deprivation. These are aggregated in the indicator people at risk of poverty or social exclusion , which encompasses individuals affected by one or more of these problems. By referring to both monetary poverty and social exclusion, the indicator highlights other issues, in addition to relative low income, that can put people at a disadvantage. It also emphasises that these issues are closely interlinked. Combined, they reflect the extent to which parts of the population are at risk of exclusion and marginalisation from economic, social and cultural activities that other people regularly participate in. SDG 1 also calls for the eradication of extreme poverty. The UN describes extreme poverty as having to live on less than USD 1.25 per day, which was updated to USD 1.90 per day in 2015 ( 1 ). While these are good measures for detecting the poorest on a global scale, they apply less to the EU, which has a higher standard of living. Tackling poverty is important for reaching the ambitions of other SDGs. Poverty can harm people\u2019s lives and severely limit their opportunities by affecting their health and well-being. It can also lower their children\u2019s educational outcomes. This can further cause a long-term loss of economic productivity and hamper inclusive and sustainable economic growth. The indicators presented in this chapter are also used for monitoring EU policies, in particular the Europe 2020 Strategy ( 2 ) and the EU Sustainable Development Strategy ( 3 ). ( 1 ) The poverty line of USD 1.90 a day is mainly used to track extreme poverty at the global level, and to measure progress on global goals set by the World Bank, the United Nations and other development organisations.

( 7 ) People living in households with very low work intensity are people aged 0\u201359 living in households where the adults worked 20 % or less of their total work potential during the past year. There are large disparities in the three indicators across EU countries, although a similar pattern can be seen for the indicators monetary poverty and severe material deprivation . Regarding these two indicators, rates are generally lower in northern and western Member States and higher in eastern and southern Member States. Overall, 10.2 % of the EU population are at risk of monetary poverty. This rate is lower than in many G20 countries such as the United States, Turkey and Mexico ( 6 ). The share of people living in households with very low work intensity ( 7 ), does not reveal the same regional distribution as the monetary poverty and severe material deprivation indicators. The share of those living in households with very low work intensity is for the most part lower in eastern EU Member States than in the other countries. A low share in one form of poverty or social exclusion does not necessarily imply a low value in another, which is the case for some eastern Member States. These disparities can be explained by different factors influencing the three sub- indicators: the overall economic development of a country affects the threshold at which one is considered monetarily poor; the standard of living may impact the number of materially deprived; and the state of the labour market can influence the number of households with very low work intensity.

        "2 Zero hunger Sustainable development in the European Union 28 Rationale for the indicators presented Food security and the elimination of hunger are central aspects of SDG 2. The goal also considers improving nutrition, which is vital for a healthy and productive society. But because EU countries have largely overcome these challenges, this chapter focuses on another main aspect of this SDG, for which developed countries can become leading examples, namely promoting sustainable food production systems. Sustainable agriculture is not only important for ensuring that the natural resources upon which the agricultural economy depends are treated cautiously but also for ensuring food security and ending hunger, which are all addressed by SDG 2. Having a high share of area under organic farming is often seen as an important contribution to sustainable agriculture. It helps protect natural resources and biodiversity by prohibiting the use of synthetic pesticides and fertilisers, growth hormones, antibiotics and genetically modified organisms. Compared with conventional farming, it enhances soil health and natural fertility and reduces indirect use of energy and water. However, it is often less productive. Gross nutrient balance on agricultural land can also provide insights into agricultural sustainability by giving an indication of production intensity. In areas of intensive livestock production, for example, high levels of manure often lead to surpluses of nitrogen and phosphorus in the environment. These nutrients leach into surface water and groundwater, causing pollution and over-fertilisation, which harm water quality and biodiversity. Intensive cropping systems that use a lot of fertiliser can cause the same problems. At the same time, soils that face nutrient deficits are more threatened by degradation and erosion. Intensive livestock production is often associated with harmful environmental impacts that undermine sustainable agriculture. High total livestock density can lead to high greenhouse gas emissions, nutrient surpluses, the spread of antibiotic-resistant microbes, and animal welfare issues. In Europe, intensive livestock production often relies on imported feed, which has been shipped over long distances with no knowledge of the methods used to produce it and whether these might impact biodiversity, water quality and soil health in its region of origin. On the other hand, extensive, pasture-based livestock production can benefit the environment by increasing farmland-specific biodiversity as well as carbon stocks and humus levels in the soil. Very low or falling livestock densities can indicate land abandonment and the loss of traditional pastures in Europe ( 1 ). The indicators presented in this chapter are also used for monitoring the EU Sustainable Development Strategy ( 2 ). ( 1 )( 2 ) ( 1 ) It has to be noted that national average values in gross nutrient balance and livestock density cannot be relied on to provide useful insights because high intensity of agriculture and its associated negative impacts mostly occur locally. This means that low values in these indicators do not automatically mean that no intensive agriculture exist in the country assessed. ( 2 ) See http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/sdi/indicators ",

In contrast, organic farming is not strongly developed in countries such as Malta, Ireland and Romania, with shares below 2 %. Regional differences exist. Organic farming particularly occurs in regions with extensive livestock production systems based on permanent grassland. However, it is less likely in regions with large areas of plains where more intensive production systems prevail. Among the countries with the largest areas of utilised agricultural land \u2014 Spain, Germany, France and the United Kingdom ( 4 ) \u2014 the area under organic farming varies between 8.2 % and 2.9 %.

On average, the current nitrogen surplus is 51 kg/ha ( 5 ). While still high, the surplus has fallen by 12 kg/ha in the EU since 2000. ( 5 ) ( 5 ) Refers to an EU-28 estimate for 2013. There is a large variation in nitrogen surpluses across Member States. In the two Mediterranean island countries, Cyprus and Malta, and the Benelux countries, nitrogen surpluses are two to four times higher than the overall EU figure. In contrast, Romania reports a slight nitrogen deficit (\u2013 1 kg/ha) and the Baltic countries along with Bulgaria and Hungary only have a small surplus (ranging from 22 kg/ha to 28 kg/ha). High nitrogen surpluses often coincide with high livestock densities and a dominance of intensive agricultural practices in such countries. Persistent nutrient surpluses indicate that an area may be at threat of environmental pollution. With the exception of Lithuania and Latvia, most countries with a low nitrogen surplus also report a phosphorus deficit , in particular Estonia, Bulgaria, Sweden, Hungary and Romania. These countries are at particular risk of continuous soil degradation. A high phosphorus surplus is reported in the Mediterranean countries Cyprus and Malta, and to a lesser extent Croatia. Nitrogen surpluses in EFTA countries Norway and Switzerland are above the EU average. Both countries also show a slight phosphorus surplus.

In Malta, however, both the total and the grazing livestock is decreasing. The structure of agriculture diff ers between and within countries. Livestock production can be very high locally or regionally, but be levelled out by the national average.

The indicator life expectancy at birth is a conventional measure of a population\u2019s general health and overall mortality level, and provides an insight into the quality of care available. However, longevity is not the only guide to well-being. The absence of disease or sickness, measured through a forecast of healthy life years , is also a relevant aspect. Health is strongly linked to other areas related to sustainable development. It is influenced by environmental issues, such as air quality, and by socio-economic factors such as living conditions. Good health is also necessary for a person to be productive and have the resources to contribute to communal life. Thus a healthy population also ensures added value for the economy and society. To reach the overall objective of ensuring healthy lives, SDG 3 also includes specific well-being targets such as reducing illnesses and deaths from pollution, decreasing injuries due to road traffic accidents, prevention and treatment of substance abuse, and implementing the WHO Tobacco Control. The indicator self-perceived health , which records people\u2019s assessment of their own health, offers a good overview as to whether efforts in these areas are providing results. Universal health coverage is another central issue for SDG 3. Limited access to health services not only places a burden on a person\u2019s health but also on a country\u2019s productivity and social protection systems. The extent to which adequate health coverage for all is achieved can be measured with the indicator unmet needs for medical care . It reveals the share of the population that has difficulty accessing medical examinations or treatments because of a lack of money. The indicators on life expectancy at birth, healthy life years and self-reported unmet needs for medical care are also used for monitoring the EU Sustainable Development Strategy ( 1 ).

        "3 Good health and well-being Sustainable development in the European Union 35 Girls born in the EU in 2014 can expect to live 83.6 years, 5.5 years longer than boys (78.1 years) . Despite the gender gap, this is a steady increase for both sexes since 2004. A global comparison shows that life expectancy is higher in Japan, South Korea, Australia and Canada ( 2 ). However, when it comes to disability-free life expectancy (or life expectancy without activity limitation), measured in healthy life years, there is only a small gender gap. Girls can expect to spend 61.8 years in good health compared with 61.4 years for boys ( 3 ). This shows that while women tend to live longer than men, they are on average likely to spend a greater share of their lives with a disability.

The upper end of the scale is dominated by some Mediterranean and northern EU countries, where life expectancy reaches at least 83.6 years for females and 78.0 years for males. Girls can expect to live the longest in Spain (86.2 years) and boys in Cyprus (80.9 years). In contrast, some countries that joined the EU in 2004 or after report the lowest levels of life expectancy for both sexes. Boys born in Latvia and girls born in Bulgaria can expect to have the lowest life span in the EU, 69.1 years and 78.0 years, respectively.

Differences in healthy life years across the EU are even greater than for life expectancy. Girls in Malta and boys in Sweden have the highest number of expected healthy life years , 74.3 years and 73.6 years respectively. These two groups can expect to live more than ten years longer without disability or disease than the EU average. At the other end of the scale, boys in Latvia and girls in Slovakia are expected to live 9.9 and 7.2 years less in good health, respectively, than the EU average. Interestingly, although girls in Bulgaria have the lowest life expectancy among EU countries, they are expected to spend more years in good health compared to the overall EU figure. These figures show that the expected number of healthy life years differs by almost 20 years for females and 22 years for males across Member States. ",
        "3 Good health and well-being Sustainable development in the European Union 37 Self-perceived health 21.6 % of the EU population perceives their health to be very good . While this appears not to have changed from 21.6 % in 2007 ( 4 ), the rate had actually been increasing steadily between 2008 and 2012 before falling again. Furthermore, two thirds of the population judge their health as being either good or very good , a value that had also been more or less increasing continuously between 2007 and 2012 before decreasing again slightly.

The average number of people judging their health as very good is almost ten times higher in the Member State with the highest rates than the one with the lowest. People in Cyprus, Greece and Ireland , which all have healthy life expectancy above the overall EU figure, are most likely to perceive their health as being very good , with 45.3 %, 44.8 % and 42.9 % of the respective populations falling into this category. In contrast, the Baltic countries and Portugal have the lowest share of people reporting very good health (under 11 % each). Despite women having a longer life expectancy than men, they are less likely to rate their health as being very good or good in all Member States. This gender gap can be observed in all age groups; however, it is lowest for 16 to 24 year olds and generally increases with age. With 32 % to 40 % of their populations reporting that they feel in very good health, the EFTA countries Iceland, Switzerland and Norway are below the leading EU Member States on this indicator. ",
        "3 Good health and well-being Sustainable development in the European Union 38 In more than half of Member States, less than 1 % of the population reports difficulty accessing medical care due to monetary constraints. This share is lowest in Austria, Finland, Slovenia and the United Kingdom (less than 0.1 % of their respective populations). While in the EU less than 3 % of people report having problems accessing health care due to lack of money, in some Member States health care access seems to be a bigger challenge. In Latvia and Greece, where access to health care is most often restricted by financial means , the rate is around four times higher than the overall figure for the EU. These countries also have a relatively high share of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion and a high share of private household out- of-pocket expenditure on healthcare ( 6 ). Interestingly, while Greece ranks higher than most EU Member States in terms of life-expectancy and self-perceived health, the opposite holds true for Latvia. Therefore, no straightforward link between life expectancy and unmet needs for medical care can be identified. 2 0 1 4 2.4 % of the EU population reports limited access to health care due to financial reasons ( 5 ) 2008 data refer to EU-27. ( 6 ) See health care expenditure by financing agent (online data code: hlth_sha_hf). Self-reported unmet needs for medical care Throughout the EU, 2.4 % of the population reports limited access to health care due to monetary constraints . This is slightly higher than in 2008, when 2.1 % ( 5 ) of the population reported their needs for medical care were unmet due to their financial situation. Although this share decreased between 2008 and 2009, it started increasing again in 2010.

        "4 Quality education \u2018Obtaining a quality education is the foundation to improving people\u2019s lives and sustainable development. Major progress has been made towards increasing access to education at all levels and increasing enrolment rates in schools particularly for women and girls. Basic literacy skills have improved tremendously, yet bolder efforts are needed to make even greater strides for achieving universal education goals. For example, the world has achieved equality in primary education between girls and boys, but few countries have achieved that target at all levels of education.\u2019 Source: United Nations, www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/education/ Sustainable development in the European Union 41 Scope of SDG 4 \u2022 Ensure that all children complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education. \u2022 Ensure access to quality early childhood development, care and pre-primary education for all children. \u2022 Ensure equal access to affordable and quality technical, vocational and tertiary education. \u2022 Increase the number of youth and adults having relevant skills for employment, decent jobs and entrepreneurship. \u2022 Eliminate gender disparities in education and ensure equal access to all levels of education. \u2022 Ensure achievement of literacy and numeracy. \u2022 Ensure acquisition of the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development. \u2022 Build and upgrade education facilities and provide a safe, non-violent and inclusive learning environment. \u2022 Expand the number of scholarships for enrolment in higher education available to developing countries. \u2022 Increase the supply of qualified teachers.

        "4 Quality education Sustainable development in the European Union 42 Rationale for the indicators presented An inclusive and quality education for all is an essential element of sustainable development. SDG 4 calls not only for all girls and boys to have access to primary and secondary education but also to be able to complete their schooling. The indicator early leavers from education and training provides an insight into progress towards these objectives by measuring the share of a country\u2019s population aged 18 to 24 who have at most lower secondary education and are not in further education or training. Leaving school early has a big impact on people\u2019s lives. People with a low level of education may not only face greater difficulties in the labour market but also have a higher risk of poverty and social exclusion. SDG 4 focuses on both granting greater and more equitable access to education and training and ensuring its high quality. An important objective of this goal is that education systems deliver high levels of numeracy and literacy and enable other foundational skills to be acquired. The indicator on low achievers in reading, maths and science provides key insights into the performance of school systems and pupils\u2019 basic skills attainment. Basic skills, such as reading a simple text or performing simple calculations, provide the foundations for learning, gaining specialised skills and personal development. These skills are also essential for people to fully participate in and contribute to society. SDG 4 also demands affordable and quality tertiary education for all women and men. The indicator on tertiary educational attainment helps to directly monitor this goal. Tertiary education is important because people with higher qualifications are more employable and are less likely to face poverty in a knowledge-based economy. Investing efficiently in education and training systems that deliver high-quality and up-to-date services lays the foundation of a country\u2019s long- term prosperity. On the other hand, low levels of tertiary education can hinder competitiveness and undermine the potential for growth. Increasing the number of youth and adults who have relevant skills for employment is another aim of SDG 4. Underpinning the ongoing quest for a high- quality labour force with up-to-date skills is the goal of lifelong learning ( 1 ). Adult education and training covers the longest time span in a person\u2019s learning process. After an initial phase of education and training, lifelong learning is crucial for improving and developing skills, adapting to technical developments, advancing a career or returning to the labour market. The indicator on participation in lifelong learning is important for monitoring this aspect of SDG 4. The indicators presented in this chapter are also used for monitoring EU policies, in particular the Europe 2020 strategy ( 2 ) and the EU Sustainable Development Strategy ( 3 ). ( 1 ) Lifelong learning is the lifelong, voluntary and self-motivated pursuit of knowledge for personal or professional reasons. The overall aim of learning is to improve knowledge, skills and competences. The intention to learn distinguishes learning activities from non-learning activities such as cultural activities or sports activities.

        "4 Quality education Sustainable development in the European Union 43 The overall share of people aged 18 to 24 in the EU who are early leavers from education and training is 11.0 % ( 4 ). This is a considerable improvement over 2006, when the rate was 4.3 percentage points higher. An individual\u2019s country of birth strongly influences the rate of early leaving from education and training across the EU. People who study away from the country in which they were born tend to find it more difficult to complete their education . On average, people born outside the EU are two times as likely to leave education and training early than people studying in their country of birth.

The rates are even higher for those born in a non-EU country . The United Kingdom, Ireland, Lithuania, Latvia and Hungary are exceptions, with people born outside the EU showing considerably lower rates of early leaving than the other groups for which data are available. In the Netherlands and Malta people born in another Member State have the lowest rate of early school leaving among the three groups, whereas in Hungary the rate is the same for people born in the country and in another Member State.

Performance in reading and mathematics is even poorer, with 17.8 % and 22.0 % shares of low achievers among 15-year-old EU citizens, respectively. Achievement in science has shown the strongest progress at the EU level since 2000, while improvement in mathematical competences has been the slowest. Compared to other advanced economies in the world, the EU\u2019s overall share of low achievers in reading and science is similar to that in the United States, but slightly lower for maths. However, the share of low-achieving pupils in the EU exceeds those in Japan and Korea, which are below 12 % and 10 %, respectively. ( 5 ) PISA is an international study launched by the OECD in 1997.

        "5 Gender equality Sustainable development in the European Union 52 Rationale for the indicators presented SDG 5 calls for the end of all forms of discrimination against women and girls. Many women experience some sort of discrimination or inequality in their private or public life. One area where this persists is the labour market. The gender pay gap , measuring the average difference in aggregate gross hourly earnings of women and men, is often used to gain an insight into progress towards tackling inequalities. A significant part of the gender pay gap is due to the fact that women are over-represented in lower paid industries. However, other factors also play a role. These include vertical segregation in the labour market, traditions, stereotypes and unequally distributed care responsibilities. The result of the gender pay gap is that women tend to earn less over their lifetime. This can affect future pension rights and may result in women being more prone to experiencing poverty in old age. SDG 5 also calls for women\u2019s full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all decision-making levels in political, economic and public life. The indicator on women\u2019s representation in national parliaments helps to monitor these priorities. Women make up more than half of the EU population and electorate, yet they continue to be under-represented in decision-making positions at all levels ( 1 ). Equal participation by women and men in decision-making is a matter of justice, respect for human rights and good governance. It is needed to better reflect the composition of society, to strengthen democracy and allow it to function properly ( 2 ). The indicator on gender pay gap is also used to monitor the EU Sustainable Development Strategy ( 3 ). ( 1 ) According to Recommendation Rec(2003)3 of the Committee of Ministers to Member States on balanced participation of women and men in political and public decision-making, the representation of either women or men should not fall below 40 %.

        "6 Clean water and sanitation Sustainable development in the European Union 58 Rationale for the indicators presented SDG 6 sets the challenge of achieving good water quality, safe drinking water and healthy water ecosystems. Important insights into whether water is suitable for basic and commercial uses can be gained using the indicator biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) in rivers. BOD measures the amount of oxygen required for microbiological decomposition of organic compounds in water. It can be used as an indicator of organic pollution in rivers and the effectiveness of water treatment. High BOD levels may indicate faecal contamination or impaired ecosystem health. Another objective of SDG 6 is to achieve adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and to end open defecation. This ambition mainly focuses on the situation of developing and least developed countries. For capturing the situation at the EU level, the indicator on population having neither a bath, nor a shower, nor indoor flushing toilet in their household can be considered as the most appropriate one for this objective. The availability of basic sanitation facilities is crucial for a healthy life and people\u2019s well-being. Households without sanitation facilities are considered to be severely deprived. The BOD indicator is also used to monitor the EU Sustainable Development Strategy ( 1 ). ( 1 ) See http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/sdi/indicators ",

        "7 Affordable and clean energy Sustainable development in the European Union 64 Rationale for the indicators presented To achieve the aim of SDG 7 of ensuring an affordable and clean energy system, the share of renewable energy in total energy consumption needs to increase. Renewable energy sources are ones that are practically inexhaustible or renew within a human lifetime. In contrast, fossil energy sources regenerate over millions of years and are the main source for man-made greenhouse gas emissions, thus contributing significantly to climate change. Energy productivity is another main pillar of an affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy system envisaged in SDG 7. A more efficient energy system reduces the energy used to provide services and products. This means it also reduces costs, dependencies and environmental impacts linked to energy supply and use. The energy productivity indicator measures the amount of economic output that is produced per unit of energy used. SDG 7 also emphasises the need for universal access to energy services. This can be limited due to factors such as low household income, high energy costs and low energy efficiency. The indicator on self-reported inability to keep home adequately warm is used here as a proxy and supports the monitoring of energy affordability. The indicator on renewable energy is also used to monitor EU policies, in particular the Europe 2020 strategy ( 1 ) and the EU Sustainable Development Strategy ( 2 ).

Wind and solar energy are also increasingly contributing to rising shares of renewable energy in final energy consumption in EU countries. At the lower end of the range are the Benelux countries, as well as the United Kingdom and Malta . Luxembourg has the lowest share of renewable energy consumption, with 4.5 %. The EFTA countries Iceland (71.1 %) and Norway (69.2 %) consume more renewable energy in relation to their gross final energy consumption than any EU Member State because of their large potential for hydropower and geothermal energy generation. 16.0 % of final energy consumption in the EU is provided by renewable sources 2 0 1 4 ",

Estonia, Finland and Bulgaria have particularly low energy productivity levels , with less than 6 PPS per kg of oil equivalent. Estonia is at the bottom of the ranking, producing around three times less from the same amount of energy than the country at the top.

        "8 Decent work and economic growth Sustainable development in the European Union 70 Rationale for the indicators presented SDG 8 calls for sustainable and inclusive growth, which ensures that economic benefits are shared across the population and among generations. The growth rate of gross domestic product (GDP) is commonly used as a proxy for increases in a country\u2019s material living standards and is closely linked to several other SDG priorities relevant to economic development such as employment and investment in research and development (R&D). SDG 8 also pushes for countries to realise full and productive employment for all, drawing particular attention to young people. The indicators on employment, share of young people neither in employment nor in education or training (NEET rate) and long-term unemployment provide insights into the progress made in these areas. Employment is also essential for achieving the overall ambition of other SDGs. For example, increasing employment is a key condition for making societies more inclusive by reducing poverty and inequality. High and persistent unemployment leads to social exclusion and increases the risk of poverty. Young people are particularly vulnerable to changes in the labour market and thus face high risk of poverty and social exclusion during economic downturns. Hence, focusing on youth and long-term unemployment indicators is important for monitoring progress towards the SDGs. Also in the absence of an adequate and well- functioning social protection system, long-term unemployment can have negative implications for economic growth and social cohesion. The indicators presented in this chapter are also used for monitoring EU policies, in particular the Europe 2020 strategy ( 1 ) and the EU Sustainable Development Strategy ( 2 ).

Growth has been fastest in central and eastern EU countries, which also have relatively low levels of nominal GDP per capita (see Chapter 10). Strong growth rates in less advanced economies are largely attributed to increased investment and adoption of new technologies, which drive up productivity. Although these countries are gradually catching up with living standards in richer EU economies, in absolute terms the gap remains substantial. The lowest positive average annual growth rates of real GDP per capita (1 % or less) can be seen in countries with already high nominal levels of GDP per capita and in some Mediterranean EU countries, such as Spain, Portugal and Cyprus. 1.0 % Average annual growth in real GDP per capita in the EU since 2000 2 0 1 5 ",

Countries in the Mediterranean region have some of the lowest employment rates in the EU, in particular Greece, Italy and Croatia (60.5 % or lower). The large variations in employment rates across Member States are likely to reflect differences in economic development, demographic trends, labour market structures and policies, as well as the asymmetric impact of the recent economic crisis.

Some eastern European countries (Bulgaria and Slovakia) also fall into this group, along with Ireland and Latvia. In contrast, the lowest long-term unemployed rates tend to be in northern and western European countries , which also have the highest employment rates in the EU.

This represents a one percentage point decrease since 2002. The NEET rate reached a decade low of 14.0 % in 2008 before peaking at 17.2 % in 2012. This increase has been driven by a rise in youth unemployment as a result of the economic crisis. The NEET rate for women is slightly higher than that for men \u2014 16.3 % against 15.4 % respectively \u2014 although the gender gap has closed slightly since 2008.

        "9 Industry, innovation and infrastructure Sustainable development in the European Union 78 Rationale for the indicators presented SDG 9 calls on countries to foster innovation to provide a sustainable foundation for future prosperity and well-being. Expenditure on research and development (R&D) or R&D intensity is one of the most common measures of innovation input. R&D intensity, expressed as R&D expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), shows an economy\u2019s level of investment in generating new knowledge. R&D and innovation are crucial for long-term economic development and well-being because they drive economic growth, job creation, labour productivity and resource efficiency. Innovation is also needed to find solutions to societal challenges such as climate change and clean energy, security and active and healthy ageing. Another aims of the SDG 9 is to make infrastructure and industries more sustainable by increasing resource efficiency and adopting more environmentally sound technologies and production processes. The eco-innovation index helps to comprehensively assess the sustainability of new production processes by applying 16 indicators grouped into five thematic areas: eco-innovation inputs, eco-innovation activities, eco-innovation outputs, resource efficiency and socio- economic outcomes ( 1 ). Eco-innovation reduces the use of natural resources and decreases the release of harmful substances across the whole life cycle, bringing economic, social and environmental benefits. Environmental benefits include improved resource productivity, in particular better material and energy efficiency, lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and reduced waste generation, which is beneficial for companies and end users. SDG 9 also seeks to boost industry\u2019s share of employment and GDP and to upgrade technology to make industries more sustainable. The indicator on employment in high- and medium-high manufacturing , as a measure of this sector\u2019s contribution to the economy and the labour market, provides an insight into progress towards these goals. Manufacturing is an important driver of job creation and if pursued with environmentally sound technologies and industrial processes it can contribute to inclusive and sustainable development. High-tech industry sectors, in particular, are key drivers of economic growth and productivity, and generally provide high value-added and well-paid employment. SDG 9 further highlights the availability of infrastructure for promoting the digital and knowledge-based economy. The indicator on enterprises with broadband internet access (fixed or mobile) gives an insight into progress on one of the most important components of the information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure. ICT facilitates the circulation, access to and transfer of knowledge, and the diffusion of innovation. This in turn promotes productivity growth, societal learning and creativity. Increasing broadband internet access for business use is an important enabling factor in this process. The indicators on R&D, eco-innovation and business broadband connectivity are also used for monitoring EU policies, in particular the Europe 2020 strategy ( 2 ) and the EU Sustainable Development Strategy ( 3 ).

This is in contrast with most southern and eastern EU countries , where R&D intensity tends to be lower .

With the exception of Ireland and Luxembourg, these countries are also characterised by above-average R&D expenditure. At the lower end of the spectrum are eastern European countries, Greece and the small southern European island countries Cyprus and Malta , where eco- innovation seems to be still weakly developed . In particular, Cyprus, Poland and Bulgaria score only 60 % or less compared with the EU average in terms of eco- innovation. ( 4 ) World Bank (2012), Golden Growth: Restoring the Lustre of the European Economic Model . The eco-innovation index is another, more holistic approach to measuring innovativeness of EU countries. The index captures the different aspects of eco-innovation by ranking countries based on 16 indicators grouped into five thematic areas: eco-innovation inputs, eco-innovation activities, eco-innovation outputs, resource efficiency and socio-economic outcomes. The index shows how well individual Member States perform in different dimensions of eco-innovation compared to the EU average of 100. The overall performance of EU countries ranges from around 50 in Bulgaria to 167 in Denmark (see Figure 9.2). Switzerland\u2019s R&D intensity is almost 50 % above the EU average (2.97 %), whereas other EFTA countries such as Iceland and Norway show moderate levels slightly below 2.00 %. Switzerland\u2019s outstanding innovation performance is due to several factors including its long tradition of supporting R&D, the strong public- private links in the funding and conduct of research, the exceptionally high private spending on R&D and its distinguished universities ( 4 ).

        "10 Reduced inequalities Sustainable development in the European Union 86 Rationale for the indicators presented SDG 10 highlights the importance of combating social, economic and political disparities by promoting economic inclusion of all people regardless of their sex, age and ethnicity. Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and real adjusted gross disposable income of households per capita are important measures for monitoring this goal by assessing differences in income and living standards across different countries and regions. GDP per capita provides a measure of the total per capita income from the production of goods and services in a country. It is often used as an indication of the average material well-being of people. However, not all of this income necessarily accrues to households: some parts may be retained by corporations and the government, and some of it may be appropriated by non-residents, for instance by subsidiaries repatriating profits to their parent company abroad. At the same time, GDP per capita does not capture household income received from investments abroad, for example, in the form of dividends and interest receipts. In contrast, household disposable income provides a broader picture of household income by accounting for taxes and social contributions and monetary and in-kind social benefits. Therefore, the indicator on household disposable income complements GDP per capita by providing an insight into the purchasing power of households and their ability to invest in goods and services or save for the future. The income quintile share ratio , which shows the distribution of income between different population groups in the same country or region, also refers to the economic dimension of inequality highlighted in SDG 10. The indicator reveals the way income is distributed within a country, thus complementing the analysis of disparities between countries based on GDP per capita and household disposable income. Apart from being an issue of social justice, high and growing income inequality threatens social cohesion, drags down economic growth and stalls progress in poverty reduction, health and well-being. Economic inequalities exacerbate inequalities of opportunity \u2014 large disparities in access to education, health-care services and jobs as well as land and other productive assets \u2014 which limit social mobility and realisation of human capital. High levels of inequality are believed to undermine democratic participation and the ability of people to work together to meet common challenges. The indicators presented in this chapter are also used for monitoring the EU Sustainable Development Strategy ( 1 ). ( 1 ) See http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/sdi/indicators ",

This represents an increase of EUR 3 600 compared to 2000. GDP per capita had been increasing continuously from 2000 to 2008, but the economic crisis interrupted this upward trend. As a result, in 2009 GDP per capita fell by 4.6 % compared to the previous year before gradually picking up again in the following years.

To illustrate the disparity across the EU, on average a household in Germany has a disposable income per capita that is more than three times higher than the one available to a household in Bulgaria. High levels of GDP per capita do not necessarily translate into high levels of household disposable income. For example, Ireland and the Netherlands have the second and the third highest GDP per capita in the EU, respectively, but their household disposable income is close to or below the EU average. One reason for this discrepancy is the presence of a significant number of foreign subsidiaries of multinational enterprises, which play an important role in overall GDP. In contrast, although France has a GDP per capita close to the EU average, it ranks third in terms of household disposable income. ( 5 ) The international comparison is in USD.

        "11 Sustainable cities and communities Sustainable development in the European Union 94 Rationale for the indicators presented SDG 11 focuses on making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. The indicator urban population exposure to air pollution by particulate matter provides insights into urbanisation\u2019s social and environmental impacts. Pollutants such as tiny particles of matter suspended in the air reduce people\u2019s life satisfaction and perception of their well-being. Exposure to the finest and therefore most hazardous types of particulate matter can lead to many chronic and acute respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Because the major sources of particulate matter such as domestic and commercial combustion, traffic and industrial activities are more concentrated in urban areas, people living in towns and cities are at greater risk. A growing population, increasing urbanisation and economic growth may even increase air pollution. Therefore reducing particulate matter is necessary for tackling air pollution in cities and the substantial disease burden it causes. Sustainable management of municipal waste is another objective of SDG 11. Most municipal waste is generated by households, but it also comes from small businesses and public institutions. Capturing the recycling rate of municipal waste is one way of monitoring progress towards reducing the environmental impacts of cities and human settlements. Recycling activities reduce the amount of waste going to landfills and help to create jobs. Increasing the recycling rate is seen as necessary for creating sustainable cities and human settlements and reducing the damage they can cause to the environment. Improving the accessibility to public transport, as measured by the distribution of population by level of difficulty in accessing public transport , is particularly important for gauging progress towards SDG 11. Good transport networks have a big impact on economic growth and allow people to commute to work and to travel for leisure. They can expand labour markets, offer more opportunities and improve quality of life. Therefore a high level of accessibility to public transport is an important pillar for solving the environmental challenges cities face. The indicators urban population exposure to air pollution and recycling rate of municipal waste are also used to monitor the EU Sustainable Development Strategy ( 1 ).

In general, central and northern Member States with dedicated and diverse policy instruments and strict regulations on waste management tend to recycle more of their municipal waste . Germany has by far the highest recycling rate in the EU (63.8 %). In contrast, there are countries that only recycle a small part of their municipal waste. The lowest rates occur in some eastern and southern European countries , in particular Slovakia (10.3 %), Malta (10.9 %) and Romania (13.0 %). Overall, about three quarters of Member States have a recycling rate below the overall EU figure. This may be explained by the fact that several Mediterranean and eastern Member States recycle less than 20 % of their municipal waste, whereas Germany recycles over 60 % of its municipal waste. Looking at the EFTA countries , Switzerland\u2019s recycling rate (53.5 %) is comparable to that of EU\u2019s best performing Member States, whereas the rates observed in Norway and Iceland are comparable with the overall EU figure (42.2 % and 44.6 %, respectively). In the EU candidate countries the recycling rate of municipal waste is especially low . In Montenegro 7.9 % of municipal waste is recovered by recycling or composting, while in Turkey, Serbia, FYR Macedonia and Bosnia Herzegovina the rate is only 1 % or less.

        "12 Responsible consumption and production Sustainable development in the European Union 102 Rationale for the indicators presented SDG 12 calls for countries to promote sustainable consumption and production to allow economies to grow while reducing their ecological footprints. This \u2018green growth\u2019 can only be achieved if more products can be made from fewer materials. The indicator resource productivity directly monitors this by relating what an economy produces in terms of gross domestic product (GDP) to the materials it uses based on its domestic material consumption (DMC). Closely related to resource productivity is the responsible consumption of materials. The aim of sustainable consumption and production patterns is to increase gains from economic activities while reducing resource use and material consumption, thus decoupling economic growth from the use of natural resources. The indicator domestic material consumption refers to the overall amount of materials directly used within an economy and provides insights into whether fewer resources are being used in absolute terms. However, the indicator does not fully capture the environmental footprint of imports and exports because it does not account for upstream \u2018hidden\u2019 material flows embodied in these products. Waste management is another important component of resource efficiency, as envisioned in SDG 12. Waste represents a considerable loss to an economy in the form of materials and energy. To ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns, significant changes in handling waste are needed. Prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse of waste are all essential for reducing the amount of resources an economy uses. The indicator on generation of waste excluding major mineral wastes monitors progress achieved towards reducing waste generation and adds to the analysis of a country\u2019s resource efficiency. The indicators presented in this chapter are also used for monitoring the EU Sustainable Development Strategy ( 1 ). ( 1 ) See: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/sdi/indicators ",
        "12 Responsible consumption and production Sustainable development in the European Union 103 Resource productivity in the EU is EUR 2.00 per kilogram ( 2 ). This means for every kilogram of material consumed, EUR 2.00 of gross domestic product (GDP) are generated. The EU has shown strong gains in this indicator, improving by 33 % since 2000. This positive development has been driven by an overall fall in domestic material consumption and an increase in GDP, indicating absolute decoupling of economic growth from resource use.

( 3 ) Resource productivity is calculated using GDP in current prices expressed in purchasing power standards (PPS) to allow cross-country comparisons in 2015. While the EU as a whole has achieved long-term gains in resource productivity, large disparities can be seen across Member States. Only nine countries, all in western Europe, report resource productivity above the overall EU level . These tend to have higher levels of GDP per capita and economies dominated by the services sector, which are less resource-intensive (such as financial and high-tech innovation services). High environmental regulation standards also play a role. In contrast, countries with a large share of industry tend to have more resource-intensive economies and hence lower resource productivity levels . This is the case with most central and eastern EU countries , in particular Bulgaria, Romania, Latvia and Estonia where resource productivity is under 0.9 PPS per kg ( 3 ). In comparison, the EFTA country Switzerland surpasses the best performing EU Member States. This can be explained by the low levels of domestic material consumption (see Figure 12.2) and high share of services sector, in particular financial, in the economy. 2.00 euros worth of GDP created per kilogram of material used in the EU 2 0 1 5 ",

This is 2.3 tonnes per person lower than in 2000, but the fall has not been continuous. Consumption had been rising before the financial crisis, peaking at 16.6 tonnes in 2007, but dropped sharply when the economy started to slow down, particularly between 2008 and 2010. This implies that the favourable reduction in DMC could be a temporary result of the crisis and not reflect a major transformation of EU consumption and production patterns.

In contrast, northern EU countries tend to have higher levels of domestic material consumption .

Overall, 12 Member States generate waste per capita above the overall EU level. Estonia generates exceptionally high amounts , with levels twice as high as the next biggest producer (Belgium) and 13 times higher than the lowest producer (Croatia). This can be explained by the high extraction of oil from oil shale in Estonia, which results in high amounts of hazardous waste. Three small Member States in the Mediterranean region generate less than 1 000 kg of waste per capita (Croatia, Cyprus and Malta) .

        "13 Climate action Sustainable development in the European Union 108 Rationale for the indicators presented SDG 13 encompasses the need to combat climate change and to strengthen countries\u2019 resilience and capacity to adapt to its impacts, giving a special focus on the need of having in place integrated strategies to achieve this goal. Improving education, raising awareness and building human institutional capacity will contribute to this goal. In a nutshell, SDG 13 calls to combat climate change with integrated strategies of mitigation, adaptation and mainstream climate finance. The two selected indicators presented in this chapter provide a first introduction only from a complementary perspective. The dominant cause of climate change is the rise in man-made greenhouse gas emissions (GHG emissions) over the past 250 years. The development of GHG emissions in each country provides insights into progress towards taking action to mitigate GHG emissions and combat climate change. Because most GHG emissions arise from the production and supply of energy, progress towards a clean energy system (SDG 7) will also directly reduce GHG emissions. The rise in global near-surface average temperature is the most obvious indicator of climate change. This indicator complements GHG emissions in helping to monitor climate change. Records show a link between temperature and the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere with a time lag between emission and temperature rise. The global community has agreed to limit the global temperature rise to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels in order to limit the extent of climate-related hazards ( 1 ). The indicators presented in this chapter are also used for monitoring EU policies, in particular the Europe 2020 strategy ( 2 ) and the EU Sustainable Development Strategy ( 3 ).

        "14 Life below water Sustainable development in the European Union 114 Rationale for the indicators presented SDG 14 calls for the conservation and sustainable use of the oceans, seas and marine resources to ensure their availability for future generations. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and MPA networks are an important tool for conserving vulnerable marine environmental habitats, biodiversity and ecosystems. MPAs also provide wider socio-economic benefits in the form of sustainable environmental tourism and small-scale fisheries, as well as research and development of blue- biotechnology. Under the EU Habitats Directive, EU Member States designate marine Sites of Community Importance (SCIs) as part of efforts to establish a coherent European ecological network known as \u2018Natura 2000\u2019. The marine sufficiency index expresses for each Member State the share of species and habitats of Community Importance, for which the European Commission considers the national network of marine SCIs to be sufficient in terms of number, extent, distribution and representativeness. In doing so, this indicator provides information on the safeguarding of marine ecosystems, whose healthy functioning and services are essential for meeting SDG 14. SDG 14 also aims to combat the overexploitation of marine resources, especially fish stocks. Overfishing ( 1 ) is a global issue that reduces fish populations and affects the health of fish stocks. It not only impacts the health and productivity of marine ecosystems but also the food security of millions of people who rely on fish as an essential source of protein. The indicator total fish catches from major fishing areas is not directly related to sustainable fishing, but provides a picture of the amount and origin of fishing yields in the EU and its Member States which contribute to the availability of food supplies. Reliable indicators on maximum sustainable yield exploitation rate looking at specific stocks (certain species in specific subareas) are needed for an improved monitoring of overfishing. In line with the international laws, such as the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the indicator average rate of fishing compared to the rate that will deliver maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is used as a measure of overfishing. When the rate of fishing is aligned on MSY (indicator value = 1 or less), fish stocks will be able to grow to their most productive size and catches will, on average over the long term, be at their highest sustainable level. The indicator on marine sufficiency index is also used to monitor the EU Sustainable Development Strategy ( 2 ). ( 1 ) Overfishing: Taking out of the sea more than natural population growth can sustain. Overfishing has a number of causes, the most ruthless being \u2018chronic over capacity\u2019 of modern fishing fleets to effectively take far more fish than can be replaced (EEA glossary http://glossary.eea.europa.eu).

        "14 Life below water Sustainable development in the European Union 116 There is no clear correlation between the extent of marine territory and sufficiency levels. A low level of sufficiency does not indicate a lack of protected marine areas. Rather it shows that the sites proposed do not sufficiently cover the marine habitats and species listed under the Habitats Directive for that Member State and/ or biogeographic region. In general, it can be said that northern European Member States have higher levels of sufficiency than their southern partners. However, this is not consistently the case and overall the indicator presents a mixed picture. ",

Looking at EFTA countries , Norway\u2019s fish catches (2 146 074 tonnes) are more than double the size of the EU Member State with the largest catch (Spain).

        "15 Life on land Sustainable development in the European Union 122 Rationale for the indicators presented A key aim of SDG 15 is to halt biodiversity loss and to protect, restore and use terrestrial and inland water ecosystems sustainably. The Birds and Habitats Directives are the two main legal EU instruments for preventing the loss of biodiversity. Sites of Community Importance (SCIs) need to be designated and managed under the Habitats Directive to maintain or restore favourable conservation status of natural habitat types and species (other than birds) of European Union interest. The terrestrial sufficiency index expresses for each Member State the share of species and habitats as listed in the Habitats Directive, for which the European Commission considers the national network of terrestrial Sites of Community Importance (SCIs) to be sufficient in terms of number, extent, distribution and representativeness. Birds occur high in food chains and are sensitive to environmental change (both anthropogenic and natural). They are widespread, diverse and mobile, living in most terrestrial and marine habitats ( 1 ). Hence, population abundance and diversity of common bird species can provide information on the status of the more widespread ecosystems. The common bird index shows the population abundance and diversity compared to the base year 1990 for a selection of common bird species associated with specific habitats. Thus, this indicator gives insights into the general ambition of SDG 15. Halting and reversing land degradation is another major target of SDG 15. Habitat loss, fragmentation and soil degradation can occur when natural ecosystems are converted to intensively managed arable land or are used for infrastructure and urban settlements. The indicator on artificial land cover shows the percentage of built-up and non-built-up artificial areas ( 2 ) in Member States. The indicators presented in this chapter are also used for monitoring the EU Sustainable Development Strategy ( 3 ). ( 1 ) For more information on the use of bird population data as a general indicator of environmental status, read \u2018Wild bird indicators: using composite population trends of birds as measures of environmental health\u2019. ( 2 ) Built-up areas consist of all kinds of settlements; non-built-up artificial areas include, for example, roads and railways.

Common farmland species show the biggest declines, with their populations falling by 31.5 % compared to 1990. This indicates that agricultural ecosystems are under particular pressure . Common forest species appear to be coping better, showing an overall decline of \u2018only\u2019 12.1 %. This is slightly better than the aggregate of all common species and less than half of the declining rate observed for farmland bird species.

        "16 Peace, justice and strong institutions Publication title 128 Rationale for the indicators presented The overall aim of SDG 16 is to promote peace and justice. The goal thus calls for the reduction of all forms of violence and crime. The indicator intentional homicide offences provides an insight into the crime level observed in a country by reflecting the number of unlawful deaths purposefully inflicted on persons by another person, including serious assault leading to death and death as a result of a terrorist attack. The number of homicide offences, which can be compared between countries regardless of different legal systems and crime definitions, may be thus considered as a proxy for the general level of security within the respective country. Peace, stability and security are important factors for the sustainable development of all countries. High levels of violence, insecurity and injustice have serious impacts on quality of life as well as on social and economic development. They can also reflect weak public institutions and poor government performance, resulting in overall instability of a state and its society. SDG 16 also promotes effective, accountable and transparent institutions. A society\u2019s level of trust in its institutions can be used as a proxy for a state\u2019s stability, functionality and efficiency. The indicator trust in institutions broken down by the three main types of institutions \u2014 police, legal and political system \u2014 provides insights into their perceived performance. The indicator also gives information on a country\u2019s level of good governance. Low levels of corruption and transparent structures underpin well performing and reliable institutions. Generally, trust in institutions is important for economic activities and their success, as it increases the confidence of investors and consumers. A lack of confidence could thus negatively affect the overall economic situation of a state. A similar indicator on \u2018good governance\u2019 referring to citizens\u2019 confidence in EU institutions is also used for monitoring the EU Sustainable Development Strategy ( 1 ).

        "17 Partnership for the goals Publication title 135 Rationale for the indicators presented The aim of SDG 17 is to revitalise the global partnership for sustainable development, and to mobilise the full range of means of implementation necessary to achieve the 2030 Agenda. It underpins and complements the means of implementation under the specific goals. Unlike the other 16 goals which mainly focus on \u2018substantive\u2019 targets, meaning that these targets are specific and outcome-oriented rather than process-oriented, goal 17 relates exclusively to the means necessary for the implementation of the \u2018substantive\u2019 goals. It recognises that in addition to having a shared vision of goals and aspirations for the planet and people, there has to be effective implementation of change on the ground. This involves building inclusive partnerships between governments, the private sector and civil society, as well as the mobilisation of public and private, financial and non- financial means by which the SDGs can be delivered. Means of implementation refer to financial and non-financial, public and private, domestic and international actions as well as enabling policies, the measurement of which is normally outside the scope of official statistics. It is for this reason alone that, pending the development of a more comprehensive monitoring approach for SDG 17, the focus of this chapter is limited to Official Development Assistance (ODA) and imports from developing countries alone. However, harnessing all means of implementation \u2014 also and especially including non-ODA resources will be crucial in delivering on the SDGs. The indicator Official Development Assistance as share of gross national income (GNI) measures the disbursements from OECD and EU countries in support of countries eligible for assistance ( 1 ). In doing so, the indicator acts as a proxy for measuring the level of partnership being offered by higher income to lower income countries. This indicator is also relevant in view of the EU\u2019s commitment of reaching an ODA of 0.7 % of GNI within the timeframe of the 2030 Agenda and 0.15 % of GNI to ODA for Least Developed Countries (LDCs). As one of the seven action areas identified under SDG 17 to mobilise the full range of means of implementation, international trade as an engine for development has a significant role to play in helping countries achieve inclusive growth and sustainable development. The indicator imports from developing countries , therefore, gives an insight into the EU\u2019s trading relationship with its developing country partners. The indicator is particularly relevant as it is a consequence not only of the EU\u2019s market access preferences provided to developing and least developed countries, but also of the assistance provided in the form of aid for trade. The indicators presented in this chapter are also used for monitoring the EU Sustainable Development Strategy ( 2 ).

In contrast, northern European and Benelux countries are the biggest donors, with shares of ODA in GNI above or close to the overall EU share of 0.47 %.

Some of them are also included in the global SDG indicator set as agreed at the 47th United Nations Statistical Commission session in March 2016 ( 3 ). The table below illustrates the overlap between these indicator sets. Some indicators are not featured in any of the indicator sets mentioned above. However, they are deemed important for monitoring the overall ambitions of the SDGs from an EU perspective. The overview is complemented by the information on geographical coverage and most recent data points for the available data.

        "Annexes Sustainable development in the European Union 148 Annex III: Methods and sources CHAPTER 1 People at risk of poverty or social exclusion This indicator is defined as the share of the population either at risk of poverty, severely materially deprived or living in a household with a very low work intensity. Monetary poverty is measured by the indicator \u2018people at risk of poverty after social transfers\u2019. The indicator measures the share of people with an equivalised disposable income below the risk-of poverty threshold. This threshold is set at 60 % of the national median equivalised disposable income after monetary social transfers. Social transfers are benefits provided by national or local governments, including benefits relating to education, housing, pensions or unemployment. Material deprivation covers issues relating to economic strain, durables and housing and dwelling environment. Severely materially deprived people are living in conditions greatly constrained by a lack of resources and cannot afford at least four of the following: to pay their rent or utility bills or hire purchase instalments or other loan payments; to keep their home warm; to pay unexpected expenses; to eat meat, fish or other protein-rich nutrition every second day; to spend a week- long holiday away from home; to own a car; to own a washing machine; to own a colour TV; to own a telephone. Very low work intensity describes the number of people aged 0 to 59 living in households where the adults worked less than 20 % of their work potential during the past year. The indicator is based on the data from the EU statistics on income and living conditions (EU-SILC). CHAPTER 2 Area under organic farming The indicator is defined as the share of total utilised agricultural area (UAA) occupied by organic farming (existing organically farmed areas and areas in process of conversion). Organic farming is a method of production, which puts the highest emphasis on environmental protection and, with regard to livestock production, animal welfare considerations. It avoids or largely reduces the use of synthetic chemical inputs such as fertilisers, pesticides, additives and medical products. Farming is only considered to be organic at the EU level if it complies with Council Regulation (EC) No 834/2007, which has set up a comprehensive framework for the organic production of crops and livestock and for the labelling, processing and marketing of organic products, while also governing imports of organic products into the EU. The detailed rules for the implementation of this Regulation are laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 889/2008. ",
        "Annexes Sustainable development in the European Union 149 Gross nutrient balance on agricultural land \u2018Gross nutrient balance\u2019 lists all inputs and outputs and calculates the \u2018gross nutrient surplus\u2019 as the difference between total inputs and total outputs. The Gross nutrient balance per hectare is derived by dividing the total gross nutrient surplus by utilised agricultural area (UAA). The inputs of the gross nutrient balance are nutrients supplied in: \u2022 mineral fertilisers; \u2022 manure; \u2022 other organic fertilisers (excluding manure); \u2022 seeds and planting material; \u2022 atmospheric deposition; \u2022 biological nitrogen fixation. The outputs of the gross nutrient balance are nutrients removed with: \u2022 harvest of crops (cereals, dried pulses, root crops, industrial crops, vegetables, fruit, ornamental plants, other harvested crops); \u2022 harvest and grazing of fodder (fodder from arable land, permanent and temporary pasture consumption); \u2022 crop residues removed from the field. The nutrient inputs and outputs have been estimated for each item of the balance from basic data by multiplying with coefficients to convert the data into nutrient content. Basic data (fertiliser consumption, livestock numbers, crop production, utilised agricultural area) are mostly derived from agricultural statistics. Coefficients are mainly estimated by research institutes and can be based on models, statistical data, measured data as well as expert judgements. Various other sources, for example FAOSTAT database, national inventory submissions to UNFCCC and to UNECE-CLRTAP, or EMEP modelled data have also been used. Livestock density index The indicator provides the number of livestock units (LSU) per hectare of utilised agricultural area (UAA) and it is based on data from the Farm Structure Survey (FSS). The LSU is a reference unit which facilitates the aggregation of livestock from various species and ages. The Eurofarm LSU coefficients, which are at the basis of this indicator, are established by convention (originally, they were related to the animals\u2019 feed requirements, the reference being a dairy cow with an annual yield of 3 000 kilograms of milk, without additional concentrated feeding stuffs). In the interpretation of the livestock density index, the limits of this theoretical unit are to be taken into account. The livestock species aggregated in the LSU total, for the purpose of this indicator, are: equidae, cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, poultry and rabbits. Livestock density is indicative of the intensiveness of production of animal products. ",
        "Annexes Sustainable development in the European Union 150 CHAPTER 3 Life expectancy and healthy life years Life expectancy at birth is defined as the mean number of years still to be lived by a person at birth, if subjected throughout the rest of his or her life to the current mortality conditions. The indicator \u2018healthy life years\u2019 (HLY) at birth measures the number of years that a person at birth is still expected to live in a healthy condition. HLY is a health expectancy indicator which combines information on mortality and activity limitation. The data required are the age-specific prevalence (proportions) of the population in healthy and unhealthy conditions and age-specific mortality information. A healthy condition is defined by the absence of long-lasting limitations in activities that people usually do. The indicator is calculated separately for males and females. The indicator is also called disability-free life expectancy (DFLE). The indicator is based on the data from the EU statistics on income and living conditions (EU-SILC). Self-perceived health Self-perceived health expresses respondent\u2019s own assessment of his or her health. The concept is operationalised by a question on how a person perceives his/her health in general using one of the answer categories very good/ good/ fair/ bad/ very bad. The indicator is based on the data from the EU statistics on income and living conditions (EU-SILC). Self-reported unmet need for medical care due to monetary constraints This indicator is defined as the share of the population reporting that at least once in the previous 12 months they could not afford a medical examination or treatment. The indicator is based on the data from the EU statistics on income and living conditions (EU-SILC). CHAPTER 4 Early leavers from education and training The indicator is defined as the percentage of the population aged 18\u201324 with at most lower secondary education and who were not in further (formal or non- formal) education or training during the last four weeks preceding the survey. Lower secondary education refers to ISCED (International Standard Classification of Education) 2011 level 0\u20132 for data from 2014 onwards and to ISCED 1997 level 0\u20133C short for data up to 2013. The indicator is based on the data from the EU Labour Force Survey (EU LFS). Low achievers in reading, maths and science The indicator is based on the results of the worldwide study Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) conducted by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in member and non-member ",
        "Annexes Sustainable development in the European Union 151 nations and assessing the 15-year-old school pupils\u2019 scholastic performance on mathematics, science and reading. The results are reported in terms of percentages of the student population at each of the predefined levels of proficiency in mathematics literacy, science literacy and reading literacy. The scores are divided into six proficiency levels ranging from the lowest, level 1, to the highest, level 6. Low achievement is defined as performance below level 2: reading (score < 407.47), mathematics (score < 420.07) and science (score < 409.54). Tertiary educational attainment The indicator is defined as the percentage of the population aged 30\u201334 who have successfully completed tertiary studies (for example, university, higher technical institution). This educational attainment refers to ISCED (International Standard Classification of Education) 2011 level 5\u20138 for data from 2014 onwards and to ISCED 1997 level 5\u20136 for data up to 2013. The indicator is based on the data from EU Labour Force Survey (EU LFS). Lifelong learning The indicator lifelong learning refers to the percentage of the population aged 25 to 64 who stated that they received either formal or non-formal education or training in the four weeks preceding the survey. The indicator is based on the data from EU Labour Force Survey (EU LFS). CHAPTER 5 Gender pay gap The unadjusted \u2018gender pay gap\u2019 (GPG) represents the difference between average gross hourly earnings of male paid employees and of female paid employees as a percentage of average gross hourly earnings of male paid employees. The population consists of all paid employees in enterprises with 10 employees or more. Gross hourly earnings include paid overtime and exclude non-regular payments. From the reference year 2006 onwards, the GPG is computed annually by the European Statistical System (ESS) according to three main guidelines; the GPG is: unadjusted, i.e. without correcting for differences in individual characteristics of employed men and women (for example, experience and education) and for differences due to sectoral and occupational gender segregations (i.e., there are more men than women in certain sectors or occupations with, on the average, higher earnings compared to other sectors or occupations); calculated using gross hourly earnings \u2014 this choice aims at excluding from the measurement differences among EU Member States in terms of use of part time work; benchmarked on a harmonised source across the EU, the Structure of earnings survey (SES) conducted every four years in Member States. The unadjusted GPG for the EU and the euro area is calculated by Eurostat (only for the aggregated NACE sections B to S without O) as the weighted mean of the gender pay gaps in EU Member States, using the numbers of employees in Member States as weights. ",
        "Annexes Sustainable development in the European Union 152 Proportion of seats held by women in national parliaments The indicator covers the proportion of seats held by women in national parliaments. The national parliament is the national legislative assembly and sometimes it can consist of two chambers or houses (upper house, typically the senate, and lower house, typically the chamber of representatives). In a unicameral system there is only one single house. The data collected refer to President (Speaker/leader of the house) and Members of parliament (count includes the President) and are split into upper and lower houses where relevant. The indicator is based on the data from the European Commission database monitoring the numbers of men and women in key decision-making positions. CHAPTER 6 Biochemical oxygen demand in rivers This indicator is defined as the mean annual five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) in rivers, as an average of all data from available measuring stations. No weighting is applied. BOD5 is a measure of the amount of oxygen required by aerobic microorganisms to decompose organic matter in a water sample over a period of five days in the dark at 20 \u00b0C and is expressed in milligrams of oxygen per litre (mg O 2 /L). It is a measure of the quality of water: the lower the value of BOD5, the lower the organic pollution of the water. Data are collected by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in the framework of the EIONET and shared with Eurostat. Share of population having neither a bath, nor a shower, nor indoor flushing toilet in their household This indicator refers to the percentage of persons in the total population living in a private household having neither a bath, nor a shower and not having indoor flushing toilet for the sole use of their household. A \u2018private household\u2019 means \u2018a person living alone or a group of people who live together in the same private dwelling and share expenditures, including the joint provision of the essentials of living\u2019. The indicator is based on the data from the EU statistics on income and living conditions (EU-SILC) survey. CHAPTER 7 Share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption The indicator is used for monitoring progress towards the renewable energy targets of the Europe 2020 strategy implemented by Directive 2009/28/EC on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources. The indicator measures how extensive the use of renewable energy is and, by implication, the degree to which renewable fuels have substituted fossil and/or nuclear fuels. In a simplified manner, the indicator is calculated as a ratio of renewable energy consumption to all energy consumption. The numerator takes into account ",
        "Annexes Sustainable development in the European Union 153 consumption of all energy from renewable sources (for example, hydro plants, windmills, solar panels, geothermal energy and combustible renewables (solid, liquid and gaseous biofuels and renewable fraction of wastes). The denominator takes into account all final energy consumption: fossil fuels (coal, natural gas, crude oil and petroleum products), nuclear energy, renewable energy, non-renewable wastes as well as electricity and derived heat produced from these fuels. Each fuel source is taken into account only once \u2014 for example if coal is transformed to electricity in a power plant, only electricity is taken into account. This indicator is calculated on the basis of Directive 2009/28/EC on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources. The indicator is based on the data from the energy balances obtained from the national authorities competent for energy statistics. Energy productivity The indicator is defined as the gross domestic product (GDP) divided by gross inland consumption of energy calculated for a calendar year. For the calculation, Eurostat uses the GDP either in the unit of euros in chain-linked volumes to the reference year 2010 at 2010 exchange rates or in the unit PPS (purchasing power standard). Whereas the unit euros in chain-linked volumes allows observation of energy productivity trends over time in a single geographical area, the unit PPS allows countries to be compared for the same year. The gross inland consumption of energy is calculated as the sum of the gross inland consumption of the five types of energy: coal, electricity, oil, natural gas and renewable energy sources. In addition, each of these figures is calculated as an aggregation of different data on production, storage, trade (imports/exports) and consumption/use of energy. Since GDP is measured in EUR million or PPS million and gross inland consumption in thousand tonnes of oil equivalent, energy productivity is available in both EUR per kg of oil equivalent and in PPS per kg of oil equivalent. The source data used for the calculation are the energy balances obtained from the national authorities competent for energy statistics and the annual national accounts compiled in accordance with the European System of Accounts \u2014 ESA 2010. Share of population that cannot afford to keep home adequately warm This indicator is defined as the share of the population which is in the state of enforced inability to keep their home adequately warm. It refers to affordability (ability to pay), regardless of whether the household actually needs to keep it adequately warm. The indicator is based on the data from the EU statistics on income and living conditions (EU-SILC). ",
        "Annexes Sustainable development in the European Union 154 CHAPTER 8 Growth rate of GDP per capita GDP includes goods and services that have markets (or which could have markets) and products which are produced by general government and non-profit institutions. It is often used as an indicator of how well off a country is, as it is a measure of average real income in that country. However, it is not a complete measure of economic welfare. For example, GDP does not include most unpaid household work. Neither does GDP take account of negative effects of economic activity, like environmental degradation. Real GDP per capita is calculated as the ratio of real GDP to the average population of a specific year. For measuring the growth rate of real GDP, the GDP at current prices are valued in prices of the previous year. Accordingly, price movements will not inflate the growth rate. Annual and quarterly national accounts volume figures are expressed in chain- linked volumes with a reference year 2010. Employment rate The employment rate is calculated by dividing the number of persons aged 20 to 64 in employment by the total population of the same age group. The survey covers the entire population living in private households and excludes those in collective households such as boarding houses, halls of residence and hospitals. The \u2018employed population\u2019 consists of those persons who during the reference week did any work for pay or profit for at least one hour, or were not working but had jobs from which they were temporarily absent. The indicator is based on the data from the EU Labour Force Survey (EU LFS). Long-term unemployment rate The long-term unemployment rate refers to the share of people who are out of work and have been actively seeking employment for at least one year. An unemployed person is defined as a person aged 15 to 74 (or aged 16 to 74 in Spain, the United Kingdom, Iceland and Norway) without work during the reference week, currently available for work and who was either actively seeking work in the last four weeks or had already found a job to start within the next three months. The unemployment period is defined as the duration of a job search or as the length of time since the last job was held (if shorter than the time spent on a job search). This definition follows International Labour Organization (ILO) guidelines. The indicator is based on the data from the EU statistics on income and living conditions (EU-SILC). Young people neither in employment nor in education and training The indicator young people neither in employment nor in education and training (NEET) corresponds to the percentage of the population aged 18\u201324 who are not employed (i.e. unemployed or inactive according to the International Labour Organization definition) and not involved in further (formal or non-formal) education or training (in the four weeks preceding the survey). The indicator is based on the data from the EU Labour Force Survey (EU LFS). ",
        "Annexes Sustainable development in the European Union 155 CHAPTER 9 Gross domestic expenditure on research and development Research and experimental development (R&D) comprise creative and systematic work undertaken in order to increase the stock of knowledge \u2014 including knowledge of humankind, culture and society \u2014 and to devise new applications of available knowledge. Gross domestic expenditure on R&D (GERD) includes expenditure on research and development by business enterprises, higher education institutions, as well as government and private non-profit organisations and is expressed as a percentage of GDP. Eco-innovation index The eco-innovation index shows how well individual Member States perform in eco-innovation compared to the EU average, which is equated with 100. For 2010\u20132012, the average used for indexing to 100 is the average of 27 EU Member States. From 2013 onwards, the average used is calculated from the data for 28 EU Member States. The index is based on 16 indicators from nine contributors (Eurostat, European Environmental Agency, Cleantech, ISO, Patstat, Scopus, Meltwater, Water Footprint Network and Orbis) in five areas: eco-innovation inputs, eco-innovation activities, eco-innovation outputs, environmental outcomes and socio-economic outcomes. The overall score of an EU Member State is calculated by the unweighted mean of the 16 sub-indicators. The relevant target in the Roadmap is for an increase in the funding for research that contributes to the environmental knowledge base. Such increases will improve a Member State\u2019s positioning according to the index. Although the index is published annually, its sub-indicators are often not, so the index is a collation of the most recent data available each year. As its units are relative it cannot indicate progress in absolute terms. Employment in high- and medium-high technology manufacturing sectors The indicator shows the employment in high- and medium-high technology manufacturing sectors as a share of total employment. The definition of high- and medium-high technology manufacturing sectors is based on a selection of relevant items of NACE Rev. 2 on 2-digit level and is oriented on the ratio of highly qualified working in this area. The indicator is based on the data from the European Labour force Survey (EU LFS). Enterprises with fixed broadband internet access Broadband refers to telecommunications in which a wide band of frequencies is available to send data. Broadband telecommunication lines or connections are defined as those transporting data at high speeds, with data transfer speed for uploading and downloading data (also called capacity) equal to or higher than 144 kbit/s (kilobits per second). The technologies most widely used for broadband internet access are digital subscriber line (DSL) and its variations (xDSL), or cable modem (connects your computer to a local television line).

        "Annexes Sustainable development in the European Union 156 access for enterprises means having an external connection from the enterprise to the internet through an \u2018internet service provider\u2019 (ISP). This indicator is defined as enterprises that are connectable to an exchange which has been converted to support xDSL-technology, to a cable network upgraded for internet traffic, or to other broadband technologies. It includes fixed and mobile connections. CHAPTER 10 GDP per capita GDP per capita is calculated as the ratio of real GDP to the average population in a specific year. In cross-countries comparisons, the gross domestic product (GDP) as national accounts aggregate is converted into comparable volume aggregates by using purchasing power parities (PPPs). PPPs serve thus as currency conversion rates to convert expenditures expressed in national currencies into an artificial common currency (the purchasing power standard, PPS), eliminating the effect of price level differences across countries. The use of PPPs ensures that the GDP of all countries is valued at a uniform price level and thus reflects only differences in the actual volume of the economy. Household disposable income Real adjusted gross disposable income of households per capita in PPS is calculated as the adjusted gross disposable income of households and non-profit institutions serving households (NPISH) divided by the purchasing power parities (PPP) of the actual individual consumption of households and by the total resident population. Households use disposable income to cover living expenses, make purchases and save for the future. It is an important means for achieving higher living standards and for gaining access to quality education, health care and housing. Household disposable income mainly consists of payments received in the form of salaries and wages, social transfers and net property income. It excludes taxes paid. Adjusted disposable income improves the comparison of income levels across countries by also considering the provision of social transfers in kind (goods and services financed by the government, for example, in health and education). The indicator is expressed in purchasing power standards to allow for comparison across countries. The source data are the non-financial Annual Sector Accounts (ASA) compiled in accordance with the European System of Accounts (ESA 2010). Inequality of income distribution The income quintile share ratio is defined as the total income received by the 20 % of the population with the highest income (top quintile group) divided by that received by the 20 % of the population with the lowest income (lowest quintile group). \u2018Income\u2019 in this context refers to the equivalised disposable income, which is the total income of a household, after tax and other deductions, that is available for spending or saving, divided by the number of household members converted into equalised adults; household members are equalised or made equivalent by weighting each according to their age. The indicator is based on the data from the EU statistics on income and living conditions (EU-SILC). ",
        "Annexes Sustainable development in the European Union 157 CHAPTER 11 Urban population exposure to air pollution by particulate matter The indicator shows the population-weighted concentration of PM 10 and PM 2.5 to which the urban population is potentially exposed. Fine and coarse particulates (PM 10 ), i.e. particulates whose diameters are less than 10 micrometres, can be carried deep into the lungs where they can cause inflammation and a worsening of the condition of people with heart and lung diseases. Fine particulates (PM 2.5 ) are those whose diameters are less than 2.5 micrometres. They are therefore a subset of the PM10 particles. Their deleterious health impacts are more serious than PM10 as they can be drawn further into the lungs and may be more toxic. In 2008, the Environment Council adopted Framework Directive 96/62/EC on ambient air quality assessment and management. The first Daughter Directive (1999/30/EC) relating to limit values for PM 10 and other pollutants in ambient air fixed an annual limit value of 40 \u00b5g/m 3 , but did not fix limits for PM 2.5 . Annual reporting must follow Commission Decision 2004/224/EC of 20 February 2004 laying down arrangements for the submission of information under Council Directive 96/62/EC in relation to limit values for certain pollutants in ambient air. The new Directive 2008/50/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2008 on ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe entered into force on 11 June 2008, including already limits for PM 2.5 . The Directive establishes the need to reduce pollution to levels which minimise harmful effects on human health, paying particular attention to sensitive populations, and the environment as a whole, to improve the monitoring and assessment of air quality including the deposition of pollutants and to provide information to the public. The directive places a requirement on Member States to assess and reduce population exposure to concentrations of PM 2.5 by 2020. The magnitude of the required reduction depends on national average concentrations between 2009 and 2011. Where concentrations for those years were greater than 22 \u00b5g/m 3 , all appropriate measures should be used to reduce below 18 \u00b5g/m 3 by 2020. It should be noted that the WHO guideline value is 10 \u00b5g/m 3 . The source data are measured and collected under the Air Quality Framework Directive. Based on the annual submissions of Member States\u2019 measured concentrations, the data is updated annually by the European Environment Agency (EEA) assisted by the Topic Centre on Air Pollution and Climate Change Mitigation (ETC/ACM), and provided further to Eurostat for dissemination. Recycling rate of municipal waste The recycling rate is the tonnage recycled from municipal waste divided by the total municipal waste arising. Recycling includes material recycling, composting and anaerobic digestion. Municipal waste consists to a large extent of waste generated by households, but may also include similar wastes generated by small businesses and public institutions and collected by the municipality; this latter part of municipal waste may vary from municipality to municipality and from country ",
        "Annexes Sustainable development in the European Union 158 to country, depending on the local waste management system. For areas not covered by a municipal waste collection scheme the amount of waste generated is estimated. Data collection, validation and dissemination are performed by the Environmental Data Centre (EDC) on Waste hosted at Eurostat. Distribution of population by level of accessibility of public transport The distribution of population by level of difficulty in accessing public transport (bus, metro, tram and similar) refers to the share of population divided according to the level of difficulty they perceive in accessing public transport. Assessment of difficulty is based on the following levels: very high / high / low / very low. The reference period is current situation. If the respondent or another household member has a physical disability and if the available public transport is not adapted to her/his disability, this is a difficulty in the accessibility. If the public transport is too far away or has inappropriate timetable, the access is considered as difficult. Consequently, the differences in the use of public transport across areas with different levels of urbanisation reflect not only the availability, but also the accessibility of public transport in terms of proximity to bus, metro or tram stations. The indicator is based on the data from the EU statistics on income and living conditions EU-SILC survey. CHAPTER 12 Resource productivity Resource productivity is defined as the ratio between gross domestic product (GDP) and domestic material consumption (DMC). Resource productivity of the EU is expressed by the amount of GDP generated per unit of material consumed in a national economy, i.e. GDP/DMC in EUR per kg. The indicator \u2018domestic material consumption\u2019 (DMC) is based on the Economy-wide Material Flow Accounts (EW- MFA). The theory of EW-MFA includes compilations of the overall material inputs into national economy, the changes of material stock within the economy and the material outputs to other economies or to the environment. EW-MFA covers all solid, gaseous, and liquid materials, except water and air. Water included in products is included. Domestic material consumption Domestic material consumption (DMC) measures the total amount of materials directly used by an economy and is defined as the annual quantity of raw materials extracted from the domestic territory of the focal economy, plus all physical imports minus all physical exports of traded products. The indicator \u2018domestic material consumption\u2019 (DMC) is based on the Economy-wide Material Flow Accounts (EW-MFA). The theory of EW-MFA includes compilations of the overall material inputs into national economy, the changes of material stock within the economy and the material outputs to other economies or to the environment. EW-MFA covers all solid, gaseous, and liquid materials, except water and air. Water included in products is included. ",
        "Annexes Sustainable development in the European Union 159 The classification of materials used in EW-MFA and for which DMC is calculated is a Eurostat based system. EW-MFA includes the material categories: biomass, metal ores, non-metallic minerals, fossil energy materials/carriers, other products, waste for final treatment and disposal. It is important to note that the term \u2018consumption\u2019 as used in DMC denotes apparent consumption and not final consumption. DMC does not include upstream hidden flows related to imports and exports of products. Generation of waste excluding major mineral wastes The indicator presents the amount of waste, excluding major mineral wastes, generated in the EU-28 and expressed in kg per inhabitant. The indicator allows waste generation over time to be monitored for the EU as a whole and the development of waste generation to be compared between countries. The indicator covers hazardous (hz) and non-hazardous (nh) waste from all economic sectors and from households, including waste from waste treatment (secondary waste) but excluding most mineral waste. The indicator covers all wastes except the following waste categories: mineral wastes, soil and dredging spoils. Combustion wastes and solidified, stabilised and vitrified wastes are included. The indicator is based on data compiled according to the waste categories listed in Annex I to the Waste Statistics Regulation (Regulation 2150/2002/EC). CHAPTER 13 Greenhouse gas emissions The indicator shows trends in total man-made emissions of the \u2018Kyoto basket\u2019 of greenhouse gases, which are carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), methane (CH 4 ), nitrous oxide (N 2 O), and the so-called F-gases (hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), nitrogen trifluoride (NF 3 ) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6 )). These gases are aggregated into a single unit, CO 2 equivalents, using gas-specific global warming potential (GWP) factors. The main indicator includes greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from all sectors, including international aviation, but excludes emissions coming from international navigation and from land use, land-use change and forestry. It presents the annual total GHG emissions indexed to 1990. The source data is provided by the European Environment Agency (EEA). It is based on the EU\u2019s annual GHG inventory reports to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Global and European near-surface average temperature This indicator shows absolute changes and rates of change in average near- surface temperature for the globe and for Europe. Annual temperature deviations are shown relative to the 1850\u20131899 average, which serves as a proxy for the pre-industrial temperatures. The values are taken from the HadCRUT4 data set provided by the Climatic Research Unit, University of East Anglia and the UK Met Office Hadley Centre and are also published by the European Environment Agency. ",
        "Annexes Sustainable development in the European Union 160 It is used to gauge progress towards the EU Sustainable Development Strategy objective of limiting the rise in the global surface average temperature to less than 2 \u00b0C compared with the pre-industrial level. CHAPTER 14 Sufficiency index for marine sites proposed by Member States under the Habitats Directive Biodiversity, a contraction of biological diversity, refers to the number, variety and variability of living organisms, including mankind, within a given area. Areas protected for the preservation of biodiversity are proposed by the EU Member States under the Habitats Directive. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) refer to geographically distinct zones for which conservation objectives can be set. These sites are not strict nature reserves which exclude human activity but can place limitations on harmful human activities such as recreation, fishing and mining. They are often established in an attempt to strike a balance between ecological constraints and economic activity, so that goods and services can continue to be delivered by sea. The marine sufficiency index expresses, for each Member State, the share of species and habitats of Community Importance, for which the European Commission considers the national network of marine Sites of Community Importance (SCIs) under the Habitats Directive to be sufficient in terms of number, extent, distribution and representativeness. The collection of source data is based on reporting obligations of the Member States under the terms of the Habitats Directive and compiled by the European Environment Agency and its European Topic Centre on Biological Diversity on behalf of the European Commission Directorate-General for the Environment (DG ENV). Fish catches from major fishing areas Fish are a natural, biological, mobile (sometimes over wide distances) and renewable resource. Aside from fish farming, fish cannot be owned until they have been caught. For this reason, fish stocks continue to be regarded as a common resource, which therefore need to be managed collectively. This has led to a range of policies and international agreements that regulate the amount of fishing, as well as the types of fishing techniques and gear used to catch fish. Catches cover the quantities of fish, crustaceans, molluscs and other aquatic organisms caught by the EU and associated countries (in live weight equivalent of the landings). They exclude catches in inland waters and are calculated as the sum of catches in the seven fishing regions covered by EU legal acts. These are the following Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) major fishing areas: 21 \u2014 Atlantic, Northwest, 27 \u2014 Atlantic, Northeast, 34 \u2014 Atlantic, Eastern Central, 37 \u2014 Mediterranean and Black Sea, 41 \u2014 Atlantic, Southwest, 47 \u2014 Atlantic, Southeast and 51 \u2014 Indian Ocean, Western. Catch statistics are submitted to Eurostat by the national authorities under the terms of the relevant EU Council Regulations. ",
        "Annexes Sustainable development in the European Union 161 Average rate of fishing compared to the rate delivering maximum sustainable yield (MSY) The average rate of fishing, or fishing mortality rate (usually represented by F) measures the rate of reduction in the size of a fish stock of abundance N over time, i.e. the rate of fish death due to fishing per unit time is proportional to the abundance of the population with coefficient \u2013F. Over any given time period, F is equivalent to the total annual catch divided by the average abundance of fish over the time period. Maximum sustainable yield (MSY) can be defined as the largest average catch or yield that can continuously be taken from a stock under existing environmental conditions. Fmsy (also \u2018fishing mortality at MSY\u2019 or \u2018MSY fishing mortality level\u2019) is the level of fishing intensity that, if applied constantly year after year, would result in MSY. The ratio F/Fmsy describes how far a stock is fished above (F/Fmsy > 1) or below (F/Fmsy < 1) Fmsy. CHAPTER 15 Sufficiency index for terrestrial sites proposed by Member States under the Habitats Directive Biodiversity, a contraction of biological diversity, refers to the number, variety and variability of living organisms, including mankind, within a given area. Areas protected for the preservation of biodiversity are proposed by the EU Member States under the Habitats Directive. Terrestrial protected areas refer to geographically distinct zones for which conservation objectives can be set. These sites are not strict nature reserves which exclude human activity but can place limitations on harmful human activities. The terrestrial sufficiency index expresses, for each Member State, the share of species and habitats of Community Importance, for which the European Commission considers the national network of terrestrial Sites of Community Importance (SCIs) under the Habitats Directive to be sufficient in terms of number, extent, distribution and representativeness. The collection of source data is based on reporting obligations of the Member States under the terms of the Habitats Directive and compiled by the European Environment Agency and its European Topic Centre on Biological Diversity on behalf of the European Commission Directorate-General for the Environment (DG ENV). Common bird index This indicator is an index and integrates the population abundance and the diversity of a selection of common bird species associated with specific habitats. Rare species are excluded. Three groups of bird species are represented: common farmland species (39 species), common forest species (34 species) and all common bird species (167 species) which include the farmland species, the forest species and a further 94 common species (generalists, as opposed to the farmland and forest specialists). Farmland birds have a high dependence on cultivated land during the nesting season and for feeding during most of the year, while forest birds are equally dependent on wooded areas. An agreed European list of bird species is used for the calculation of each of the EU indices of the farmland, forest ",
        "Annexes Sustainable development in the European Union 162 and all common species, while for the national farmland bird indices, each country chooses the species to be covered. This means that different species are covered in each country, according to their occurrence; for example, for the farmland birds, only the Skylark is included in the indices of all countries. The indices should be judged only in their overall development rather than in their annual fluctuation because they are the result of a modelling procedure. The whole time series is recalculated each time new data are added. The source data used for this indicator are provided by the European Bird Census Council (EBCC) and its Pan-European Common Bird Monitoring Scheme (PECBMS) programme. Artificial land cover This indicator measures the total artificial area with its subunits of total built-up area and total artificial non-built-up area divided by the total area in the country. It provides a view on the share of artificial land cover on the total land. \u2018Built-up areas\u2019 cover areas with buildings and greenhouses (roofed constructions built for permanent purpose) whereas artificial non-built-up areas include streets and sealed surfaces (areas or linear features characterised by an artificial and/or impervious cover of hard artificial materials, concrete, gravel). Total land cover is the surface area of land in the country including artificial land, cropland, woodland, scrubland, grassland, bare land, water and wetland. Eurostat provides land cover and land use data through the EU harmonised data collection LUCAS \u2014 a Land Use and Cover Area frame Survey. Data are available for 2009 and 2012. The LUCAS survey is carried out every three years. In 2009 LUCAS survey covered 23 EU countries; data for four EU countries (BG, CY, MT, RO) are not available. For 2012, data exist for all 27 EU Member States. CHAPTER 16 Intentional homicide offences This indicator shows the number of intentional homicide offences cases recorded per hundred thousand inhabitants. The intentional homicide is defined as unlawful death purposefully inflicted on a person by another person. Data on intentional homicide also include serious assault leading to death and death as a result of a terrorist attack. It excludes attempted homicide, manslaughter, death due to legal intervention, justifiable homicide in self-defence and death due to armed conflict. The indicator is based on data on crime and criminal justice collected jointly by Eurostat and UNODC from administrative sources. Trust in institutions The indicator was constructed based on the answers provided by the respondent to the questions about the degree of trust in particular institutions: the legal system, the political system and the police. The response scale used was from 0 to 10, where 0 means no trust at all and 10 complete trust. The term \u2018legal system\u2019 refers to the entire system for interpreting and enforcing the laws and not to a specific legal entity within the country. Trust in the legal system is supposed to measure, for example, opinions and attitudes towards the effectiveness and ",
        "Annexes Sustainable development in the European Union 163 efficiency of the institutions such as the courts, the fairness of its procedures and decisions, and the extent to which the sentences given out reflect the values and desires of citizens. The term \u2018political system\u2019 refers to a complete set of institutions, interest groups (such as political parties, trade unions), the relationships between those institutions and the political norms and rules that govern their functions. The term \u2018police\u2019 refers to the police as an institution. The indicator is based on the data from the EU statistics on income and living conditions EU-SILC survey. CHAPTER 17 Official Development Assistance Official Development Assistance (ODA) consists of grants or loans by the official sector to countries or territories on the official recipient list of the OECD\u2019s Development Assistance Committee ( 1 ), or to multilateral agencies. Its main objective is to promote economic development and welfare in the recipient countries. The indicator is defined as a share of gross national income and based on data published by the OECD. EU imports from developing countries This indicator is defined as the value at market prices of EU imports from the DAC countries, as determined by the OECD Development Assistance Committee. The indicator is successively broken down by income groups of countries referring to the World Bank definition. DAC (Development Assistance Committee) countries refer to developing countries and territories on Part I of the OECD/DAC list of Aid Recipients.

        "Sustainable development in the European Union A STATISTICAL GLANCE FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF THE UN SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS This Eurostat publication, entitled Sustainable development in the European Union \u2014 A statistical glance from the viewpoint of the UN Sustainable Development Goals , provides an overview of the current situation of the EU and its Member States on sustainable development in relation to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This publication follows a strictly descriptive approach, presenting a purely statistical picture based on facts and fi g ures. It provides rather a snapshot of the starting position of the EU and its Member States and is not intended as a regular SDG monitoring exercise at EU level. The analysis in this publication is based on a limited number of indicators, which are relevant to the EU perspective and capture the broader objective and ambition of each SDG. Each goal is analysed through two to four indicators. In total, 51 indicators are presented in the report, mainly obtained from the European Statistical System and disseminated by Eurostat. The analysis of Member States\u2019 performance and international comparisons focus on the most recent year for each indicator. EU-28 trends over time are also presented, covering the period from 2000 or 2002 up to the most recent year for which data are available (2014 or 2015).
