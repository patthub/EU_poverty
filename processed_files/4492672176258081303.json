        "\u2014 having regard to the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2022, which the Commission adopted on 9 July 2021 (COM(2021)0300) (the \u2018DB\u2019), \u2014 having regard to the position on the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2022, which the Council adopted on 6 September 2021 and forwarded to Parliament on 10 September 2021 (11352/2021 \u2014 C9-0353/2021), \u2014 having regard to Rule 94 of its Rules of Procedure, \u2014 having regard to the opinions of the committees concerned, \u2014 having regard to the report of the Committee on Budgets (A9-0281/2021), Section III \u2014 Commission General overview 1. Recalls that, in its abovementioned resolution of 25 March 2021 on general guidelines for the preparation of the 2022 budget, Parliament defined clear political priorities for the 2022 budget to support the recovery from the COVID-19 crisis, to boost investments and tackle unemployment, and to lay the foundations for a more resilient and sustainable Union; reaffirms its strong commitment to those priorities and sets out the following position to ensure an appropriate level of financing to deliver on them; 2. Believes that the Union budget must be equipped with the tools to enable it to respond to multiple crises simultaneously; reiterates Parliament\u2019s view that 2022 should be a full implementation year and the 2022 budget should play a pivotal role in ensuring a positive and tangible impact on citizens\u2019 lives; against this background, supports increases to boost investment with a particular focus on SMEs, which are a cornerstone of the Union economy and play a crucial role in delivering excellent quality investment and job creation in all Member States, to strengthen efforts towards the green and digital transitions, to give fresh opportunities to young people and to provide protection to children, to build a strong European Health Union and to support COVAX programme; reinforces, further, priorities in the fields of security, migration, asylum and integration, fundamental rights and Union values, while acknowledging the recent deteriorating situation in external policy and humanitarian aid and the need to be able to react swiftly as well in the medium and long term to the upcoming challenges; 3. Takes note of Council\u2019s position on the DB, cutting EUR 1,43 billion in commitment appropriations for the MFF headings compared to the Commission\u2019s proposal; considers that the cuts proposed by the Council follow the usual top-down approach of implementing an overall arbitrary reduction target, which is neither driven by an objective assessment of implementation trends nor absorption capacities and does not reflect the multitude of challenges the Union is facing or the commitments the Union has entered into; points out the contradiction with core shared policy priorities; concludes that the Council\u2019s position is far from Parliament\u2019s expectations for a recovery budget; decides therefore, as a general rule, to restore appropriations on all lines cut by the Council to the level of the DB, for both operational and administrative expenditure, and to take the DB as the starting point to build its position upon; accepts, however, to enter EUR 1 299 million in both commitment and payment appropriations in 2022 for the Brexit Adjustment Reserve (BAR) as this reflects the political agreement on the BAR Regulation ( 10 ); 4. Insists that new policy priorities or tasks must be accompanied by fresh resources, and that creating an agency or expanding its mandate should not come at the expense of existing programmes or agencies; compensates, therefore, reductions in appropriations for funding programmes proposed by the Commission to reinforce the financial envelopes of decentralised agencies; underlines the fact that proper coordination and synergies between agencies are needed to increase the effectiveness of their work, especially where there is convergence towards specific policy objectives, in order to allow for the fair and efficient use of public money; C 184/180 EN Official Journal of the European Union 5.5.2022 Thursday 21 October 2021 ( 10 ) Regulation (EU) 2021/1755 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 October 2021 establishing the Brexit Adjustment Reserve (OJ L 357, 8.10.2021, p. 1). ",
        "5. Takes note, in this context, of the recent initiative on a European Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA); expresses deep concern over Parliament's exclusion from the decision-making procedure for establishing such an authority; points, further, to the important budgetary implications of this initiative and the need for Parliament to be also able to fully exercise its role as one arm of the budgetary authority; is strongly opposed to any financing architecture that would redeploy funds away from key objectives and actions initially planned and agreed upon by the co-legislators under Horizon Europe, EU4Health and RescEU; highlights, in this context, the need to ensure adequate funding for Europe\u2019s Beating Cancer plan as a priority objective for the Union budget, which should not be jeopardised as a result of redeployments in favour of other policy initiatives; underlines that the timing of such an initiative has not made it possible for Parliament to take it into account in its reading on the 2022 budget; expects that this issue be addressed during the budgetary conciliation on the 2022 budget and calls for other means of funding to be explored for this purpose; 6. Stresses, also, that the Commission announced a package in favour of refugees from Syria and beyond after the publication of its DB; in that respect, calls for a comprehensive agreement to be found on the overall package in the budgetary conciliation on the 2022 budget, which would also include Draft Amending Budget No 5/2021; acknowledges that further measures will be needed to adequately respond to the recent events in Afghanistan, including support for citizens, including women and girls, children, vulnerable groups, as well as heavily targeted risk groups, such as researchers, teachers, doctors, and scholars, who do not have the possibility to continue their life and work in Afghanistan; underlines that, given the changing situation and the lack of a comprehensive and longer-term needs assessment, these issues could not be fully factored into the Parliament\u2019s reading and will be reassessed in the light of the Commission\u2019s Amending Letter No 1/2022 and subsequent information presented at a later stage; 7. Decides to reinforce lines that have an excellent implementation rate and the operational capacity to absorb the additional appropriations in 2022; indicates that, for the purpose of adequately financing the pressing priorities expressed above, the Flexibility Instrument needs to be fully mobilised, and a partial use of the Single Margin Instrument (amount offset against current year margins) will further be required; requests, moreover, the entire amount of the 2020 decommitments to be made available in line with Art 15(3) of the Financial Regulation in 2022; 8. Underlines the need to restore the level of the DB for the financing cost of the European Union Recovery Instrument (EURI) to avoid giving a negative signal towards the financial markets, pending any reassessment of forecasted needs by the Commission in conciliation; reiterates its clear position, as defended in the 2021-2027 MFF negotiations, that the NGEU interest costs and repayments should be counted over and above the MFF ceilings; 9. Underlines the importance of supporting climate action and environmental protection by providing additional resources for the relevant Union programmes and instruments in 2022; emphasises, once again, that in the spirit of climate mainstreaming, efforts should be enhanced across all policy areas with a view to achieving the overall target for climate spending over the entire MFF 2021-2027 of at least 30 % of the total amount of the Union budget and the EURI expenditure; stresses, furthermore, the need for continuous work towards providing 7,5 % of annual spending under the MFF for biodiversity objectives in 2024, and 10 % as of 2026; emphasises that the Commission needs to establish the effective methodology in particular for tracking, halting and reversing biodiversity loss before the presentation of the draft budget for 2023 in order to ensure that the target set out in the Interinstitutional Agreement for 2024 can be met effectively; insists that Parliament be fully involved in the development of more robust, transparent and comprehensive methodologies for implementing and tracking such expenditure, and remains committed to the annual consultations and close cooperation with the Commission and the Council, as laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement; recalls that, for the implementation of the Green Deal, it is essential that funding is only awarded for activities which are in line with the \u2018do no significant harm\u2019 principle and consistent with the Paris Agreement; stresses that the guidance published for the Recovery and Resilience Facility should be seen as the standard for all other expenditures of the same nature, in particular must serve as a basis for the implementation of cohesion policy; reminds that the implementation of the principle as regards biodiversity must go beyond the full respect of relevant Union acquis; 10. Recalls that women have been disproportionately affected by the fallout of the COVID-19 crisis; underlines the importance of gender mainstreaming in all relevant programmes in the 2022 budget and of the implementation of gender-responsive budgeting to ensure that women and men benefit equally from public spending; calls, in this context, on 5.5.2022 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 184/181 Thursday 21 October 2021 ",
        "the Commission to accelerate the introduction of an effective, transparent and comprehensive methodology, in close cooperation with Parliament, to measure relevant gender expenditure, as set out in the Interinstitutional Agreement, in order to be able to show tangible results for the 2022 budget and in view of the extension of the methodology to all MFF programmes and calls in this context in particular for the systematic and comprehensive collection and analysis of data in the context of all Union policies and programmes in order to measure their respective impact on gender equality in all dimensions and in all stages of the preparation, monitoring, implementation and evaluation of the budget; calls, furthermore, for the swift implementation of the EU gender equality strategy 2020-2025 and the need for specific binding targets and additional actions, in particular training and initiatives to foster gender equality and fight gender bias; 11. Notes that many of the communications and documents of the Union\u2019s institutions, bodies and agencies are only available in English; notes also that working meetings are held without the possibility of interpretation; calls for the principles, rights and obligations laid down in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and Regulation No 1/1958 ( 11 ) \u2014 as well as in internal guidelines and decisions, such as the Code of Good Administrative Behaviour \u2014 to be upheld; invites the Union\u2019s institutions, bodies and agencies, therefore, to provide the necessary human resources to ensure multilingualism, by increasing the number of staff responsible for translation and interpretation; 12. Sets, therefore, the overall level of appropriations for the 2022 budget (all sections) at EUR 171 802 114 290 in commitment appropriations, representing an increase of EUR 4 008 766 380 compared to the DB; decides in addition to make available an amount of EUR 486 000 000 in commitment appropriations further to decommitments under Article 15(3) of the Financial Regulation; sets the overall level of appropriations for the 2022 budget (all sections) at EUR 172 467 593 189 in payment appropriations; Heading 1 \u2014 Single market, Innovation and Digital 13. Considers that a successful research and innovation programme is essential for the Union\u2019s future prosperity; stresses that Horizon Europe, which has very high European added value, will make a critically important contribution to the Green Deal and efforts towards a climate-neutral economy, to a successful digital transition and to the recovery of the Union economy from the pandemic; highlights in particular the need to bolster Union investment in health research, including funding for cancer research; stresses the excellent implementation rate of this programme, reflecting its ability to absorb additional appropriations in next year\u2019s budget; increases, therefore, the allocation of Horizon Europe over the level of the DB by EUR 305 million in commitment appropriations; 14. Supports the proposal in the DB to make available EUR 77,3 million in decommitments for the three clusters referred to in the relevant Joint political statement attached to the Horizon Europe regulation ( 12 ); notes, however, that the remaining 2020 research decommitments amount to EUR 408,7 million; reiterates its strong conviction that this unexpectedly high amount of research decommitments, which was not forecast by the Commission during the MFF negotiations, should be made available in their entirety under Horizon Europe, in full compliance with Article 15(3) of the Financial Regulation; believes strongly that, in the light of the continuing health crisis, half of the remaining amount should go towards the Cluster Health; 15. Stresses that the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) plays an absolutely crucial role in the building of high-quality, sustainable, affordable, interconnected trans-European transport, energy and digital networks and is therefore at the heart of efforts to strengthen the Union economy and make a success of the green and digital transitions; recalls that CEF makes a very significant contribution to the overall target of at least 30 % climate expenditure from the MFF and Next Generation EU (NGEU); notes that CEF plays an essential role in boosting economic, social and territorial cohesion and in promoting interconnectivity across the Union territory; proposes therefore to increase the funding for the three CEF strands by a total amount of EUR 207,3 million in commitment appropriations above the level of the DB; C 184/182 EN Official Journal of the European Union 5.5.2022 Thursday 21 October 2021 ( 11 ) Regulation No 1 determining the languages to be used by the European Economic Community (OJ P 17, 6.10.1958, p. 385).

",
        "16. Stresses the need to bridge the digital divide and strengthen the Union\u2019s resilience and digital sovereignty; believes that the Digital Europe Programme is a vital tool in increasing rates of digitalisation in the Union, thereby leading to significant productivity gains, and in helping to bolster investments in cybersecurity and artificial intelligence; recalls the need to support businesses, especially innovative digital SMEs and start-ups; considers, moreover, that additional appropriations are required to promote digital inclusion and digital literacy and skills across Europe, with a particular focus on women\u2019s digital literacy; proposes therefore to increase the amount allocated to the programme by just over EUR 71 million; 17. Supports increases to the various strands of the Single Market Cluster by a total amount of just over EUR 37 million in commitment appropriations above the level of the DB; underlines the importance of an adequately funded Single Market Programme to boost competitiveness, promote entrepreneurship, and effectively support small businesses, including start-ups, with the significant, dual challenge of a green and digital transition; draws particular attention, therefore, to the need to significantly increase the budget line dedicated to improving the competitiveness of enterprises and their access to markets, considering in particular the severe and long-lasting consequences of the health crisis on SMEs; 18. Highlights its long-standing request for a dedicated budget line and allocation for tourism, particularly considering the severe contraction that the sector, which includes many SMEs, has experienced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; acknowledges that several Union programmes contribute to the long-term competitiveness and sustainability of the sector, but strongly believes that a Union tourism programme would ensure more coordinated, visible and transparent action that would effectively support the sector\u2019s recovery and would put it on a path towards a sustainable future; 19. Considers InvestEU to be a cornerstone of the recovery strategy and underlines the need for sufficient funding to be made available in the 2022 budget so that the programme can deliver without delay on its objectives and the rebuilding of European long-term competitiveness; stresses, moreover, the importance of the InvestEU Advisory Hub and the InvestEU Portal in strengthening the investment and business environment across the Union; rejects, therefore, all cuts to this programme proposed by Council and decides, as a minimum requirement, to restore all relevant budget lines to the level of the DB; 20. Decides to create a reserve conditional on further improvements in the governance of the International Accounting Standards Board operating under the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation in line with the demands contained in its resolution of 7 June 2016 ( 13 ); decides to create a reserve for the European Banking Authority (EBA) in light of the serious deficiencies and shortcomings identified by the European Court of Auditors (ECA) in its Special Report 13/2021 as regards the lack of sufficient action in the area of anti-money laundering / counterterrorist financing until the ECA recommendations are fully complied with; 21. Reinforces the European Union Agency for Railways (ERA), in line with the identified needs of that agency, to ensure it can adequately fulfil its role in supporting the transition towards the decarbonisation of transport modes, also for segments where direct electrification is complex, and to ensure an overall level playing-field with other modes, ensuring, inter alia, the completion of rail missing links, particularly cross-border ones; highlights that a greater number of staff is necessary for the Agency to cope with the high demand for issuing vehicle authorisations (VA), single safety certificates (SSC) and ERTMS trackside approvals (TA) and the implementation of the 4th Railway Package; 22. Increases therefore the level of commitment appropriations for Heading 1 by EUR 668 593 067 above the DB (excluding pilot projects and preparatory actions), to be financed by using the available margin and mobilising the special instruments; moreover, makes available to the heading an overall amount of EUR 486 000 000 in commitment appropriations corresponding to de-commitments made under Article 15(3) of the Financial Regulation; 5.5.2022 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 184/183 Thursday 21 October 2021 ( 13 ) European Parliament resolution of 7 June 2016 on International Accounting Standards (IAS) evaluation and the activities of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation, the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG) and the Public Interest Oversight Board (PIOB) (OJ C 86, 6.3.2018, p. 24).

        "Sub-heading 2a \u2014 Economic, social and territorial cohesion 23. Decides to create a separate budget line under the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+), to provide a special additional allocation to foster the implementation of the European Child Guarantee in order to contribute to eradicate child poverty and to meet targets of the European Pillar of Social Rights Action plan, while mitigate the negative effects of the pandemic on children; reinforces, for this purpose, Sub-heading 2a by EUR 700 000 000 above the DB in commitment appropriations (excluding pilot projects and preparatory actions), to be financed by using the available margin and mobilising the special instruments; 24. Recalls that the support of the Recovery Assistance for Cohesion and the Territories of Europe (REACT-EU) to the ESF+ and to the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD) should contribute to provide notably for job creation and quality employment, in particular for people in vulnerable situations, and for social inclusion and poverty eradication measures, notably on child poverty; Sub-heading 2b \u2014 Resilience and values 25. Emphasises, in the context of the COVID-19 crisis, the need to build up a strong European Health Union and strengthen resilience of the health systems; decides therefore to increase resources of the EU4Health Programme by EUR 80 million; 26. Underlines that additional resources should notably be allocated for sexual and reproductive health and right services (SRHR), particularly to ensure timely and free access, as well as quality of services; 27. Emphasises that youth remains an overarching priority for the Union budget; reinforces therefore funding to meet increasing demand for the Erasmus+ programme by a total amount of just over EUR 137 million, as a 5 % increase represents an additional 40,000 mobility exchanges and is an important step to compensate for last years\u2019 missed opportunities; recalls that Erasmus+ is a key flagship programme and one of the most successful Union programmes with strategic investment in the future of the Union and of its citizens; recalls that insufficient funding for the Erasmus+ programme would endanger the continued creation of new opportunities for young people and their increased employability; furthermore increases the European Solidarity Corps by EUR 5 million as the economic crisis triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic should not adversely affect support for the youth; 28. Stresses that for emergency situations, including those connected to the increasingly severe impact of climate change, sufficient resources must be mobilised in the Union budget; highlights, in this context, the relevance of increasing the Union Civil Protection Mechanism (rescEU) by EUR 10 million, in particular in relation to the natural disasters in Europe, to enhance the protection of Union citizens and strengthen preparedness in the event of future disasters due to climate change; stresses therefore the need to invest in climate mitigation and adaptation for particularly vulnerable regions and rebuild them in a more sustainable way; 29. Proposes, further, a reinforcement to the Culture strand of the Creative Europe Programme by EUR 10 million to support Europe\u2019s cultural and creative sectors and creative industry, particularly hit by the COVID-19 crisis, in the recovery; underlines that no funding from any of Creative Europe\u2019s three strands should be used for financing projects in the framework of the New European Bauhaus initiative; 30. Stresses the crucial role of the Citizens, Equality, Rights and Values Programme to strengthen European citizenship and democracy, equality and gender equality and the rule of law in the Union, as well as to support victims of gender-based violence, and insists that additional appropriations are required to support these objectives; increases the Justice Programme to offset the proposed cut to finance increased tasks for the European Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (eu-LISA) under the e-CODEX proposal; 31. Decides to increase the budget for \u2018Multimedia actions\u2019, to create a reserve in order to encourage the Commission to provide more stability and predictability for radio networks covering EU affairs with funding covering at least two years and to clarify the different objectives financed through this budget line; increases, also, appropriations on social dialogue in order to enhance social dialogue and to support in particular national social partners in the response to the COVID-19 crisis and its long-term consequences; C 184/184 EN Official Journal of the European Union 5.5.2022 Thursday 21 October 2021 ",
        "32.

Reinforces the Employment and Social Innovation strand of ESF+ with a focus on advancing women's participation in the labour market; 34. Recalls the important role played by the decentralised agencies active under this Sub-heading; decides to increase funding for the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA), the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (EU-OSHA) and the European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation (Eurojust) in line with the identified needs of those agencies; increases, further, staffing levels for the European Medicines Agency (EMA), FRA and Eurojust; emphasises also the importance to further assess and possibly further increase funding in line with the needs of Union agencies dealing with the impacts of the COVID-19 health crisis in the future, in particular of the European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) in light of the amended founding regulation; 35. Underlines the importance to enhance the protection of the Union budget against fraud and irregularities; reiterates, in this context, the fundamental role that the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office (EPPO) plays in protecting the financial interests of the Union, including the use of funds from Next Generation EU, as well as ensuring the respect of the rule of law; decides, therefore, to apply targeted reinforcements to the EPPO and increase its staffing levels to allow the body to fulfil its duties in line with the requirements to fulfil its mandate; calls on the Commission, in light of the difficulties experienced by the EPPO in recruiting the necessary staff to fulfil its mandate in 2021, to show the necessary flexibility to ensure that appropriations agreed by the budgetary authority can be fully implemented going forward; points out the significant backlog of cases and the fact that after only some weeks of operations the EPPO has registered more than 1 000 reports of fraud affecting the financial interests of the Union, which underlines the urgency of the request; 36. Reinforces Sub-heading 2b overall by EUR 296 065 210 above the DB in commitment appropriations (excluding pilot projects and preparatory actions), to be financed by using the available margin and mobilising the special instruments; Heading 3 \u2014 Natural Resources and Environment 37. Observes that the COVID-19 pandemic has served to emphasise the strategic role that agriculture plays in avoiding a food crisis by providing safe, high-quality food at affordable prices all over Europe; insists that additional support measures under some budget lines for selected agricultural sectors, namely the support for the school scheme, young farmers and apiculture, need to be funded in 2022 to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; 38. Stresses the urgent need to act on climate change, as underlined by the latest IPPC report published on 9 August 2021; recalls, the importance of the LIFE programme in supporting and underpinning climate action and environmental protection in the Union; in light of the programme\u2019s remarkable absorption capacity, reinforces budgetary support for LIFE by EUR 171 million (25 % above the DB) across the various programme strands; 39. Stresses the need to significantly increase the budget of the European Environment Agency to provide sufficient financial and staff resources to enable full implementation of the European Green Deal and its related policies, and to achieve the goal of climate neutrality by 2050 at the latest; underlines that the reinforcement of the European Environment Agency should not be financed from the LIFE programme, which has not been intended by the co-legislators for such purposes; 40. Calls strongly for support for the outermost regions, including the POSEI (programme of specific options for remote and insular locations); 41. Calls, therefore, for a reinforcement of allocations under Heading 3 by EUR 212 750 473 in commitment appropriations above DB levels (excluding pilot projects and preparatory actions), to be financed by using part of the available margin; 42. Recalls that traditionally, an Amending Letter will still complete the picture regarding the availabilities for the EAGF and that the approach to amendments in Heading 3 can be adjusted accordingly in the course of the conciliation; 5.5.2022 EN Official Journal of the European Union C 184/185 Thursday 21 October 2021 ",
        "Heading 4 \u2014 Migration and Border Management 43. Underlines the importance of increasing appropriations for the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund, in particular in the light of the recent developments in Afghanistan; reverses, further, the decrease for the Border Management and Visa Instrument (BMVI) programmed by the Commission to finance new tasks for Europol under its enhanced mandate, as the necessary appropriations for Europol should be drawn exclusively from unallocated margins under the relevant MFF heading ceilings and/or through the mobilisation of the relevant MFF special instruments; against this background, offsets also the redeployment of BMVI for eu-LISA; 44. Recalls the importance of providing the Union budget with a sufficiently detailed nomenclature to allow the budgetary authority to fulfil its decision-making role effectively and for Parliament in particular to fulfil its democratic oversight and scrutiny roles across all headings; regrets, therefore, that the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund does not benefit from a more detailed nomenclature reflecting the specific objectives of the Fund; 45.
