        "EU FAMILY MEASURES Parental leave. EU rules ensure minimum parental leave at the birth of a child for both fathers and mothers. In the United Kingdom information on the length of maternity, paternity and adoption leave is available at https://www.gov.uk/ browse/working/time-off Gender equality. The EU has set up the Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE). It is especially concerned with gender violence http://europa. eu/!cT46Qe EU CHILD PROTECTION Child poverty prevention. The EU 2020 Strategy gives a new impetus to efforts to alleviate child poverty and social exclusion with a target to protect 20 million people from the risk of poverty or social exclusion by 2020. Europe works for families through the Member States. 2014 is the 20th anniversary of the International Year of the Family and a good opportunity to highlight its role in society. There is no formal family policy in Europe but the European Union (EU) researches and communicates the most successful policies for Member States to adopt for the benefit of families and the economy. There are also a range of areas where individual EU policies directly benefit family members. The Treaty on European Union explicitly requires the EU to promote the protection of the rights of the child. The EU and the United Kingdom government believe that eliminating child poverty is an economic as well as a social priority. Studies show ( 1 ) that children growing up in poverty and social exclusion are less likely to do well in school and enjoy good physical and mental health. They are also more likely to find themselves in conflict with the justice system. The EU Social Investment Package as part of the EU 2020 growth strategy aims to assist in breaking this cycle of disadvantage http://www.socialinclusion.ie/ documents/KorneliaKozovska_ SocialDimensionEurope2020_Final. pdf ( 1 ) 2011 EU Communication on an EU Agenda for the Rights of the Child Child-friendly justice is an EU priority.

        "Family law and inheritance. Although the substantive family law remains under the sole competence of EU countries, the EU is empowered to take measures concerning family law with cross-border implications on the basis of a special legislative procedure : all EU countries should agree and the European Parliament must be consulted. With the aim of offering EU citizens legal certainty in cross-border family law situations, various essential instruments have been adopted by the EU over recent years and important draft instruments are currently under negotiation. Courts must return abducted children to the jurisdiction of the country where the divorce settlement was originally made, provided all legal requirements are met.
