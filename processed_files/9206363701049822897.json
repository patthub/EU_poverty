        "EN 2 EN EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL The Commission proposal for the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for 2014-2020 (the MFF proposal) 1 sets the budgetary framework and main orientations for the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). On this basis, the Commission presents a set of regulations laying down the legislative framework for the CAP in the period 2014-2020, together with an impact assessment of alternative scenarios for the evolution of the policy. The current reform proposals are based on the Communication on the CAP towards 2020 2 that outlined broad policy options in order to respond to the future challenges for agriculture and rural areas and to meet the objectives set for the CAP, namely 1) viable food production; 2) sustainable management of natural resources and climate action; and 3) balanced territorial development. The reform orientations in the Communication have since been broadly supported both in the inter-institutional debate 3 and in the stakeholder consultation that took place in the framework of the impact assessment. A common theme that has emerged throughout this process is the need to promote resource efficiency with a view to smart, sustainable and inclusive growth for EU agriculture and rural areas in line with the Europe 2020 strategy, keeping the structure of the CAP around two pillars that use complementary instruments in pursuit of the same objectives. Pillar I covers direct payments and market measures providing a basic annual income support to EU farmers and support in case of specific market disturbances, while Pillar II covers rural development where Member States draw up and co-finance multiannual programmes under a common framework. 4 Through successive reforms the CAP has increased market orientation for agriculture while providing income support to producers, improved the integration of environmental requirements and reinforced support for rural development as an integrated policy for the development of rural areas across the EU. However, the same reform process has raised demands for a better distribution of support among and within Member States, as well as calls for a better targeting of measures aiming at addressing environmental challenges and better addressing increased market volatility. In the past, reforms mainly responded to endogenous challenges, from huge surpluses to food safety crises; they have served the EU well both on the domestic and the international front. However, most of today's challenges are driven by factors that are external to agriculture and would thus require a broader policy response. 1 Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions A budget for Europe 2020 , COM(2011)500 final, 29.6.2011. 2 Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions The CAP towards 2020: meeting the food, natural resources and territorial challenges of the future , COM(2010)672 final, 18.11.2010. 3 See in particular the European Parliament resolution of 23 June 2011, 2011/2015(INI), and the Presidency conclusions of 18.3.2011. 4 The current legislative framework comprises Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 (direct payments), Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 (market instruments), Council Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 (rural development) and Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 (financing).

        "EN 3 EN The pressure on agricultural income is expected to continue as farmers are facing more risks, a slowdown in productivity and a margin squeeze due to rising input prices; there is therefore a need to maintain income support and to reinforce instruments to better manage risks and respond to crisis situations. A strong agriculture is vital for the EU food industry and global food security. At the same time, agriculture and rural areas are being called upon to step up their efforts to meet the ambitious climate and energy targets and biodiversity strategy that are part of the Europe 2020 agenda. Farmers, who are together with foresters the main land managers, will need to be supported in adopting and maintaining farming systems and practices that are particularly favourable to environmental and climate objectives because market prices do not reflect the provision of such public goods. It will also be essential to best harness the diverse potential of rural areas and thus contribute to inclusive growth and cohesion. This reform accelerates the process of integration of environmental requirements. It introduces a strong greening component into the first pillar of the CAP for the first time thus ensuring that all EU farmers in receipt of support go beyond the requirements of cross compliance and deliver environmental and climate benefits as part of their everyday activities. Thirty percent of direct payments will now be tied to greening, and these payments will ensure that all farms deliver environmental and climate benefits through the retention of soil carbon and grassland habitats associated with permanent pasture, the delivery of water and habitat protection by the establishment of ecological focus areas and improvement of the resilience of soil and ecosystems through crop diversification. They will reinforce the ability of land and natural ecosystems to contribute to address major EU biodiversity and climate change adaptation objectives. Cross compliance will still underpin direct payments and it will be further focused to provide protection for wetlands and carbon rich soils while at the same time being streamlined to reduce administrative burdens. The Commission is committed to the introduction of the Water Framework Directives within the remit of cross compliance when all Member States will have fully implemented them in particular with clear obligations for farmers. Within rural development also, the objectives of the sustainable management of natural resources and climate action are prioritised through the restoration, preservation and enhancement of ecosystems as well as the promotion of resource efficiency, low carbon and climate resilient agriculture. Rural development will allow to significantly contribute towards the completion of the implementation of both the Natura 2000 and Water Framework Directives and to the achievement of the EU's 2020 biodiversity strategy. The future CAP will not, therefore, be a policy that caters only for a small, albeit essential, part of the EU economy, but also a policy of strategic importance for food security, the environment and territorial balance. Therein lies the EU added value of a truly common policy that makes the most efficient use of limited budgetary resources in maintaining a sustainable agriculture throughout the EU, addressing important cross-border issues such as climate change and reinforcing solidarity among Member States, while also allowing flexibility in implementation to cater for local needs. The framework set out in the MFF proposal foresees that the CAP should maintain its two- pillar structure with the budget for each pillar maintained in nominal terms at its 2013 level and with a clear focus on delivering results on the key EU priorities. Direct payments should promote sustainable production by assigning 30 % of their budgetary envelope to mandatory measures that are beneficial to climate and the environment. Payment levels should progressively converge and payments to large beneficiaries be subject to progressive capping. Rural development should be included in a Common Strategic Framework with other EU ",
        "EN 4 EN shared management funds with a reinforced outcome-orientated approach and subject to clearer, improved ex-ante conditionalities. Finally, on market measures the financing of the CAP should be reinforced with two instruments outside the MFF: 1) an emergency reserve to react to crisis situations; and 2) the extension of the scope of the European Globalization Adjustment Fund. On this basis, the main elements of the legislative framework for the CAP during the period 2014-2020 are set out in the following regulations: \u2013 Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing rules for direct payments to farmers under support schemes within the framework of the common agricultural policy ('the direct payments regulation'); \u2013 Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a common organisation of the markets in agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) ('the Single CMO regulation'); \u2013 Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) ('the rural development regulation'); \u2013 Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the financing, management and monitoring of the common agricultural policy ('the horizontal regulation'); \u2013 Proposal for a Council regulation determining measures on fixing certain aids and refunds related to the common organisation of the markets in agricultural products; \u2013 Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 as regards the application of direct payments to farmers in respect of the year 2013; \u2013 Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 as regards the regime of the single payment scheme and support to vine-growers. The rural development regulation builds on the proposal presented by the Commission on 6 October 2011 that sets out common rules for all funds operating under a Common Strategic Framework 5 . A regulation will follow on the scheme for most deprived persons, for which funding is now placed under a different heading of the MFF. In addition, new rules on the publication of information on beneficiaries taking account of the objections expressed by the Court of Justice of the European Union are also under preparation with a view to finding the most appropriate way to reconcile beneficiaries' right to protection of personal data with the principle of transparency. 5 Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down common provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund, the Cohesion Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund covered by the Common Strategic Framework and laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006, COM(2011)615 of 6.10.2011.

        "EN 5 EN 2. RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT On the basis of the evaluation of the current policy framework and an analysis of future challenges and needs, the impact assessment assesses and compares the impact of three alternative scenarios. This is the result of a long process started in April 2010 and steered by an inter-service group that brought together extensive quantitative and qualitative analysis, including setting a baseline in the form of medium-term projections for agricultural markets and income up to 2020 and modelling the impact of the different policy scenarios on the economics of the sector. The three scenarios elaborated in the impact assessment are: 1) an adjustment scenario that continues with the current policy framework while addressing its most important shortcomings, such as the distribution of direct payments; 2) an integration scenario that entails major policy changes in the form of enhanced targeting and greening of direct payments and reinforced strategic targeting for rural development policy in better coordination with other EU policies, as well as extending the legal base for a broader scope of producer cooperation; and 3) a refocus scenario that reorients the policy exclusively towards the environment with a progressive phasing out of direct payments, assuming that productive capacity can be maintained without support and that the socio-economic needs of rural areas can be served by other policies. Against the background of the economic crisis and the pressure on public finances, to which the EU has responded with the Europe 2020 strategy and the MFF proposal, all three scenarios attach different weight to each of the three policy objectives of the future CAP which aims at a more competitive and sustainable agriculture in vibrant rural areas. With a view to a better alignment with the Europe 2020 strategy, notably in terms of resource efficiency, it will be increasingly essential to improve agricultural productivity through research, knowledge transfer and promoting cooperation and innovation (including through the European Innovation Partnership on agricultural productivity and sustainability). Whereas EU agricultural policy does not any more operate within a trade distorting policy environment, additional pressure on the sector is expected from further liberalization, notably in the framework of the DDA or the FTA with Mercosur. The three policy scenarios were drawn up taking into account the preferences expressed in the consultation which was conducted in the context of the impact assessment. Interested parties were invited to submit contributions between 23.11.2010 and 25.1.2011 and an advisory committee was organised on 12.1.2011. The main points are summarized below: 6 \u2013 There is broad agreement among stakeholders on the need for a strong CAP based on a two-pillar-structure in order to address the challenges of food security, sustainable management of natural resources and territorial development. \u2013 Most respondents find that the CAP should play a role in stabilizing markets and prices. \u2013 Stakeholders have diverse opinions concerning the targeting of support (especially redistribution of direct aid and capping payments). 6 See Annex 9 of the impact assessment for an overview of the 517 contributions received. ",
        "EN 6 EN \u2013 There is agreement that both pillars can play an important role in stepping up climate action and increasing environmental performance for the benefit of EU society. Whereas many farmers believe that this already takes place today, the wider public argues that Pillar I payments can be more efficiently used. \u2013 The respondents want all parts of the EU, including less favoured areas, to be part of future growth and development. \u2013 The integration of the CAP with other policies, such as environmental, health, trade, development, was emphasised by many respondents. \u2013 Innovation, development of competitive businesses and provision of public goods to EU citizens are seen as ways to align the CAP with the Europe 2020 strategy. The impact assessment thus compared the three alternative policy scenarios: The refocus scenario would accelerate structural adjustment in the agricultural sector, shifting production to the most cost efficient areas and profitable sectors. While significantly increasing funding for the environment, it would also expose the sector to greater risks due to limited scope for market intervention. Furthermore, it would come at a significant social and environmental cost as the less competitive areas would face a considerable income loss and environmental degradation, since the policy would lose the leverage of direct payments coupled with the cross compliance requirements. At the other end of the spectrum, the adjustment scenario would best allow for policy continuity with limited but tangible improvements both in agricultural competitiveness and environmental performance. There are however serious doubts as to whether this scenario could adequately address the important climate and environmental challenges of the future, which also underpin the long-term sustainability of agriculture. The integration scenario breaks new ground with enhanced targeting and greening of direct payments. The analysis shows that greening is possible at a reasonable cost to farmers although some administrative burden cannot be avoided. Similarly, a new impetus in rural development is possible provided that the new possibilities are efficiently used by Member States and regions and that the common strategic framework with the other EU funds does not remove synergies with Pillar I or weaken rural development's distinctive strengths. If the right balance is struck, this scenario would best address the long term sustainability of agriculture and rural areas. On this basis the impact assessment concludes that the integration scenario is the most balanced in progressively aligning the CAP with the EU's strategic objectives and this balance is also found in the implementation of the different elements in the legislative proposals. It will also be essential to develop an evaluation framework to measure the performance of the CAP with a common set of indicators linked to policy objectives. Simplification has been an important consideration throughout the process and should be enhanced in a variety of ways, for instance in the streamlining of cross compliance and market instruments, or the design of the small farmers scheme. In addition, the greening of direct payments should be designed in such a way as to minimize administrative burden including the costs of controls. ",
        "EN 7 EN 3. LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL It is proposed to maintain the current structure of the CAP in two pillars with annual mandatory measures of general application in Pillar I complemented by voluntary measures better tailored to national and regional specificities under a multi-annual programming approach in Pillar II. However, the new design of direct payments seeks to better exploit synergies with Pillar II, which is in turn placed under a Common Strategic Framework to better coordinate with other EU shared management funds. On this basis, the current structure of four basic legal instruments is also maintained, albeit with the scope of the financing regulation enlarged to bring together common provisions into what is now called the horizontal regulation. The proposals comply with the principle of subsidiarity. The CAP is a truly common policy: it is an area of shared competence between the EU and the Member States that is being handled at EU level with a view to maintaining a sustainable and diverse agriculture throughout the EU, addressing important cross-border issues such as climate change and reinforcing solidarity among Member States. In the light of the importance of future challenges for food security, the environment and territorial balance, the CAP remains a policy of strategic importance to ensure the most effective response to the policy challenges and the most efficient use of budgetary resources. In addition, it is proposed to maintain the current structure of instruments in two pillars where Member States have more leeway to tailor solutions to their local specificities and also co-finance Pillar II. The new European Innovation Partnership and risk management toolkit are also placed within Pillar II. At the same time the policy will be better aligned with the Europe 2020 strategy (including a common framework with other EU funds) and a number of improvements and simplification elements introduced. Finally, the analysis carried out in the framework of the impact assessment clearly shows the cost of no action in terms of negative economic, environmental and social consequences. The direct payments regulation lays down common rules for the basic payment scheme and related payments. Building on the reform of 2003 and the Health Check of 2008 that decoupled direct payments from production while subjecting them to cross compliance requirements, the regulation now seeks to better target support to certain actions, areas or beneficiaries as well as to pave the way for convergence of the level of support within and across Member States. The regulation also includes a section on coupled support. A single scheme across the EU, the basic payment scheme, replaces the Single Payment Scheme and the Single Area Payment Scheme as from 2014. The scheme will operate on the basis of payment entitlements allocated at national or regional level to all farmers according to their eligible hectares in the first year of application. Thus the use of the regional model that was optional in the current period is generalized, also effectively bringing all agricultural land into the system. The rules on the management of entitlements and the national reserve largely follow current rules. With a view to a more equitable distribution of support, the value of entitlements should converge at national or regional level towards a uniform value. This is done progressively to avoid major disruptions. An important element is to enhance the overall environmental performance of the CAP through the greening of direct payments by means of certain agricultural practices beneficial ",
        "EN 8 EN for the climate and the environment that all farmers will have to follow, which go beyond cross compliance and are in turn the basis for pillar II measures. The definition of active farmer further enhances targeting on farmers genuinely engaged in agricultural activities, and thus legitimizes support. In addition, the progressive reduction and capping of support for large beneficiaries is foreseen while taking due account of employment. The following payments are also provided: \u2013 an payment (30% of annual national ceiling) for farmers following agricultural practices beneficial for the climate and the environment: crop diversification, maintenance of permanent pastures and ecological focus areas. Organic farming automatically benefits from this payment, while farmers in Natura 2000 areas will have to comply with the relevant requirements to the extent that they are consistent with the Natura 2000 legislation; \u2013 a voluntary payment (up to 5% of annual national ceiling) for farmers in areas facing specific natural constraints (areas delimited in the same manner as for rural development purposes); this payment recognizes the need for income support to maintain presence in areas facing specific natural constraints and complements existing support under rural development; \u2013 a payment (up to 2% of annual national ceiling) for young farmers in their installation, which may be complemented by setting up aid under rural development; and At the same time, the regulation lays down a simplified scheme for small farmers (up to 10% of annual national ceiling), who may thus receive a lump sum payment replacing all direct payments and producing administrative simplification with an easing of such farmers' obligations related to greening, cross compliance and controls. A voluntary coupled support scheme is provided for specific types of farming or specific agricultural systems which are experiencing certain difficulties and which are particularly important for economic and/or social reasons; support is provided to the extent necessary to maintain current levels of production (up to 5% of annual national ceiling with the possibility to go beyond this in particular cases). In addition, the regulation maintains the possibility for Complementary National Direct Payments for Bulgaria and Romania and includes a specific payment for cotton. In terms of simplification, the new direct payments system will be based on a single type of payment entitlements and streamline transfer rules, thereby simplifying its management; a harmonisation of provisions for coupled payments under one heading renders the legal framework more user-friendly and the scheme for small farmers with its simplified requirements and procedures will reduce the red tape on small farmers and enhance their competitiveness.

        "EN 9 EN 4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION The MFF proposal provides that a significant part of the EU budget should continue to be dedicated to agriculture, which is a common policy of strategic importance. Thus, in current prices, it is proposed that the CAP should focus on its core activities with EUR 317.2 billion allocated to Pillar I and EUR 101.2 billion to Pillar II over the 2014-2020 period. The Pillar I and Pillar II funding is complemented by additional funding of EUR 17.1 billion consisting of EUR 5.1 billion for research and innovation, EUR 2.5 billion for food safety and EUR 2.8 billion for food support for the most deprived persons in other headings of the MFF, as well as of EUR 3.9 billion in a new reserve for crises in the agricultural sector and up to EUR 2.8 billion in the European Globalization Adjustment Fund outside the MFF, thus bringing the total budget to EUR 435.6 billion over the 2014-2020 period. As regards distribution of support among Member States, it is proposed that all Member States with direct payments below 90% of the EU average will see one third of this gap closed. The national ceilings in the direct payments regulation are calculated on this basis. The distribution of rural development support is based on objective criteria linked to the policy objectives taking into account the current distribution. As is the case today, less developed regions should continue to benefit from higher co-financing rates, which will also apply to certain measures such as knowledge transfer, producer groups, cooperation and Leader. Some flexibility for transfers between pillars is introduced (up to 5% of direct payments): from Pillar I to Pillar II to allow Member States to reinforce their rural development policy, and from Pillar II to Pillar I for those Member States where the level of direct payments remains below 90% of the EU average. Details on the financial impact of the CAP reform proposals are set out in the financial statement accompanying the proposals. ",

The present Regulation is therefore in line with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5(3) of the Treaty on European Union.

Taking into account the levels of direct payments for farmers in Bulgaria and Romania in the framework of the application of the phasing-in mechanism to all direct payments granted in those Member States, this instrument of financial discipline should only apply in those Member States as from 1 January 2016. (12) In order to take account of the developments relating to the total maximum amounts of direct payments that may be granted, including those resulting from the decisions to be taken by the Member States regarding transfers between the first and second pillars, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission for the purpose of reviewing the national and net ceilings set out in this Regulation. (13) Experience from the application of the various support schemes for farmers has shown that support was in a number of cases granted to beneficiaries whose business purpose was not or only marginally targeted at an agricultural activity, such as airports, railway companies, real estate companies and companies managing sport grounds. To ensure the better targeting of support, Member States should refrain from granting direct payments to such natural and legal persons. Smaller part-time farmers contribute directly to the vitality of rural areas, for that reason they should not be prevented from being granted direct payments. (14) To avoid an excessive administrative burden caused by the managing of payments of small amounts, Member States should in general refrain from granting direct payments where the payment would be lower than EUR 100 or the eligible area of the holding for which support is claimed would be less than one hectare. However, as the structures of the Member States' agricultural economies vary considerably and may differ significantly from the average farm structure in the Union, Member States should be allowed to apply minimum thresholds that reflect their particular situation. Due to the very specific farming structure in the outermost regions and the smaller Aegean Islands, Member States should be able to decide whether any minimum threshold should apply in those regions. Moreover, Member States should have the possibility to opt for the implementation of one of the two types of minimum threshold taking account of the particularities of the structures of their farming sectors. As payment could be granted to farmers with so-called \u2018landless\u2019 holdings, the application of the hectare-based threshold would be ineffective. The support-related minimum amount should therefore apply to such farmers. To ensure equal treatment of farmers whose direct payments are subject to phasing-in in Bulgaria and Romania, the minimum threshold should be based on the final amounts to be granted at the end of the phasing-in process. (15) The distribution of direct income support among farmers is characterised by the allocation of disproportionate amounts of payments to a rather small number of large beneficiaries. Due to economies of size, larger beneficiaries do not require the same level of unitary support for the objective of income support to be efficiently achieved. Moreover, the potential to adapt makes it easier for larger beneficiaries to operate with lower levels of unitary support. It is therefore fair to introduce a system for large beneficiaries where the support level is gradually reduced and ultimately capped to improve the distribution of payments between farmers. Such system should however take into account salaried labour intensity to avoid disproportionate effects on large farms with high employment numbers. Those maximum levels should not apply to ",

In order to make capping effective, Member States should establish some criteria in order to avoid abusive operations by farmers seeking to evade its effects. The proceeds of the reduction and capping of payments to large beneficiaries should remain in the Member States where they were generated and should be used for financing projects with a significant contribution to innovation under Regulation (EU) No [\u2026] of the European Parliament and of the Council of\u2026.on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) 15 [RDR]. (16) In order to facilitate the implementation of capping, notably with regard to the procedures for granting direct payments to farmers and the corresponding transfers to rural development, net ceilings should be determined for each Member State to limit the payments to be made to farmers following the application of capping. To take into account the specificities of CAP support granted in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 247/2006 of 30 January 2006 laying down specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions of the Union 16 and Council Regulation (EC) No 1405/2006 of 18 September 2006 laying down specific measures for agriculture in favour of the smaller Aegean islands and amending Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 17 , and the fact that these direct payments are not subject to capping, the net ceiling for the Member States concerned should not include those direct payments. (17) It should be specified that the provisions of this Regulation which could give rise to behaviour of a Member State possibly constitutive of State aid are excluded from the application of the State aid rules given that the provisions concerned include appropriate conditions for the granting of support, or envisage the adoption of such conditions by the Commission, in order to prevent undue distortion of competition. (18) In order to achieve the objectives of the CAP, the support schemes may need to be adapted to changing developments, if necessary within short time-limits. Therefore, it is necessary to provide for a possible review of the schemes, in particular in the light of economic developments or the budgetary situation, implying that beneficiaries cannot rely on support conditions remaining unchanged. (19) Farmers in Member States which acceded to the European Union on or after 1 May 2004 received direct payments following a phasing-in mechanism provided for in the respective Acts of Accession. For Bulgaria and Romania, such mechanism will be still in force in 2014 and 2015. Furthermore, those Member States were allowed to grant complementary national direct payments. The possibility for granting such payments should be maintained for Bulgaria and Romania until they are fully phased-in. (20) In order to ensure a better distribution of support amongst agricultural land in the Union, including in those Member States which applied the single area payment scheme established under Regulation (EC) No 73/2009, a new basic payment scheme should replace the single payment scheme established under Council Regulation (EC) 15 OJ L [\u2026], [\u2026], p. [\u2026]. 16 OJ L 42, 14.2.2006, p. 1. 17 OJ L 265, 26.9.2006, p. 1. ",
        "EN 15 EN No 1782/2003 of 29 September 2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers 18 , and continued under Regulation (EC) No 73/2009, which combined previously existing support mechanisms into a single scheme of decoupled direct payments. Such a move should entail the expiry of payment entitlements obtained under those Regulations and the allocation of new ones, although still based on the number of eligible hectares at the disposal of farmers in the first year of implementation of the scheme. (21) Due to the successive integration of various sectors into the single payment scheme and the ensuing period of adjustment granted to farmers, it has become increasingly difficult to justify the presence of significant individual differences in the level of support per hectare resulting from use of historical references. Therefore direct income support should be more equitably distributed between Member States, by reducing the link to historical references and having regard to the overall context of the Union budget. To ensure a more equal distribution of direct support, while taking account of the differences that still exist in wage levels and input costs, the levels of direct support per hectare should be progressively adjusted. Member States with direct payments below the level of 90 % of the average should close one third of the gap between their current level and this level. This convergence should be financed proportionally by all Member States with direct payments above the Union average. In addition, all payment entitlements activated in 2019 in a Member State or in a region should have a uniform unit value following a convergence towards this value that should take place during the transition period in linear steps. However, in order to avoid disruptive financial consequences for farmers, Member States having used the single payment scheme, and in particular the historical model, should be allowed to partially take historical factors into account when calculating the value of payment entitlements in the first year of application of the new scheme. The debate on the next Multiannual Financial Framework for the period starting in 2021 should also focus on the objective of complete convergence through the equal distribution of direct support across the European Union during that period. (22) The experience gained with the application of the single payment scheme shows that some of its main elements should be kept, including the determination of national ceilings to ensure that the total level of support does not exceed current budgetary constraints. Member States should also continue to operate a national reserve that should be used to facilitate the participation of young new farmers in the scheme or may be used to take account of specific needs in certain regions. Rules on the transfer and use of payment entitlements should be kept but, where possible, simplified. (23) In order to guarantee the protection of the rights of beneficiaries and in order to clarify the specific situations that may arise in the application of the basic payment scheme, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission for the purpose of adopting rules on eligibility and the access in respect of the basic payment scheme of farmers in case of inheritance and anticipated inheritance, inheritance under a lease, change of legal status or denomination and in the case of merger or scission of the holding; adopting rules on the calculation of the value and number or on the increase in the value of payment 18 OJ L 270, 21.10.2003, p. 1.

(24) In order to ensure the proper management of payment entitlements, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission for the purpose of adopting rules on the declaration and activation of payment entitlements. (25) As regards hemp, specific measures should be kept to ensure that illegal crops cannot be hidden among the crops eligible for the basic payment, thereby adversely affecting the common market organisation for hemp. Hence, payments should continue to be granted only for areas sown to varieties of hemp offering certain guarantees with regard to the psychotropic substance content. In order to preserve public health, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission for the purpose of adopting rules making the granting of payments conditional upon the use of certified seeds of certain hemp varieties and defining the procedure for the determination of hemp varieties and the verification of their tetrahydrocannabinol content. (26) One of the objectives of the new CAP is the enhancement of environmental performance through a mandatory \"greening\" component of direct payments which will support agricultural practices beneficial for the climate and the environment applicable throughout the Union. For that purpose, Member States should use part of their national ceilings for direct payments to grant an annual payment, on top of the basic payment, for compulsory practices to be followed by farmers addressing, as a priority, both climate and environment policy goals. Those practises should take the form of simple, generalised, non-contractual and annual actions that go beyond cross- compliance and are linked to agriculture such as crop diversification, maintenance of permanent grassland and ecological focus areas. The compulsory nature of those practises should also concern farmers whose holdings are fully or partly situated in \"Natura 2000\" areas covered by Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora 19 and by Directive 2009/147/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 November 2009 on the conservation of wild birds 20 , as long as these practises are compatible with the objectives of those Directives.

(30) In order to promote the sustainable development of agriculture in areas with specific natural constraints, Member States should be able to use part of their national ceilings for direct payments to grant an annual area-based payment, on top of the basic payment, to all farmers operating in such areas. That payment should not replace the support given under rural development programs and should not be granted to farmers in areas which were designated in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 of 20 September 2005 on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) 22 but have not been designated in accordance with Article 46(1) of Regulation (EU) No [\u2026] of the European Parliament and of the Council of \u2026. on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) 23 [RDR]. (31) The creation and development of new economic activity in the agricultural sector by young farmers is financially challenging and constitutes an element that should be considered in the allocation and targeting of direct payments. This development is essential for the competitiveness of the agricultural sector in the Union and, for that reason, an income support to young farmers commencing their agricultural activities should be established in order to facilitate the initial establishment of young farmers and the structural adjustment of their holdings after the initial setting up. Member States should be able to use part of their national ceilings for direct payments to grant an annual area-based payment, on top of the basic payment, to young farmers.

(33) Member States should be allowed to use part of their national ceilings for direct payments for coupled support in certain sectors in clearly defined cases. The resources that may be used for any coupled support should be limited to an appropriate level, while allowing such support to be granted in Member States or in their specific regions facing particular situations where specific types of farming or specific agricultural sectors are particularly important for economic, environmental and/or social reasons. Member States should be allowed to use up to 5 % of their national ceilings for this support, or 10 % in case their level of coupled support in at least one of the years of the period 2010-2013 exceeded 5 %. However, in duly justified cases where certain sensitive needs in a region are demonstrated, and upon approval by the Commission, Member States should be allowed to use more than 10 % of their national ceiling. Coupled support should only be granted to the extent necessary to create an incentive to maintain current levels of production in those regions. This support should also be available to farmers holding, on 31 December 2013, special payment entitlements allocated under Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 and Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 and who do not have eligible hectares for the activation of payment entitlements. As regards the approval of voluntary coupled support exceeding 10 % of the annual national ceiling fixed per Member State, the Commission should further be empowered to adopt implementing acts without applying Regulation (EU) No 182/2011. (34) In order to ensure efficient and targeted use of Union funds and to avoid double funding under other similar support instruments, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission for the purpose of defining the adoption of rules concerning the conditions for granting voluntary coupled support and of rules on its consistency with other Union measures and on the cumulation of support. (35) As regards support to the cotton sector, Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 considered necessary that part of it continued to be linked to the cultivation of cotton through a crop specific payment per eligible hectare to ensure against any risk of disruption to production in the cotton producing regions, taking into account all factors that influence this choice. This choice should be maintained in accordance with the objectives set out in Protocol No 4 on cotton attached to the 1979 Act of Accession. (36) In order to enable the efficient application of the crop-specific payment for cotton, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission for the purpose of the adoption of rules and conditions for the authorisation of land and varieties as regards the crop specific payment for cotton and of rules on the conditions for the granting of that specific payment, on the eligibility requirements and the agronomic practices, on criteria for the approval of inter-branch ",

Experience has shown that the restructuring of the cotton sector would be better served through other measures, including those under rural development programming financed under Regulation (EU) No [\u2026] [RDR], which would also allow for a greater co-ordination with measures in other sectors. However, the acquired rights and legitimate expectations of undertakings already involved in restructuring programmes should be respected. Therefore the ongoing programmes of four or eight years should be allowed to continue to their end. At the end of that period, however, the programmes should end. The funds available from the four-year programmes could then be integrated into the available Union funds for measures under rural development from 2014. The funds available after the end of the eight year programmes would not be useful in rural development programmes in 2018 given the programming period and could therefore be more usefully transferred to support schemes under this Regulation, as already provided for in the second sub-paragraph of Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC) No 637/2008. Regulation (EC) No 637/2008 will therefore become obsolete from 1 January 2014 or 1 January 2018 as regards Member States which have, respectively, four or eight-year programmes. Regulation (EC) No 637/2008 should therefore be repealed.

For that purpose, a lump-sum payment replacing all direct payments should be established. Rules seeking simplification of formalities should be introduced by reducing, amongst others, the obligations imposed on small farmers such as those related to the application for support, to agricultural practices beneficial for the climate and the environment, to cross-compliance and to controls as laid down in Regulation (EU) No [\u2026] [HZR] without endangering the achievement of the overall objectives of the reform, it being understood that Union legislation as referred to in Annex II to Regulation (EU) No [\u2026] [HZR] applies to small farmers. The objective of that scheme should be to support the existing agricultural structure of small farms in the Union without countering the development towards more competitive structures. For that reason, access to the scheme should be limited to existing holdings.

In order to ensure the good application of the rules contained in this Regulation, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission for the purpose of the adoption of the necessary measures regarding notifications to be made by Member States or for the purpose of checking, controlling, monitoring, evaluating and auditing direct payments, implementing international agreements, including notification requirements under those agreements and of rules laying down the nature and type of the information to be notified, on the methods of notification and on the access rights to the information or information systems and the conditions and means of publication of the information (42) Union legislation concerning the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, in particular Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data 25 and Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data 26 are applicable.

Expected result(s) and impact It is not possible to set quantitative targets for impact indicators at this stage. Although the policy can steer in a certain direction, the broad economic, environmental and social outcomes measured by such indicators would ultimately also depend on the impact from a range of external factors, which recent experience indicates have become significant and unpredictable. Further analysis is on-going, to be ready for the period post-2013. As regards the direct payments, Member States will have the possibility to decide, to a limited degree, on the implementation of certain components of the direct payment schemes. For rural development, the expected results and impact will depend on the rural development programmes that Member States will submit to the Commission. Member States will be asked to set targets in their programmes. 1.4.4. Indicators of results and impact The proposals provide for the establishment of a common monitoring and evaluation framework with a view to measuring the performance of the Common Agricultural Policy. That framework shall include all instruments related to the monitoring and evaluation of CAP measures and in particular of the direct payments, market measures, rural development measures and of the application of cross compliance. The impact of these CAP measures shall be measured in relation to the following objectives: (a) viable food production, with a focus on agricultural income, agricultural productivity and price stability; (b) sustainable management of natural resources and climate action, with a focus on greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity, soil and water; ",
        "EN 75 EN (c) balanced territorial development, with a focus on rural employment, growth and poverty in rural areas. By means of implementing acts, the Commission shall define the set of indicators specific to these objectives and areas. Moreover, as regards rural development, a reinforced common monitoring and evaluation system is proposed. That system aims (a) to demonstrate the progress and achievements of rural development policy and assess the impact, effectiveness, efficiency and relevance of rural development policy interventions, (b) to contribute to better targeted support for rural development, and (c) to support a common learning process related to monitoring and evaluation. The Commission will establish, by means of implementing act, a list of common indicators linked to the policy priorities. 1.5. Grounds for the proposal/initiative 1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term In order to meet the multi-annual strategic objectives of the CAP which are a direct translation of the Europe 2020 strategy for European rural areas and to fulfil the relevant requirements of the Treaty, the proposals aim to lay down the legislative framework for the Common Agricultural Policy for the period after 2013. 1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement The future CAP will not only be a policy that caters for a small, albeit essential, part of the EU economy, but also a policy of strategic importance for food security, the environment and territorial balance. Thus, the CAP, as a truly common policy, makes the most efficient use of limited budgetary resources in maintaining a sustainable agriculture throughout the EU, addressing important cross-border issues such as climate change and reinforcing solidarity among Member States. As mentioned in the Commission communication \"A Budget for Europe 2020\" 30 , the CAP is a genuinely European policy. Instead of operating 27 separate agricultural policies and budgets, Member States pool resources to operate a single European policy with a single European budget. This naturally means that the CAP accounts for a significant proportion of the EU budget. However, this approach is both more efficient and economical than an uncoordinated national approach. 1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past On the basis of the evaluation of the current policy framework, an extensive consultation with stakeholders as well as an analysis of future challenges and needs, a comprehensive impact assessment has been carried out. More details can be found in the impact assessment and the explanatory memorandum that are accompanying the legal proposals. 30 COM(2011)500 final of 29 June 2011. ",
        "EN 76 EN 1.5.4. Coherence and possible synergy with other relevant instruments The legislative proposals concerned by this financial statement should be seen in the broader context of the proposal for a single framework regulation with common rules for the common strategic framework funds (EAFRD, ERDF, ESF, Cohesion Fund and EMFF). That framework regulation will make an important contribution to reducing administrative burden, to spending EU funds in an effective way, and to put simplification into practice. This also underpins the new concepts of the common strategic framework for all these funds and the upcoming Partnership Contracts which will also cover these funds. The common strategic framework, which will be established, will translate the objectives and priorities of the Europe 2020 Strategy into priorities for the EAFRD together with the ERDF, ESF, Cohesion Fund and EMFF, which will ensure an integrated use of the funds to deliver common objectives. The common strategic framework will also set out coordination mechanisms with other relevant Union policies and instruments. Moreover, as regards the CAP, significant synergies and simplification effects will be obtained by harmonising and aligning the management and control rules for the first (EAGF) and second (EAFRD) pillar of the CAP. The strong link between the EAGF and the EAFRD should be maintained and the structures already in place in the Member States be sustained. 1.6.

Monitoring and reporting rules In terms of monitoring and evaluation of the CAP, the Commission will present a report to the European Parliament and the Council every 4 years, with the first report to be presented not later than end 2017. This is complemented by specific provisions in all areas of the CAP, with various comprehensive reporting and notifications requirements to be specified in the implementing rules. As regards rural development, rules are also provided for monitoring at programme level, which will be aligned with the other funds, and which will be coupled with ex ante, on-going and ex post evaluations. 2.2. Management and control system 2.2.1. Risk(s) identified There are more than seven million beneficiaries of the CAP, receiving support under a large variety of different aid schemes, each of which having detailed and sometimes complex eligibility criteria. The reduction in the error rate in the domain of the common agricultural policy can already be considered as a trend. Thus, most recently an error rate close to 2% confirms the overall positive assessment of previous years. It is the intention to continue the efforts in order to achieve an error rate below 2%. 2.2.2. Control method(s) envisaged The legislative package, in particular the proposal for the regulation on the financing, management and monitoring of the common agricultural policy, envisages maintaining and reinforcing the current system established by Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005. It provides for a compulsory administrative structure at Member State level, centred around accredited paying agencies, which are responsible for carrying out controls at final beneficiary level in accordance with the principles set out under point 2.3. Every year, the head of each paying agency is required to provide a statement of assurance which covers the completeness, accuracy and veracity of the accounts, the proper functioning of the internal control systems and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions. An independent audit body is required to provide an opinion on all these three elements. The Commission will continue to audit agricultural expenditure, using a risk-based approach in order to ensure that its audits are targeted to the areas of highest risk. Where these audits reveal that expenditure has been incurred in breach of Union rules, it will exclude the amounts concerned from Union financing under the conformity clearance system. ",
        "EN 79 EN As regards the cost of controls, a detailed analysis is provided in annex 8 to the impact assessment accompanying the legislative proposals. 2.3. Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities The legislative package, in particular the proposal for the regulation on the financing, management and monitoring of the common agricultural policy, envisages maintaining and reinforcing the current detailed systems for controls and penalties to be applied by the paying agencies, with common basis features and special rules tailored to the specificities of each aid regime. The systems generally provide for exhaustive administrative controls of 100% of the aid applications, cross-checks with other databases where this is considered appropriate as well as pre-payment on-the-spot checks of a minimum number of transactions, depending on the risk associated with the regime in question. If these on-the-spot checks reveal a high number of irregularities, additional checks must be carried out. In this context, the by far most important system is the Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS), which in financial year 2010 covered around 80% of total expenditure under the EAGF and the EAFRD. For Member States with properly functioning control systems and low error rates, the Commission will be empowered to allow for a reduction of the number of on-the-spot checks. The package further envisages that Member States shall prevent, detect and correct irregularities and fraud, impose effective, dissuasive and proportionate penalties as laid down in Union legislation or national law, and recover any irregular payments plus interests. It includes an automatic clearance mechanism for irregularity cases, which provides that if recovery has not taken place within four years of the date of the recovery request, or within eight years in the case of legal proceedings, the amounts not recovered shall be borne by the Member State concerned. This mechanism will be a strong incentive for Member States to recover irregular payments as quickly as possible. ",
        "EN 80 EN 3. ESTIMATED FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE The amounts indicated in this financial statement are expressed in current prices and in commitments. In addition to the changes resulting from the legislative proposals as listed in the accompanying tables below, the legislative proposals imply further changes which have no financial impact. For any of the years in the period 2014-2020, the application of financial discipline cannot be excluded at this stage. However, this will not depend on the reform proposals as such, but on other factors, such as the execution of direct aids or future developments in the agricultural markets. As concerns direct aids, the extended net ceilings for 2014 (calendar year 2013) included in the proposal regarding transition are higher than the amounts allocated to direct aids indicated in the accompanying tables. The purpose of this extension is to ensure a continuation of the existing legislation in a scenario in which all the other elements would remain unchanged, without prejudice to the possible need for applying the financial discipline mechanism. The reform proposals contain provisions giving Member States a set degree of flexibility in relation to their allocation of direct aids respectively rural development. In case Member States decide to use that flexibility, this will have financial consequences within the given financial amounts, which cannot be quantified at this stage. This financial statement does not take into account the possible use of the crises reserve. It should be underlined that the amounts taken into account for market-related expenditure are based on no public intervention buying-in and other measures related to a crisis situation in any sectors. 3.1.
