        "The level of engagement and interest of Europeans throughout the Europe- an Year for Development reflects how international solidarity continues to lie close to the heart of the EU and its citizens. Development concerns us all, which is why in the European Year for Development, we invited Europe- ans, and especially young people, to take part in a conversation about our world, our dignity and our future . Throughout the European Year for Development, we have heard the voices of the people our cooperation affects \u2014 these are their stories. Their stories demonstrate the universality of core human values of dig- nity, honesty, fairness, justice and resourcefulness. Development and international cooperation are fundamen- tal European policies that affect us all. One of my priorities for the European Commission is to strengthen Europe\u2019s role in the world. Europe can only be a global player if Europe- ans understand how the external policies of the European Union and its Member States benefit us all in our interde- pendent world. Eradicating poverty and achieving sustainable development are two of the most pressing challenges facing the world today. Sustainable development is about allowing people to live a decent life while respecting our planet. In September 2015, at a special United Nations summit, world leaders endorsed an ambitious new universal sus- tainable development agenda to build on the Millennium Development Goals. The new Sustainable Development Goals aim at ending extreme poverty, fighting inequality and injustice and reducing climate change by 2030. The EU and its Member States have played a leading role in bringing about these new global commitments and are fully committed to building a better world for all. For us to be suc- cessful in this mission, we need everyone to play their part to ensure that all people everywhere can live a life in dignity. Jean\u2011Claude Juncker European Commission President Foreword ",

        "We wanted the European Year for Development to be a year of stories, stories about the people who are at the centre of our work. This has been a great success and I thank all of our partners for sharing their experiences. The many great stories collected in this book are about the girls and boys, women and men from across the world, whose lives have been touched by our cooperation. The stories show that a better world is possible and, wherever we are from and wherever we want to go, our aspirations are the same: a stable and peaceful world, edu- cation for our children, jobs for young people and a decent life on a planet we need to protect. The European Union sent a strong message about our com- mitment to international cooperation by declaring 2015 the European Year for Development. 2015 was the deadline for meeting the Millennium Development Goals, which guided our development policy for 15 years. The world has made great progress. Extreme poverty has fallen by half; over 90 % of children in developing countries, with boys and girls in equal measure, are now in school; there are twice as many women in parliament; child mor- tality has fallen by more than half and a massive 2 billion people have gained access to clean water. With the European Union and its Member States as the world\u2019s largest donor, we can take pride in these numbers. Europe\u2019s development cooperation is helping to make a dif- ference in the lives of millions around the world. These successes fuel our motivation for our future work and in implementing the new sustainable development agenda. EU institutions and delegations, Member States, our inter- national development partners, regional and local authori- ties, non-governmental organisations, universities, the me- dia and the private sector all brought their own energy and unique perspectives to the Year. I want to express my grati- tude to all of our partners for their commitment to our work. Neven Mimica European Commissioner for International Cooperation and Development Foreword ",

        "14 With rainfall becoming increasingly scarce and erratic, Husen Shibot\u2019s traditional farm could no longer sustain his family. Cultivating progress: farming in Eritrea Standing amongst his coffee trees, Husen Mohamed Jimie Shibot is pleased with his current crop. \u2018I would not feel like a real farmer if I didn\u2019t grow my own coffee\u2019, he says. Like over two thirds of Eritreans, Mr Husen works in ag- riculture. He has always lived in the Geleb region, about 100 km north of the capital Asmara, where he started to work on his parents\u2019 farm as a young man. Now, Mr Husen is himself a father and grandfather \u2014 but only he and his wife still live on their family farm in Geleb. \u2018I always wanted at least one of my four children to stay and take over the farm, looking after us in our old age \u2014 that is the traditional way of life in Eritrea\u2019, he says. But though the Eritrean climate has always been dry and crop cultivation a challenge, the conditions Mr Husen faces are very different to those of previous generations. As is traditional for farmers in this area, Mr Husen depended on rain-fed agriculture, mostly planting a variety of cereals such as barley, sorghum and millet, as well as cultivating coffee trees. Global climate change contributed to worsen- ing climatic conditions. The limited and increasingly erratic rainfall and deforestation left little water to grow enough food for personal consumption \u2014 let alone any surplus to SUDAN SAUDI ARABIA YEMEN SOMALIA DJIBUTI ERITREA ETHIOPIA SOUTH SUDAN EGYPT Husen Shibot; \u2018I hope my children can one day return to our farm\u2019.

        "A Y E A R O F S T O R I E S \u2014 E U R O P E A N Y E A R F O R D E V E L O P M E N T 2 0 1 5 15 In partnership with the government and other stakeholders, the EU has therefore supported agricultural projects worth close to EUR 50 million in recent years. Within the frame- work of government policies, EU support has helped to build numerous dams, hillside terraces and irrigation structures. Six million tree seedlings have been produced in tree nurs- eries and planted throughout the country. Since the start of the activities in Geleb, two dams have been built to recharge ground water. In order to distribute the water, a solar-driven pump has been installed in the Geleb tree nursery, so it is not dependent on expensive fossil fuels. Mr Husen is one of the 400 000 ben- eficiaries of these projects, which aim to increase agricultural production by at least 10 % in the country. The con- struction of a dam close to his farm has recharged the ground water and he can draw water from his well once again. He has also learnt how to irri- gate effectively his land and fight soil erosion. \u2018As there is now water available for irrigation, I can water plants throughout the year and have ventured into horti- culture\u2019, he says, presenting his newly cultivated guava and apple trees, the seedlings for which he received from the nearby Geleb nursery. \u2018Thanks to the irrigation, I hope to harvest enough to sell the surplus on the local market and even transport some to the town of Keren\u2019. His apples will fetch high prices in Eritrea as most apples are imported from countries like South Africa. But it is the healthy coffee sell. Mr Husen\u2019s well had been dry for years, making any type of crop irrigation impossible. Variable rainfall and an overall reduction in precipitation led to poor harvests. With the farm unable to sustain the growing family, Mr Husen\u2019s children moved away long ago, taking low-paid jobs in Er- itrea\u2019s service industry. Mr Husen\u2019s story is typical for many Eritrean farmers. As the average yearly rainfall in the region is now below 300 mm (less than half that of Germany), reliance on rain-fed agri- culture becomes increasingly precarious. Most of this pre- cipitation falls in the rainy season from July to September. During these months, heavy downpours can transform the local Chemorat River into an uncontrollable torrent. Once this surface water has rushed down the valley, however, it is lost. The river is reduced to a trickle for the rest of the year. Deforestation has reached a critical rate with the loss of thousands of trees a year. As forests slow the run-off of water and increase filtration rates to recharge underground water reservoirs, this has had a significant impact on the availability of water for irrigation. Soil erosion and declining soil fertility are also major problems. Only a very few farms in the area are mechanised, and traditional ways of cultiva- tion and harvesting prevail. This lack of modern tools, seeds and fertilisers means Eritrean farmers are unable to en- hance their harvests and leaves them dependent on wors- ening climatic conditions. Given the number of livelihoods depending on the country\u2019s agricultural sector, investment in better techniques and a move towards irrigated agriculture for year-round farming therefore makes a real difference. I would not feel like a real farmer if I didn\u2019t grow my own coffee. Husen Mohamed Jimie Shibot ",
        "16 trees that really give him confidence. Coffee is an important part of Eritrean culture \u2014 as are family ties. The size of Mr Husen\u2019s land may not be enough to support all his children and their families. But the initiatives sup- porting agriculture in the area may at least enable one of his children to return to Geleb and take over a profitable farm. \u2018This would make me happy\u2019, Mr Husen says. \u2018A fam- ily should stay together\u2019. A new crop of apples is ready to pick. EU\u2011funded activities in support of Eritrean agriculture \u00ae Current EU support for Eritrea totals more than EUR 60 million. \u00ae The largest ongoing EU programme is in agriculture. It aims to benefit more than 400 000 people and to increase agricul- tural production by around 10 %. \u00ae Six million tree seedlings will be produced and planted. \u00ae More than 1 000 hectares of land will be irrigated using solar-driven pumps. \u00ae Soil and water conservation activities are implemented on around 20 000 hectares.

Last year, its 15 seamstresses produced 180 school uniforms and 3 000 bags. It was a chal\u2011 lenge, but the women pulled together and managed to deliver all orders on time, as founder Reina Valladarez explains. \u2018I celebrate it as a victory \u2014 not long ago, no one knew who we were, and now we have gained a good name and have lots of work\u2019, she says proudly. Along the way, she has found a new identity for herself: Reina Valladarez \u2014 seamstress and business woman. Together with 14 other team members, Reina works 6 days a week trying to keep their small textile enterprise growing. \u2018Sometimes we finish so late that the husband of a col- league has to come and give us a lift home in his pick-up. He laughs at us, asking what kind of business women we are if we have to go home in a truck. But yes, we are busi- ness women\u2019, smiles Mrs Valladarez. The road to business success has not been smooth. Com- ing from a poor family, Reina Valladarez started working straight after primary school. By the age of 14 she was already learning to sew, and at 15 she started working as a seamstress. \u2018I had my first child when I was 20 years old and then simply stopped studying\u2019, she recounts. \u2018As the Honduran seamstress Reina Valladarez has made a success of her textile company \u2014 and altered her outlook on life. Reina Valladarez: hard at work to meet her business\u2019 growing orders. ",
        "18 money my husband earned was not enough to support our family, I had to earn some extra making clothes. The mar- riage was complicated and I had a son with a disability. To forget all my problems, I worked more and more\u2019, she re- calls. Working from home meant that she had limited con- tact with other working women. That was about to change. The EU is working with Honduran NGOs and officials to de- velop a programme to support the launch of small local businesses. The programme aims to strengthen economic development in Danli \u2014 to help people willing to start their own business, to accompany them in the process and to support them in forming networks that will allow them to share their experience and coordi- nate their workload. One day, officials from the municipality of Danli\u2019s local development unit came to Mrs Val- ladarez\u2019s district. They proposed to all women in the area who worked at home that they unite and organise a small enterprise of their own. The idea caught her imagination, but there were obstacles to overcome. \u2018At the beginning it looked so com- plicated. I was going to meetings and workshops and many people gave up\u2019, she remembers. But she and her team persevered and, in 2011, managed to register their own company: \u2018Luz Victoria was born\u2019, she says. The new business faced initial difficulties: capital was needed to buy materials and some of the women lacked teamwork and business-management skills. \u2018Then people from the mu- nicipality came back to help us\u2019, explains Mrs Valladarez. \u2018We passed several courses on different topics, exchanged expe- riences with other small enterprises and visited big sewing factories. I guess that was when we learned how to organise ourselves and work as a team \u2014 sometimes one person\u2019s weakness can be compensated for by another\u2019s strength. And that is great\u2019, she says. Competence-focused courses like these are part of the EU-financed programme for econom- ic development. The support also includes financial aid for material support for new businesses, which are often able to draw great benefit from very basic supplies. Luz Victoria, for instance, received a few sewing machines. These have made the company\u2019s work more productive and have allowed the team to accept bigger orders \u2014 and keep up with demand. EU-supported local economic development initiatives such as these have already had an effect all across Danli. Now, the first thing a traveller notices in the Honduran town is the number of small shops, workshops and stalls selling food, clothes and other commodities. But economic improvement is far from the only dimension of success here. \u2018Before or- ganising the company, I was totally dependent on my hus- band\u2019, says Reina Valladarez. \u2018Now I am able not only to pay for myself, but also to help my daughter cover her univer- sity costs and guarantee good living conditions for my son. And \u2014 perhaps most importantly \u2014 I see myself differently. Before the courses and training, I could not have imagined being able to negotiate, deal with government officials or business people. Now I am good at that. I guess I simply \u201ckilled off\u201d my low self-esteem\u2019, she smiles, bright-eyed as she confides that she already has big plans for the future. Not long ago, no\u2011one knew who we were.

Like thousands of boys and young men from the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) of Pakistan, Gul was coaxed and coerced into joining the Taliban in what they called their fight \u2018for the glory of Islam\u2019. He was only 18 years old. After a harrowing 4\u2011year journey, Gul Rehman has finally managed to return: having re\u2011 nounced militancy, he is back with his family and his community, reconnected and respected. It has been a long road. Gul\u2019s home, the remote Bajaur Agency region in north-west Pakistan bordering Afghanistan, has been ravaged by war. Since 2001, militant violence in FATA and adjoining areas of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) province has left a trail of death and destruction. The war has cost more than 47 000 lives and EUR 58 billion in material losses. It has caused social upheaval and deeply damaged the local communities. Pashtuns (the Pashto-speaking ethnic group accounting for most of the area\u2019s population) have long-standing traditions of tolerance and cooperation.

The movement offers a way for the local community to address and resolve its own problems and disputes, and is becoming stronger and more popular by the day.

She persuaded her son to take Paiman\u2019s phased course and work through a programme of deradicalisation. It worked: \u2018Paiman shattered my smug world of falsified indoctrination and gave me this positive thinking and this new life\u2019, says Gul. Job-related skills training for the af- fected young men also forms part of Paiman\u2019s programme, helping them find their way back to normal life. EU financial support enables Paiman\u2019s trained counsellors to work closely with them until they are reintegrated into their families and communities. The tolana also act as an \u2018early warning\u2019 mechanism, identifying young people at risk and alerting the community and relevant government depart- ments to any activity that might lead to extremism. They hold sessions to raise the community\u2019s awareness of the impact of violent extremism and act as advocates, repre- senting their community at meetings with local administra- tion and government departments. and frequent drone attacks \u2014 has left communities and individuals traumatised. The resulting atmosphere of fear has created fertile ground for Taliban recruitment. Thousands of families have lost fathers, sons and brothers to extremist indoctrination. The young men in particular are targeted. \u2018Youths are inhuman- ly recruited and used for terrorism in our region\u2019, says Gul\u2019s teacher. Naivety, deprivation and lack of opportunities cre- ate openings for the extremists. \u2018The younger children find it hard to refuse the terrorists, fearing for their own safety or reprisals against their families\u2019, says the teacher. Gul\u2019s personal experience relates how, once recruited, the young men are taught to glorify violence. \u2018During our train- ing, the extremists told us that our mission was as simple as touching two wires together and that the resulting blast would obliterate the infidels or those siding with them \u2014 but that God would spare us from the flame and shrapnel, protecting us from any harm\u2019, he recalls. \u2018I was indoctrinat- ed and numbed\u2019. Finding a way back wasn\u2019t easy for Gul Rehman, but he was also lucky \u2014 not least thanks to his mother. She was ap- proached by Paiman, a local NGO promoting peace, non-vi- olent dispute resolution and deradicalisation. Supported by EU-funding, Paiman works with the local communities. One of its peace groups had identified Gul\u2019s mother and sup- ported her training as a tolana (Pashto for \u2018together\u2019). The tolana are central to Paiman\u2019s strategy for creating non-vi- olent communities.

The spread of the toxic gas to the surrounding valleys took the lives of over 1 700 people and decimated livestock in every village within a 15 km radius. The devastating effects of the tragedy would be felt by the region and its people for years to come. In the wake of the disaster, the government and its main partners, including the European Union, launched projects to make the areas surrounding the lake safe and viable. The aim is to prevent further explosions and to reassure the inhabitants of the region by gradually releasing the gas buried under the lake. An artificial degassing system was installed in 2001 and is being closely monitored. Martin Kin\u00e9 hails from one of the villages in the vicinity of the lake. He lost his father in the disaster and is still haunt- ed by the memory. \u2018On the day of the tragedy, my father had come to check on his herd as usual\u2019, he recounts. \u2018As it was getting late, he decided to sleep there and return home the following day. That was the last I saw of him\u2019. In 1986, the Lake Nyos disaster took 1 700 lives. Now, thanks to investment, the region is recovering and its people can come home.

        "24 The Nyos region is still considered by the authorities as an area of high risk, but the safety measures now in place have served to reassure hundreds of displaced persons who, like Martin Kin\u00e9, are gradually returning home. \u2018I came back to the area last year because I realised that the gov- ernment and its partners had done a lot to make sure that Lake Nyos will never explode again\u2019, he reasons. Between 2010 and 2014, the EU spent EUR 14.5 million in the region, enabling work to be carried out to re- inforce the dam, build an access road and help resettle inhabitants. It is esti- mated that some 10 000 people have benefited indirectly from the EU\u2019s en- deavours. \u2018We\u2019ve found a site for a new school, and officials working for Emida, an or- ganisation that receives EU aid, are now just waiting for the go-ahead from the authorities\u2019, explains Olivier Tang Kuma, the village\u2019s crown prince. His face lights up when he talks about what he sees as the \u2018rebirth of Nyos village\u2019. For him, the array of measures taken to breathe new life into the area in the aftermath of the disaster are \u2018an absolute godsend\u2019. Aboubakar Soulemane Maoko, a dignitary from the Muslim community, shares the prince\u2019s optimism: \u2018We welcome the European Union\u2019s help with open arms\u2019, he says. \u2018Through Emida, the EU is building classrooms, drinking water points and mills, establishing communal fields and so on. Just what the villagers need!\u2019 \u2018We\u2019re working to improve living conditions for local people, but also to encourage those still living in the camps set up after the disaster to come back to the villages, where there is an abundance of pasture land\u2019, stresses Claude Olivier Bagneken, Emida\u2019s executive secretary. Launched almost 6 months ago, the project is set to run for 2 years. As well as the ongoing construction of a range of basic infrastruc- ture, it has also launched capacity-building measures for local associations and trained over 200 people in prevent- ing violence in schools and in managing social conflict. In 2012, thanks to European Development Fund resources, the EU launched the first phase of operations to shore up the lake\u2019s natural dam. The aim is to prevent the natural dam \u2014 which retains the water of the lake \u2014 from burst- ing. Gr\u00e9gory Tanyileke, geologist and head of the team in charge of the project, hails it as one of the EU\u2019s key en- deavours in the region. \u2018The success of this first phase, like the scientific studies which shed light on the root cause of the 1986 disaster, gives us real grounds for optimism\u2019, he adds. His words have not gone unheard: inhabitants of the region are slowly returning to the areas around the lake despite their painful memories of the 1986 disaster.

Ali underlines that a daily meal for the children has much to do with this development. \u2018The students can only deliver results when their basic needs are provided for. The access to daily school meals makes the children more focused and will eventually give them a better opportunity to influence their own future\u2019, he says. The school has now made its own vegetable garden with the aim of sustainably and cost-effectively producing its own food for the children now and into the future. Ali and his fellow teachers have had to overcome many challenges in the school, but one of their greatest improve- ments in recent years was not to do with education, but rather with a more basic matter: food. Coming from im- poverished backgrounds, the children often came to school hungry, which made it difficult for them to focus on their schoolwork. The teachers sometimes gave some of their own food to the students, or would even approach Ali to ask for food or money for themselves and the children. This all changed with the introduction of the \u2018School feeding programme\u2019, which was implemented by the World Food Programme in 2010 with EU financial support.

The note\u2011 book seems to be his most treasured possession. His parents don\u2019t have much more, but Owen feels lucky because he is finally going to school. Not long ago, there were no schools in his village, Itenda, with the closest one located 20 km away. The bush surrounds the village for hundreds of kilometres. Itenda lies at the heart of the Muchinga escarpment, well over a thousand kilometres from Lusaka. Tall acacias lean towards the ground, praying for rain; not one drop has fall- en for months. The rivers and creeks seem to have dried out long ago. As we arrive in the village, scores of women and children are dancing and singing. They smile and offer firm hand- shakes while drums play. Someone presents us with a live chicken. There have been no cars spotted here for the last 5 months, so everyone is pleased to see us and we are immediately surrounded by a small group of children.

Before, none of the children were attending school, but to- day almost a hundred boys and girls, aged 3 to 12, study reading, writing and arithmetic, sitting in small groups on the red clay floor. The most popular of all are picture books \u2014 the children could spend hours looking through them \u2014 but now it\u2019s time for mathematics. Eagerly, the children start copying equations that Mr Kaira has written on the blackboard into their notebooks. A multicoloured globe is the main attraction. The children finally know where in the world are Zambia, Cha- ma and Lusaka. The confines of the village are expanding as the world flows in by virtue of everyday learn- ing. The children find out about new worlds inhabited not just by elephants, impalas and snakes, but also by kan- garoos, penguins and, in the oceans, whales as big as elephants. The community school is a revelation, for the parents and village elders just as much as the children. \u2018In 2 to 3 years, the children will know much more than their parents. The parents are now well aware that even primary education has the potential to change their children\u2019s lives\u2019, says Mr Kaira. Owen already knows as much. \u2018When I finish school, I will work in the city, where there are no elephants or snakes\u2019, he says with conviction. Proudly, Owen leads us to a large rectangular building \u2014 his new school, the most important spot in the village. He is indeed lucky: in Africa, one in four people have never been to school, as in many remote villages there simply is no school. Zambia is far from an exception in this respect. Although the constitution espouses the right to universal public education, many children are forced to forgo school in order to contribute to their families\u2019 survival. The school in Itenda was built by the villagers. For weeks they dug for clay, formed it into small cubes, dried them in the sun and built a great semi-circular kiln, which was then fired to harden it. The school is run by a group of communi- ty leaders. Everyone has a different responsibility: one acts as a caretaker, an essential function in the midst of the African bush, where a moment\u2019s inattention can result in a devastating termite infestation. Another person tends to the school garden, the main source of school funding and of the teacher\u2019s salary. The teacher in Itenda is Mr Kaira, a volunteer who looks to be around 20 years old. He talks about his work, surround- ed at all times by a gaggle of children. \u2018Project managers visit twice a year from Lusaka. We can\u2019t do this by ourselves. For me, it\u2019s like a course in continu- ous education. We discuss new learning methods, children\u2019s rights, the best ways to improve conditions in our village. The children love being in school. Here, they have new books, maps, rulers\u2019. The parents are now well aware that even primary education has the potential to change their children\u2019s lives.

A shortage of primary school teachers and facilities continues to be a problem throughout Papua New Guinea, and many schools lack qualified teachers, especially in the more remote communities. Where there are no teachers, schools are simply closed, and many children cannot attend school. The provision of well-trained teachers is essential if all children, including those from remote villages, are to have access to quality education. \u2018I like to work with young people and support them. Where I come from, many schools have closed down because there are not enough teachers, and I see the need to go back and work there\u2019, says Mathilda Patrick, a recently qualified teacher.

        "34 Mathilda is one of 220 teachers to have graduated under the scholarship programme so far, and a further 700 trainee teachers are completing their studies this year. \u2018The 2 years of studies were very challenging in terms of tackling all the new knowledge and skills to be learned. Learning to be patient with children was the biggest challenge for me\u2019, recalls Mathilda. Mathilda is now teaching at Kamina Primary School, an isolated village 5 hours\u2019 walk across rugged terrain from her home village. \u2018It is difficult\u2019, Mathilda tells us. \u2018The lack of power is a big challenge, as is the lack of resources and teaching aids too. There are not enough teachers in these villages, so we also face the challenge of teaching multi-grade classes, for a teacher is a complex task\u2019. All these issues are addressed by the teacher training course, attended by Mathilda. The training also equips teachers to sensitise the curriculum to the local context and teach important human rights topics to the children, such as gender equality and conflict resolution. Mathilda, also a single working mother, with a 2-year-old daughter, is happy that she had the opportunity to return to her region to teach and be close to her family for support. \u2018I am the only one from my region who made it to the teachers\u2019 college to study.

But that has not been possible for them, because the schools and colleges have always been designed for people who have not dropped out of school or who only have a little catching up to do. Today thousands of young Ecuadorians who have been out of school for 3 or more years can resume their stud- ies through a flexible education pro- gramme implemented by Ecuador\u2019s Ministry of Education. This programme is designed for stu- dents to cover 3 school years in just 11 months. The students must attend class every day and are given mate- rials and relevant texts, while their teachers are trained to develop a pu- pil-centred approach to teaching them. Once they complete the programme, the participants can enrol in any institution they choose to continue their regular high school studies. A project run by the DYA (Centre for Development and Self-management) with the financial support of the Euro- pean Union played a key part in developing this programme and making it a reality today. The centre focused its efforts on lending technical assistance to the Ministry of Education to cater for young people like Mar\u00eda and Pedro, mobilising local agencies helping prevent child labour and establish- ing educational services that serve as models for teenagers and young people who have fallen behind in their schooling. Through an agreement with the Ministry of Education, the centre delivered its educational model in September 2014, and since then has supplied technical assistance to cater for 50 000 young people between 15 and 21 years old. Children who work lose much more than they gain. Com- bating child and juvenile labour means giving them all ac- cess to education.

This allows them to dream, to achieve their personal goals and to fully exercise their right to education.

However, the difficulty or novelty of this situation did not prevent these young Indian women from working as peer leaders with the action project in order to pass on information about child marriage, pregnan\u2011 cy, contraception, HIV prevention and care, sexually transmitted infections (STI) and other aspects of sex\u2011 ual health to youth in their village. Supported by the European Union, the action project em- powers young people and especially girls and young wom- en by educating them about issues that are important to them and discussing subjects that no one has talked to them about before. Peer leaders are integral to this work, helping to spread the information to other young people, as they are more likely to listen and learn from peers their own age.

Savera (name changed), a 20-year-old peer leader, says, \u2018I was completely unaware about hygiene and nutri- tion during menstruation, safe sex, condom use or consensual sex. I also learned so much about HIV prevention and care here\u2019. Remembering when she first started working as a peer leader, she recalls that \u2018the villagers used to call me \u2018characterless\u2019 because I spoke open- ly about sexual reproductive rights, which was something \u2018nice, conserva- tive girls\u2019 aren\u2019t allowed to talk about. Now, however, my uncles and oth- er village elders ask me to get their daughters involved in the project\u2019. An increasing number of girls are doing just that. Anoth- er peer leader who joined the action project, Divya (name changed), found the information she received to be helpful on a very personal level. The 19-year-old explains, \u2018I met this boy in college 3 years ago and we began to like each other and he asked me to have sex with him. After everything I had learned from this project, I knew that I didn\u2019t want to have sex with him, that I had the right to say \u2018No\u2019 and so I refused. I\u2019m happy that I had the right information and was able to protect myself from potentially ruining my life\u2019. It is important to note that having the right information isn\u2019t enough if it isn\u2019t coupled with the confidence to share the information or to search for more information. While speaking about her attendance in health camps and infor- mation-sharing meetings with doctors, Savera said, \u2018I would never have dreamed of speaking to a doctor even about my own health problems. Now I can openly ask doctors ques- tions about sexual health and other issues and I can see how amazed they are that I, being a village girl, am able to confidently ask these things\u2019. Kavita added, \u2018I used to be ashamed when they taught us about sexual and repro- ductive health and rights but now there is no shame and our perspectives have changed. Now I feel confident and at ease sharing information about these issues\u2019. With the right type of support and access to information, the action project is building the capacity of these girls and young women leaders and offering them a sense of confi- dence they never had before, while also empowering them to change the social landscape of their villages, one peer group at a time. The villagers used to criticise me because I spoke openly about sexual reproductive rights, which was something \u2018nice, conservative girls\u2019 aren\u2019t allowed to talk about.

It all started on 9 October 2014 at the Ebola treatment centre (CTE) in the town of Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou in the Guin\u00e9e For- esti\u00e8re region of Guinea. Two days after being admitted to the centre (run by M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res [MSF] and financed by the European Union), Papus was informed that he had tested positive for Ebola, the dreadful haemorrhagic fever devastating the country. Having just recently buried his father, a former surgeon who had died of a disease with similar symptoms to Ebola, Papus took the news philosophically: \u2018I knew that if you sus- pected you might have Ebola, coming to the treatment cen- tre would quickly increase your chance of survival. That\u2019s what I did, of my own accord, so I was very confident\u2019. The staff of the CTE took meticulous care of Papus and all the other patients. He ate well, drank water regularly, took his medicine as he was supposed to and had regular visits from his family and loved ones, which did much to cheer him up.

Since then, he has talk- ed about the illness to his neighbours and raised awareness of Ebola in local radio broadcasts, churches and public places. In doing so he is honouring the wish of his late father, who advised him to \u2018always strive to save lives\u2019.

It is an area that faced the brunt of 2 decades of civil war. For as far back as Margaret can remember, if there is one challenge that has hampered her life, it is access to water. In many parts of rural Africa, the majority of people living with disabilities, older people and those living with chronic illnesses spend most of their lives marginalised by society and deprived of human dignity. In five post-conflict districts in north-eastern Uganda, the EU is supporting the imple- mentation of a project delivering safe water, sanitation and hygiene education, in partnership with WaterAid Uganda under the EU Water Facility. Access to water is fundamental to human dignity and health. \u2018Before there was a safe water point in Bobolo village, we could only collect water from the swamp down the valley\u2019, Margaret says. \u2018I could not push my wheelchair uphill with a big water container. As a result I would have to go with- out enough water for some days or wait for my children to come back from school to help me push the tricycle\u2019.

        "56 A little over a year ago, however, things changed for the better when the water, sanitation and hygiene project was launched in Margaret\u2019s home village. Through the project run by WaterAid Uganda, a borehole was constructed in the village, bring- ing safe water to Bobolo. \u2018My life has never been the same with safe wa- ter nearby. It now takes me less than 15 minutes to collect water\u2019, rejoiced Margaret. Margaret was also able to construct an accessible latrine and a bath shel- ter big enough for her wheelchair by using locally available materials. The project even helped her acquire a rain- water-harvesting tank in her com- pound. \u2018During rainy seasons I don\u2019t have to go to the village borehole any- more. The tank collects enough water to last me a long time\u2019, Margaret says. To improve sanitation and good hygiene practices in the vil- lage, the project used a community approach, clustering the households in the village for sensitisation, capacity building and initiating actions. The village clusters then led the con- struction of sanitation and hygiene facilities for people with disabilities and households with other vulnerable people. Locally available materials and construction methods were used to construct these facilities. Construction methods in- cluded the use of dry grass bundles to construct curtain walls for bathing enclosures and the use of four-litre jerry cans to make a hand-washing facility \u2014 better known as tippy taps \u2014 for the toilet. Margaret is one of several people in Bobolo village who have benefited from the better sanitation. With improved access to inclusive safe water, sanitation and hygiene facil- ities, Margaret has ample time to participate in and contrib- ute to village meetings, engage in household chores and earn a living by plaiting people\u2019s hair and mending clothes. Margaret\u2019s experience provides an inspiring example of how improved access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene education can transform the lives of people with disabili- ties, older people and those living with chronic illnesses. Margaret is not alone. Many community members, under the guidance of their cluster heads, are using the acquired knowledge to innovate and make their sanitation facilities accessible. WaterAid Uganda and the other project partners regularly use the lessons learned from this work to influ- ence policymakers to make inclusive water and sanitation a reality for all in Uganda. Before there was a safe water point in the village, we could only collect water from the swamp down the valley. I could not push my wheelchair uphill with a big water container.

Sister Zamisa had Lizzy taken into theatre right away, where doctors operated on her to deliv- er the three remaining babies \u2014 a boy, a girl and another boy. The outcome astonished even the experienced Sister Zamisa: \u2018Despite the long hours of labour, all the nurslings were healthy. These really are true miracle babies\u2019. Five years ago, Lizzy\u2019s story might well have ended less happily. Zimba- bwe\u2019s health sector was on the brink of collapse. The economic and political crisis had led to chronic underfunding and the health sector battled with a large-scale skills flight, outdated hospital equipment and stockouts of essential medicines and commodities. The maternal mortality ratio reached an all-time high of 960 per 100 000 births. Now a busy mother of six, Lizzy isn\u2019t too concerned with the figures. She knows for sure, though, that her life hung by a thread: \u2018I wouldn\u2019t be alive today without the ambulance that transferred me so speedily to the hospital and to my rescue\u2019. something may go wrong. I don\u2019t have transport, the clinic never used to have transport and I was anxious about what would happen in case of complications\u2019, says Lizzy. Mabeya clinic, however, had received one of 63 all-terrain ambu- lances distributed to rural, district and mission hospitals by the European Union through a UNFPA programme on ma- ternal health. As Lizzy\u2019s due date arrived in June 2014, she went into labour at Mabeya clinic and everything seemed to be going well. She gave birth to a boy: a small baby at 1.8 kg, but otherwise healthy. Then things took a turn for the worse. As both Lizzy and the staff at Mabeya clinic were shocked to discover, she was carrying a further three babies yet to be delivered. The situation turned critical: Lizzy was in pain and urgently needed proper medical attention. \u2018I was terrified\u2019, Lizzy recalls. \u2018I thought I was going to meet my maker right there\u2019. To her surprise, she was ushered into an ambulance and ferried to St Peter\u2019s Hospital at Che- cheche Growth Point. \u2018Doctors there immediately scanned me. I saw them shaking their heads; they said they couldn\u2019t help me. I was whisked away again, back into the ambu- lance, and we dashed towards Chiredzi General Hospital, 180 km from Mabeya\u2019. Sister Langelisha Zamisa, the nurse in charge of the hospi- tal\u2019s maternity ward, says Lizzy\u2019s condition on arrival was very serious. \u2018When she was wheeled in here she had lost a lot of blood and suffered postpartum haemorrhages and Despite the long hours of labour, all the nurslings were healthy.

Their youngest son, baby Sajjad, had not been eating well and had lost a lot of weight. Having suf\u2011 fered two miscarriages and the death of one baby at just 3 days old, Mrs Nathi was praying for better luck with Sajjad. She and her husband were doing every\u2011 thing in their power to help their infant son \u2014 even taking out a hefty loan to pay for 3 months\u2019 worth of expensive medical treatment. The treatment, howev\u2011 er, had failed to make a difference. When Merlin\u2019s nutrition experts visited the couple\u2019s village of Haji Umer Jat in January 2014, they examined Sajjad and found him to be severely malnourished. Along with a fever and diarrhoea, the condition was putting Sajjad\u2019s life in danger. They recommended immediately sending Sajjad to the nutrition stabilisation centre at a hospital in the district capital Thatta. However, this posed a real prob- lem for Sajjad\u2019s parents, who had no one to look after their other children. Mr Jatt couldn\u2019t take time off work, as his job as a security guard brought in just 3 000 Rupees (ca. EUR 27) a month. Hardly enough for the family to get by on \u2014 especially once the repayment instalment of the loan he took out for earlier treatments had been deducted. With an EU-funded project, Merlin is helping malnourished children like Sajjad and their families. Baby Sajjad: getting a health check. ",
        "62 Fortunately, Merlin staff were able to refer Sajjad to the nearby health facility where the EU-WINS project had en- abled an outpatient therapeutic programme (OTP). Here, the medical officer immediately prescribed the medicines needed to deal with Sajjad\u2019s complica- tions at home and provided Mrs Nathi with a week\u2019s worth of sachets of ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) for Sajjad. The staff showed her how to feed the RUTF to Sajjad and how much to give him. RUTF is a highly nu- tritious peanut-based paste in a plas- tic wrapper, which requires no water, preparation or refrigeration. Two sa- chets per day are equivalent to 1 000 calories and are taken in addition to regular food and breast milk. Sajjad\u2019s health improved dramatically. In just a week, he gained 300 g in weight and 0.4 cm in height \u2014 rapid growth and evidence of a healthy appetite. As Mrs Nathi had previously stopped breastfeeding, Merlin experts advised her to resume and continue until Sajjad reached the age of two. Though sceptical at first, she ac- cepted the staff\u2019s advice on exercises promoting \u2018re-lac- tation\u2019. She\u2019s now happily breastfeeding again and says it makes her feel relaxed. After 2 months of treatment, Sajjad was looking good on all indicators and had achieved the healthy weight of 7.7 kg. Mrs Nathi couldn\u2019t be happier: \u2018We had lost hope after con- tinuous expensive treatment for 3 months, but now Sajjad is doing well. I feel so happy that he\u2019s eating properly and has the proper nutritional supplies, guidance and care at no cost. This means I can give some time to my other children and to my domestic responsibilities\u2019, she says. She also has more time for hand embroidery, an important supplemen- tary source of family income. Sajjad\u2019s father agrees. \u2018Thanks to Merlin, Sajjad is now healthy. I am very thankful to the nutrition team who are helping poor children in Thatta District. I am also thankful to God that my Sajjad is now so much more active and energetic\u2019, says Mr Jatt. Both parents are showing their gratitude by getting actively involved. Mrs Nathi is now the leader of a breastfeeding group in the village and does vol- untary nutrition work. So far, she has identified five cas- es of severely malnourished children, all of whom have been referred to the OTP for admission. Mr Jatt is an ac- tive member of the village health committee and works as a volunteer, helping the nutrition team trace defaulters and absentees.

You\u2019re not alone: tackling mental health in Afghanistan Malalay (fictitious name to protect her identity) was born in Maidan Wardak, a province in central\u2011eastern Afghanistan. She is one of six children and, since she was five, has lived in fear. Her father was often vio\u2011 lent at home. Every day she would dread the moment her father returned from work, not knowing what his mood would be like. As she grew older, she learned that he was suffering from mental problems that caused depression and erratic, ag- gressive behaviour, as well as psychosomatic issues. By the time Malalay turned 13, her family moved to Ka- bul. Like many other Afghans that moved to Kabul from the countryside looking for better opportunities, they found themselves living in one of the many poor neighbourhoods of the Afghan capital. By then her father\u2019s illness had been diagnosed and medical treatment had helped him. But 8 years of constant distress had taken their toll on the psychological wellbeing of Mala- lay. She was depressed, she was feeling constant physical discomfort and her hands and feet would often get cold without any apparent reason.

From battleground to playground in the Philippines \u2018I\u2019m so happy to see people bringing hope to our lives. We couldn\u2019t return to our village because our houses were burned during the war and I\u2019m afraid that there is still unexploded ordnance around. We need help to clear these dangers and to rebuild our village\u2019, says Tantua Dikatula, a 65\u2011year\u2011old Muslim and former resident of Lumbac village in southern Philippines. This follows an unexploded ordnance (UXO)-risk education session in her village delivered by the NGO Fondation Su- isse de D\u00e9minage (FSD, Swiss Foundation for Mine-clearing in English). UXO are grenades, mortar shells, anti-tank mis- siles, rockets, aircraft bombs that were fired or dropped but have yet to explode. \u2018After what you\u2019ve taught me, I wouldn\u2019t pick up an UXO even if someone offered me a million pesos\u2019, says Mrs Mondejar, a Christian resident of the nearby village of In- udaran, following the presentation. Both women, Christian and Muslim, belong to mixed com- munities affected by armed conflict.

As part of the process, the teams report any device found to police and army explosive ordnance disposal teams and relay requests for UXO clearance and other assistance. Today Inudaran is making an effort to overcome its dreadful past. As the parties to the conflict have brokered a peace agreement after more than 16 years of on-and-off negotiations, peace and order have been re-es- tablished and the different religious groups live together side by side. In 2011, the village launched its new motto, \u2018From battleground to play- ground\u2019, as it hosted the first of its annual long-board com- petitions on what they claim to be the longest racetrack for this sport in the whole of Asia. At least some of the destroyed houses have been rebuilt and new buildings like a medical centre and a day care centre have been erect- ed. However, much more remains to be done with the local school still in ruins and many unexploded ordnance leaving the population at risk. In 2000, one of the main rebel groups, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) launched a number of attacks in the area. In response, the government declared an \u2018all-out war\u2019. Both women\u2019s villages were caught up in the fighting. Inudaran, which means \u2018lucky\u2019 in the local language, was turned into a bloody battlefield overnight. The fighting in- volved shelling, mortar bombardment, aerial bombing and ground combat. After suffering heavy casualties, MILF reb- els were forced to retreat into the hills. After the fighting ended, the destruction was laid bare. All the villagers had left the district \u2014 Inudaran had a popu- lation of zero in the official 2001 census \u2014 and most of the buildings were destroyed beyond repair. This included the only local elementary school, today a ruin, riddled with bullet holes and shrapnel marks. This was not the only legacy. The few who dared to return soon encountered one of the most hazardous legacies of modern warfare: UXO. One of those who came back to the village was 15-year-old Nelito Tokiro, who was seriously injured after he found a mor- tar bomb under a coconut tree.

        "72 The education system is already very weak throughout the whole country. The cycles of conflicts in the east have made education take a turn for the worse. Some schools have repeatedly closed down due to inse- curity, gravely disrupting the learning process. In Maibano, like most parts of rural eastern DRC, the schooling infra- structure is poor.

However, this selection can be difficult in a country like the DRC where education is also affected by poverty and weak governance\u2019. Through the EU Children of Peace project, the EU is aiming to give 2 000 children affected by conflict in the DRC an education. Education is crucial for both the protection and the development of all children, especially those affected by conflict. This initiative is meant to give children psycho- social support and help create some sense of normality. \u2018Children do not readily identify guns as a threat. They are used to seeing armed men around\u2019, says Justin Kaseke, from War Child Holland, the coordinator of the EU Children of Peace project in the DRC. \u2018But they easily identify the effects of the conflict on their lives and in the community\u2019.

These are the words of Maria Santos, talking to police offi- cers from the \u2018Special Department of Attention to Women and Intra-Family Violence of the Dominican National Police Force\u2019. Maria is 24 years old. About a year ago she was savage- ly attacked by her partner who struck her 14 times with a machete. She was severely wounded and terrified that he would return to finish the job, especially since having had the courage to make a formal report of this brutal crime to the special unit. Maria has recovered well, though is badly scarred, and is slowly regaining her confidence and self-esteem. Second Lieutenant Wardi Altagracia Lebr\u00f3n Cruz and Sergeant Ma- jor Luc\u00eda Jim\u00e9nez Aybar, both attached to the special unit, have a lot to do with this, pushing the investigation hard. The perpetrator fled, changed his identity and went under- ground, but was captured and is now in prison. The health service worked on the physical wounds and the special unit helped to organise therapy and ensure justice.

Sergeant Major Luc\u00eda Jim\u00e9nez Aybar: improving police practice and decreasing violence against women. ",
        "78 These are formidable women and greatly experienced, committed police officers, both tough and tender. Both ex- pressed their deep satisfaction with the training organised by Profamilia, an NGO supported by the EU in human rights, gender awareness and practical techniques of dealing with women who are victims of violence. Second Lieutenant Wardi Altagracia Lebr\u00f3n Cruz has no il- lusions; she knows that such violence is part of Dominican \u2018macho\u2019 culture and that the fight is on many levels. How- ever, she is clear that her own vision and awareness has changed and her practice as a police officer has im- proved, particularly in what she calls the \u2018approach\u2019 to victims. Wardi is well aware that women victims are all too often treated as the guilty party in a sexist culture. Sergeant Major Luc\u00eda Jim\u00e9nez Aybar was also impressive in her under- standing of the need to reduce vio- lence inside the police force. Luc\u00eda un- derstands the need to unlearn deeply embedded models of violent and sexist behaviour throughout society as well as in the police force. She insisted on the need to target men, and more especially boys, in order to break down cultural- ly rooted attitudes and deconstruct the myths of a macho masculine gender identity. Both women have become \u2018facilitators\u2019 of training work- shops with fellow police officers and key community figures such as teachers, reaching 1 500 people a month. Wardi and Luc\u00eda claim to be \u2018contagious\u2019 and to be chang- ing the practices of their colleagues in other units. These are realistic professionals, rooted in and aware of the cul- ture they live in. Wardi has been in the force for 18 years and Luc\u00eda for 15. Both have 10 years\u2019 experience in units dealing with women victims of violence and both know the problem is big, pervasive and hard to eradicate, but they are refreshingly optimistic. They expect to win the battle in the long term and make a systemic contribution to improved police practice and decrease violence against women. This programme has crossed boundaries and ignored ta- boos. The decision to work with the police force, which is generally speaking an authoritarian, sharply hierarchical organisation steeped in machismo and almost military in its structure and culture, was inspired. They are not \u2018natu- ral\u2019 partners. The fact that the police opened themselves up to this partnership and this uncompromising training is also a very positive sign. In fact, much of the material on hu- man and specifically gender rights developed for the course has been included in the general police training procedures. Gender awareness in police training is being mainstreamed. These radical changes mean that women like Maria Santos can feel more secure and no longer be afraid at home or on the street. I am no longer afraid at home or on the street. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Maria Santos ",

Vietnam\u2019s tourism industry making sustainability pay \u2018About 5 years ago, tourism marketing in Vietnam was for many people mainly about promotion\u2019, says Mr Le Tuan Anh, Deputy Director of Marketing at the Vietnam National Administration of Tourism (VNAT). At the time, our aim was simple \u2014 to just increase tourism\u2019. Tourism statistics from the Vietnam General Statistics Office substantiate Mr Anh\u2019s claims. From 2000 to 2013, international visitor arrivals to Vietnam more than tripled, from 2.1 million visitors to 7.6 million, and domestic tour- ism from 11.7 million to 35 million. \u2018However, with such success, we started to realise that some of our top tourist destinations like Ha Long Bay were being loved to death by the visitors\u2019, notes Mr Anh. \u2018We were struggling to manage the crowds and to maintain the infrastructure such as the ferry wharfs and the trails to caves and lookouts. We also noticed more rubbish in the water and small incidents of friction starting to emerge be- tween visitors and local communities\u2019. \u2018So in terms of visitor arrivals, we were more than achiev- ing our goals; but we were doing it at the risk of harming the environment and the relationship with the local people.

The work of VNAT and ESRT in bringing responsible tour- ism into the mainstream is, however, not just staying at the central level. Throughout 2014 the ESRT project im- plemented a nation-wide responsible tourism seminar series which reached more than 3 000 beneficiaries from the tourism private sector, tourism au- thorities at the provincial and district level and communities involved with tourism at the local level. \u2018The responsible tourism seminars instil the importance and benefits of sustain- ability into our key sector stakeholders and arm them with practical strategies they can put into place to become more sustainable\u2019, says Mr Anh. \u2018I am very excited about the future for tourism in Vietnam now\u2019, Mr Anh says, grinning. \u2018Before, we were always wor- rying about the problems coming from growth. Now that we are on the pathway to sustainability our opportunities seem endless\u2019. We clearly had to change the way we were doing business\u2019, said Mr Anh. \u2018In 2010, when the EU proposed a programme on respon- sible tourism to the Vietnamese Government, we knew this was exactly what we needed\u2019. \u2018To date, we have made great progress. With the help of the EU environmentally and socially responsible tourism (ESRT) programme we now have a tourism marketing strategy that still allows for growth, but also focuses on developing qual- ity products that are based on the strengths of Vietnam\u2019s destinations and not only considers economic benefits, but also social and environmental impacts\u2019, adds Mr Anh. According to Mr Anh, sustainability is also reflected in the current incarnation of the nation\u2019s tourism logo, a vibrant lotus flower sprouting out of the word Vietnam. \u2018The petals of the lotus flower reflect Vietnam\u2019s strategic product lines: marine/beach tourism, cultural tourism, na- ture-based tourism and city-breaks. By sensitively promot- ing nature and culture in our product line, we are not only helping to preserve our natural and cultural heritage for which, as a nation, we are very proud, but we are also add- ing new economic value to the environment and people\u2019s cultural heritage. Increasing demand for natural and cul- tural heritage products is, for example, supporting employ- ment in rural homestays, craft villages and for performance Before, we were always worrying about the problems coming from growth.

Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez is getting ready to start her shift working in the floating cage full of spotted rose snappers that belongs to her cooperative in the es\u2011 tuary of La Ballona\u2019s community. Maria Jos\u00e9 was born and raised in La Ballona, about 186 km from the capital, Managua. She was left in the care of her grandmother to be raised and left school by 8th grade to get married. She now works as the secretary and spokes- person of the Marcelino M\u00e9ndez Cooperative. The cooperative is farming commercial species of fish and shellfish as opposed to the more traditional methods of fishing in the area. It is supported by the EcoPesca project, which is funded by the European Union and implemented by Friends of the Earth from Spain, and by the LIDER and Cod- deffagolf foundations. The project is working to preserve the area\u2019s marine biodiversity and improve living conditions of 46 coastal marine communities in Nicaragua, Honduras and El Salvador, which all share the Gulf of Fonseca. This Nicaraguan cooperative is developing sustainable fish farming, helping to protect the ecosystem and providing a living for locals. The snapper farm on the floating cage. ",
        "86 The Nicaraguan fisheries census conducted in 2011 by EcoPesca found that there are 2 500 fishermen, more than half of whom work offshore and the other 1 000 in the es- tuaries. The census also found that 80 % of those working in the estuaries are from female-headed households. Co- operatives like Marcelino M\u00e9ndez have the power to bring great change to the sustainability of these communities, which survive through fishing. Ensuring that coastal communities are interested in farming commercial spe- cies has not been an easy task. The EcoPesca project has created a strat- egy for the fishing sector to change perceptions around fish farming. While feeding the fish, Maria Jos\u00e9 ex- plains how she is contributing to the economic development of both her family and the community. Six months ago, the cooperative obtained legal status, the granting of the 5-acre area in which they operate and commercial rights to sell at a better price. With these legal rights, the cooperative feels more empowered. \u2018Now all the authorities, organisa- tions and cooperation agencies give us a prompt response. Without this recognition, it would not be the same\u2019, says Maria Jos\u00e9. The cooperative members are farming snapper. An import- ant aspect of this work is feeding, which aims to fatten the fish from 1 to 1.25 pounds. It is necessary to feed the fish three times daily with fresh shrimp heads or twice a day with pele (a nutritious food for fish). To improve the quali- ty of life and generate more income, the cooperative also produces shell fish. For Edwin Caballero from the LIDER Foundation and a spe- cialist in sustainable economy, La Ballona is the best place to implement these activities, both due to the environ- mental conditions and because it ties in with supplying the local tourism economy. \u2018A single cage would generate USD 6 000. In a single harvest, they will handle five cages, generating USD 30 000 in 6 months\u2019, says Caballero. These economic initiatives have even gone beyond im- proving the families\u2019 incomes; the number of children and youth in the workforce has been reduced. The project has partnered with the Ministry of Education and the Munici- pal Government to stamp out child labour. \u2018We believe that children and adolescents should be in schools, not working in fisheries\u2019, says Mr Caballero. Moreover, the project has set the foundations for good tri- lateral cooperation between Nicaragua, Honduras and El Salvador for sustainable fish farming and ecosystem pro- tection in the Gulf of Fonseca.

Origi\u2011 nally from the city of Thi\u00e8s in Senegal, some 100 km from Dakar, she followed her husband to the near\u2011 by town of Mboro when he moved there for work in 1985. However, the little money he was making was not enough to feed the whole family. \u2018My husband alone could not provide for us. I decided to get into farming to take some of the financial pressure off my husband. I\u2019ve loved farming ever since I was a child. My father was a farmer too\u2019, she told us. Two years after moving to Mboro, Sokhna rented a half-hectare plot of land for EUR 11 per harvest. The field was 2 km away from her home. \u2018I had to walk there be- cause I couldn\u2019t afford public transport.\u2019 Every morning, Sokhna would make breakfast for the fam- ily, do the housework and then head off to her field. She would use water from the well in the field to water her plot. When done, she would return home to make lunch. \u2018As a woman, I couldn\u2019t work in the field like a man does, because I had to take care of the household chores first\u2019.

It was a huge thing\u2019. As time went by, Sokhna got better organised and gained additional experience. Her husband retired and joined her in the fields. In 2012, they exported 8 tonnes of on- ions for EUR 1 200 and a year later they exported 9.5 tonnes bringing in EUR 1 425. The whole family reaped the bene- fits of Sokhna\u2019s agricultural venture: \u2018I could afford to send my children to school and feed and clothe us all\u2019. In order to continue her export busi- ness, Sokhna now needs to step up her production and, even more im- portantly, improve the storage condi- tions for the product to keep longer. The European Union has helped her by financing the construction of an onion storage and drying plant. Before this, producers were forced to sell their crops quickly before they rotted. Now, though, they can dry their onions, store them properly and sell them at the best mo- ment to make the highest profit. available 2 months after the start of sowing, as they are busy during the rainy season. \u2018Until the seasonal worker arrived, I worked the plot alone. I sowed the seeds and wa- tered them for the next 2 months. Proper care and water- ing are crucial at this stage, but I didn\u2019t have time to fully dedicate myself to it because I also had all my housework to do. I lost a lot of the crops because by the time I\u2019d arrive at the field, the sun would already be high up and the heat would dry the seeds out\u2019, recalls Sokhna. The first year she sowed a cheaper, low-yield variety of on- ion. She ended up with 30 bags of the product, which she sold to a merchant for EUR 229, earning double the money her husband was making. Sokhna was overjoyed. \u2018The mon- ey was a real godsend for my family\u2019. Word about Sokhna reached Souahibou Diaw, President of the union of coastal vegetable growers, who invited her to join the cooperative. \u2018I was excited. With the help of the co- operative I discovered a variety of onions called Mercedes, which has the highest yields. I also took out a bank loan of EUR 150, with the cooperative as my guarantor. An import- er from Spain also agreed to buy my crop of onions\u2019, she tells us, which is how Sokhna managed to sell 2 tonnes of Mercedes onions to the Spanish importer for EUR 450. \u2018We admire Sokhna\u2019s determination. She is the first wom- an in Mboro to have exported onions\u2019, the president of the cooperative proudly states. Sokhna\u2019s voice is emotional as she recalls her success: \u2018It was 2010, a year that will stay I would encourage women to take up farming, not just to make sure they\u2019ve got food but also to boost their incomes and provide more for their families.

Accounting for a third of all tea produced globally, the world\u2011renowned \u2018Ceylon Tea\u2019 was first grown by the British in Sri Lanka in the 1800s. It remains one of the country\u2019s primary export earners and sources of employment. Less well known is the history of Sri Lanka\u2019s tea planta- tions, dating back over 150 years, which many regard as al- most synonymous with colonial rule. Tamils of South Indian origin still make up a large proportion of Sri Lanka\u2019s tea plantation workers. Their ancestors were brought to work in the sector primarily through a brutal historic system known as \u2018bonded labour\u2019. The consequences of this system are still felt, as many members of the tea plantation commu- nity find themselves ethnically, linguistically and economi- cally marginalised.

That was about to change. \u2018Including the excluded\u2019, an initiative that works to improve the lives of the tea plantation workers, is implemented by CARE International and funded by the EU. Annalechchamy is amongst its beneficiaries. Supported by the initia- tive, she has found her inner strength and confidence. With training in lead- ership and opportunities to participate in decision-making, Annalechchamy is now \u2014 step by step \u2014 working to overcome the parochial beliefs that discourage women from taking on positions of importance. Empowered by the project, she has become one of the first female community-level trade union leaders. She is challenging the ways of life that had seemed set in stone. Most importantly, she has learnt to recognise that what she has to say is important and that she can influence change. Women in estates are extremely vulnerable and often face discrimination in families, communities and workplaces. Patriarchal practices confine women and men to specific roles, with women taking on less public and more subservi- ent roles in their families and society despite their consid- erable contributions. Confined to the plucking of tea leaves, women like Annalechchamy were not only required to work longer hours and more days in a year than the men, they were also required to work in the open, often in difficult weather conditions. Anecdotal evidence has also indicated that gender-based violence is particularly high in the es- tates. However, abuse is rarely reported and social norms often excuse such behaviour. Limited understanding of re- course further prevents women from seeking help. With Annalechchamy taking on the role of a trade-union leader, the rigidly defined social roles have been chal- lenged. She hopes that more issues pertaining to women will be discussed. Annalechchamy recounts: \u2018I started as a volunteer, but after I received training, I am no longer scared to talk with the estate management. I speak freely!\u2019 The estate managers have also embraced this change. Alex Samuel, then Group Manager of Carolina Estate, Watawala Plantations, said: \u2018By being able to talk face to face in the community development forums, both sides are beneficia- ries. The workers understand our requirements better and can thus appreciate the position of the management on cer- tain issues. Productivity has improved and labour issues are rare. From the workers\u2019 perspective, they have direct access to the management and can directly explain their needs and explore ways in which management can help them\u2019.

Coffee farmers in Malawi cooperate and reap the rewards of mechanisation Macdonald and Justina started growing the coffee beans in 2000. \u2018I recognised this as a great business opportunity that could really improve my fortunes\u2019, says Macdonald. \u2018Before, I was a \u201cJack of all trades\u201d, growing various crops with no focus and no under\u2011 standing of how to manage production\u2019. Moving to coffee was a game\u2011changer for Macdonald. It was not long before he was able to build a house for him\u2011 self and one in the town for his relatives. However, he candidly accepts that it was not all perfect to begin with. \u2018With more coffee, more problems began to arise\u2019, he states. \u2018To start with, we had a big issue with transportation, as our nearest processing factory was so far away\u2019. After 8 years of grappling with this challenge, he and his fellow farmers approached the cooperative for assistance. Doing this secured them a processing machine, with the only stipulation that there would be a minimum threshold of production to be reached. \u2018This processing machine was a godsend\u2019, says Macdonald. \u2018Almost none of us would have seen such success without it. It revolution- ised our ability to process large quantities of coffee\u2019.

The EU provided new, state-of-the-art machines for this, encouraging many more people in the area to get into planting. Together, the cooperative and the EU provided low-cost start-up inputs, including tools and fertilisers that allowed the farmers to engage in farming practices that were both environmentally friendly and also secured them high yields. All of the coffee that is harvested is sent to Mzuzu Coffee, which markets and exports it; only around 5 % of the yield is sold on the domestic market. Demand is continuing to increase year after year, ensuring that the cooperative can continue to expand. Last year, Macdonald reports producing somewhere in the region of half a million kwacha worth of coffee, an amount he was delighted with. Justina began by helping her husband, but with training and assistance she felt increasingly confident that she could manage her own farm. \u2018With the new factory nearby, there was no longer an excuse not to plant my own coffee\u2019, she says.

This is mainly due to the lack of economic activity on the island. Family farming is the main occupation of more than 90 % of village inhabitants. Fifteen years ago, farming in Adda was easier; fields produced good harvests and Adda was the water source for the entire subregion. However, farming is becoming increasingly restricted, particularly as a result of deforestation leading to drastic erosion, the disappearance of constantly flowing rivers and the loss of fertility in soils. The young people are gradually moving out of the region. For almost 3 years the Comorian NGO, Dahari (\u2018sustain- able\u2019 in English), with the financial support of the EU, has been helping Adda farmers to boost their income.

Ab- dou, the primary school teacher, has welcomed the expertise of Dahari into the school in Adda. The garden is help- ing children to become good farm- ers from an early age. It also helps to generate revenue for running the school. \u2018Teaching farming techniques to children is important for their fu- ture, especially as the plot is on school grounds, making practical work easier\u2019, commented Adbou. Since the school garden was set up and following several practical working sessions, the children have learnt how to grow tomatoes, lettuce, cabbage, onions and aubergines.

Empowering one girl at a time in Belize Dangriga looks like the cover of a travel magazine: a tropical paradise in southern Belize, a place to relax under the sun and enjoy the palm trees and turquoise waters. What onlookers may not know is that it is also the district with the highest rates of teenage pregnancies in the country, HIV prevalence higher than anywhere else in Central America and a place where violence and poverty are an ever\u2011pres\u2011 ent reality.

Young girls in Dangriga find themselves lost in a system where they are not expected to have ambitions to ever provide for themselves and where their own mother feels that they have no other choice than to encourage their daughters to accept these offers in order to save the fam- ily and put food on the table. The high HIV prevalence in Belize confirms this reality, as rates are highest among young girls and old men, many of whom unknowingly keep spreading the virus. Teenage pregnancies are the main rea- son for school dropouts and sexual abuse is one of those things everybody knows about but too few dare to report. Michele Irving, the coordinator for POWA, explains: \u2018We work on the self-esteem of girls, on keeping them in school, on teaching them about safety and on trying to keep them away from dangers.

This is the ritual on the sugar plantations in the province of Bukidnon on the southern island of Mindanao in the Philippines, where farm workers cut and burn the sugarcane and collect it the following day. The farm workers come from all around Mindanao to work in the fields and they group themselves into what is lo- cally known as a \u2018tolda\u2019 or a camp. These groups spend days deep in the fields until all the sugarcane in the area has been harvested. A total of 25 people working togeth- er, including child labourers, compose a tolda and together they burn and harvest the sugarcane before loading it onto waiting trucks. Until recently, 14-year-old Jeraldine Aboy, or \u2018Pitang\u2019 to her friends, worked in one of these camps. She is the second of four children. The eldest suffers from polio and cannot work. This placed a greater burden of helping the family on the shoulders of Pitang. Her family belongs to the Mano- bo Pulahingon, one of the indigenous groups in Mindanao. The Manobos in Bukidnon province have lost a significant part of their ancestral domain, as sugarcane and pineapple plantations aggressively encroach on their lands. After years of working in the sugarcane plantations, 14-year-old Pitang has returned to school and can start dreaming of a brighter future. Pitang, a child labourer from the Philippines, has returned to school as a result of an EU programme. Photo credit: EILER ",
        "108 Pitang first joined her father in a camp located far from their home in San Nicolas, Don Carlos, when she was just 6 years old. Her work included harvesting and cleaning the sugarcane fields and slashing through weeds in the direct heat of the sun. During the night, she burnt the sugarcane to prepare it for harvesting in the morning. She and her father would sleep in a makeshift cot and eat dried fish and rice provided by their employer and deducted from their pay. The sunrise signalled the beginning of another workday, but it would continue long after the setting of the sun. For this gruelling labour, she would earn a meagre 150 pesos (EUR 2.49) per day. As brave as she is, Pitang could en- dure the hardship of work only as long as her father was with her, providing comfort and a sense of safety amidst the razor-sharp leaves of the sugarcane. \u2018Working in the sugarcane fields is inherently dangerous. One day, my knife slipped from my hand and landed on my foot, cutting a deep wound. I was so scared from all of the blood that the only thing I was able to do was cry\u2019, explained Pitang. Things went from bad to worse when her father became ill and could no longer work with her. She was 10 years old then and since the family was in desperate need of money, she had to drop out of school in the middle of the year. She worked in the camps for as long as a month, missing milestones supposedly allotted for any child. However, the work and loneliness never hampered her from dreaming of receiving an education. Last year, Pitang heard of the \u2018Bata Balik-Eskwela, a community-based approach in combating child labour in hazardous industries in plan- tations and mining\u2019, an EU-supported project belonging to a Filipino NGO, the Ecumenical Institute for Labour Educa- tion and Research, Inc. (EILER). After learning of its objec- tive to support the reintegration of child labourers to formal schooling, she immediately approached their tribal elder, the Datu, and asked permission to join the programme. Due to her excitement, she enrolled unbeknownst to her parents. It was an uphill battle for Pitang, though. Having missed 3 years of school, she had problems with spelling and found mathematics very demanding, along with other subjects. Since she enrolled in the programme, however, she has never missed a session, always trying to improve herself. And it is paying off. According to her teacher\u2019s lat- est assessment, Pitang can now read in Filipino, shows im- provement in mathematics and can now read a little bit of English even. Her latest achievement was writing an essay, something unheard of before. Now, she dares to think of her next big dream: being on stage and singing in front of an applauding audience. Before she would only sing to ease some of the burden of work and cure loneliness in the fields. She can now dream bigger. Working in the sugarcane fields is inherently dangerous. Pitang ",

She works as a child protection aid worker at one of the organisations that have set up a child-friendly space in the camp, while Sally and Sami go to school and attend dif- ferent child-oriented activities. Life is monotonous except for occasions like Nawroz (the Kurdish New Year), when Um Alaa takes her children to the city for some entertainment. \u2018It\u2019s nice, but I miss Aleppo and my friends there\u2019, said Sally. As a widowed mother, Um Alaa says she will not voluntarily return to her hometown in Syria, where people have turned against one another and where their lives would be at risk. She is work- ing hard in the camp to try to make the best out of her situation, but struggles to accept the confinement of her family\u2019s aspirations and dreams. She says she will continue to fight for her children\u2019s education and for expanding the reach of her work beyond the fence of the tented camp that has been sheltering her for more than 2 years now. Four years ago, the first waves of Syrians crossed the bor- ders of the now war-stricken Syria into neighbouring coun- years. After that incident Abu Alaa remained at home without working for a week. When he received a phone call from the business owner asking him to come back to work at 7 a.m. one morning, Um Alaa pleaded her husband to stay at home but he wouldn\u2019t listen \u2014 he was focused on making sure that he would be able to keep bread on the family\u2019s table. Abu Alaa died in a street explosion on his way back home that day, leaving Um Alaa a widowed mother of four. \u2018He was a loving man, very kind-hearted\u2019, Um Alaa said. \u2018Even if he didn\u2019t have money, he always tried to help people\u2019. Since then, not only has Um Alaa managed to cross to safety with her children without the support of her extended family, but she has also constantly tried to seek opportunities to give her four children the future they had aspired to before the war. She lives with her second-eldest son Mohammad (22) and her twins Sally and Sami (14) in the camp. Her eldest, Alaa, who is now 24, lives in Erbil (160 km away) working as a street vendor to earn money to cover the cost of his dialysis \u2014 a medical service not available in the camp. Between the jokes, exchanges of hugs and kisses, recurring cups of tea and Arabic coffee and delicious bites of home- made labaneh (strained yoghurt), the dominating topic of dis- cussion among the family is the future of Um Alaa\u2019s children.

When it was over, we came back and our house was gone, completely washed away. The same thing with the crops: the bananas, cassava and sweet po\u2011 tatoes. We rely on these for food and they were all gone\u2019 , recounts Leonila Garen, 30, a resident of Ma\u2011 bini village in Basey, Samar province, the Philippines. Coping in the face of disaster Leonila, a mother of five, recalls how difficult it was during the first few days after the typhoon, when their world was falling apart. Had it not been for the basic humanitarian goods that reached them, they would not have had anything to eat. Her family spent a few more weeks at a relative\u2019s house until her husband was able to gather enough scrap material for a makeshift shelter, using a tarpaulin as a roof. With the crops gone, her husband \u2014 who used to earn a liv- ing farming and delivering copra, a coconut product, once a week \u2014 found himself jobless and without an income. The village councillor, Efren Pacanas, summed up the hard- ship facing his community: \u2018 The people in our village have Resilience shines through after typhoon Haiyan struck a community in the Philippines already affected by conflict.

A resilient community Councillor Pacanas explained that be- fore the typhoon, the remote village of Mabini had been facing problems of a different nature \u2014 armed con- flict . \u2018 Upland farming is only done on a seasonal basis; it\u2019s purely rain-fed, which is one of the reasons why it is taking longer for our community to recover completely. Also, transport- ing crops downtown has always been a challenge for us owing to the poor road network. This is further complicated by the armed clashes that erupt occasionally in some districts\u2019. The most recent incident, he said, was in February this year. Growing up in Northern Samar province , Leonila is no stranger to armed conflict. \u2018 Others, especially children, still get scared when they hear gun shots, but I\u2019m already used to it\u2019. In 2011, as part of the work of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to support communities affected by armed conflict, a water network was constructed to supply clean water to more than 1 200 people in Mabini. Before this, villagers had to spend over 2 hours each day on pad- dle boats to collect drinking water from the Sohoton River. Today, this access to water has helped the community re- cover more rapidly from the effects of the typhoon. \u2018 With water readily accessible, we have more time to spend culti- vating the land\u2019, said Rogelio Asis, a local farmer. Building a more robust future A year and a half after typhoon Haiyan, Leonila and her family are living in their new home \u2014 this time sturdier than the temporary structure her husband had built. \u2018 It would have taken us at least 5 years to build a house like this because our income is just enough to cover our most basic needs. With four of the children in school, we could only dream of having a house\u2019, she said, adding that having been chosen as a beneficiary of the Philippine Red Cross/ ICRC shelter programme is an answered prayer. She is also very happy with the latrine that was built this year, as in the past they had none of their own and had to use their relative\u2019s toilet nearby. Leonila\u2019s family is among the 4 461 households that re- ceived storm-resilient shelters from the Philippine Red Cross and the ICRC in 2014. The ICRC, together with the National Society, focused its response on Samar Island, where it has been working for years to address the needs of communities affected by armed conflict.

        "118 5 million people are in need of humanitarian aid in Ukraine. Delivering help to the most vulnerable is a daily challenge for humanitarians. Barely holding on in Ukraine It is early July and I am travelling in eastern Ukraine with a group of journalists to see first\u2011hand how the European Union is providing help to people affected by the ongoing conflict. Nature is in bloom and a cease\u2011 fire is \u2018officially\u2019 in force in this region of Ukraine that is ravaged by a conflict which in over a year has left 5 million in need of humanitarian help. Driving east, we pass freshly-dug trenches and a burned-out tank in the middle of the street. On our way to the frontline our passports are inspected once, twice and three times at different checkpoints by soldiers in full uniform with guns ca- sually slung over their shoulders. With us travels Daniel J. Gerstle, the head of emergency pro- grammes for the Czech NGO \u2018People in Need\u2019 (PIN) in Ukraine. He is used to this procedure. PIN\u2019s emergency response teams cross the frontline sometimes two or three times a week to distribute food and hygiene kits. They also provide building materials, help with home repairs and provide psychosocial assistance, food vouchers and cash grants for vulnerable, conflict-affected families. To cover the needs of over 100 000 people on both sides of the frontline, the teams have to be highly mobile and maintain strict neutrality as they cross back and forth be- tween government-controlled and non-government-con- trolled areas.

Some stores still have stock from last year, but others have used up all reserves\u2019, explains Daniel. The people living on both sides of the frontline, but espe- cially those in the non-government-controlled area, are seeing their local economy crumble; many are losing their jobs and income, while food stocks plummet and prices rise. \u2018People on both sides are suffering horrible losses and ex- periencing trauma; at least in the gov- ernment-controlled areas there are still functioning stores and rare opportuni- ties to find some work, which cannot be found on the other side\u2019. Access to people in need is not always possible. Every day PIN\u2019s teams assess the situation. First they see whether the teams and trucks can even cross the frontline. This is primarily the deci- sion of the Ukrainian government who searches all vehicles to make sure that only food and household supplies reach the other side. Second, they assess how heavy the fighting is in the areas where there are people in need. Around the Donetsk airport and the southern town of Shyrokine, fighting has been the worst. There has been a continuous non-stop battle over the past few months, while in other areas like Mariinka, Avdiivka and Popasna there is intermittent shelling. Despite the presence of the three big cities of Donetsk, Lu- hansk and Mariupol, most of eastern Ukraine is very poor, with small farms and run-down heavy industry. When the conflict broke out in spring 2014, only a few joined the fighting. Most of the people here were more concerned about day-to-day survival. \u2018 In some of the really remote vil- lages damaged by heavy fighting during the winter we found some people, especially the elderly, who were afraid to leave or unable to leave because of a disability. A few died in the cold when others were evacuated. With blown-up tanks in the snow back then, one old man said he thought he\u2019d woken up back in the Second World War\u2019, recounted Daniel while we drove through the country. \u2018 Hundreds of thousands of people who had nothing to do with the political situation have lost everything \u2014 their homes, family members and livelihoods. They don\u2019t want this war. They are barely holding on. They need urgent help\u2019. We stop in Luganskoye, a small village right on the front- line, where shelling can be heard almost every night. Dan- iel climbs out of the car to talk to the villagers. They know him well and greetings are exchanged. Some things can be bought in the small grocery shop \u2014 soft drinks and canned goods, for example \u2014 but other daily items are scarce. Three onions and a few wrinkly cucumbers are the only vegetables found on the shelves. \u2018The biggest difference you see when crossing from the government-controlled side to the other is that many, if not I believe we have a great deal of work to do to improve this world and we each need to do our part.

As simple as it sounds, the task before him today is of par- amount importance. He will be travelling from his village to Akbounou, the capital of his commune, where a mobile court hearing will take place to register some sections of the population whose births were never recorded.

Having these documents is so important for the people of our commune\u2019, he says. Inizdane got up early this morning. He lives in a remote little village in the Tahoua region of northern Niger.

Yet without this document they are unable to register for examinations to get into high school, meaning that primary school effectively marks the end of the road for their education. So when the authorities told him that a mobile court was coming to the area, Inizdane informed the parents and ex- plained how important it was to register their children. Although not all of them are able to make the trip today because they can\u2019t afford the transport or have work com- mitments elsewhere, the headmaster has reassured them that he won\u2019t let them down. He hops onto his moped and rides back and forth along the 14 kilometres of track between his village and Akbounou, with children riding pillion on each trip. \u2018I\u2019ve already done three round-trips on my moped with two kids riding on the back each time, so that\u2019s six children who have had their births registered.

This global action is paving the road to change for millions of domestic work- ers in Argentina and across the world. \u2018I work now as a live-out domestic worker from Monday to Friday. I have a contract and I know my rights. After many years of working in Argentina, I will be able to retire and have my pension paid in Paraguay\u2019, explains a satisfied Ma- ria. She has also joined the Domestic Workers Union (UPA- CP) and enrolled in the vocational training course \u2018Servicios en casas particulares\u2019 (service in private homes), which UPACP provides to its affiliates, free of charge. \u2018I received a diploma. I framed it and hung it on my wall. I feel so proud of myself\u2019. Following the adoption of the first migration law in 2004, the government of Argentina passed yet another progres- sive law in March 2013 to regulate employment relation- ships for private home workers. This is a significant ad- vance in the application of the principles promoted by the ILO\u2019s convention on decent work for domestic workers in terms of complete equality between the rights of domestic workers and other workers. The law updates and expands domestic workers\u2019 labour rights by recognising maternity leave, paid holidays, a minimum wage, a yearly bonus and compensation in case of layoffs or firing. It restricts work- ing hours to 8 hours per day and 48 hours per week. \u2018Since the passing of the laws, I have made sure to tell all my friends from Paraguay who also work as domestic workers to request a work contract from their employers and claim the new benefits. Most of them are now part of the formal economy\u2019, explained Maria. \u2018We have to keep demanding respect and make sure all domestic workers have a contract, as it is about our future and the future of our children\u2019. Many people thought it was our destiny to be exploited, but I never lost faith things could improve for us workers. Maria Perez ",

We at the NEXUS service centre are working to change this perception by offering relevant services to those who have decided to go abroad for a job, helping them prepare for tak- ing this important step in their lives, or to those who have returned and want to efficiently reintegrate back into their home community. Vera is a very good example of the latter and we are proud of what she has accomplished\u2019, explained Carolina Cartofeanu, Direc- tor of NEXUS Cahul. Only a couple of months have passed since launching their floral business and Vera and her hus- band are already planning to expand their business into flo- ral decorations and flower delivery. They are not sure what resources and skills they will need to succeed at this, but at least they are sure where they will go for advice. pany, how to open a bank account or where to go for tax and social registrations. I am sure that my dream would not have come true so quickly without the thorough and kind help of the Cahul NEXUS service centre\u2019, said Vera. She heard about the NEXUS service centre in Cahul from a short news video on a local web portal popular among Moldovan migrants. Vera was impressed and decided to visit the centre. \u2018There, at NEXUS, I received not only the information and guidance I needed, but they actually ac- companied me to the registration chamber and other public institutions dealing with business registration.

By the time she got to the hospital, the infection had set in and her leg had to be amputated. With no access to contraception, Judith carried nine more pregnancies on one leg using crutches. Sadly, her tenth child died when he was just 1 month old. After hearing that Marie Stopes Zambia (MSZ) was going to visit her village to run a family planning clinic, Judith decided she\u2019d like to hear more about how she could avoid becoming pregnant again. Together with her husband, Ju- dith met the MSZ outreach team to find out more about the different methods of family planning. Convinced her body couldn\u2019t handle yet another pregnancy, Judith decided to undergo female surgical contraception, which was carried out by one of MSZ\u2019s mobile clinical outreach teams. Afterwards, Judith said: \u2018Since I had the procedure, I don\u2019t worry about falling pregnant again and my sex life has im- proved\u2019. Judith is one of the 26 000 women in Muchinga Province who will be using modern contraceptive methods by 2016 as a result of MSZ\u2019s innovative family planning project, fi- nanced by the European Union in Zambia.

        "134 Zambia has one of the youngest, most rural populations in the world, with 46 % of its population under the age of 15 (2010 census). Rates of use of modern methods of contraception have improved greatly over the past 2 decades. However, lack of access to family planning services is a major con- tributor to the 16 % of births which are reported as unwanted and the estimat- ed 30 % of maternal deaths caused by unsafe abortions. Close to one in every two girls in Zambia has given birth be- fore the age of 19, and this age group also accounts for an estimated 80 % of unsafe abortions carried out. So the need for accessible contraceptive ser- vices in Zambia \u2014 particularly for un- married adolescent girls \u2014 is profound. MSZ\u2019s EU-funded \u2018Maternal and sex- ual-reproductive health rights\u2019 proj- ect is carried out in five districts in Muchinga Province and works closely with government district medical offi- cers to plan and deliver outreach ser- vices across 45 rural health facilities. These five districts are among the most under-served in Zambia both in terms of contraceptive services and health- care. One of the biggest challenges to delivering these ser- vices in Zambia is dealing with the huge distances between communities and facilities. Mpika District alone is the size of Denmark. To address this challenge, MSZ uses the \u2018camping model\u2019. From its bases in Muchinga Province, a customised MSZ Land Rover \u2014 stuffed with equipment and manned with specialised medical staff \u2014 travels up to 200 km into some of the most rural parts of the province. At these mobile clinics, the team provides group and individual counselling, HIV testing, contraception and advice on follow-up. Overall, demand greatly exceeds what the project and gov- ernment health facilities can supply. There is an appoint- ment system in place, yet on some occasions more women turn up for services than can be seen that day, with many of them having walked up to 25 km. When that happens, the team adjusts its schedule and stays for an extra night so that the remaining clients can be seen the following day. MSZ Country Director Adrienne Quintana said: \u2018The high up- take of our services is a reflection of the significant need for family planning in this area. With support from traditional leaders, many husbands and wives now understand how family planning contributes to the development of their communities, positively impacting on health, education and livelihoods\u2019. Speaking about the impact on her and on her family, Judith says that \u2018the procedure has given me and my husband a chance to focus on taking care of our nine children and giving them a better life\u2019.

All have escaped a bleak fate. However, the uncertainty of a new life in a land distant from home is a small price to pay for many seeking refugee status in Uganda. Continuous fear of imminent attacks from armed groups has characterised several countries in East Africa for years. It has forced millions to leave behind their lives, families, homes and belongings in search of some stability and se- curity. However, the journey to acquiring refugee status re- quires a great amount of patience and waiting.

Sharing the fruits of our labour in Cape Verde In preceding centuries, Cape Verde\u2019s horticulture sec\u2011 tor was a substantial source of nutritional and eco\u2011 nomic sustenance in this resource\u2011poor archipelago. Banana production in particular allowed local farm\u2011 ers to secure income and provide for local commu\u2011 nities. Unfortunately, according to Nora Silva, Head of the National Institute for Agricultural Research and Development, most plantations succumbed to drought, pollution and disease in the 1990s. At the dawn of the new millennium, the outlook for the sec- tor\u2019s recovery appeared bleak \u2014 threatening livelihoods, socioeconomic development and food security. \u2018These fields were once replete with banana trees\u2019, Silva maintained while on a field visit in Santa Cruz, \u2018now there is nothing\u2019. Seeking to reverse this trajectory, the European Union fi- nanced the development of water irrigation systems on Santiago Island to promote the sector\u2019s recovery. This en- tailed constructing large water reservoirs and installing silos close to new plantations where a network of hoses could then disperse water at regular intervals.

The newly resurgent agribusiness is having a large impact on local economic development and food security. While Jo\u00e3o\u2019s produce is primarily destined for local markets, he has also begun exporting to other is- lands, particularly those with signifi- cant tourism. \u2018Production capacity and quality are very high\u2019, he explained, \u2018if we continue at this rate, soon we can begin exporting beyond Cape Verde\u2019. This increased supply of local pro- duce also benefits communities, as it lowers prices and provides essential nutrients. Bananas are particularly advantageous since they contain high amounts of fibre and potassium. Fibre, for example, helps regulate the diges- tive system, which mitigates dehydra- tion arising from diarrhoea, a leading cause of infant and child mortality. By reducing extreme poverty, malnutrition and child mortality, the programme is reinforcing Cape Verde\u2019s success in local- ly contributing to the global millennium development goals.

As Jo\u00e3o explained, \u2018the primary crops grown in Cape Verde today are beans and corn\u2019, which are used for Cape Verdean staples like katchupa and feijoada. \u2018 However\u2019, he continued, \u2018these are difficult to grow due to a lack of rainwater and they can only be harvested once per year. The advantage of bananas is that they can be harvested year-round, with yields ripening every 4 months\u2019. With the recovery of banana production, Jo\u00e3o began di- versifying his crops by adding mango, pineapple and sug- arcane.

Crab catches have substantially increased in recent years, but the incredible potential offered by the resource could be undermined if it is not managed well. Julienne Razafindrafara, who has been crab fishing for the past 5 years, is acutely aware of what is at stake. Madagascar has 325 000 hectares of this type of eco- system, which accounts for a potential fishing yield of 7 500 tonnes of crab (still largely under-exploited). Crabs are one of the most sought-after products on the in- ternational market and have the potential to generate sub- stantial and sustainable revenues for Madagascar\u2019s coastal communities. Asian markets have a preference for larger species of live crab, which fetch around twice as much per kilo as frozen crab (which is mainly exported to Europe). The EU\u2019s SmartFish programme is promoting sustainable fishing in Madagascar. Julienne, crab fisher, lives among the mangroves of Mahajanga. ",

This is where Julienne\u2019s story fits in. Since 2012, she has been paying very close attention to innovative but inexpen- sive methods of improving storage and transport conditions, which help to dramatically reduce the mortality rate of the crabs. Julienne lives in one of the pilot vil- lages of four regions chosen by the regional SmartFish programme run by the Indian Ocean Commission and financed by the European Development Fund. The pro- gramme provides support at every stage in the production chain. The aim is to keep the mangrove crab alive and in- tact from capture to market. \u2018Just a year ago we lost almost half of our crab catch\u2019, says Julienne. Today Julienne works with some 60 fishermen. She has given them new traps in order to catch the bigger crabs without damaging them. She has also provided them with tanks to preserve their catch and has built two boats with shelving for transporting the crabs to Mahajanga. Julienne explains that the cost of these investments was recouped after the very first month. Speaking of the new methods introduced through the pro- gramme, she says: \u2018The new equipment has dramatically reduced our losses. I was a crab fisher myself and I can confirm how much difference this has made to our lives\u2019. It is nightfall in the village.

As the project focuses on aquaculture, all the members were supposed to have a pond, so I started cleaning up the old pond that was never used. My children helped me.

When he was a very young boy, seeing his parents farming and helping them harvest tomatoes, he could not have imagined that he would one day be leading the national network for collaboration and dialogue among producer organisations, known as the CDD\u2011G9. He has just concluded another meeting focused on preparing a common position on the draft framework law on agricultural policy, which will shape the future of farming and food security in Niger. Born and raised in Niger\u2019s capital city of Niamey, Belko spent his youth helping his parents on the farm. He soon began cultivating traditional Nigerien crops (millet, cowpea, sesame and rice) and fresh vegetables as well as raising livestock and poultry. Today, he continues to farm lands in the metropolitan area of Niamey, as well as in the region between the towns of Gu\u00e9lado and Say. In Niger, where 80 % of the population is rural, family farming is the rule. Belko stands out, nevertheless, for his strong activism within producer organisations, his dedi- cation to family farming and his readiness to engage as Small farmers are the key to the food supply for rural populations, they need to have a say in policies that regulate them.

Thanks to his having joined Nogar\u00e9\u2019s market vegetables cooperative in 1985/1986, Ousmane developed his skills and increased the productivity of his farm. This first experience in a co- operative taught him about the po- tential benefits of collective action for small-scale producers and the coun- try\u2019s agricultural development, pover- ty reduction and food security policies. Strong in his convictions, Belko carved out his path in the cooperative move- ment in Niger, and in 2008 became president of the council for farmers\u2019 action and solidarity in Niger (Caspani). This position allowed him to actively work on the issue closest to his heart: enabling producer organisations to serve as the collective voice of farmers and other actors in the formulation and implementation of agricultural policies and laws. In fact, the producer landscape in Niger is rather fragmented and characterised by a lack of unity and coordination. Addition- ally, women, who make up a significant proportion of mem- bers, remain largely under-represented in decision-making and leadership positions. Over recent years, Niger and other countries have increas- ingly recognised that developing sustainable agricultur- al policies cannot happen without small-scale and family farmers communicating their concerns and providing input on the policies, laws and programmes that will affect them. Joining forces with FAO and the EU In March 2013, Ousmane\u2019s path crossed with the Europe- an Union and the UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization, when the two partners brought producer organisations to- gether to support their dialogue with government. They identified the most appropriate ways to strengthen the participation of producer organisations, specifically in the implementation of the national strategy on food se- curity and rural agriculture. Belko and his fellow leaders were able to present the views of the CDD-G9 network. The common platform for dialogue and collaboration for small-scale and family farmers in Niger had come to frui- tion and was now to be part of a rich partnership with the EU, FAO and other partners. After this first founding step and more than a year of sup- port from the EU and the FAO, Belko\u2019s network strength- ened. It has been engaging other organisations, formulating proposals and influencing the formulation and implementa- tion of national policy and legal instruments that will affect thousands of small producers \u2014 and, in turn, food securi- ty \u2014 throughout the country. As a result of EU\u2013FAO support, not only does the network provide a way for farmers to get their voices heard at the national level, it also ensures information and capacity de- Things are evolving very rapidly and in a very positive way.

Protecting forests for a sustainable future in Vietnam Pham Hong Luong\u2019s father was a forester, and grow\u2011 ing up in northeast Vietnam, Pham Hong wanted to be just like his dad.

Now, 20 years later, Pham has the chance to do just that. He works for the Government of Vietnam overseeing an innovative national programme called \u2018Payments for forest ecosystem services\u2019, or PFES. Forests play a crucial role in preventing soil erosion, main- taining the water cycle and fighting climate change. They also provide timber, food and fuel for poor rural commu- nities. Since 2010, the PFES programme has recognised forests\u2019 importance by requiring those who rely on forest environ- mental services \u2014 water supply companies, hydropower plants and tourism operators \u2014 to make payments to the communities and individuals that own and look after the forest.

Vietnam\u2019s experience also offers important lessons for oth- er global programmes that are seeking fair ways to share benefits among rural people \u2014 such as REDD+ (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation), which aims to tackle climate change by reducing carbon emissions from deforestation. \u2018These studies are very useful and helpful for us to ensure the most effective system for conservation\u2019, says Pham. For example, to make incentives more effective, CIFOR is exploring ways to structure PFES payments based on local preferences and combine them with other sources of revenue, like REDD+ funding or forest certification. That could make the payments sub- stantial enough to ensure people do not lose out if they stop clearing trees to plant crops. \u2018If the benefit-sharing mechanism is adjusted, villagers will get more money to ensure their livelihoods, which helps them to protect our forests\u2019, Pham says. \u2018That is a sustainable way to ensure we keep our forests in the future\u2019. Each year, the programme collects around USD 60 million, 75 % of which is distributed to forest owners. In exchange, they must not cut down any trees. Vietnam is the first country in Asia to trial a nationwide pro- gramme like this \u2014 and Pham says that there is a lot to figure out and many questions to be answered. How much do you charge \u2014 and if you have a fixed rate of payment, what happens when there\u2019s inflation? Which areas count as forest? Who counts as a forest owner? What about people who have customary rights to land but no legal title? Are the payments enough to ensure people do not clear the forests? An EU-funded project of the Centre for International Forest- ry Research (CIFOR) is helping Pham and the Government of Vietnam answer some of these questions \u2014 particularly those related to how the benefits of schemes like PFES are distributed and how they are perceived by the local people who receive them. \u2018Our research aims to bring local perspectives to the fore- front of policy design\u2019, says CIFOR\u2019s Grace Wong. \u2018If people don\u2019t see these schemes as fair, they may not be willing to engage in the forest management activities and conserva- tion\u2019.

Javier has overseen some small but radical improve- ments to the environment along the river to the south of Buenos Aires city. The 60 km river and its basin are widely considered to be among the most polluted areas in Argentina. Moving up the river, one gets the impression of watching a procession of worn-out factories. Some of them have been shut down, but many others are still operating in what is a heavily in- dustrialised zone and major source of chemical waste. The factories alternate with tiny rickety houses, most of which have nothing more than a thin metal plate for a roof.

Because of groundwater, air and soil contamination and the precarious living conditions, local dwellers face significant health risks.

Water will take more time\u2019, Javier explains, as he details the long history of envi- ronmental and social problems in the river basin. Local residents have played an import- ant role in ushering in these changes. \u2018People pushed positively\u2019, continues Javier, referring to grassroots move- ments of local residents who gradu- ally began voicing their demands for better environmental and living conditions.

She wakes up early every morning, before sunrise, to go to the local market to buy meat, fruit, vegetables and other commodities and to prepare for the day that lies ahead. At home, Sommay\u2019s younger sister and her mother, who is in her seventies, help set up her stove, using traditional fuels such as firewood and charcoal. Sommay attracts customers, mainly office workers in the city centre, by offering tasty warm meals cooked on the spot. For this, the stove must be kept burning the whole day. This constant use meant that Sommay had to buy a new stove every 5 months and at least four sacks of charcoal (25 kg each) every week. Her business routine followed the same path for nearly 3 years until the constant increase in the price of charcoal, coupled with her dependence on low-quality and perishable traditional stoves put the survival of her business at risk.

With no other options, Sommay approached her longstand- ing provider of cooking stoves to see if something more durable and efficient was available. It was then that she was introduced to the \u2018improved cook- ing stoves programme\u2019. Her choices were limited: either try something new to save her business or go bust. Going out of business was not really an op- tion as she had to earn enough mon- ey to be able to send her two kids to school and look after her family. She decided to go for it. The stove bought by Sommay is part of the improved cooking stoves pro- gramme, a renewable energy project supported by the European Union and implemented by SNV Netherlands Development Organisation, Oxfam Novib and the Lao NGO Normai. The initiative works to improve the quality, efficiency and safety of stoves in Laos. Currently, many of the traditional stoves being used are inefficient and last only a few months before they break into pieces. Sommay and her family have not looked back. The new improved stove is still functioning well after 2 years of con- stant use. The stove cost only 15 000 kip (EUR 1.50) above the average price of the traditional one, which had to be re- placed regularly.

This high de- pendence degrades the local environment, demands con- siderable time in fuel collection, is costly and creates indoor air pollution. According to the WHO, this air pollution causes the premature death of 2 600 people each year. The burn- ing of coal and wood also adds considerably to greenhouse gas emissions. This EU-financed initiative has recently registered the 10 000 th stove sold. The programme aims to replace 25 % of the national stove market by the end of the fourth year. Meanwhile, Sommay, who recently bought her fourth im- proved stove (three for her restaurant\u2019s kitchen and one for her family\u2019s cooking purposes), has become an active promoter of the stove by sharing her first-hand experience and convincing many of her relatives, neighbours and cli- ents to replace their kitchen stoves.

Village courts providing justice in Bangladesh Mostafa Khatun is 50, a housewife with five sons, four daughters and two grandchildren. She was mar\u2011 ried to a distant cousin at the age of 14 and did not receive any education. She is a devout Muslim like many women in Cox\u2019s Bazaar district. A dispute was sparked one day when her neighbour, Ab- dullah, her husband\u2019s cousin, cut down a bamboo tree near their house. As Abdullah and his three sons dragged the tree away, a number of mahogany saplings that Mostafa had been growing were destroyed. Mostafa\u2019s husband had purchased the saplings 2 years prior for 15 taka each with the intention of selling them once they had grown. These trees were an investment and were hoped to provide much needed supplementary in- come to the household, as each tree could fetch EUR 200 (BDT 20 000) within 20 years. Mostafa ran outside to see what was happening. Her hus- band and children were not at home but there was a heat- ed exchange with her neighbours, during which Abdullah and his sons destroyed 10 more saplings. They attacked Mostafa, pulling her hair, tearing her clothes and pushing her down into the mud, bruising her back and arms.

Mostafa and her husband used these funds to contribute to their children\u2019s education. They believe that the village court\u2019s decision was a fair one and prefer it to the district court because it is closer, faster and less expensive. For Mostafa\u2019s husband, the apology the family received from the neigh- bours at the village court was as im- portant as the financial compensation. Mostafa said: \u2018My cousin said that what he did in the quarrel was wrong and I am honoured that he apologised\u2019. Abdullah, the defendant\u2019s story Abdullah had got angry when Mostafa had shouted at them and that\u2019s when they destroyed her trees and pushed her into the mud. Abdullah was scared when he heard that Mostafa\u2019s husband had lodged a complaint with the police, as he knew that he could face being arrested. He and his sons hid over the course of 1 month. The case was also weighing heavily on him in financial terms, as it cost him EUR 650 (BDT 65 000) in lawyers\u2019 fees and transport costs associated with visits to the police station and the district court. Abdullah had to take loans from relatives to cover the legal costs: \u2018We are poor and work in the brick-field to meet family needs. We didn\u2019t have enough money and so I had to borrow from others\u2019. On hearing her cries, several other neighbours came to her rescue and took her back to her house. \u2018It all happened so quickly, I didn\u2019t have time to think, but afterwards I was in a lot of pain and was afraid\u2019, Mostafa recalled. On returning to the village, her husband took her to the dispensary where she received medication for her injuries at a cost of EUR 22 (BDT 2 200). He then went to the village elders to lodge a complaint about Abdullah\u2019s actions. When the defendant refused to respond to the request of the el- ders, Mostafa\u2019s husband reported the matter to the police station, 8 km away. The police referred the case to the district court, 25 km away. Two years and 15 visits later, there was still no con- clusion to the case. Finally, the district court Magistrate rec- ommended that the case be referred to the village court. Mostafa recalls, \u2018My husband used to go to the police sta- tion and district court to follow-up on the case. He became upset and spent a significant amount of money without any results. We were always worried that they would harm us\u2019. The village court registered the case and \u2014 following usual procedure \u2014 a panel was formed comprising of represen- tatives from both parties. The jury heard the details with evidence and declared that the defendant was guilty of destroying the saplings and of injuring Mostafa. A EUR 50 (BDT 4 920) fine was imposed as compensation for the de- stroyed saplings and for the medical expenses from Mo- stafa\u2019s injuries.

With a troubled childhood and adolescence filled with fi- nancial difficulties, as well as a disruptive family life, Jellet- ly began stealing small things at school: a pencil, an eraser; things he did not have. After a while, he no longer want- ed to go to school and began stealing from supermarkets and from people\u2019s backyards, eventually going further with crime, using firearms and getting involved in drug traffick- ing and drug abuse. He was caught six times, but as he was a minor, he did not remain in custody for long. When Jelletly entered the prison system, he met other people involved in more serious crime and emerged from prison immersed in this criminal world. After being sentenced for more serious crimes, Jelletly was transferred to APAC ( Associa\u00e7\u00e3o de prote\u00e7\u00e3o e assist\u00eancia aos condenados \u2014 Association for the protection and as- sistance of the convicted) located in the city of Perd\u00f5es, where his mother used to live.

Without the presence of the police or weapons, prisoners learn to act with APAC staff on a more equal footing and to recover the meaning of some essential values such as society, family, dignity and work. APAC is a pioneering methodology in Brazil and it is now- adays a reference worldwide as an alternative to the traditional peni- tentiary model. According to Jelletly, APAC helped him in the most difficult time of his life, and it was there that he entered as a criminal and left as a recovering human being. Jelletly reports that he did not know much before being arrested, nor did he have any interest in learning, because he felt that crime gave him what he needed. His only work experience had been to plant and harvest tangerines, but he had chosen crime instead, as it had offered a better financial return. Jelletly enrolled in a professional course on civil construc- tion, which was offered inside the APAC prison unit. He was one of 300 convicts who graduated in the training courses offered by the project. Upon his release from prison, Jelletly, with his new skills, was able to find work in civil construction in his city and says, \u2018I changed my life completely. The hands that once destroyed now build houses; those hands that once stole, trafficked and killed the dreams of other people are the same that received the trust of APAC to carry its own cell keys. I learned a lot, from laying bricks to making dough, painting, etc.\u2019 \u2018I learned much more than that too. I now understand that building is an art and know how to create instead of de- stroy. That work also carries something more valuable than money: the ability to help other people accomplish their dreams, for example by building someone\u2019s first home\u2019. Jelletly finished serving his sentence but keeps going to APAC. Only now he goes to the prison unit as a volunteer, preparing other convicts to face the labour market and so- ciety\u2019s prejudice beyond the prison\u2019s walls. I changed my life completely.

Seniors know their rights and fulfil their dreams in Thailand Fulfilling the dreams of older people requires specific support from society and institutions, especially the economic and health sectors. Fulfilling those dreams also requires knowledge about older people\u2019s rights. An EU supported project, that is building capaci\u2011 ties for promoting older people\u2019s rights and income security, implemented by the Foundation for Older Persons\u2019 Development and HelpAge International, is helping to fulfil these dreams in Thailand. If people are not aware of their rights, they cannot demand these rights through legally established processes and in- stitutions. In cooperation with the Older People\u2019s Group (OPG) in Ban- thi District, Lamphun Province, the project organised a team of volunteers called `older people\u2019s rights promotion volunteer team of Banthi\u2019. The team is working to increase knowledge about older people\u2019s rights and to encourage, monitor and protect those rights. The volunteer team also works with government agencies in the 10 pilot areas to raise their awareness about the rights of older people and their duties to protect and promote these rights.

Workshop-style meetings were held in various villages to educate older people about 13 critical rights and entitlements for older people in accor- dance with Thailand\u2019s Older Persons Act 2003. The work- shops also helped to strengthen Older People\u2019s Groups, placing them as invaluable sources of knowledge on the issues that affect their lives and their communities. In the past, older people lacked useful knowledge and infor- mation that could assist their daily lives, especially knowl- edge of their rights. This meant a lack of knowledge around access to health services and access to the Elderly Fund provided by the government, among other important issues. The Older Persons Act was a start but there is still a gap between the act and its implementation. Since the volunteer team was estab- lished a few years ago, Mae Janfong Maha-mai and her Banthi OPG team have been distributing information at monthly meetings, covering topics re- lated to the rights and services avail- able for elderly people. They also raise the awareness of the public at large. Realising and being able to access their rights brings an important change for older people, such as access to com- prehensive healthcare. For example, they can request shorter waiting times to visit a doctor. \u2018I would like to make organisations aware of older peo- ple\u2019s rights so that the elderly can access their benefits and make us visible in society\u2019, said Mae Janfong Maha-mai.

Up until recently, he could not participate in public tenders be\u2011 cause he did not have key information that would al\u2011 low him to compete with other companies. \u2018I needed to know the technical specifications, price references and the criteria used\u2019, Marco Tulio says. \u2018When I requested this information, it was repeatedly denied.

Like other Latin American countries, El Salvador faces the challenge of fighting corruption and improving the quali- ty of its institutions. Despite certain advances, the country continues to get a failing grade in Transparency Interna- tional\u2019s corruption index. A new law, the Transparency and Access to Information Act, has opened up a channel for improving transparency.

The road continues to be arduous but, little by little, Salva- dorans are managing to defeat the culture of opacity and make public institutions work for all citizens. Citizens have started to file complaints when information is denied to them. Marco Tulio is one such case. \u2018Thanks to the IAIP, the ISSS had to give me the information free of charge\u2019.

His hands are marked by the years of hard work that have prematurely aged him. When Ismoil graduated from school in 1992, he got his driver\u2019s licence, hoping to find work as a driver. However, that same year, the civil war started and he was forced to take up arms and fight. In 1998, when the war was over, Tajikistan was devastated and Ismoil was imprisoned for having participated in the war. During his time in prison, conditions were dismal; prisoners were tortured and those who managed to survive did so only because of the food they received from their families. Ismoil had to work in prison and spent his days blowing glass, which eventually gave him lung problems. During his 9 years in prison, Ismoil worked for 7 years and earned a total of 37 Somoni (approximately EUR 6). While in prison, Ismoil was visited by a group of Iranian hu- man rights observers looking to interview former soldiers from the civil war. During each interview, prison guards After 9 years in prison, Ismoil is being helped by an EU-funded initiative to deal with the legal and psychological consequences of incarceration.

        "180 were present, so no one dared speak about the conditions they were enduring in prison. However, thanks to adminis- trative changes in 2004 in Tajikistan, the prisoners\u2019 living conditions improved. Ismoil was released after 9 years in prison. While leaving prison meant freedom, it also meant being unemployed. Is- moil had to deal with his lack of profes- sional experience, education or social network to rely on. On top of that, as an ex-convict, Ismoil was an easy target for police harassment. Through a friend still in prison, he heard of the services provided by the Bureau on Human Rights and Rule of Law (BHR) at the service desk for ex-prisoners in Dushanbe. The project operates in four Tajik cities, providing free legal and psychological counsel- ling for former convicts. It also refers clients to centres providing treatment for drug and alcohol abuse, which is a common problem among ex-prisoners. The project also works to improve the capacities of prisons, targeting both prison staff and convicts in Nurek Women\u2019s Prison, with the aim to improve conditions in prison and to prepare prisoners for life on the outside. At the service desk, a lawyer and a psychologist are at hand to provide their services for ex-prisoners. Zarrina Alimsho- eva, the centre\u2019s psychologist, says that clients who come to her are often traumatised, afraid and lack self-esteem. They do not know how to deal with what they have expe- rienced in prison or whom to contact for help with such issues and legal concerns. The centre combines psycholog- ical support with legal advice, if requested by the clients. The Government of Tajikistan has no system of social ser- vices for ex-prisoners. Instead, the centre relies on good relations with prison staff for referrals to the service desk of prisoners who are about to be released. For Ismoil, the services of Zarrina and her colleague changed his life. \u2018When I came to Zarrina, I felt like I could stretch my wings. Whenever I face any challenges, I pass by or call them\u2019, says Ismoil. The lawyer at the centre has managed to help Ismoil deal with groundless indemnity claims from authorities and Zarrina has helped him restore his self-confidence. As a result of this support, Ismoil was able to find a job as a forest ranger, therefore providing for himself. After con- tacting the BHR service desk he does not feel so lonely. \u2018Af- ter I was released I had no friends. But now I have a lawyer and a psychologist, and I see them as my friends\u2019, says Ismoil. *Ismoil is a fictional name used to protect the identity of the person.
