        "EN 2 EN EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL On the basis of powers conferred on it by the Council, the European Commission has conducted negotiations with the Islamic Republic of Mauritania with a view to renewing the Protocol to the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania. At the end of those negotiations, a new Protocol was initialled on 26 July 2012. The new Protocol covers a period of two years from the date of its signature. The main aim of the Protocol to the Agreement is to provide fishing opportunities for vessels of the European Union in the waters of Mauritania within the limits of the available surplus. The Commission has, among other things, taken account of the opinion of the Scientific Committee set up under the Agreement. The general aim is to strengthen the cooperation between the European Union and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania with a view to establishing a sustainable fisheries policy and sound exploitation of fisheries resources in Mauritanian fishing zones, in the interests of both Parties. More specifically, the Protocol provides for annual fishing opportunities in the following categories and quantities: \u2013 5 000 tonnes for fishing vessels specialising in crustaceans other than spiny lobster and crab; \u2013 4 000 tonnes for black hake (non-freezer) trawlers and bottom longliners; \u2013 2 500 tonnes for vessels fishing for demersal species other than black hake with gear other than trawls; \u2013 200 tonnes of crab; \u2013 22 tuna seiners; \u2013 22 pole-and-line tuna vessels and surface longliners; \u2013 300 000 tonnes for pelagic freezer trawlers; \u2013 15 000 tonnes for non-freezer pelagic vessels (to be deducted from the allocation set for pelagic freezer trawlers). The Commission proposes, on this basis, that the Council, with the consent of the Parliament, adopt this new Protocol by Decision. ",

Inspection at sea Inspection at sea in the Mauritanian zone of European Union vessels holding a licence shall be carried out by vessels and inspectors of Mauritania who are clearly identified as being assigned to carry out fishing checks. Before boarding, the Mauritanian inspectors shall inform the European Union vessel of their decision to carry out an inspection. The inspection shall be carried out by a maximum of two inspectors, who must provide proof of their identity and official position as an inspector before carrying out the inspection. The Mauritanian inspectors shall only stay on board the European Union vessel for the time necessary to carry out tasks linked to the inspection. They shall carry out the inspection in a way which minimises the impact on the vessel, its fishing activity and cargo. The inspection should not last longer than three hours for pelagic vessels and one and a half hours for the other categories. During inspections at sea, transhipments and landings, the master of a European Union vessel shall facilitate boarding by and the work of the Mauritanian inspectors, in particular by making any manoeuvres deemed necessary by the inspectors. At the end of each inspection, the Mauritanian inspectors shall draw up an inspection report. The master of the European Union vessel has the right to include his comments in the ",
        "EN 23 EN inspection report. The inspection report shall be signed by the inspector drawing up the report and the master of the European Union vessel. The Mauritanian inspectors shall issue a copy of the inspection report to the master of the European Union vessel before leaving the vessel. Mauritania shall send a copy of the inspection report to the European Union within a period of four working days after the inspection. 3. Inspection in port Inspection in port of European Union vessels landing or transhipping catches from Mauritanian fishing zones shall be carried out by Mauritanian inspectors who are clearly identified as being assigned to carry out fishing checks. The inspection shall be carried out by a maximum of two inspectors, who must provide proof of their identity and official position as an inspector before carrying out the inspection. The Mauritanian inspectors shall only stay on board the European Union vessel for the time necessary to carry out the tasks related to the inspection and shall conduct the inspection in such a way as to minimise the impact on the vessel, the landing or transhipment operation and the cargo. The inspection must not last longer than the landing or transhipment operation. At the end of each inspection, the Mauritanian inspector shall draw up an inspection report. The master of the European Union vessel has the right to include his comments in the inspection report. The inspection report shall be signed by the inspector drawing up the report and the master of the European Union vessel. The Mauritanian inspector shall provide a copy of the inspection report to the master of the European Union vessel at the end of the inspection. Mauritania shall send a copy of the inspection report to the European Union within a period of 24 hours days after the inspection. 4. Mutual observation system for shore-based controls The Parties shall set up a mutual observation system for shore-based controls. To this end, they shall designate representatives who shall attend monitoring operations and inspections carried out by the respective national inspection authorities and may make observations on the implementation of this Protocol. These representatives must possess: \u2013 a professional qualification, \u2013 appropriate experience in the fisheries field, and \u2013 thorough knowledge of the provisions of the Agreement and of this Protocol. Inspections shall be carried out by the national inspection authorities and the representatives in attendance may not, on their own initiative, exercise the powers of inspection conferred on national officials. ",
        "EN 24 EN When the representatives accompany national inspection officials, they shall have access to the vessels, premises and documents subject to inspection by those officials, in order to collect data (not containing named references) necessary for the accomplishment of their task. The representatives shall accompany the national inspection authorities on their visits to the ports, on board ships in dock, to public auction houses, fish wholesalers\u2019 shops, cold stores and other premises for landing and stocking fish before it is placed on the market. The representatives shall draw up and submit a report every four months detailing the inspections attended. This report shall be addressed to the competent authorities. A copy shall be supplied by those authorities to the other Contracting Party. The Parties hereby decide to carry out at least two inspections each year, alternately in Mauritania and in Europe. 4.1 Confidentiality The representative on joint monitoring operations shall respect the plant and equipment on board the vessel, and any other installations, and also the confidentiality of all documents to which access is provided. The Parties agree to maintain the highest standards of confidentiality during such operations. The representative shall disclose information on the results of such operations solely to the competent authorities. 4.2 Location This programme shall be implemented in European Union ports of landing and in Mauritanian ports. 4..3 Funding Each Party shall bear the costs of its representative on monitoring operations, including travel and board. CHAPTER VII \u2013 Satellite monitoring system (VMS) The satellite monitoring of European Union vessels shall be ensured by dual transmission based on a triangular system introduced on an experimental basis for the entire period covered by this Protocol, as follows: (1) EU vessel \u2013 flag State FMC \u2013 Mauritanian FMC (2) EU vessel \u2013 Mauritanian FMC \u2013 Flag State FMC 1. Modalities of transmissions Each position message must contain the following information: (a) vessel identification; ",
        "EN 25 EN (b) the most recent geographical position of the vessel (longitude, latitude), with a margin of error of less than 500 metres, and with a confidence interval of 99 %; (c) the date and time the position is recorded; (d) the speed and the course of the vessel. The FMC of the flag State and the FMC of Mauritania shall ensure the automatic processing and, if necessary, the electronic transmission of the position messages. The position messages shall be recorded in a secure manner and kept for a period of three years. 2. Transmission by the vessel in the event of breakdown of the VMS system The master shall ensure at all times that the VMS system of his vessel is fully operational and that the position messages are correctly transmitted to the FMC of the flag State. Where the continuous satellite monitoring equipment installed on board a fishing vessel develops a technical fault or breaks down, the master of the vessel shall transmit the information specified in point 5 by fax to the Control Centre of the flag State and the Mauritanian FMC in good time. In those circumstances a global position report shall be sent every four hours. This global position report shall include the position reports as recorded by the master of the vessel on an hourly basis in accordance with the requirements laid down in point 5. The Control Centre of the flag State shall send these messages immediately to the Mauritanian FMC. The faulty equipment shall be repaired or replaced within a period of not more than five days. Where this deadline is not met, the vessel in question must leave the Mauritanian fishing zones or return to a Mauritanian port. Where there is a serious technical problem requiring an additional period, an exception may be granted at the request of the master for a maximum of 15 days. In that situation the requirements laid down in point 7 shall continue to apply and all vessels, with the exception of tuna vessels, shall enter port in order to take on board a Mauritanian scientific observer. 3. Secure communication of position messages between the FMC of the flag State and Mauritania The FMC of the flag State shall automatically send the position messages of the vessels concerned to the FMC of Mauritania, and vice versa. The FMC of the flag State and the FMC of Mauritania shall exchange their contact e-mail addresses and inform each other immediately of any change to these addresses. The transmission of position messages between the FMCs of the flag State and Mauritania shall be carried out electronically using a secure communication system. The FMC of Mauritania shall immediately inform the FMC of the flag State and the European Union of any interruption in receiving consecutive position messages from a vessel holding a fishing authorisation, where the vessel concerned has not notified its departure from Mauritanian fishing zones. 4. Malfunction of the communication system ",
        "EN 26 EN Mauritania shall ensure the compatibility of its electronic equipment with that of the FMC of the flag State and inform the European Union immediately of any malfunction as regards the communication and receiving of position messages with a view to finding a technical solution as soon as possible. The Joint Committee shall deal with any dispute arising. The master shall be considered to be responsible for any proven manipulation of a vessel\u2019s VMS system aimed at disturbing its operation or falsifying its position messages. Any infringement shall be subject to the penalties provided for by this Protocol. CHAPTER VIII \u2013 Infringements 1. Inspection report and statement of infringement The inspection report, which shall specify the circumstances and reasons leading to the infringement, must be signed by the master of the vessel, who may note any reservations therein and a copy of which shall be given to him by the surveillance authority. This signature shall not prejudice the master's rights or any defence which he may make to the alleged infringement. The statement of infringement shall be drawn up faithfully by the surveillance authority on the basis of any infringements found and entered in the inspection report drawn up following checks on the vessel. The conformity of the vessel's characteristics ascertained during the technical inspection (chapter II) shall be taken into account during such checks. 2. Notification of the infringement In the event of infringement, the surveillance authority shall serve by post on the vessel's agent the statement relating to the infringement, together with the inspection report. The surveillance authority shall inform the European Union thereof without delay. In the event of an infringement which cannot be brought to an end at sea, the master, at the request of the surveillance authority, shall take the vessel to the port of Nouadhibou. In the event of an infringement acknowledged by the master which can be brought to an end at sea, the vessel shall continue fishing. In both cases, the vessel shall continue fishing once the infringement is brought to an end. 3. Settlement of infringements In accordance with this Protocol infringements may be settled either out of court or by legal proceedings. Before taking any measure against the vessel, the master, the crew or the cargo, with the exception of measures aimed at protecting evidence, Mauritania shall organise, at the request of the European Union if necessary, within three (3) working days of notification of the detention of the vessel, an information meeting to clarify the facts which have led to the vessel being detained and to explain what further action may be taken. A representative of the ",
        "EN 27 EN flag State and a representative of the owner of the vessel must be allowed to attend this information meeting. The Settlement Committee shall then be convened by the surveillance authority. All information concerning out-of-court settlements or legal proceedings relating to infringements committed by European Union vessels shall be sent to the European Union without delay. If necessary and by derogation granted by the Chairman, the shipowner may be represented in the Settlement Committee by two persons. Any fine must be paid by transfer no later than 30 days after the settlement. Where a vessel intends to leave the Mauritanian fishing zones, it may only do so once the payment has become effective. A Public Treasury receipt or, failing this, a SWIFT bank transfer certified by the Central Bank of Mauritania on non-working days, shall serve as proof of payment of the fine allowing the vessel to be released. If the settlement procedure has not reached a successful conclusion, the Ministry shall refer the matter to the public prosecutor of Mauritania without delay. Under the legislation in force, a bank security shall be lodged by the shipowner to cover any fines. The vessel shall be released 72 hours from the time when the security is lodged. The bank security shall be irrevocable until the legal proceedings have been concluded. It shall be released by the Ministry once legal proceedings end without a conviction. Similarly, in the event of a conviction leading to a fine, this fine shall be paid in accordance with the legislation in force, which lays down that the bank security will be released if payment is made within 30 days of the judgment. The vessel shall be released and its crew authorised to leave the port: \u2013 once the obligations arising under the amicable settlement have been fulfilled, or \u2013 when the bank security referred to in point 5 above has been lodged and accepted by the Ministry, pending completion of the legal proceedings. CHAPTER IX \u2013 Signing-on of Mauritanian seamen 1. Apart from tuna seiners which must sign on one Mauritanian seaman per vessel and pole-and-line tuna vessels which must sign on three (3) Mauritanian seamen per vessel, each European Union vessel shall sign on 60 % of Mauritanian seamen for the duration of its presence in Mauritanian fishing zones, freely selected from a list established by the Ministry; this calculation shall not include officers. However, where Mauritanian trainee officers are signed on, the number of such officers shall be deducted from that of Mauritanian seamen. 2. The shipowner or his agent shall inform the Ministry of the names of the Mauritanian seamen signed on the vessel concerned, mentioning their position in the crew. 3. The International Labour Organisation (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work shall apply as of right to seamen signed on by European Union vessels. This concerns in particular the freedom of association and the effective ",
        "EN 28 EN recognition of the right to collective bargaining, and the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. 4. Mauritanian seamen's employment contracts, a copy of which shall be given to the signatories, shall be drawn up between the shipowners' agent(s) and the seamen and/or their trade unions or representatives in consultation with the competent Mauritanian authorities. The contracts shall guarantee the seamen the social security cover applicable to them, including life assurance and sickness and accident insurance. 5. Shipowners or their agents shall send, within two months of the issue of the licence, a copy of that contract duly signed by the competent authorities of the Member State concerned direct to the Ministry. 6. Mauritanian seamen's wages shall be paid by the shipowners. They shall be fixed, before licences are issued, by mutual agreement between the shipowners or their agents and the Mauritanian seamen concerned or their representatives. However, the wage conditions granted to Mauritanian seamen shall not be lower than those applied to Mauritanian crews and shall comply with or exceed ILO standards. 7. If one or more seamen employed on board fail to report at the time agreed for the vessel's departure, the vessel shall be permitted to start the planned trip after informing the competent authorities in the port of embarkation of the shortfall in the number of seamen required and having updated its crew list. The authorities concerned shall notify the surveillance authority thereof. 8. The shipowner shall take all necessary steps to ensure that the number of seamen required by this Agreement are signed on by the vessel by the next trip at the latest. 9. Where no Mauritanian seamen are taken on board for reasons other than that specified in the previous point, owners of European Union vessels shall be obliged to pay as soon as possible a flat-rate amount of EUR 20 per day of fishing in the Mauritanian fishing zone per seaman within a maximum of three months. 10. Payment for failure to sign on seamen shall be based on the actual number of fishing days and not on the period of the licence. 11. This sum shall be used for training Mauritanian fishermen and shall be paid into the account specified in Chapter I, General Provisions, of this Annex. 12. Twice a year the European Union shall send the Ministry a list of Mauritanian seamen on board European Union vessels on 1 January and 1 July of each year, showing their number in the seamen's register and the vessels on which they are employed. 13. Without prejudice to point 7 above, recurring failure by shipowners to sign on the requisite number of Mauritanian seamen shall result in automatic suspension of the vessels\u2019 fishing licence until such obligations have been met. ",
        "EN 29 EN CHAPTER X \u2013 Scientific observers A system for scientific observation on board European Union vessels is hereby established. 1. For each fishing category the Parties shall designate at least two vessels per year which shall take on board a Mauritanian scientific observer, except for tuna seiners, which shall board observers at the request of the Ministry. There shall be only one scientific observer at a time per vessel. The period spent on board a vessel by a scientific observer shall be the length of a trip. However, at the express request of one of the Parties, this embarkation may be spread over several trips depending on the average duration of the trips planned for a particular vessel. 2. The Ministry shall inform the European Union of the names of designated scientific observers, provided with the requisite documents, at least seven working days before the scheduled date of their embarkation. 3. All costs arising out of the activities of scientific observers, including their salary, emoluments and allowances, shall be borne by the Ministry. 4. The Ministry shall make all necessary arrangements for the embarkation and landing of the scientific observer. Scientific observers shall enjoy the same treatment on board as the vessel's officers. Scientific observers shall be offered every facility needed to carry out their duties. The master shall give them access to the means of communication needed for the discharge of their duties, to documents directly concerned with the vessel's fishing activities, i.e. the fishing log, the supplementary fishing log and the navigation log, and to those parts of the vessel necessary to facilitate the exercise of their tasks as observer. 5. Scientific observers must report to the master of the designated vessel the day before the selected date of embarkation. Should the scientific observer not appear, the master of the vessel shall inform the Ministry and the European Union. In this case the vessel shall be authorised to leave the port. However, the Ministry may subsequently, without delay and at its own expense, arrange the boarding of a new scientific observer, without disrupting fishing by the vessel. 6. Scientific observers must have: \u2013 a professional qualification, \u2013 adequate fisheries experience, and thorough knowledge of the provisions of this Protocol. 7. Scientific observers shall ensure that European Union vessels operating in Mauritanian fishing zone comply with the terms of this Protocol. ",
        "EN 30 EN They shall compile a report on this subject. In particular, they shall: \u2013 observe the fishing activities of the vessels; \u2013 check the position of vessels engaged in fishing operations; \u2013 perform biological sampling in the context of scientific programmes; \u2013 record particulars of the fishing gear and the mesh sizes of the nets used. 8. Observation shall be confined to fishing activities and related activities governed by this Protocol. 9. Scientific observers shall: \u2013 take all appropriate steps to ensure that the conditions of their boarding and presence on the vessel neither interrupt nor hamper fishing operations, \u2013 use the instruments and procedures approved for measuring the mesh size of nets used under this Protocol; and \u2013 respect the material and equipment on board and the confidentiality of all documents belonging to the vessel. 10. At the end of the observation period and before leaving the vessel, the scientific observer shall draw up a report in accordance with the model in Appendix 9 to this Annex. The observer shall sign it in the presence of the master, who may add or cause to be added to it any observations considered relevant, followed by the master\u2019s signature. A copy of the report shall be handed to the master of the vessel when the observer is put ashore as well as to the Ministry and the European Union. CHAPTER XI \u2013 Vessels targeting highly migratory species 1. Licences for tuna seiners, pole-and-line tuna vessels and surface longliners shall be issued for periods which coincide with calendar years except for the first and last year of this Protocol. On presentation of the proof of payment of the advance, the Ministry shall draw up the licence and enter the vessel concerned on the list of vessels authorised to fish which shall be sent to the surveillance authority and to the European Union. 2. Before receiving its licence, each vessel operating under the Agreement for the first time must be presented for the inspections required by the legislation in force. Such inspections may be carried out in a foreign port to be agreed. All expenses linked to such inspection shall be borne by the shipowner. 3. Vessels holding fishing licences for neighbouring countries may indicate in their licence applications the country and species concerned and the period of validity of such licences to facilitate their multiple entries into and exits from the fishing zone. ",
        "EN 31 EN 4. Licences shall be issued following payment, by transfer to the account indicated in Chapter I, of a lump sum corresponding to the advance specified in the Fishing in the Protocol. This lump sum shall be established pro rata temporis to the validity of the licence for the first and last year of the Protocol. The parafiscal charge shall be paid in proportion to the time spent in the Mauritanian fishery zone. Monthly payments are deemed to cover periods of 30 days' actual fishing. This provision preserves the indivisible nature of the charge and, consequently, the monthly payment shall be due in respect of any period begun. A vessel which has fished for 1 to 30 days over the year shall pay the charge in respect of one month. The second monthly payment of this charge shall be due after the first period of 30 days and so on. Additional monthly payments shall be made no later than 10 days after the first day of each additional period. 5. Vessels shall keep a log-book in accordance with the model in Appendix 3 to this Annex for each fishing period spent in Mauritanian waters. It shall be filled in even when no catches are made. 6. Subject to any checks that Mauritania may wish to carry out, the European Union shall submit to the Ministry, by 15 June each year, a statement of fees due for the previous fishing year on the basis of the catch declarations made by each shipowner and confirmed by the scientific institutes responsible for verifying catch data in the Member States, such as the IRD (Institut de Recherche pour le D\u00e9veloppement), IEO (Instituto Espa\u00f1ol de Oceanograf\u00eda), INIAP (Instituto Nacional de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o Agr\u00e1ria e das Pescas) and IMROP (Institut Mauritanien de Recherches Oc\u00e9anographiques et des P\u00eaches). 7. Tuna vessels and surface longliners shall comply with all the recommendations adopted by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). 8. For the last year of application of the Protocol, the statement of the fees due for the previous fishing year shall be notified within four months of expiry of the Protocol. 9. The final statement shall be sent to the shipowners concerned, who shall have 30 days from the notification and the approval of the amounts by the Ministry, within which to discharge their financial obligations to the competent national authorities. Payment in euro, payable to the Public Treasury, shall be made into the account mentioned in Chapter I no later than one and a half months after that notification. However, if the amount of the final statement is lower than the advance referred to in point 3 above, the resulting balance shall not be reimbursable to the shipowner. 10. 10. Vessels shall be obliged, within the three hours before entering or leaving the zone, to communicate their position and the volume of the catch on board direct to the Mauritanian authorities by electronic means or, failing that, by radio. The addresses and radio frequency shall be notified by the surveillance authority. ",

        "EN 63 EN ANNEX 2 Financial support for promoting responsible and sustainable fishing 1. Subject and amounts Financial support within the meaning of this Annex is public development aid which is independent of the commercial component governed by Article 7(1)(a) of the Agreement and Article 2(1) of this Protocol. Such support, referred to in Article 2(2) of this Protocol, amounts to EUR 3 million per year. It aims to contribute to the development of responsible and sustainable fishing in Mauritanian fishing zones in keeping with the strategic objectives of conservation of fishery resources and better integration of the sector into the national economy. Financial support comprises three intervention priorities, as follows: Measures Priority I: SCIENTIFIC COOPERATION AND TRAINING Support for implementation of fisheries development plans (IMROP, ONISPA, ENEMP) Priority II MONITORING Support for the activities of DSPCM Priority III ENVIRONMENT Conservation of the marine and coastal environment (PNBA and PND) 2. Beneficiaries The beneficiaries of the support are the Ministry of Fisheries and the Ministry of the Environment and Sustainable Development, respectively. These institutional beneficiaries shall work closely with the Finance Ministry. 3. Implementation framework The European Union and Mauritania shall agree within the Joint Committee provided for in Article 10 of the Agreement, following the entry into force of this Protocol, on the eligibility criteria for financial support, and on its legal base, programming, monitoring and evaluation, and the methods of payment. 4. Visibility Mauritania undertakes to guarantee the visibility of the measures implemented with financial support. To this end, the beneficiaries shall coordinate with the Delegation of the European Union at Nouakchott their work on implementing the visibility guidelines laid down by the European Commission. In particular, each project must be subject to a clause ensuring visibility for the support of the European Union, notably through use of the logo (EU flag). Lastly, Mauritania shall send the European Union a schedule of inaugurations. ",

Objective(s) 1.4.1. The Commission's multiannual strategic objective(s) targeted by the proposal/initiative The negotiation and conclusion of fisheries agreements with third countries meets the general objective of maintaining and safeguarding the fishing activities of the European Union fleet, including the distant-water fleet, and developing relations in a spirit of partnership with a view to strengthening the sustainable exploitation of fishery resources outside European Union waters. The Fisheries Partnership Agreements (FPAs) also ensure coherence between the principles governing the Common Fisheries Policy and the commitments made under other European policies (sustainable use of third-country resources, combating illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing, integration of partner countries into the global economy and better political and financial governance of fisheries). 1.4.2.

The conclusion of the Protocol will contribute to maintaining the fishing opportunities for European vessels in Mauritanian fishing zones. The Protocol will also contribute to better management and conservation of fishery resources, through financial support (sectoral support) for the implementation of the annual and multiannual programmes adopted at national level by the partner country. 1.4.4. Indicators of results and impact Specify the indicators for monitoring implementation of the proposal/initiative. Rates of utilisation of fishing opportunities (annual uptake of fishing authorisations as a percentage of availability under the Protocol); Gathering and analysing data on catches and the commercial value of the Agreement; Contribution to employment and to added value in the European Union and to stabilising the EU market (in aggregate with other FPAs); Number of technical meetings and meetings of the Joint Committee. ",
        "EN 67 EN 1.5. Grounds for the proposal/initiative 1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term The Protocol for the 2008-12 period will expire on 31 July 2012. It is intended that the new Protocol will apply provisionally from the date of signature. A procedure for the adoption by the Council of a Decision regarding the provisional implementation of the Protocol has been launched in parallel with this procedure. The new Protocol will provide a framework for the fishing activities of the European fleet and will, in particular, allow vessel owners to continue to obtain fishing authorisations in Mauritanian fishing zones. In addition, the new Protocol enhances cooperation between the European Union and Mauritania, with a view to promoting the development of a sustainable fishing policy. It provides, in particular, for the vessels to be monitored via VMS and encourages electronic transmission of catch data. 1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement As regards this new Protocol, failure to act by the European Union would allow private agreements to spring up which would not guarantee sustainable fisheries. The European Union also hopes that with this Protocol, Mauritania will continue to cooperate effectively with the European Union on sustainable fishing. The funds available under the Protocol will also allow Mauritania to continue its strategic planning efforts for the implementation of its fisheries policies. 1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past Due to the underutilisation of certain fishing categories under the previous Protocol and in line with the conclusions of the scientific opinion, the Parties have decided to reduce the fishing opportunities. The corresponding commercial value has nevertheless been raised slightly to take account of price trends in the markets. 1.5.4. Coherence and possible synergy with other relevant instruments Funds paid out under FPAs constitute fungible revenue in the budgets of the third- country partners. However, allocating some of those funds for implementing measures as part of the country\u2019s sectoral policy is a condition for the conclusion and monitoring of FPAs. These financial resources, decoupled from the commercial part of the Protocol, are compatible with other sources of funding from other international donors, for the realisation of projects and/or programmes at national level in the fisheries sector.

The Commission (DG MARE, in collaboration with the European Union Delegation at Nouakchott) will ensure regular monitoring of the implementation of this Protocol, particularly in terms of operators\u2019 utilisation of fishing opportunities and in terms of catch data. Furthermore, the Fisheries Partnership Agreement provides for at least one annual meeting of the Joint Committee, at which the Commission and the third country concerned review the implementation of the Agreement and the Protocol thereto and, if necessary, adjust the programming and, where applicable, the financial contribution. 2.2. Management and control system 2.2.1. Risk(s) identified There is some risk in setting up a fisheries protocol, particularly with regard to the amounts intended to finance the sectoral fisheries policy (under-programming). 2.2.2. Control method(s) envisaged To avoid these risks, extensive dialogue is planned on the programming and implementation of the sectoral policy. Joint analysis of progress, as referred to in paragraph 2.1, also forms part of these control methods. In addition, the Protocol contains specific clauses for its suspension, on certain conditions and in given circumstances. 2.3. Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities Specify existing or envisaged prevention and protection measures. The Commission undertakes to try to establish permanent political dialogue and cooperation with a view to improving the management of the Agreement and strengthening the European Union's contribution to the sustainable management of resources. In any case, any payment which the Commission makes under a fisheries agreement is subject to the Commission's standard rules and budgetary and financial procedures. This makes it possible, in particular, to fully identify the bank accounts of the third countries into which the financial contribution is paid. For this particular Protocol, the entire financial contribution must be paid into an account of the Central Bank of Mauritania pursuant to Chapter I, Article 5 of Annex 1. ",
