        "The voice of Diversity Europe Group May 2018 Europe III 2018 is an important year for the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC). Celebrating 60 years since its creation in May 1958, we are forced to reflect on what we, European civil society have jointly achieved. But we must also reflect on what challenges lie ahead and what role we can play in shaping the Europe of tomorrow! For there are indeed many challenges on the European horizon\u2026Between the negotiations on the new EU Multi-annual financing framework (MFF), the elections to the European Parliament, the final phase of the Brexit negotiations and a new European Commission, there will be a lot of turbulence over the next two years. As the philosopher Emmanuel Kant stated in the 18th Century \u201cThe only thing permanent is change\u201d! Change has begun first and foremost within our Group, which from 17 April has a new name: \u2018Diversity Europe Group\u2019. What remains is the expertise, energy, creativity and dedication of our Members, who will continue to innovate, to drive new ideas and policy work within our Group, the EESC and the EU. We will continue together to re-energise Europe and to use our influence to disseminate the benefits of EU Membership. For as much as the EU needs our expertise, the EU also needs our engagement to give transparency and credibility to the European project . However, firstly, allow me to introduce myself as the new President of Group III. A self-employed lawyer representing German Liberal Professional Associations at the EESC since 2002, I am above all a Europhile. I deeply believe in the values of the EU and in its benefits as a complementary layer of governance and identity. For the Union not only inherited, but also embraced the democratic values of Ancient Greece. It is not by chance that President Macron gave his speech outlining the future of Europe at the hill of Pnyx in Athens in September 2017. It is in this ancient site that democracy first flourished. However, democracy also comes with personal responsibilities. I believe that this applies particularly to us, as representatives of organised European civil society. I also believe that our principal mission should be to take initiatives, to be proactive, rather than reactive. For this reason, my Presidency will have one horizontal priority: combatting prejudice and populism through responsibility and diversity . What do I mean by this? Firstly, I consider that all of us have a personal responsibility to more effectively connect the \u2018Brussels bubble\u2019 with the respective organisations that EESC Members represent here. This is why we are here and this should be our first priority. It is our responsibility to actively communicate on Europe to our national organisations. To persuade national civil society and political authorities of the added value, opportunities and benefits of the EU . Given the increasing Euroscepticism, illiberalism and populism, I believe that a great deal more of our energy must be focused on \u2018selling\u2019 Europe and its values of tolerance, plurality and inclusion to the national level, at home . Put simply, Europe is everybody\u2019s business! We as Members of the EESC have a double responsibility. To step up our activities linking the European and the national levels. To strengthen national and European networks. To work more closely together. This brings me to my second priority for the first part of my mandate: combatting populism, which is clearly on the rise as we have seen from the recent elections in Hungary, Italy, Austria and Germany. Our Group has already scheduled a conference in October in Austria on populism , which will be preceded by the publication of study on DIVERSITY EUROPE: Combatting prejudice and populism through responsibility and diversity! ED Editorial Arno METZLER (DE) President of Diversity Europe Group ",
        "Europe III the rise of populism in non-metropolitan areas. We will be looking at how and when civil society organisations are able or unable to avert the rise of populism in periphery areas. Regrettably, the populist vote \u2013 left or right wing - within EU Member States has increased from an average of 8.5% in the year 2000 to over 24% at its peak today. Moreover, the triangular relationship between the People, the Elite and Others (foreigners, immigrants, etc.) is becoming dangerously pervasive and antagonistic within our societies. Within this context, it is very difficult for the European Institutions to assert values which have been ignored by citizens in democratic elections in Member States. So without doubt, the fight against populism must be made at the national level and has to be supported by the maximum number of Europeans . My third priority for the first part of the mandate, will involve combatting prejudice and promoting diversity through education. As Nelson Mandela once stated \u201cEducation is the most powerful weapon you can use to change the world\u201d . Without doubt, we should devote more energy to turning children into European citizens, through civic education. But we must also encourage our youth to become partners in change. Taking the lead in embracing diversity, inclusiveness and tolerance within our societies, all of which should be sources of pride, not of hate and conflict . The same applies to our Group: our diversity is truly our strength and richness. For this reason, I proposed changing the name of our Group to \u2018Diversity Europe\u2019! But the promotion of diversity and tolerance will also come into the thematic work of our Group over the next few months, through a study on \u2018prejudice\u2019 in schools. I end this Editorial with a plea for European civil society to remain positive, constructive and cooperative. We must jointly shape European challenges into opportunities for a more active and effective EU! Tomorrow begins Today!

        "The European Economic and Social Committee at 60 its role among the institutions reaffirmed The EESC is celebrating its 60 th anniversary. A pivotal age at a time when bringing Europe closer to the people is more important than ever. For Toute l\u2019Europe, university professor and EESC member Thierry Libaert takes a look at the work and development of the consultative assembly of European economic and social partners, which on average produces 150 opinions and reports each year. From the outset of the European project, there was a belief that it was not enough to mobilise governments - you also had to involve society\u2019s main interest groups. This resulted in a consultative body being established, made up of an equal number of representatives of employers, employees, and members representing various public interests, including the volun- tary sector. As Walter Hallstein, the first president of the European Commis- sion put it, \u201cYou will share the experience, technical views and concerns of the population of the six countries of the Common Market with the Com- mission\u201d. Established on 25 March 1957 by the Treaty of Rome, the Europe- an Economic and Social Committee held its first meeting on 19 May 1958. \u201cArrangements that work\u201d Currently made up of 350 members distributed equally among the three interest groups, the Eu- ropean Economic and Social Committee (EESC)\u2019s task is to draw up opinions on most of the major European public policies . Its first president, the Belgian, Roger de Staercke, said that its role was to find \u201carrangements that work\u201d. From the beginning, the EESC has worked on the basis of what is still its guiding principle 60 years on, the search for consensus . Going beyond sec- toral and national affiliations, the objective is to reach a final opinion to which everyone can subscribe. The opinion, draft- ed by a rapporteur, is the product of a study group on which the differ- ent interests are represented. It is then discussed and often amended at a meeting of one of the Committee\u2019s sections, before being submit- ted to the plenary session and voted on. The final opinion aims to be a synthesis of views which were often initially in conflict. The in-house culture is one of continuous dialogue aimed at finding areas of compro- mise leading to broader agreement . Unlike parliamentary assemblies, the object is not to secure a majority of at least 50% but rather to achieve the broadest possible consensus among the extraordinary diversity of interests represented. In the 1970s, the EESC obtained the right to issue opinions on its own initia- tive on any question relating to the activities of the European Commission. The 1980s were dominated by the Commission presidency of Jacques Delors and a focus on social issues. At his request, the Committee draft- ed the Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers. This marked a turning point for Europe which was now made up of twelve States whose predominant economic philosophy was favourable to the de- velopment of a social Europe. In 1999, the EESC, which had seen its consultation rights expanded by the Treaty of Maastricht, signed in 1992, held the first Convention of civil so- ciety organised at European level. The aim was to launch a wide-ranging debate with all representative civil society organisations. This was when the concept of organised civil society, now widespread, first emerged. Your Europe, Your Say! The 2000s marked the full recognition of the EESC, particularly in 2007 by the Treaty of Lisbon. Its members\u2019 term of office increased from four to five years, its membership became more representative of the diversity of Eu- ropean interests and its field of mandatory consultation was extended to cover 28 areas of activity. In 2010, the EESC held the first \u201cYour Europe, Your Say\u201d event to allow young people from different educational establishments in the Member States to discuss Europe and learn how to work together. Two years later, the Com- mittee launched the European Citizens\u2019 Initiative Day to serve as a forum for discussion on this new right conferred by the Lisbon Treaty that enables citizens to directly influence the European decision-making process, by col- lecting a million signatures. To quote only one example of a recent opinion, on 17 October 2013 the Committee issued an opinion on efforts to put a stop to planned obso- lescence . The opinion was highly significant. Firstly, because it was the first European text to address the issue . Secondly because it symbolised a Eu- rope close to its citizens, as every consumer has bought a product and then realised that it was difficult or very expensive to repair . And finally, because it perfectly illustrated the search for consensus . The opinion, which subsequently led to a European Parliament resolution, was in fact adopted virtually unanimously (only one vote against). What about the future? 60 years after it was set up, what does the future hold for the EESC? In the first place, at a time when our societies are increasingly fragmented, the European Economic and Social Committee is the only forum bringing together most of the major interest groups . The existence of a place of dialogue for virtually all the components of civil society is now more necessary than ever. At a time when the dynamic role of civil society is being discovered, along with prospects for revitalising Eu- ropean public consultations, the EESC clearly has a key role to play . Secondly, the very principle of the Committee\u2019s work gives it a special place at the centre of European public policy. The aim is not to convince your peers of the rightness of your views, or to impose them on others, but rather, step by step, to arrive at the broadest possible consensus. The fact that companies big or small, workers, consumer representatives and envi- ronmental NGOs can agree on a text on subjects as vital as the problem of migrants, posted workers, the Union\u2019s economic recovery or the transition to the green economy can have a lasting impact on the decisions of the Commission or the Council of the European Union. It has to be admitted, however, that not all opinions are of equal quality and not all the hundred or more opinions adopted in a given year will have the same potential im- pact. The EESC will have to face up to challenges, such as the growing number of consultative bodies attached to the various institutions. Many deci- sion-makers have been seduced by the mirage of a purely digital partic- ipatory democracy. Belief in purely virtual consultation reaching the great- est possible number of internet users is attractive in terms of its scale and offers the illusion of a post-modern democracy. But EESC members know that the most constructive exchanges take place face-to-face through the process of ongoing civil dialogue. ",

        "THIS ALSO HAPPENED DURING THE APRIL PLENARY SESSION OF THE EESC Mr Metzler intervened at this mid-term re- newal Plenary as President of the Group III. He congratulated Mr Jahier (former president of the group) for having been elected president of the EESC and welcomed the 4 priorities he identified for his presidency mandate: (1) sustainable development , (2) promotion of peace , (3) strengthening the role of Culture within the European political discourse , (4) give our youth the space and voice they deserve . \u2018I particularly welcome the emphasis you will place on Culture. I agree that Culture has an enormous untapped potential to play in fighting populism, Euroscepticism and the shrinking civic space, all of which are threatening our democratic societies . But in investing in, in sharing and in celebrating Culture, we can directly strengthen open soci- eties and our democratic values. Culture not only drives sustainable and inclusive growth, but crucially, it also enables us to compre- hend and to welcome diversity in Europe. European Culture, His- tory and Diversity are completely interlinked . This is despite the fact that on many occasions in the past, there have been attempts to align History with only one Cultural heritage and one historical inter- pretation. I am more of the opinion that we should be using Europe- an history to remind us of our collective diversity ! I also very much support your desire to instill hope and ambition in the European project . To create a new European narrative. To build a regenerated sustainable Europe, with our young persons as central players. For we cannot build the Europe of tomorrow, without our young! Ms Slavova has been elected President of the REX Section for the mandate 2018-2020. Ms Rodert has been elected President of the INT Section for the mandate 2018-2020. We also cannot expect to operate on our own! The Committee does not exist in a vacuum. It does not exist without the national civil so- ciety organisations to which our Members belong. There is a whole world of important civil society actors beyond the walls of our Committee. To be successful, we must work with them in part- nership, at both the national and European levels! Finally, before closing, I would like to echo your call for greater co- operation and mutual respect among all actors within the Com- mittee. We can only advance in our consultative role if we work openly together. We cannot preach \u2018trust\u2019 to the outside world, if we do not practice it within our own walls!\u2019 ",
        "Group III Member Renate Heinisch with Luca Jahier working in new functions Renate HEINISCH (DE) Federal Association of German Senior Citizens\u2019 Organisations Member of Diversity Europe Group Renate Heinisch, from Boxberg, is active in the EESC with new functions for the mandate 2018-2020. Renate Heinisch, who has been a member of the EESC since 2002, has already started the dialogue with the European Health Parliament (EHP). 50 young people from all Member States have made recommendations on the future of European health policy. These guidelines are now discussed within the EESC and translated into actions. \u2018To me antibiotics and vaccination are of utmost importance\u2019, says Renate Heinisch, who is working on a report related to \u2018EU-wide cooperation in the fight against vaccine-preventable diseases\u2019. The health sector is anchored in the SOC and INT sections, to which Renate Heinisch belongs as a member. She is also a member of the Liberal Professions category, the Information Technology Group, the CCMI, as well as the EU-Chile Joint Consultative Committee. Luca Jahier (Italian member) was elected as the 32nd President of the EESC (representing the organised civil society at the EU level) at the Plenary session in April. In his speech, the new president set out the four priorities of his programme: sustainable development, promoting peace, strengthening the role of culture and give a voice to the youth of Europe. \u2018I invite you all to work with me for a strong civic engagement towards a sustainable future for Europe. I invite you to dream together with me of a revitalised Europe and to work towards a second European Renaissance!\u2019, the President Luca Jahier addressed the 350 members of the EESC, with his new presidency cabinet composed of women in many leadership positions. The EESC has 350 members from 28 Member states. The members are appointed by the Council of the European Union upon the proposal of the governments of the EU Member states for a five-year term. They work independently in the interest of all EU citizens. These members are not politicians. They are employers, trade unionists and representatives from different sectors such as agriculture, consumer and environmental protection, the social economy, SMEs and the liberal professions as well as representatives of associations for disabled people and associations working for the voluntary sector, the gender equality, the youth, the elderly people, science and research, etc. The final priority is to make young people the primary actors of change, giving them the space and voice they deserve . Europe III Dr. Renate Heinisch is still a member of the EESC. Our picture shows her together with the president of the EESC Luca Jahier.

        "Group III Member Renate Heinisch with Luca Jahier working in new functions Alternative fuels infrastructure S\u00e9amus BOLAND (IE) Irish Rural Link Vice-President of Diversity Europe Group At the April plenary the EESC approved the opinion TEN/654-Action Plan on Alternative Fuels Infrastructure. It derives from Article 10(6) of Directive 2014/94/EU, which included the assessment of national policy frameworks under article 10(2). The overall context of this opinion is informed by the Paris agreement on climate change, which is a binding agreement, obligating all signatories to implement a range of measures which will achieve a reduction of greenhouse emissions in a timely manner. The opinion is extremely critical of the extremely slow progress being made by the EU and is concerned that the national reports submitted to the EU Commission show no urgency to achieve any progress in this area. One of these measures agreed, among the EU members is the importance of providing an alternative infrastructure that will facilitate motorists to switch from conventional fuels to sustainable fuels in line with the EU Commissions strategy to achieve compliance with the Paris agreement . Such a measure if successful would allow. In effect such a measure would allow users of transports to drive across Europe in the knowledge that their vehicle would have access to the alternative fuel necessary for their particular journey. As of now, no such infrastructure exists and even within member states is particularly poor. In November 2017, the Commission took decisive steps forward in implementing the EU\u2019s commitments under the Paris Agreement, which stipulated a binding domestic reduction in CO 2 of at least 40% by 2030. The \u201cClean Mobility Package\u201d included an action plan and investment solutions for the trans-European deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure. The aim is to support national policy frameworks by supporting investments in the transport network (the trans-European transport network or \u201cTEN-T\u201d) in urban areas. This will ensure the availability of alternative fuels infrastructure for road users. By current EU estimates, as many as 95% of road vehicles and vessels use conventional fuels. This is despite a number of available EU funding instruments; not covered by the action plan. However, due to the availability of EU funding, some progress in the provision of alternative fuels infrastructure has been made. The European Alternative Fuels Observatory has recorded 118 000 publicly accessible recharging points for electric vehicles. There are 3 458 refuelling points for compressed natural gas and, at the end of September 2017, there were 82 points for hydrogen vehicles. However; there is a severe lack of charging points for electric vehicles per 100 000 city inhabitants. All Member States were due to report on progress by the end of 2017. Two failed to do so (Malta and Romania). However, they have since improved their situation and are working positively with the commission. Unfortunately, all of the National Reports have demonstrated that member states are significantly falling behind in relation to targets as set out by themselves. Unless there is an immediate and significant change in the implementation of this plan, then it is almost certain that the programme will fail; which means that compliance with the Paris agreement will be seriously undermined leading to the failure of the accord. In its recommendations the opinion seeks to radically improve this performance and is of the view that the Commission must seriously review the action plan proposed. It calls on the Commission and each of the member states to re-prioritise the Alternative fuels infrastructure Plan, so that there are clear stages of achievement within the timelines given. The action plan, which on current performance has almost stalled is the central driver of change and needs to attain a much greater momentum than it already has. It is noted that each member state relies heavily on the taxation gained from conventional transport fuel and makes it clear that this fact should not be used as an excuse not to implement the action plan. The plan, although significantly funded by the EU clearly suffers from still not having enough. There is a reluctance by the private sector to invest at the levels required and there is considerable uncertainty that the life-span of certain technologies is short and may necessitate a complete renewal before the necessary return. Clearly the there is a need to combine available funding including that leveraged from the private sector. The lack of encouragement to consumers to become involved is also a matter of concern. They demand certainty in terms of availability of alternative fuel, a reliable platform which provides the necessary information to switch over and certain support incentives, in the form of taxation or income support for people on low incomes. In rural areas the provision of alternative fuel infrastructure can be more expensive. Equally the reliance on diesel vehicles to maintain viable regional economies means that there are particular challenges in these areas. By their nature rural regions can have a more scattered population, with long distances between settlements and places of employment. Problems such as provision and cost of charging points have not been solved. This means that there is limited options available in terms of alternative fuels. In this regard rural transport could benefit from the wider availability of infrastructure based on the use of biofuel. The technology is already well established and if prioritised would go a long way to achieving necessary transition. While there has been significant investment by the EU in supporting the action plan, there is considerable evidence that such investment needs to increase significantly. Opportunities to work with the auto industry as well as other large economic stake holders will need to be explore. However, the situation of families on low incomes will have to be taken into account in further planning. Clearly the implementation of the action plan on alternative fuels infrastructure has got off to a very bad start and is perilously close to complete failure. Nothing less than an immediate resuscitation is likely to save it. ",

In order to increase competition between gas suppliers and guarantee energy security in the Energy Union, the European Commission put forward a propos- al to amend the Gas Directive (2009/73/EC) in November 2017. The objective was to make sure that gas pipelines from and to third countries are subject to the common rules of the internal gas market. Given the EU\u2019s increasing de- pendency on gas imports, the proposed amendments raised a number of political and economic issues , especially concerning their implications for current and future investment, the regulatory burden for national authorities, and the autonomy of Member States in conducting external energy policy. A keynote speech has been delivered by Mr. Buzek, Member of the European Parliament and chair of the European Parliament\u2019s Committee on Indus- try, Research and Energy (ITRE) , who stated that \u2018it is important that we have stability and continuity of gas supply in the EU. This amendment proposed by the Commission is a revision of a technical nature and limited in scope, and it will be applicable to the EU territory as a whole. It is a precondition for our en- ergy security and independence; it will create a level playing field among all actors involved and facilitate free competition.\u201d Ms Miltovi\u010da , Rapporteur of the opinion \u201cAmending the Internal Gas Market Directive\u201d moderated the panel \u2018EU Gas Market Policy: How important are pipelines for Europe\u2019s energy security?\u2019. She stressed how important it was to better coordinate the rules in relation to external suppliers and to achieve a single regulatory framework so that energy was supplied ac- cording to the same rules everywhere . Ms Miltovi\u010da has coordinated all contributions from this event, which has fed into the EESC opinion on amending the Internal Gas Market Directive, adopted at the April plenary session.

Youth buy-in and education are key to the transforma- tion of our economy into a sustainable one.\u2019 Summarising the conclusions of the different participatory workshops, Mr Lohan said \u2018The conclusion of today is that these small projects need more support - not only as re- gards financing - and today\u2019s event was a major step towards more citi- zen engagement in the fight against climate change.\u2019 Europe III ",

The new ECI proposal redefines many technical aspects of the mechanism, which will have a direct impact on the role of various stakeholders, including the EU institutions, Member States and civil society organisations. This panel looked at a possible role for each stakeholder group, to help increase the po- litical visibility and dimension of the ECI, as well as to identify the poten- tial areas for partnerships. This panel took place after the keynote speech by Luca Jahier according to whom \u201ca well-functioning ECI should empower citizens; it should give them a voice, a sense of belonging and identity, helping to rebuild trust and to rediscover the solidarity of the European project\u201d. Roman HAKEN (CZ) Director of the Centre for Community Organizing (CCO) of Central Moravia Member of the Czech Government Council for NGOs Member of Diversity Europe Group Jean-Marc ROIRANT (FR) Secretary-general of the Ligue de l\u2019enseignement education movement Member of Diversity Europe Group Financing of civil society organisations by the EU 6 April \u2013 Event in Prague related to the non-profit sector in the EU and in Czech Republic On 6 April, Mr Haken and Mr Roirant attended an event in Prague relat- ed to the sustainability of the NGOs services and the voice of NGOs : their state of play , the shrinking civic space of NGOs and what could be improved . During the event co-organised by the umbrella organisation \u2018Platform of NGOs\u2019 based in Czech Republic, discussions have been raised by a lawyer from the Committee of legislative and financing for NGOs of the government Council, by people belonging to NGOs and to local networks, by the Ministry for Youth, Sport and Education on the Czech level and by the first vice-president of the Czech Senate. It was also a good opportunity to highlight the own-initiative opinion SOC/563 \u2018Financing of civil society organisations by the EU\u2019 (Rapporteur: Jean-Marc Roirant). In this own-initiative opinion the EESC calls on the European institutions to promote a positive image of CSOs, preserve their independence and strengthen their capacity for action . Background Funding is one of the factors contributing to enabling active citizenship and participatory democracy. Civil society organisations or NGOs do receive EU financial support (co-funding) either for projects or for policy work as structural funding. However, access to EU funding remains quite difficult for many asso- ciations as procedures are quite complicated and the administration is burdensome . In addition, there is a lack of transparency and consist- ency of audit procedures because of diverging interpretation of rules in place and lack of harmonisation. This opinion will contribute to reviewing the state of the art as regards the distribution and effectiveness of EU funding as contributing to participatory democracy and citizenship and will make recommenda- tions in view of the review of the EU funding priorities. The opinion could contribute to the current discussions and decision on revised financial regulations, and the upcoming proposal for a Multi An- nual Financial Framework after 2020 , as well as to the implementation of Article 11 of TEU on civil dialogue. It will also complement the EP own initiative report on budgetary control of financing NGOs from the EU budget. This own-initiative opinion, which received much positive insights until now, came at just the right time both from the institutional calendar and from the point of view of contributing to the reflection on the civic and social functions of CSOs in troubled times for the associative life in the EU . At the same time, a dangerous shrinking of the civic space is taking place in some Member States. Lastly, some of the recommendations in this opinion provide some insights adapted to the needs of the moment, such as the establishment of an EU Ombudsman on civic space freedoms to whom NGOs would report incidents related to any harassment or restric- tion of their work and the one concerning the creation of a \u2018democratic fund\u2019 called by the parliamentary debate \u201cEuropean Values Instrument\u201d .

Cillian Lohan , member of the European Circular Economy Stakeholder Platform , agreed that technology alone would not be enough to drive the transition but rath- er have to work in combination with wide- spread behaviour change. He was convinced that we could \u201cdrive behaviour changes if we offer valuable and affordable alternatives\u201d. Addressing the way we consume would be a key element in terms of what we could achieve in the future. Referring to the necessary transition to a circular econo- my, he said that it appeared \u201ccompelling to move from the concept of con- sumers to the concept of users in terms of over-consumption and waste\u201d. Renate HEINISCH (DE) Federal Association of German Senior Citizens\u2019 Organisations Member of Diversity Europe Group 10 April: European Health Parliament (EHP) debate \u2013 Looking at the future of EU health policy On 24 April Ms Heinisch took part as a speaker in the EHP workshop dedicated to \u2018How to drive the debate with EU policy-makers?\u2019. On that day around 50 young people under 35 years coming from different parts of Europe, with a strong interest in healthcare and in making Europe the best continent in the world in terms of healthcare launched their bold recommendations in the following 5 key areas : \u2022 Outcomes-based Healthcare systems \u2022 Robotics, artificial intelligence and precision medicine \u2022 Antimicrobial resistance \u2022 A health workforce planning \u2022 A European Vaccine Initiative Indr\u0117 VAREIKYT\u0116 (LT) Delegate of the Lithuanian Youth Council (LiJOT) Member of Diversity Europe Group Strategic communication cooperation in response to hybrid threats On 20 April, high-level politicians and representatives of think-tanks, gov- ernmental institutions, international organisations, NGOs, NATO and cy- ber-security organisations from more than 20 countries gathered in Vilnius to discuss strategic communication cooperation in response to hybrid threats . Indr\u0117 Vareikyt\u0117 , an expert on disinformation and hybrid threats, and EESC rapporteur of the information report on \u201cHow media is used to influence social and political processes in the EU and Eastern neighbouring coun- tries\u201d, was invited to the event to share her expertise on the EU\u2019s progress in solving the issue. Major changes in the media market were noted by the speakers: the reve- nues and number of readers/viewers of traditional media are shrink- ing, while digital media is growing . The general view was that raising awareness was the key priority in countering propaganda and fake news. However, there was also widespread understanding that the Western world was at present ill prepared to withstand Russia\u2019s actions in the field of information. It was noted that it was time for major players, international organisations and the media industry (journalists, Facebook, Twitter, etc.) to quickly come to an agreement on what to do to counter these threats. During her speech to the participants at the event, Ms Vareikyt\u0117 empha- sised the need for a comprehensive and robust approach. At the same time, she noted that collaboration between the public and non-governmental sectors \u2013 as a way to create a comprehensive system of resilience so as to counter hybrid threats and information campaigns \u2013 was very important. As one of the best remedies against propaganda and fake news, Ms Vareikyt\u0117 suggested promoting and establishing more alternative sources of information. There are also many cases of bad journalism, and sometimes our reactions to fake news and propaganda are too hysterical. At the same time, there is still a need for all allies to reach a common understanding on hostile disinformation campaigns. Ms Vareikyt\u0117 said that it was time to treat Russia\u2019s actions in the information field as seriously as we treat them in relation to the economy. Reliable information is one of our citizens\u2019 fundamental rights. Therefore, alongside active measures, it is very important to strengthen democracy in general. The biggest assets in countering Russian actions are democracy and truth, even if telling the truth requires more of an effort than lying. One of the ways to limit Russia\u2019s actions is to resolve internal problems by tack- ling the source of these problems and not just their consequences. Concluding her speech, Ms Vareikyt\u0117 underlined that public support was crucial in this context, so as to strengthen our societies\u2019 resilience. Individu- al Member States provide good examples. For example, a case in Lithuania where a fake news story \u2013 about the alleged rape of a Lithuanian girl by two German soldiers from a NATO EFP battalion \u2013 had been effectively dealt with was quoted as an example of good cooperation between StratCom ex- perts, criminal investigators, politicians, the media, and the general public. Nonetheless, while the level of internet literacy among the population is increasing, we are doing nothing to increase the population\u2019s resilience to hostile propaganda. Therefore, media literacy becomes crucially im- portant. Free, accountable and responsible media outlets are the best guarantee that the dissemination of propaganda and fake news will not go unchecked. Media literacy should start at school. Accessible, reliable and independent media outlets are also more effective in pro- moting positive narratives. Europe III ",

Member States have been willing to share health responsibilities whenever they recognise that certain health topics cannot be solved within the borders of one country. In this spirit a single market for pharmaceuti- cals and medical devices has been created. She also stated that we have seen major developments on the public health policy side . \u2018Cross-border health policy in the area of health threats, the establishment of the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC), and the cross-border healthcare Directive are the best examples of how topics need to be ad- dressed at EU level, when health issues do not stop at borders.\u2019 According to her, EU health policy has also become very successful since Member States have focused mainly on their financing of healthcare . The EU has become very helpful in developing concepts that cannot be solved by single Member States alone. Rare diseases for instance, cannot be dealt with by Member States alone. We need to collect all expertise available in order to be able to treat patients with rare diseases. This led to a highly successful EU policy from which Member States now benefit . Ms Heinisch also explained that the European Parliament has been crucial in this policy, in particular by always putting the patients at the centre of its policies. MEPs suggested the involvement of patients during the policy making. With the Orphan Drugs Regulation , we created the regulatory system, with the EMA the scientific body and with the Cross-border Healthcare Directive, we created the idea of European Reference Networks . The na- tional Rare Diseases Plans were developed in the Member States following a Council and Commission initiative. This latter example shows how effective EU health policy can be. Finally, Ms Heinisch stressed on the need to develop a health policy for young people . To her, this topic has been neglected for a long time and de- serves greater attention if we want to keep Europe a prosperous region. 4 th European Congress of Local Governments 26-27 April - ICE Krak\u00f3w Congress Centre, Poland Population ageing is a major issue in many developed countries. Growing num- ber of people at age of \u201c50+\u201d forces local governments tend to undertake new activities, focused on this age group.

During the debate, Ms Heinisch developed the basic principles of the mu- nicipal policy on ageing: \u2022 Municipalities play a key role in determining the quality of life in old age. Only there you find the unique link between volunteer engagement and social networks on the one hand and the provision of particular infra- structural services on the other hand. \u2022 Municipalities should enable older citizens, especially elderly people with disabilities, to lead a self-determined, independent, participa- tory, active and healthy life. They should help to promote a differentiated picture of ageing that reflects both the vulnerability and the potential of old age. This should be implemented on all municipal levels. \u2022 Policy on Ageing is a cross-sectoral task that includes all municipal departments such as urban planning, transportation, outdoor spaces and buildings and economic planning. The following key topics on municipal level have been underlined: \u2022 Health and Long-Term Care \u2022 Housing \u2022 Mobility and Transportation \u2022 Volunteering and Social Participation \u2022 Education and Lifelong Learning \u2022 Digitalization and digital participation Ms Heinisch concluded that policies on ageing should always involve the elderly and allow active participation . Measures that promote an age-friend- ly local environment benefit all age groups in the municipality. ",

IDA is an alliance of eight global and six regional organisations of per- sons with disabilities. IDA advocates at the UN for a more inclusive global environment for persons with disabilities and their organisations. The Con- vention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) is its touchstone. IDA invests in ensuring that the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Develop- ment Goals are inclusive and in line with CRPD and supports organisations of persons with disabilities worldwide to take part in UN and international human rights processes, and use international accountability mechanisms. With member organisations globally, IDA represents the estimated one bil- lion people worldwide with disabilities.

        "Group III Members in the Spotlight playing a key role Social and economic inequalities in the EU Dilyana SLAVOVA (BG) National Coordinator of the Mountain Milk NGO President of REX section Member of Diversity Europe Group The range of inequality levels prevailing in Europe is so wide that it is difficult to consider a \u201csingle European model\u201d. It covers not only the poverty/wealth perspective, rural/urban perspective, but also education, migration, etc. In this article, Dilyana Slavova is focusing on social inequalities. Europe is becoming more unequal, both between and within countries, but there is no one-size-fits-all solution for this. The EU has stopped being a \u2018convergence machine\u2019. Overall, new Member States recorded impressive economic growth after their accession to the EU. For a number of reasons \u2013 in particular relating to changes in the labour market and in redistribution \u2013 income inequality has increased in most European countries during the past three decades. Moreover, the profile of individuals at the bottom of the income distribution has also changed: The most vulnerable are no longer the elderly, but rather young people and families with children. The deep economic crisis and the often mild recovery in many European countries have been associated with stabilisation, if not a further increase in income inequality. In all European countries, tax and transfer policies are contributing significantly to reducing market income inequality, but some welfare systems manage that redistribution better than others. So, income inequality remains at an all-time high. The following data is from the OECD\u2019s research on social inequalities in the EU. In the 1980s, the average income of the richest 10% was seven times higher than that of the poorest 10%; today, it is around 9 \u00bd times higher. The economic recovery has not reversed the long-term trend towards increasing income inequality. The distribution of wealth is even more unequal than that of income. The 10% of wealthiest households hold 50% of total wealth; the 40% least wealthy own little over 3%. The post-crisis job gaps are closing on average in Europe, but there are still 1.4 million fewer jobs in the EU in 2015 compared with 2007. Major inequalities remain across countries in terms of overall employment, with unemployment rates reaching 24% in Greece versus 4% in Iceland. Inequalities in terms of type of job, such the share of part-time or temporary employment, are also large in Europe. The Nordic countries are among the most equal European countries, but Central European countries like Slovenia and the Czech and Slovak Republics also have lower levels of income inequality. Western European countries, such as France, Germany and the Netherlands, are close to the European average, while the level of income inequality is above average in all Southern European countries. The highest levels of income inequality in Europe are reached in the United Kingdom and the Baltic States. Inequality in Europe is generally lower than in many non-European countries. Gender gaps in employment and earnings have declined in most countries in the EU, but at 9.8% and 12.8% respectively they persist \u2013 and women are still disadvantaged in terms of the type of job and occupation they hold. Low-skilled youth who are disconnected from both employment and learning represent 17% of 15-29 year-olds in the EU, and risk being permanently left behind in the labour market. There is a gap in education outcomes among individuals with different parental socio-economic backgrounds. A child from an advantaged socio- economic background will score on average 20% higher in mathematics than a child from a disadvantaged background. There are close links between socio-economic backgrounds and education and health outcomes. Men with lower levels of education have 2.7 years less life expectancy than the better educated, and women, 1.2 years. Immigrants tend to have lower outcomes in terms of the labour market or incomes than the native-born in most areas; 36% have a low level of education, against 25% of native-born; 64.8% are in employment, as opposed to 66.3% of the native-born. Those in employment are twice as likely as their native-born peers to live below the poverty line. Native-born children of immigrants raised and educated in the host country face persistent disadvantages compared with children of native- born parents. In the EU, the youth unemployment rate among native- born immigrant offspring is almost 50% higher than among the young with native-born parents. In non-EU OECD countries, the rates for the two groups are similar. What next? The EU should encourage and support the Member States in developing policy packages that contribute to growing cohesion both within and between countries. Such \u2018dual-use\u2019 policy packages do exist: education offers a telling example. Upward convergence in the quality of our human capital is a key condition for long-term upward convergence in prosperity and well-being across the EU. Currently, the EU is deeply affected by a human capital divide, both between and within the Member States. Hence, reducing background inequalities between families with children and investing in child care and education contribute both to national cohesion and to long-term EU-wide convergence. Obviously, creating greater access to success in education for all children is not just a question of money; it also requires reforms in the education system in many Member States. Governments pursuing such a strategy deserve encouragement and opportunities to learn from other EU governments, but also tangible support from the EU. We need more \u2018solidarity in reform\u2019. There is a growing awareness that we need to organise more solidarity in the EU, as witnessed by the recent Five Presidents\u2019 Report on the future of the Eurozone and the refugee crisis. The EU should provide a framework that reconciles openness and mobility with domestic social cohesion; it should support national welfare states at a systemic level in some of their key functions; it should guide the substantive development of national welfare states by indicating general social standards and objectives and organise mutual learning processes, but leave ways and means to the Member States.

The intervention of such a fund should make full use of the experience and capacity of civil society organisations by granting them a leading role in programming, implementation, monitoring and evaluation \u2022 considers cooperation between the national bodies managing the funds and the partner organisations to be of key importance \u2022 advocates strengthening the technical and organisational capacity of Eu- ropean networks of organisations working to combat poverty and social exclusion. \u2022 calls on the Member States to make greater use of global grants, regrant- ing and treatment - where possible - of in-kind contributions on the same footing as financial contributions. \u2022 declares its readiness to set up a small ad hoc group composed of EESC members and relevant European level civil society platforms which would contribute to better coordination of ESF and FEAD interventions and to the discussion of the basic principles of a future integrated EU fund aimed at combating poverty and social exclusion. \u2022 considers cooperation with the Committee of the Regions to be essential. Toni VIDAN (HR) Romanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry Member of Diversity Europe Group TEN/657 - Third report on the State of the Energy Union The EESC \u2022 strongly supports the idea of a European Energy Union and would like to stress that the Energy Union offers opportunities to make Europe more democratic, more cohesive, more competitive, and more just. \u2022 deems it important to set more ambitious targets , especially in view of the Paris Agreement , to include a long-term perspective for the Energy Union until 2050 , to ensure that civil society is effectively involved in the production of energy transition plans at different levels, and to assess and address not only technical but also market and institutional barriers pre- venting the general public, consumers, communities, and SMEs from partic- ipating and benefitting fully from the clean energy transition A range of institutional innovations are therefore proposed by the Committee, ranging from a Social Pact for a Citizens-driven Energy Transition and a Europe- an Energy Information Service to a European Energy Transition Adjustment Fund and a Green Erasmus Pro . Baiba MILTOVI\u010cA (LV) International and EU Affairs Adviser of the Latvian Nation- al Association for Consumer Protection (LPIAA) Vice-President of Diversity Europe Group TEN/653 - Amending the Internal Gas Market Directive The European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) welcomes and sup- ports the intention behind the European Commission\u2019s proposal for an amendment of the Gas Market Directive (2009/73/EC) to fill a legal void left behind by the original Directive, namely that the common rules for the internal gas market also apply to the interconnectors of pipelines from and to third countries. The amendment is to improve market integration and security of gas supply . The EESC has \u2013 in the past \u2013 frequently emphasised the importance of clear, consistent and effective governance for the Energy Union. However, it should be noted that the Committee would like to raise awareness con- cerning the political sensitivities linked to this proposal and also takes issue with some of the substantive and procedural aspects of it . The po- litical sensitivities are linked to the trade-off between the Member States\u2019 ability to pursue their own national interests in the context of energy supply and security on the one side, and the need for the application of clear and consistent regulatory principles to the Single Market on the other side. This trade-off is to be mitigated through the possibility granted to Mem- ber States for derogations from regulations. As a result of this, the EESC is concerned that the proposal may not create the legal certainty investors require. In view of the political sensitivities and potential legal challeng- es, the Committee regrets that the Commission has not undertaken a com- prehensive impact assessment. It should also be noted that an important consequence of this proposal could be to activate serious consideration of firstly, the increasing dependence of the EU on Russian gas and the use of this energy source as a lever in foreign policy issues and secondly of the danger of locking-in commitment to a fossil fuel because of the need for pay-back on high-cost infrastructure .
