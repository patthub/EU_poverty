Poland\u2019s ranking has dropped by nine places since 2010. Best performance Poland\u2019s scores are highest in the domains of health (83.1 points) and money (75.5 points).

The Index uses a scale of 1 to 100, where 1 is for total inequality and 100 is for total equality . The scores are based on the gaps between women and men and levels of achievement in six core domains \u2013 work, money, knowledge, time, power and health \u2013 and their subdomains. Two additional domains are included in the Index but do not have an impact on the final score. The domain of intersecting inequalities highlights how gender inequalities manifest in combination with age, (dis)ability, country of birth, education and family type. The domain of violence against women measures and analyses women\u2019s experiences of violence. The Index is composed of 31 indicators . The Gender Equality Index 2020 also includes a thematic focus on digitalisation and the future of work . About the Index ",

        "Violence Why is there no score for the violence domain? There is no new data to update the score for violence, which is why no figure is given. Eurostat is currently coordinat- ing an EU-wide survey on gender-based violence, with results expected in 2023. EIGE will launch a second round of administrative data collection on intimate partner violence, rape and femicide in 2022. Both data sources will be used to update the domain of violence in the Gender Equality Index 2024. Unlike the other domains of the Index, the domain of violence does not measure differences between women\u2019s and men\u2019s situations; rather, it examines women\u2019s experiences of violence (prevalence, severity and disclosure). The overall objective is not to reduce the gaps in violence between women and men, but to eradicate violence completely. Istanbul Convention: state of play The Istanbul Convention is the most comprehensive international human rights treaty on violence against women and do- mestic violence. Poland signed the Istanbul Convention in December 2012 and ratified it in April 2015. The treaty entered into force in August 2015. Data gaps mask the true scale of violence. The EU needs comprehensive, up-to-date and comparable data to develop effective policies that combat violence against women. Thematic focus on digitalisation and the future of work The Gender Equality Index 2020 focuses on digitalisation and the future of work. The thematic focus looks at three areas: y use and development of digital skills and technologies; y digital transformation of the world of work (segregation, working conditions, work\u2013life balance); y broader consequences of digitalisation for human rights, violence against women, and caring activities. During the COVID-19 lockdowns, women in violent relationships were stuck at home and exposed to their abus- er for long periods of time, putting them at greater risk of domestic violence. Even without a pandemic, women face the greatest danger from people they know.
