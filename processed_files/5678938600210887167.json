        "PE-CONS 6/1/16 REV 1 3 EN (3) Since 2002 the Union has been negotiating EPAs with the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group of States in the form of seven regions comprising the Caribbean, Central Africa, Eastern and Southern Africa, the East African Community, the Pacific Island States, the South African Development Community and West Africa. Such EPAs have to be consistent with World Trade Organisation (WTO) obligations, support regional integration and promote the gradual integration of the ACP economies into the rules-based world trading system, thereby fostering their sustainable development and contributing to the overall effort to eradicate poverty and to enhance living conditions in the ACP States. At the first stage, negotiations may be concluded on agreements leading to the establishment of EPAs covering, as a minimum requirement, WTO-compatible goods arrangements consistent with regional economic and political integration processes, to be complemented as soon as possible by complete EPAs. (4) Those agreements establishing, or leading to the establishment of, EPAs for which negotiations have been concluded provide that the parties may take steps to apply the agreement, before provisional application on a mutual basis, to the extent feasible. It is appropriate to take action to apply the agreements on the basis of those provisions. (5) The arrangements included in this Regulation are to be amended, as necessary, in accordance with the agreements establishing, or leading to the establishment of, EPAs, as and when such agreements are signed and concluded pursuant to Article 218 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and are either provisionally applied or in force. The arrangements are to be terminated in whole or in part if the agreements in question do not enter into force within a reasonable period of time in accordance with the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. ",
        "PE-CONS 6/1/16 REV 1 4 EN (6) For imports into the Union, the arrangements in the agreements establishing, or leading to the establishment of, EPAs should provide for duty-free access and no tariff-rate quotas for all products with the exception of arms. Those arrangements are subject to transitional periods and arrangements for certain sensitive products and specific arrangements for the French overseas departments. Given the specific nature of the case of South Africa, products originating in South Africa should continue to benefit from the relevant provisions of the Agreement on Trade, Development and Cooperation between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of South Africa, of the other part 1 , as amended (\u2018the TDCA\u2019), until such time as an agreement establishing, or leading to the establishment of, an EPA enters into force between the Union and South Africa. (7) The rules of origin applicable to imports made under this Regulation should for a transitional period be those laid down in Annex II. Those rules of origin should be superseded by those annexed to any agreement with the regions or states listed in Annex I when that agreement is either provisionally applied, or enters into force, whichever is the earliest. (8) It is necessary to provide for the possibility of temporarily suspending the arrangements set out in this Regulation in the event of a failure to provide administrative cooperation or of irregularities or fraud. Where a Member State provides information to the Commission concerning possible fraud or failure to provide administrative cooperation, the relevant Union legislation should apply, in particular Council Regulation (EC) No 515/97 2 . 1 OJ L 311, 4.12.1999, p. 3. 2 Council Regulation (EC) No 515/97 of 13 March 1997 on mutual assistance between the administrative authorities of the Member States and cooperation between the latter and the Commission to ensure the correct application of the law on customs and agricultural matters (OJ L 82, 22.3.1997, p. 1).

        "PE-CONS 6/1/16 REV 1 5 EN (9) It is also appropriate to provide for general safeguard measures for the products covered by this Regulation. (10) In view of the particular sensitivity of agricultural products, it is appropriate to allow safeguard measures to be taken when imports cause or threaten to cause disturbances in the markets for such products or disturbances in the mechanisms regulating those markets. (11) In accordance with Article 349 TFEU, due account should be taken in all Union policies, in particular in customs and trade policies, of the particular structural, social and economic situations of the outermost regions of the Union. (12) Special account should therefore be taken both of the sensitivity of agricultural products, especially sugar, and of the particular vulnerability and interests of the outermost regions of the Union when laying down the rules on safeguards in an effective manner. (13) Article 134 of the Treaty establishing the European Community was deleted by the Treaty of Lisbon without being replaced with an equivalent Article in the Treaty on European Union or the TFEU. The reference to that Article in Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 should therefore be omitted. ",

Moreover, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of adding an Annex to this Regulation which sets out the regime applicable to products originating in South Africa once the relevant trade provisions of the TDCA have been superseded by the relevant provisions of an agreement establishing, or leading to the establishment of, an EPA. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making 1 . In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States\u2019 experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.

Note 2: 1. The first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column gives the heading number or chapter number used in the Harmonised System and the second column gives the description of goods used in that system for that heading or chapter. For each entry in the first two columns a rule is specified in column 3 or 4. Where, in some cases, the entry in the first column is preceded by an \u2018ex\u2019, this signifies that the rules in column 3 or 4 apply only to the part of that heading as described in column 2. 2. Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter number is given and the description of products in column 2 is therefore given in general terms, the adjacent rules in column 3 or 4 apply to all products which, under the Harmonised System, are classified in headings of the chapter or in any of the headings grouped together in column 1. 3. Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading, each indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered by the adjacent rules in column 3 or 4. ",
        "PE-CONS 6/1/16 REV 1 47 ANNEX II EN 4. Where, for an entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in both columns 3 and 4, the exporter may opt to apply either the rule set out in column 3 or that set out in column 4. If no origin rule is given in column 4, the rule set out in column 3 has to be applied. Note 3: 1. The provisions of Article 4 of this Annex concerning products having acquired originating status which are used in the manufacture of other products apply regardless of whether that status has been acquired inside the factory where those products are used or in another factory in the Union or in the ACP States. Example: An engine of heading 8407, for which the rule states that the value of the non-originating materials which may be incorporated may not exceed 40 % of the ex-works price, is made from \u2018other alloy steel roughly shaped by forging\u2019 of heading ex 7224. If that forging has been forged in the Union from a non-originating ingot, it has already acquired originating status by virtue of the rule for heading ex 7224 in the list. The forging can then count as originating in the value calculation for the engine regardless of whether it was produced in the same factory or in another factory in the Union. The value of the non-originating ingot is thus not taken into account when adding up the value of the non-originating materials used. ",
        "PE-CONS 6/1/16 REV 1 48 ANNEX II EN 2. The rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or processing required and the carrying out of more working or processing also confers originating status; conversely, the carrying out of less working or processing cannot confer originating status. Therefore, if a rule provides that non-originating material at a certain level of manufacture may be used, the use of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed and the use of such material at a later stage is not. 3. Without prejudice to Note 3.2, where a rule states that \u2018materials of any heading\u2019 may be used, materials of the same heading as the product may also be used, subject, however, to any specific limitations which may also be contained in the rule. However, the expression \u2018manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of heading \u2026\u2019 means that only materials classified in the same heading as the product of a description other than that of the product as given in column 2 of the list may be used. 4. When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one material, this means that one or more materials may be used. It does not require that all be used. Example: The rule for fabrics of headings 5208 to 5212 provides that natural fibres may be used and those chemical materials, among other materials, may also be used. This does not mean that both have to be used; it is possible to use one or the other or both. 5. Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular material, the condition does not prevent the use of other materials which, because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy the rule. (See also Note 6.3 below in relation to textiles). ",
        "PE-CONS 6/1/16 REV 1 49 ANNEX II EN Example: The rule for prepared foods of heading 1904 which specifically excludes the use of cereals and their derivatives does not prevent the use of mineral salts, chemicals and other additives which are not produced from cereals. However, this does not apply to products which, although they cannot be manufactured from the particular materials specified in the list, can be produced from a material of the same nature at an earlier stage of manufacture. Example: In the case of an article of apparel of ex Chapter 62 made from non-woven materials, if the use of only non-originating yarn is allowed for this class of article, it is not possible to start from non-woven cloth \u2014 even if non-woven cloths cannot normally be made from yarn. In such cases, the starting material would normally be at the stage before yarn \u2014 that is the fibre stage. 6. Where, in a rule in the list, two percentages are given for the maximum value of non-originating materials that can be used, then those percentages may not be added together. In other words, the maximum value of all the non-originating materials used may never exceed the higher of the percentages given. Furthermore, the individual percentages must not be exceeded in relation to the particular materials to which they apply. ",
        "PE-CONS 6/1/16 REV 1 50 ANNEX II EN Note 4: 1. The term \u2018natural fibres\u2019 is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or synthetic fibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including waste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres that have been carded, combed or otherwise processed but not spun. 2. The term \u2018natural fibres\u2019 includes horsehair of heading 0503, silk of headings 5002 and 5003 as well as the wool fibres, fine or coarse animal hair of headings 5101 to 5105, the cotton fibres of headings 5201 to 5203 and the other vegetable fibres of headings 5301 to 5305. 3. The terms \u2018textile pulp\u2019, \u2018chemical materials\u2019 and \u2018paper-making materials\u2019 are used in the list to describe the materials not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns. 4. The term \u2018man-made staple fibres\u2019 is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of headings 5501 to 5507. Note 5: 1.
