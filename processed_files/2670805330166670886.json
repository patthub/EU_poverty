        "Summary Report EFSA Scientific Colloquium 5, 21-22 March 2006 - Parma, Italy 5. About EFSA The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) was established and funded by the European Community as an independent agency in 2002 following a series of food scares that caused the European public to voice concerns about food safety and the ability of regulatory authorities to fully protect consumers. In close collaboration with national authorities and in open consultation with its stakeholders, EFSA provides objective scientific advice on all matters with a direct or indirect impact on food and feed safety, including animal health and welfare and plant protection. EFSA is also consulted on nutrition in relation to Community legislation. EFSA\u2019s work falls into two areas: risk assessment and risk communication. In particular, EFSA\u2019s risk assessments provide risk managers (EU institutions with political accountability, i.e. the European Commission, European Parliament and Council) with a sound scientific basis for defining policy-driven legislative or regulatory measures required to ensure a high level of consumer protection with regards to food and feed safety. EFSA communicates to the public in an open and transparent way on all matters within its remit. Collection and analysis of scientific data, identification of emerging risks and scientific support to the Commission, particularly in case of a food crisis, are also part of EFSA\u2019s mandate, as laid down in the founding Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of 28 January 2002.

        "I INTROdUCTION ANd STRUCTURE OF ThE COLLOQUIUM Summary Report EFSA Scientific Colloquium 5, 21-22 March 2006 - Parma, Italy 9. EFSA Science Colloquia aim to achieve a better understanding of the fundamental scientific issues related to risk assessment on food and feed and are therefore organised in a way to provide ample opportunity for an interactive exchange of expert views. To that end the Science Colloquia are sufficiently informal to allow for substantial debates if needed. However, at the same time, they are adequately structured and managed to enable participants to reach conclusions and make recommendations, as appropriate. The meeting on the development of food-based dietary guidelines was the fifth in this series of Science Colloquia. EFSA has been asked by the European Commission to provide guidance for the translation of nutrient-based recommendations for a healthy diet into food-based recommendations. Before addressing this question by the EFSA scientific panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA), it was felt useful to organize a colloquium with scientists at the academic, regulatory and private sector levels to have an open scientific debate on the state-of-the-art of scientific approaches for developing food-based dietary guidelines (FBDG). The colloquium had the following objectives: \ue045 to discuss the state-of-the-art of scientific approaches for the development of FBDG; \ue045 to review the advantages and limitations of various approaches for the development of FBDG; and \ue045 to provide some conclusions which could be considered by the NDA Panel for developing guidance on suitable approaches for the translation of nutrient- based dietary advice into food-based dietary recommendations. Around 70 participants representing relevant expertise in the field participated in an interactive exchange of expert views (see annex 1 and 2 for the programme and list of participants). After some introductory presentations providing an overview of FBDG and examples of their use in various countries (presentations are attached as annex 3), participants were split up in small discussion groups (DG) to debate various aspects of the development of FBDG and reported back to the plenary session. The discussion group themes and questions were as follows: ",

        "The following chapter provides an introduction to FBDG and summarises experience with FBDG made by some countries. what are Food-Based dietary Guidelines and what are they meant for? FBDG are described by the World Health Organization (WHO, 1996) as follows. They are: \ue045 the expression of the principles of nutrition education mostly as foods; \ue045 intended for use by individual members of the general public; and \ue045 written in language that avoids, as far as possible, the technical terms of nutritional science (if not expressed entirely as foods). It is important to emphasize a few points that are always coming up in discussions about FBDG: \ue045 nutrient-based guidelines and food-based guidelines should give a consistent message. The recommended amounts of nutrients as recommended in nutrient-based guidelines should ideally be provided by the foods and amounts of foods recommended in the food-based guidelines; \ue045 the foods that are consumed by individual consumers are to a large extent determined by culture and tradition. This means that FBDG can certainly not be developed on a European level but at most on a national level, and even there specific groups may have to be taken into account. Experiences with FBdG The first FBDG date from around 1950. Since then many attempts for improvement have been made. An important milestone was the 1996 WHO/FAO expert report. Its conclusions and the scheme to develop FBDG are still the basis of subsequent discussions: \ue045 FBDG will vary among population groups. \ue045 More than one dietary pattern is consistent with health. \ue045 It is important to develop food-based strategies that are locally appropriate. \ue045 Bodies responsible for developing dietary guidelines are encouraged to integrate the FBDG-messages with other policies related to health promotion ( e.g. those concerning smoking, physical activity and alcohol consumption).

        "\ue045 It is recommended that dietary guidelines be based on, and aim to improve, current dietary practices and prevailing diet-related public health problems, rather than be based on nutrient requirements and recommended intake levels. \ue045 Foods make up diets and are more than a collection of nutrients. \ue045 Food processing and preparation influence the nutritional value of foods. \ue045 Food components may have biological functions that science has not yet identified. The report also gave suggestions for the steps to be taken for development of FBDG: \ue045 Form a working group from relevant stakeholder groups. \ue045 Consult technical experts on food availability, food intake patterns and nutrition related diseases. \ue045 Identify the major nutrition related health problems for which dietary guidelines are useful. \ue045 Draft a set of FBDG and prepare background statements for each FBDG and critically review them with experts and stakeholders. Promoting appropriate diets and lifestyles was one of the 9 action-oriented strategies formulated in the 1992 ICN Plan for Action in Nutrition. In 2005 the WHO reported that 75 countries, of which 33 in Europe, had developed FBDG. WHO also emphasizes cultural and social messages, e.g. : \ue045 enjoy your meals; \ue045 start your day with breakfast; \ue045 make mealtime a social time; \ue045 enjoy meals with all members of the family; \ue045 eat a variety of foods every day. The complexity of the FBDG is highlighted by the fact that even with a unanimously agreed advice on fruit and vegetables, 43 out of 50 recommendations on fruit and vegetables are different, and only 7 are the same ( i.e. eat plenty of). 1\u0018.

        "Translating scientific data into FBdG The US, which has a long history in the field, uses a very systematic approach to develop dietary guidelines. First a scientific report is developed by a committee appointed jointly by the Departments of Health and Agriculture. The systematic scientific review is based on peer-reviewed publications with the primary focus on human studies. The report is published after stakeholders and the public have been given the chance to comment. From the scientific review a policy document is developed. Translation into FBDG is carried out with the help of: \ue045 comparisons of usual intake from national surveys to the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) or Adequate Intake (AI) to identify shortfall nutrients; \ue045 the proposed USDA food pattern and technical support data; \ue045 food pattern modelling ( e.g. increased amounts of fish, whole grains substituted for enriched grains, and varying levels of fat). A recent example of FBDG in Europe is found in Sweden. The main starting points of the exercise were that they should: \ue045 reflect Swedish dietary habits and mixed diets; \ue045 be applicable for healthy adults between 19 and 60 years of age; \ue045 attain the recommendations of the Swedish Nutrition Recommendations; \ue045 be relevant for individuals with moderate physical activity; \ue045 have as few changes as possible compared to previous guidelines; and \ue045 allow all types of food. The Swedish Nutrition Recommendations contain, apart from the common recommendations on macro- and micronutrients, messages about meal patterns, variation, energy balance and physical activity that already form a starting point for FBDG. The Swedish Nutrition Recommendations Objectified (SNO) form the basis of the \u201c5 dietary advice\u201d which in effect is a FBDG. To develop SNO the representative choice of foods, average portion sizes and consumption frequencies at the food group level and the exchangeability at the food group level were investigated in a 4 week-menu. Difficulties with respect to nutrient composition arose for protein-iron (for women of childbearing age), the balance between saturated and unsaturated fat and sodium.

        "An example of the outcome is shown in the figure below. A special case of FBDG development for children took place in Germany. Starting point was the characteristics of the present diets of children and adolescents, and the recommended nutrient densities which turned out to be similar for all age groups. In the subsequent development, scientific and practical criteria were combined, as illustrated in the figure below. 1\u0018.

        "discussion group 1: developing FBdG from nutrient recommendations There are some inherent problems in establishing nutrient goals for individuals, which have to be solved: nutrient recommendations are meant for populations and not for individuals, and may contain fixed values for single nutrients and ranges for macronutrients. It is not easy to combine nutrient recommendations with a balanced diet, because one has to combine intake data, composition data, recommendations and eating patterns for individuals within a population. Further, one has to identify critical nutrients for health outcomes and nutrition related disorders. In order to define key nutrients that may constitute a risk for deficiency or excess, national intake data need to be compared to recommended intakes. Basically, key public health issues should be identified and the scientific links between nutrients and health should be established. There are also many inherent problems in selecting the critical nutrients for health outcomes and nutrition related disorders. Apart from methodological errors, particularly under-reporting, in collecting nutrient data, there are the problems with a small \u201dwindow\u201c of intake for some nutrients ( e.g. iodine, selenium), frequency vs. quantity of intake ( e.g . sugar and the risk of dental caries), effects of foods vs. meals ( e.g. glycemic indices may be different), the effect of the intake of fat and sugar on nutrient density, and the impact of physical activity on energy intake. In order to select energy intake levels, it is essential to consider overall energy density, nutrient density of the diet, portion sizes and the frequency of food consumption. Physical activity levels are also important in this context, for instance a low physical activity level will affect FBDG and make it more difficult to achieve nutrient intakes in line with recommendations. It is essential to have a monitoring system in place with adequate food composition data and with an adequate number of days surveyed for adequate population groups ( e.g. socio-economic strata, children, adolescents, and very old people). Even with an adequate system, there will be inaccuracies in collecting data for identifying the achievement of nutrient goals, e.g. difficulties in including foods consumed outside home.

        "In concordance with the problems highlighted, the group came up with the following conclusions and recommendations. In order to translate nutrient goals into food goals, it is necessary to : \ue045 compare the distribution of requirements for priority nutrients with distribution of intakes; \ue045 identify food and lifestyle patterns compatible with nutrient recommendations; \ue045 identify key foods contributing to nutrient intakes in the population and in those who achieve the nutrient goals; \ue045 consider the nutritional, microbiological and toxicological quality of foods; \ue045 make sure that the recommended foods are affordable, available and accessible to most people; \ue045 avoid radical changes in current dietary practices; \ue045 make use of modelling techniques; \ue045 combine recommendations, composition data, intake data and intake patterns. To identify dietary patterns associated with the achievement of nutrient goals, one will need: \ue045 adequate food intake data that represent habitual individual intake across all age groups; \ue045 up-to-date food composition data; \ue045 data on the effect of socioeconomic factors and the price of food on food intake distribution; \ue045 an adequate monitoring system, and repeated nutrition and risk factor surveillance. 20. Summary Report EFSA Scientific Colloquium 5, 21-22 March 2006 - Parma, Italy ",
        "discussion group 2: developing FBdG from epidemiology Epidemiology is highly relevant for the development of FBDG, because it enables us to understand the effect of nutrients, foods, food groups and food patterns on health and disease. The group differentiated between descriptive and analytical epidemiology. For both approaches, critical assessment of methodology is essential. Descriptive approaches are necessary for the assessment of dietary exposure and disease patterns. They may also be relevant for specific population groups. Analytical epidemiology applies to foods, food groups and nutrients. All types of studies (from ecological to intervention) may be used, but the weight of each type of study has to be critically assessed. The strength of the evidence must be evaluated by considering the strength of the association, repeatability and generalisability, and also the criteria of causality. The risk of confounding is always present and has to be accounted for. The group came to the following conclusions: \ue045 Combination of the evidence on multiple exposures and outcomes provides information on the association between diet and disease risk. \ue045 To balance risks and benefits methodologies of risk-benefit analyses in nutritional epidemiology and impact measures ( e.g. population attributable risk) for realistically achievable dietary goals under different scenarios must be incorporated. \ue045 The consequences of replacing particular food groups with others must be evaluated and existing food patterns (taking account of regional situation, physiological state, population group) must be taken into account. \ue045 To underpin the epidemiology, there is a need to quantitatively assess determinants of food choices ( e.g. meal patterns, availability of food).

        "discussion group 3: determinants of food choice and dietary behaviour Food choice and dietary behaviour are determined by a multitude of factors, which act at different points during life, both at individual and population levels. \ue045 The individual level Important determinants are biological (such as age, gender, health status, and genetic make-up), socioeconomic, cultural and tradition-related, and those related to the family, friends and the local community. Moreover, personal attributes such as self-efficacy, self-esteem, knowledge, skills and attitudes will be of influence. \ue045 The population level Determinants include the availability of healthy (and unhealthy) foods and accessibility in terms of cost and price. Marketing and advertising, food labelling and education in the use of food labels are also important determinants and will depend on a public health policy and its implementation. Therefore, to influence food choice it must be recognized that determinants are multifactorial and multisectorial, and that positive changes in food choice require action within all sectors in a society, including government, education, workplaces, communities, families and individuals within these families. Consequently, to obtain a positive change in food choice, various issues need to be addressed: \ue045 \u201cmicro-issues\u201d (belonging to the personal domain), such as health status, taste, beliefs ( e.g. on food safety) and concerns ( e.g. body image); \ue045 \u201cmacro-issues\u201d, such as improved availability and access to healthy foods, promotion of healthy choices (pleasant, easy and desirable). Children and their dietary habits need special attention and means should be developed to make the healthy choice the preferred choice for children in all settings. Regulation of food labelling and marketing particularly for foods appealing to children. Furthermore, it is necessary to build a public policy that supports and promotes healthy eating habits, for instance maternal leave for breastfeeding and recognition of the value of parenting and its demands for time. Critical periods in life for the acquisition of healthy eating habits are periods of growth and development, i.e. , childhood and adolescence, and changes in dietary 22. Summary Report EFSA Scientific Colloquium 5, 21-22 March 2006 - Parma, Italy ",
        "behaviour will mostly occur in periods with major life changes, such as pregnancy, parenting and sometimes illness. Besides the necessity of collecting good and reliable food intake data covering whole populations, there is a need for obtaining data on determinants that influence food choice. Dietary behaviour is not stable as evidenced by the large shifts in food choice that have taken place, particularly within food groups. However, shifts between food groups are more seldom achieved. It would therefore be a good idea for the food industry to provide healthier food versions within food groups and for the political system to support such measures. The group came up with following proposals to change food choice and dietary behaviour: \ue045 Educational efforts concerning the nature, importance and preparation of foods and meals. \ue045 Portion sizes have increased in recent 10 years; therefore the availability of smaller portion sizes at competitive prices is important. \ue045 Increased availability and accessibility to healthy versions of foods and of healthy foods that are easy to prepare. \ue045 Consumer-friendly labelling. \ue045 FBDG approved by the political system and by all stakeholders, which are validated for practicability and efficiency and which are implemented in concerted actions. FBDG development should be an iterative process. Special efforts are needed to reach those consumers who for social or other reasons are difficult to reach and often have poor dietary habits. discussion group \u0018: FBdG for different population groups with a special emphasis on children and the elderly The discussion group worked according to the figure represented below. In step 1, groups were identified and justified according to nutritional needs; in step 2 according to management needs; and in step 3 according to communication needs: Summary Report EFSA Scientific Colloquium 5, 21-22 March 2006 - Parma, Italy 23. Summary of discussion results ",
        "Step 1 approaches are scientifically based and follow similar routes for different population groups. In step 2 and 3, important differences play a role. For example in addressing elderly people, different approaches (depending on housing situation and degree of independence) may be followed: via charities for elderly populations, via the catering community, via general practitioners, day centres, pharmacies, supermarkets, catering in the institutions or dieticians. Similarly for pregnant and lactating women, management and communication routes via school programmes, pharmacies (predictor test), family planning centres, work place programmes or supermarkets (leaflets) may be used. For infants routes via paediatricians, nursery schools, local community centres and home support were suggested. 2\u0018.

        "Iv GENERAL dISCUSSION ANd CONCLUSION Several issues, particularly with respect to procurement of food intake data, methods for developing FBDG and how to communicate FBDG to the population or to different segments of the population, were raised during the general discussion. Two approaches for dealing with FBDG were discussed. One approach is to start with the most important nutrition related health issues, and then derive the FBDG that is likely to address the targeted health issues best. Indeed, most current nutrition recommendations consider public health significance. Another approach is to start with nutrient recommendations and make sure that they are fulfilled in FBDG. Both approaches should be considered as they both have their strengths and limitations depending on the aims and underlying scientific data. With today\u2019s rapid increase in overweight and obesity globally, we must acknowledge that energy density, portion size and frequency of consumption are crucial issues. FBDG should therefore include these aspects. The question was raised if the FBDG should be on the basis of a recommended physical activity level or on the basis of habitual low physical activity level. In other words should we adjust FBDG to the low and decreasing physical activity levels in most affluent societies or should we make FBDG on the basis of a recommended and higher physical activity level. The last-mentioned approach will increase energy allowance and give room for more foods, including discretionary foods. No unanimous conclusion was reached. There are several scientific approaches to collect information on food and health. Basically this information derives from observational and from intervention studies. Epidemiological studies, descriptive as well as analytical, are an expedient and relevant way of getting reliable large-scale data, which can be used as a tool for developing FBDG. However, there are inherent limitations depending on dietary assessment methods with respect to e.g. establishing amounts and portion sizes. Implementation and communication are important aspects of FBDG. FBDG, which are not implemented and effectively communicated to the target group are essentially worthless. Communication should be consistent and the messages should be understandable and workable for the target groups. FBDG should principally only convey \u201cpositive\u201d messages to the population (\u201ceat more\u201d; \u201cfeel better\u201d; \u201creplace\u201d) instead of \u201cnegative\u201d messages (\u201ceat less\u201d; Summary Report EFSA Scientific Colloquium 5, 21-22 March 2006 - Parma, Italy 25. ",
        "\u201creduce disease risk\u201d), since positive messages are more likely to create a positive attitude. FBDG further should receive broad recognition from all stakeholders for instance through partnerships. The important, potentially very helpful, role of industry in communicating the FBDG is part of this. A strong partnership including industry would also ensure that labelling of foods and the use of health claims would be in accordance with and contribute to the fulfilling of FBDG In conclusion, the colloquium covered all relevant aspects of the development of FBDG. It became clear that the 1996 WHO/FAO document is still a good basis for discussion also in 2006. Implementation of FBDG remains a critical part. Evaluation of the success of FBDG that have been introduced is essential to make further progress. 2\u0018. Summary Report EFSA Scientific Colloquium 5, 21-22 March 2006 - Parma, Italy ",

        "ICN Plan of Action \ue045 Included among its strategies \u201dpromoting appropriate diets and healthy lifestyles\u201d and calls on governments: on the basis of energy and nutrient recommendations to provide advice to the public by disseminating, through the use of mass media and other appropriate means, qualitative and/or quantitative dietary guidelines relevant for different age groups and lifestyles and appropriate for the country\u2019s population. (WHO, 1998) RNIs, dietary guidelines, goals and targets dietary guidelines in relation to other systems of nutritional recommendations and goals Recommended nutrient intakes (RNIs) are also known, in different countries, as recommended dietary allowances (RDAs), recommended dietary intakes (RDIs), dietary reference values (RDVs) or population reference intakes. They are authoritative, quantitative estimates of human requirements for essential nutrients, usually set out with different amounts (in weight/day) considered to be adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of practically all healthy people. Dietary guidelines are sets of advisory statements that give dietary advice for the population in order to promote overall nutritional wellbeing and to address all diet-related conditions. They have usually been expressed in technical nutritional terms, but some guidelines have been expressed as food groups. Dietary guidelines differ from RNIs in that the advice is more provisional, being based on a variety of information, including indirect evidence about the complex relationship of food components with health and disease. Dietary guidelines are broad targets for which people can aim, while RNIs indicate what should be consumed on average each day. Dietary goals are desirable food intakes that support optimal nutrition and health. Dietary goals can be used for planning, often over the long term, at the national level rather than as the basis for providing advice for individuals. They are usually expressed in terms of average national intakes. Dietary (or nutritional) targets are specific desirable points to be achieved along the path towards meeting national dietary goals in an overall health policy context. Dietary targets should be expressed easily quantified terms so that monitoring of their achievement is possible.

The group also evaluates the general food production and supply situation by considering current practices, subsidies and other governmental policies and problems, to see whether FBDGs can be implemented in the present situation. \ue045 A set of draft FBDGs is formulated. \ue045 Background statements for each FBDG are prepared, and each statement is circulated to all group members. \ue045 The working group or committee meets again and each background statement is critically reviewed and revised. The wording of guideline statements is pilot tested with consumer groups, revised as needed and carefully checked. \ue045 The background statements are finalized, consolidated and sent to interest groups in the country (and possibly also to international advisers) for comment. \ue045 The working group or committee meets again to consider changes in view of the comments received. \ue045 Finally, the secretary of the group puts together a draft of the final report. The group finalizes and adopts the draft and publishes and disseminates the final report. (WHO 1998) \u00182. Summary Report EFSA Scientific Colloquium 5, 21-22 March 2006 - Parma, Italy ",

        "Conclusions and recommendations -1 descriptive data \ue045 Descriptive epidemiologic studies are necessary for assessment of dietary exposure. Critically assess methodologies used to assess dietary patterns. \ue045 Descriptive epidemiologic studies are necessary for assessment of disease patterns in populations and their trends. \ue045 Relevant to work of DG 4. Make use of all available data. Prioritize on the basis of existing dietary and disease patterns. Conclusions and recommendations -2 Use of analytical epidemiology \ue045 Make use of all types of epidemiological studies, from ecological to intervention ones. Critically assess the weight of each type of study. Evaluate the strength of evidence (strength of association, repeatability and generalizability, criteria of causality). \ue045 Account for confounding by (and effects of) other factors ( e.g. physical activity). \ue045 These processes apply equally to food groups, foods and nutrients. \ue045 Make use of resources from (inter)national bodies ( e.g . WHO), but also critically evaluate studies. \ue045 Combine evidence on different exposures and outcomes. 132. Summary Report EFSA Scientific Colloquium 5, 21-22 March 2006 - Parma, Italy ",
        "Conclusions and recommendations -3 Balancing risks and benefits \ue045 Incorporate methodologies of risk-benefit analyses in nutritional epidemiology (look at different components within one food). \ue045 Impact measures ( e.g. population attributable risk) for realistically achievable dietary goals under different scenarios. \ue045 Evaluate the consequences of replacing particular food groups with others. Account for existing food patterns. Conclusions and recommendations -\u0018 determinants of dietary behavior \ue045 Need for more studies to quantitatively assess determinants of foods choices ( e.g. meal patterns, availability of food). Useful to work of DG3 and for evaluation of effects of FBDG. Implications (not epi-specific) \ue045 Implications of FBDG on food availability. Need for involvement of stakeholders in the process of creating FBDG. \ue045 Implementation (catering) guidelines. From FBDG to practice in specific settings ( e.g. hospitals, schools). \ue045 Consumers need to be aware of how to combine information provided for specific food items (FBDG vs. labels). \ue045 FBDG (mis)used for health claims.
