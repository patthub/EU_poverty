        "2 1. Introduction 1.1 Why collect data on rape and intimate partner violence? Violence against women is rooted in women\u2019s unequal status in society, and that status reflects the unequal distribution of social, political and economic power between women and men in society. It is defined by the Council of Europe as \u2018a violation of human rights and a form of discrimination against women and shall mean all acts of gender- based violence that result in, or are likely to result in, physical, sexual, psychological or economic harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life\u2019 ( 1 ). The collection of data on the prevalence of rape and intimate partner violence (IPV) is key to establishing and evaluating effective prevention measures. Detailed, accurate and comprehensive data is required to measure the magnitude and dimensions of violence against women, and to monitor changes over time. Furthermore, EU Member States that are parties to the Istanbul Convention are required to provide regular data on all forms of violence against women which are covered by the scope of the convention, disaggregated by sex, age, type of violence, victim-perpetrator relationship, geographical location and other relevant factors such as disability ( 2 ). 1.2 How do we measure prevalence? The prevalence of rape and IPV can be somewhat determined by population-based surveys and administrative data. However, in order to determine the real magnitude of the violence, we need to measure the \u2018grey zone\u2019 (as indicated in the graphic below), which is difficult based on current knowledge and available data. Administrative data Administrative data includes, but is not limited to, health records, criminal and civil justice systems, legal aid services and specific services designed to respond to women who have experienced violence. However, administrative data cannot provide an accurate estimation of the prevalence of IPV and rape at population level because acts of violence against women are under-reported, especially when violence is perpetrated by an intimate partner or family member. Additionally, administrative sources tend only to collect data on the most severe cases, which is not an accurate representation of the full extent and nature of the problem, as depicted by the graphic here. The European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) has a wealth of expertise in the area of administrative data collection on violence against women, which is critical for monitoring Member States\u2019 implementation of the Istanbul Convention. EIGE has analysed the availability and comparability of administrative data on violence against women from sources in all Member States, resulting in in- depth knowledge about both the available disaggregation and gaps in data collection. EIGE has also proposed common indicators for the measurement of forms of violence against women based on the minimum data requirements of the Victims\u2019 Rights Directive and Istanbul Convention, with the aim of supporting Member States to populate them, thereby contributing to a comparable measure of the phenomenon over time at EU level. Population-based surveys When properly designed and executed, population-based surveys produce the most reliable data on the prevalence of violence against women. This is largely because surveys have the potential to reach almost all women, regardless of whether or not they have reported violence to the police or sought help from health or specialised social services. Moreover, surveys allow for the identification of patterns and risk factors for violence against women, as well as social and health consequences ( 3 ). The Istanbul Convention mandates that parties shall endeavour to conduct population-based surveys to measure prevalence and trends in all forms of violence within the convention\u2019s scope. The purpose of this leaflet is to describe the characteristics of international, national and EU-wide surveys on the prevalence of rape and IPV, in order to establish whether the existing data obtained from national surveys is adequate to enable comparisons across Member States and to monitor the prevalence of violence against women in each Member State, in accordance with the requirements of the Istanbul Convention.

        "3 2. International surveys Before 2014 four international surveys using similar instruments were carried out, producing data that can be used for cross-country comparisons: \u0083 The European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) survey, \u2018Violence against women \u2014 an EU-wide survey\u2019 ( 4 ); \u0083 The International violence against women survey (IVAWS) ( 5 ); \u0083 The International crime victims survey (ICVS)/ European Survey on Crime and Safety (EU ICS) ( 6 ); \u0083 The Date rape cases among young women survey, conducted by the Mediterranean Institute of Gender Studies (MIGS) ( 7 ). Table 1 presents an overview of these surveys (target population, core topics, period of violence and descriptive variables). Table 1.

        "4 2.1 How rape is measured In all four of the aforementioned surveys, the items measuring rape mention \u2018forced sexual intercourse\u2019 (although the MIGS survey does not use the word \u2018force\u2019 but rather, \u2018against my will\u2019). The FRA survey goes further and specifies rape as \u2018forced oral sex, forced anal or vaginal penetration\u2019, whereas the other surveys do not specify the acts or means of penetration. All the surveys except the MIGS survey go beyond the definition of the Istanbul Convention and include additional questions on attempted rape and forced sexual intercourse with someone other than the perpetrator. The FRA survey also distinguishes between physical force and psychological force used by the perpetrator. The FRA survey, the IVAWS and the MIGS survey all allow for a distinction between rape by partners/ex-partners and non-partners. The ICVS includes a question on whether sexual offences were carried out by a partner/ex-partner or a non-partner, allowing for these figures to be connected to instances of rape. Whereas the FRA survey allows for the sex of the perpetrator to be identified, the IVAWS only includes rape perpetrated by men, and the two other surveys do not address the sex of the perpetrator at all. It is worth noting that the MIGS survey only asks about rape by a person with whom the victim was in a relationship/dating; this is a crucial limitation to the measure of prevalence, as it does not ask about rape by strangers, family members or acquaintances (Table 1). Therefore, the FRA survey most closely fits with the definition of rape given by the Istanbul Convention. 2.2 How intimate partner violence is measured According to the Istanbul Convention, IPV can take various forms: physical, sexual, psychological and economic violence (PV, SV, PSV and EV respectively). Each of these international surveys includes items that measure physical and sexual violence; only the MIGS and FRA surveys measure psychological violence; and only the FRA survey measures economic violence. With the exception of the ICVS/EU ICS, the items used in the surveys to measure physical and psychological violence correspond almost exactly to the items suggested in the United Nations (UN) statistical guidelines for surveys ( 8 ). The ICVS/EU ICS uses questions that merely distinguish between the severity of the incident (threat or actual use of force) and whether weapons were used ( 9 ). The FRA survey measures sexual violence (other than rape) using items that mostly correspond to the content of the UN statistical guidelines, although in less detail. The items for sexual violence in the MIGS survey deviate quite substantially from the UN\u2019s suggested items, as they do not distinguish between the type of force or coercion, and the specification of the sexual acts differs (Table 1). As in the case of rape, the FRA survey is the closest fit to the definition of IPV used in the Istanbul Convention. 2.3 Descriptive variables These surveys mainly produce data on the numbers of victims who have experienced a certain kind of violence during their lifetime or over a specific period. Only the FRA survey (and potentially the MIGS survey) could provide figures on the number of females victimised during the 12 months preceding the survey. This prevalence data would be most suitable for comparison with administrative data; however, most of these surveys do not obtain data on the frequency of victimisation, as respondents are not asked how often they experienced a certain form of violence. An exception is the FRA survey, which gives an indication of repeated victimisation during the preceding year and could therefore be compared to annual administrative data on incidents and/or cases (Table 1). 3. National prevalence surveys within the EU-28 A total of 44 national prevalence surveys that included questions related to IPV or rape were identified (all conducted between 2007 and 2014, or, if none could be identified in that period, between 2003 and 2007). The sociodemographic characteristics of the studied population and type of violence are described in Table 2. Additional information can be found in Annex I. 3.1 Where rape and intimate partner violence are measured The Member States that have national prevalence surveys to measure rape and IPV, and the time-period covered, are described in Figure 1. Of the national prevalence surveys, 34 from 22 Member States (BE, BG, CZ, DK, DE, EE, EL, ES, FR, HR, IT, CY, LU, HU, MT, NL, AT, RO, SI, SK, SE, UK_E&W/UK_SC) asked about rape. Additional information can be found in Annex I. 3.1.1 How rape is measured The UN Statistical Commission recommends measuring rape based on its detailed definition, whereby rape refers to \u2018engaging in the non-consensual vaginal, anal or oral penetration of a sexual nature of the body of another person with any bodily part or object, including through the use of physical violence and by putting the victim in a situation where she cannot say no or complies because of fear\u2019 ( 10 ). The definitions used in the identified national surveys are similar to the UN definition, although they are often narrower ",

Most surveys refer to the use of force and/or lack of consent in combination with sexual intercourse. The reference to sexual intercourse is mostly general, with only a couple of surveys explicitly including oral and/or anal penetration. Only a few surveys include specifics such as taking advantage of vulnerabilities, the use of an object and/or of other body parts for penetration, and a specific question on marital rape or rape in intimate partner relationships. National surveys can thus only be compared using a narrower definition than the UN\u2019s, namely: sexual intercourse by use of force or lack of consent. There will be some information bias, stemming from the fact that some surveys explicitly include Figure 1. EU Member State measurements of rape and intimate partner violence in national prevalence surveys ",
        "6 anal and oral penetration in their definition, while others refer to sexual intercourse in general, leaving the interpretation of \u2018sexual intercourse\u2019 up to the respondent. This might generate errors (under- or over-coverage of cases of anal/oral penetration in some surveys compared to others). Additional information can be found in Annex II. 3.1.2 How intimate partner violence is measured IPV encompasses four dimensions: physical, psychological, sexual and economic violence ( 9 ). 3.1.2.1 Physical violence The following elements are suggested by the UN Statistical Commission to measure physical violence in surveys: slapping, throwing something at the partner, pushing/ shoving/pulling hair, hitting, hitting with fists or other objects, kicking/biting/dragging, beating, choking/burning or threatening with a knife/gun/other weapon ( 8 ). The majority of Member State surveys that measure prevalence over the past 12 months used several of these components to measure physical violence. Often, the components use the same, or similar, wording, while at other times the wording is different but the meaning is similar (see Figure 2). Additional information can be found in Annex III. 3.1.2.2 Psychological violence Regarding psychological violence, most surveys use components suggested by the UN Statistical Commission that integrate the two dimensions of emotional abuse and controlling behaviour ( 11 ). Figure 3 shows the most frequent components used by national prevalence surveys to measure psychological violence over the past 12 months. Additional items that go beyond the elements suggested by the UN are also listed. Additional information can be found in Annex IV . 3.1.2.3 Sexual violence The UN Statistical Commission suggests distinguishing between rape, attempted rape and other sexual acts ( 12 ). In 11 Member States, surveys (that include prevalence over the past 12 months) ask about experience of rape in general (BE, CZ, DK, EE, FR, IT, MT, NL, PT, SE, UK_E&W/UK_SC), but surveys in only four Member States refer to attempted rape (BE, DK, PT, UK_E&W/UK_SC). In 10 Member States, surveys refer to other sexual acts that are forced and/or without consent (BE, DK, EE, EL, FR, IT, NL, PT, SE, UK_SC) and surveys in five Member States (EE, MT, NL, PT, UK_SC) refer to sexual harassment.

Components used to measure psychological violence over the past 12 months in EU Member State national prevalence surveys 3.1.2.4 Economic violence The identified national prevalence surveys measure different aspects of economic violence, generally corresponding to those suggested by the UN Statistical Commission, i.e. denying the partner access to property and durable goods; deliberately not complying with economic responsibilities, such as alimony or financial support for the family and thereby exposing her to poverty and hardship; denying her access to the labour market and education; or denying her participation in decision-making concerning finances. Additional information can be found in Annex VI . Other aspects of economic violence mentioned in these surveys are as follows. \u0083 Destroying common property on purpose; selling common goods. \u0083 Stealing from the partner (stealing or otherwise taking away money, such as salary, pension, etc.). \u0083 Aspects relating to the partner\u2019s work life/career: harassing the partner at work with frequent calls or visits, forbidding the partner to take trips for professional training, business trips etc., making a scene at the workplace. This latter aspect (limiting her career) would be a particularly interesting addition to the UN Statistical Commission\u2019s definition of economic violence, as it adds a new dimension. ",
        "8 4. Conclusions 4.1 International surveys International surveys which measure the prevalence of violence against women on an EU scale are scarce. Out of four identified international surveys, the FRA survey is the most suitable to support monitoring of the Istanbul Convention at EU level because of the definitions used to measure forms of violence against women, the characteristics and size of the sample. In addition, it covers all 28 EU Member States, among a sample of women aged 18-74 years. However, for the purposes of monitoring the implementation of the Istanbul Convention, the survey would need to be undertaken periodically. 4.2 National prevalence surveys National prevalence surveys were not comparable across Member States. There are several limitations affecting comparability. \u0083 Different composition of the samples (i.e. only women, or both women and men included), limiting the number of surveys where the samples converge. \u0083 Different age groups included in survey samples. \u0083 Inclusion/exclusion of frequency of victimisation. \u0083 Surveys conducted in different years, most within a time span of 10 years, but in some even beyond that. \u0083 Differences in the definitions of forms of violence and in the type of items used to measure the concept of violence. Consequently, in order to obtain reliable data on violence against women at the European Union level, an international survey is required (such as the survey carried out by the FRA in 2012) that uses a consistent methodology across Member States. This would ensure comparable and unbiased measurement. The availability of such data is fundamental for the development and evaluation of appropriate policies and actions to combat the widespread phenomenon of violence against women. For the purposes of measuring prevalence at national level, a significant number of surveys are capable of this task, and can be used for monitoring of the Istanbul Convention at national level only.
