        "Beijing Platform for Action Artificial intelligence, platform work and gender equality The growth of artificial intelligence (AI) technology and plat- form work is rapidly changing the world of work. These two phenomena have the potential to create new opportunities for gender equality, but at the same time can reinforce gen- der stereotypes, sexism and discrimination in the labour market. (1) European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (2018), \u2018Platform economy repository \u2013 Typology\u2019, https://www.eurofound. europa.eu/data/platform-economy/typology. What is artificial intelligence? AI refers to software that displays intelligent behaviour. It uses algorithms and deep neural networks to make autono- mous decisions, based on probabilities of certain outcomes and goals that developers have taught it to reach. What is platform work? While the precise definition of platform work is still evolv- ing, Eurofound defines it as \u2018a form of employment that uses an online platform to enable organisations or individuals to access other organisations or individuals to solve problems or to provide services in exchange for payment\u2019 ( 1 ). It distin- guishes between digital labour platforms (e.g. TaskRabbit, Freelancer, Deliveroo, Uber or Wolt), which encompass plat- form work, and digital capital platforms (e.g. Airbnb or Etsy), where income is not generated through labour and which therefore do not constitute platform work. Artificial intelligence in platform work In platform work, algorithms have three main purposes: 1. Matching customers with workers. Users can enter the tasks they need done into a platform and individual workers choose their jobs. 2. Performance monitoring and management. Various technological tools, facilitated by AI, can be used to re- motely manage workers. This function often relies on automated decision-making systems, real-time data col- lection to inform performance rating systems, and the use of \u2018nudges\u2019 to control, monitor and motivate workers\u2019 behaviour. For example, platform workers who tend to work during unsocial hours, such as evenings or week- ends, often get more and better tasks or \u2018gigs\u2019. This puts platform workers \u2013 both women and men \u2013 with care re- sponsibilities at a disadvantage. 3. Evaluation of worker performance. Clients can often rate a worker\u2019s performance. If they are not satisfied with the results and rate their satisfaction with a par- ticular worker as low, the worker can be algorithmically excluded from future jobs. Sometimes these evalua- tions can be biased or discriminatory, which is especial- ly problematic when platform workers cannot challenge their ratings. \u00a9 I m a g e : C h i a r a L u x a r d o ",
        "European Institute for Gender Equality Artificial intelligence, platform work and gender equality How does artificial intelligence reinforce sexism and gender stereotypes? (2) LinkedIn (2019), AI Talent in the European Labour Market, https://economicgraph.linkedin.com/content/dam/me/economicgraph/en-us/reference-cards/re- search/2019/LinkedIn-AI-Talent-in-the-European-Labour-Market.pdf. (3) Idem. Gender bias can be embedded in AI by design, reflecting so- cietal norms or the personal biases of those who design the systems. One example of how algorithms perpetuate gen- der stereotypes is AI-powered translation tools that produce gender-biased translations. When translating occupations, such as \u2018flight attendant\u2019 or \u2018engineer\u2019, from a language that does not assign a gender to nouns to one that does, trans- lation tools might only provide one, stereotypical result (e.g. only a feminine version of the word \u2018nurse\u2019), even though the word could have both a feminine and a masculine form. Another, more startling example of gender bias powered by AI is a new form of gender-based violence \u2013 deepfake por- nographic videos. These are produced using AI technology to superimpose images of people\u2019s faces or bodies, creating fake videos that appear authentic. These almost exclusively target women and inflict harm on their personal and pro- fessional lives. The emergence of deepfake apps for smart- phones means that anyone can make videos using explicit content without the consent of those involved. On the positive side, AI can be used to recognise and remove harmful content, ranging from hate speech to revenge porn and deepfake videos. However, there is a stark difference in the pace of development between deepfakes and face ma- nipulation detection. This reflects a general bias in the in- dustry, where concerns for gender equality remain less of a priority. It can also be linked to the under-representation of women and other marginalised groups in the development of AI. Demand for artificial intelligence talent grows, yet women are missing out AI development and maintenance is one of the fastest-grow- ing and highest-paid industries. Jobs in this field usually offer good working conditions and benefits. Yet with the majority of AI professionals being men, women are missing out. Data on the AI industry workforce is scarce, but available evidence from LinkedIn suggests that in the EU just 16 % of all AI- skilled individuals are women and 84 % are men ( 2 ). Even if women start a career in AI, they do not always stay. The gender gap in the AI workforce widens with career length. Women with more than 10 years of work experience in AI represent 12 % of all professionals in the industry, com- pared to 20 % of women with 0\u20132 years ( 3 ). The gendered design of virtual assistants. Digital voice assistants are intentionally designed to exhibit fem- inine features, including their names and voices, while they perform secretarial tasks traditionally assigned to women. This reaffirms gender stereotypes about women being subservient, helpful and pleasant. In some cases, these assistants may even appear flattered by sexual harassment and verbal abuse, which could trivialise such behaviour towards women. \u00a9 I m a g e : f i z k e s / s h u t t e r s t o c k ",

(7) See, for example, World Economic Forum (2018), The Global Gender Gap Report 2018, http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GGGR_2018.pdf. (8) These findings are based on EIGE\u2019s survey of 4 932 platform workers, aged between 16 and 54, in 10 Member States (Denmark, Spain, France, Latvia, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia and Finland), carried out in November and December 2020. Diversity in the AI industry is key to developing and maintain- ing AI tools that are gender sensitive and equitable. There are two main ways to improve the gender balance in the AI industry: 1. close the gender divide in AI-related fields of education; 2. focus on entry and retention of women in the industry. Exposure to technology starts at a young age. In secondary schools across the EU, four out of five girls never or almost never engage in coding activities ( 4 ) and this carries over to tertiary education. Although more than half of university stu- dents in the EU are women, fewer women choose to enrol in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) studies, which are highly relevant for AI-related jobs. In 2018, women constituted about 28 % of graduates in engineering, manufacturing and construction, and only around 20 % of ICT graduates ( 5 ). Even if young women aspire to pursue a career in science, they often do not opt for such a career, or quit their jobs much earlier than men. The organisation of work and work culture, including requirements for continuous skill updates (sometimes outside of working hours) or unpredictable working hours, likely play a crucial role in perpetuating the gender imbalance in the field. Strongly male-dominated work environments, stereotyping, sexual harassment, gender dis- crimination and the gender pay gap present additional chal- lenges for women working in AI ( 6 ). Another barrier faced by women in AI is the persistent glass ceiling. Women are less likely to be in senior roles and are therefore less likely to gain expertise in certain high-profile emerging skills and, in turn, are less likely to be promoted ( 7 ). Who are the platform workers in the European Union? Across the 10 surveyed countries, there were somewhat fewer women platform workers than men (42 % were wom- en while 58 % were men) ( 8 ). In recent years, the number of women in platform work has been growing and has acceler- ated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the expansion of dig- ital forms of work.

        "European Institute for Gender Equality Artificial intelligence, platform work and gender equality The majority of platform workers are young (with an average age of 30 for women and 32 for men) and very well educated, and many have care responsibilities. The education level of platform workers raises concerns about deskilling, as plat- form work often entails low-skilled tasks. Although platform work can be a way for some young workers to enter the la- bour market and gain experience, others may be at risk of becoming trapped in precarious jobs. In addition to working via platforms, 76 % of women and 80 % of men who are platform workers also work full-time or part- time or are self-employed in other jobs. Fewer women than men are employed full-time outside of platform work (44 % compared to 49 %). Overall, the gender differences in activity status are very small. Although most platform workers are young, only 6 % of the women and 4 % of the men surveyed were students. A significant proportion of platform workers have family re- sponsibilities: a majority of regular platform workers live with a partner and children (48 % of women and 40 % of men) or with a partner but no children (23 % of women and 25 % of men), and 10 % of both women and men are lone parents. On average, about 11 % of both women and men platform workers were born outside the EU. Addressing gender equality concerns in platform work Gender segregation in platform work is lower than in the traditional labour market Much of platform work is split along well-known gendered lines. EIGE\u2019s survey shows that significantly more women than men provide childcare and elderly care services, where- as men dominate platform jobs in construction, software de- velopment or transportation. However, certain occupational choices by women and men seem less differentiated than in the traditional labour market. For example, work in tradition- ally female-dominated sectors such as housekeeping and other home services shows gender balance when taken via online platforms, with close to 46 % of workers being men. Easy entry to platform work, but lower flexibility The most common reason for taking work on digital labour platforms is because it is a good way to earn additional in- come (according to 45 % of women and 40 % of men). The flexibility of working hours and location, especially in relation to family commitments, is more important for women than for men (36 % cited it as important compared to 28 %). In addition, highly educated women and men appreciate working on digital platforms for the flexibility it allows in choosing when and where to work. By contrast, fewer plat- form workers with lower education have the autonomy to plan their working schedules. One of the main reasons for working through digital plat- forms is the perception that they allow work to be more eas- ily combined with family commitments. However, aside from easy entry, there is limited evidence of flexibility in platform work. As many as 36 % of women and 40 % of men who reg- ularly work via platforms often or always work at night and/or the weekend. In addition, many are unable to choose when to work and their hours are scattered throughout the day. The penalties imposed by platforms for interrupted work are also detrimental to combining work with care responsibilities at home. The most frequently mentioned drawbacks of working through digital labour platforms were unpredictable incomes (according to 33 % of women and 29 % of men), unpredicta- ble working hours (24 % of women and 22 % of men) and low or unfair pay (23 % of women and 20 % of men). \u00a9 I m a g e : S F I O C R A C H O / S h u t t e r s t o c k ",

Women and men spend similar amounts of time in regular jobs or on digital platforms, but women carry the bulk of childcare and housework Many platform workers are working an excessive number of hours, particularly women, who also take on the bulk of household work and childcare. Women and men platform workers spend the same number of hours working in jobs outside of platform work and on digital platforms, but wom- en on average spend about 2.5 hours per week more than men on household work, and 3.5 hours more on childcare. The differences are even greater in couples with children. Women\u2019s overall working time and schedules on online plat- forms are more affected by family factors while men\u2019s are more affected by personal and professional factors. Foreign-born platform workers, particularly men, are disproportionately affected by unfair treatment and discrimination More men (66 %) than women (58 %) indicated having experi- enced some form of unfair treatment while providing servic- es through digital platforms. Women are slightly more often treated unfairly due to their age and sex, while men are more likely to report unfair treatment due to language or accent, skin colour, nationality, religious beliefs, sexual orientation or gender identity, and illness or disability. For example, as many as 85 % of foreign-born men experienced unfair treat- ment and discriminatory practices in platform work, com- pared to 77 % of foreign-born women.

        "European Institute for Gender Equality Artificial intelligence, platform work and gender equality The COVID-19 pandemic and related policy measures have strongly impacted the lives of platform workers Roughly one third of women (32 %) and two fifths of men (39 %) platform workers lost their paid jobs due to COV- ID-19. As many as 38 % of low-educated women and 58 % of low-educated men lost their jobs and had to leave their accommodation (32 % and 45 %, respectively) due to COV- ID-19. Similarly, as many as 45 % of foreign-born women and 52 % of foreign-born men lost their paid jobs or had to leave their accommodation due to COVID-19 (31 % and 44 %, re- spectively). Platform work served as an important source of income during the pandemic. A similar proportion of women (36 %) and men (35 %) started or restarted platform work due to COVID-19. Among platform workers who lost their regular jobs, almost half of women (44 %) and men (45 %) started or restarted working via online platforms due to COVID-19. In addition, 26 % of women and 29 % of men increased their working hours on digital platforms.

Legal uncertainty in the employment status of platform workers Platform workers are frequently considered self-employed by default and are thus engaged in predominantly unregulated jobs. Companies (and clients) benefit from classifying plat- form workers as self-employed: they pay lower or no social security contributions for workers, have to follow fewer or no employment regulations, and make task-specific rather than salary payments. Self-employed platform workers then bear all the costs, including social protection coverage. More of- ten than not, however, self-employed platform workers work under the same conditions as regular employees, but with limited protection. Platform work can increase women\u2019s and men\u2019s participa- tion in the labour market, providing them with some flex- ibility around care and other activities, and a way out of discrimination in the traditional workplace. However, with limited regulations and social protections, platform work may lead to greater vulnerability and risk of poverty over the life course. Platform workers\u2019 poor access to social security Platform workers, predominantly those classified as self- employed, have very limited or no access to maternity and parental leave, sick pay and unemployment benefits. \u00a9 I m a g e : g o f f k e i n . p r o / S h u t t e r s t o c k ",
        "Artificial intelligence, platform work and gender equality European Institute for Gender Equality They may not meet the employment-related conditions, or the low pay and fragmented nature of platform work may not satisfy contribution-based or job tenure requirements. The situation is particularly dire for those who primarily depend on platforms to access work. According to EIGE\u2019s survey, for as many as 38 % of women and 46 % of men who are regular platform workers, platform work is their primary activity ( 9 ). The classification of platform workers as self-employed also hinders their capacity to seek collective representation, ne- gotiate improved working conditions and social protection, or contest pay inequalities. What needs to change? Both AI and platform work have tremendous potential to im- prove gender equality in the labour market, but also carry the risk of perpetuating unequal outcomes for women and men. Gender equality in AI development and platform work could benefit the EU by increasing the quality and competi- tiveness of European technology and the labour market. In relation to AI, the EU needs to do the following: \u2022 Mainstream gender into the policy framework on AI-related transformation of the labour market. AI technologies are opening up many opportunities for society and the economy. However, AI also contributes to reproducing gender stereotypes, sexism and discrimina- tion and enables new forms of gender-based violence. It is important to mainstream gender into the policy cycle and to use appropriate tools, such as gender monitoring and evaluation, to promote gender equality and tackle dis- crimination and gender stereotypes in AI. Equally crucial is the adjustment of the current equal treatment legisla- tive framework to set up accountability mechanisms for AI technology and access to remedies in the event of harm. \u2022 Increase the number of women in, and the diversity of, the AI workforce. In order to avoid the reproduction of gender stereotypes and discrimination in AI technologies, we need more di- versity at all levels of the workforce. The EU has already made several steps in this direction, particularly by incen- tivising women\u2019s participation in STEM education. Never- theless, gender segregation in education and employ- ment persists. More intensive efforts are needed on the part of EU Member States to reverse this trend and increase di- versity in AI-relevant education and training at all levels. The EU regulatory framework for AI should include more stringent measures engaging not only women and girls (9) Meaning that they work more than 20 hours per week via platforms or receive at least half of their income from platform work. but also industry and academia to address recruitment and retention barriers to diversity in AI. In relation to platform work, the EU needs to do the follow- ing: \u2022 Address the legal uncertainty in the employment status of platform workers to combat disguised em- ployment. Platform workers are frequently considered self-em- ployed by default and are thus engaged in predominant- ly unregulated jobs. More often than not, self-employed platform workers work under the same conditions as regular employees, but with limited protection or options to unionise. The 2021 European Pillar of Social Rights action plan high- lights that as the number of vulnerable and precariously self-employed individuals in the platform economy rises, it is increasingly vital to clarify platform workers\u2019 employ- ment status. EIGE\u2019s study has provided arguments in support of classifying platform workers as employees as this would contribute to a more gender-responsive regu- lation of platform work. \u2022 Address gender inequalities in platform work. Platform work is not immune to gender inequalities. Rather, it mirrors overall labour market trends, such as horizontal and vertical gender segregation and gen- dered impacts on work\u2013life balance, which are especially problematic for people with care responsibilities. How- ever, emerging approaches to regulating platform work are largely gender-blind. In this context, the EU and na- tional-level gender equality policies should address the negative trends in gender equality that are apparent in platform work. \u00a9 I m a g e : W A Y H O M E s t u d i o / S h u t t e r s t o c k ",
        "European Institute for Gender Equality Artificial intelligence, platform work and gender equality A directive on transparent and predictable working con- ditions could be a first step towards ensuring a balance between flexibility and security for workers in the digital economy. Its transposition at Member State level should not exclude platform workers, both women and men. Similarly, national transposition of the work\u2013life balance directive should ensure that platform workers can ben- efit from its provisions in relation to flexible working ar- rangements and access to parental leave.
