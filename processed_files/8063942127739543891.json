        "EN 2 EN EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) was established in 1990 to support the development of market economies from central Europe to central Asia following the widespread collapse of communist regimes. The European Union, together with the European Investment Bank (EIB) and 40 countries (including all EU Member states at that time), were founding members. The EBRD is currently owned by 61 countries, the EU and the EIB. The EBRD supports projects in 29 countries, primarily in the private sector, that cannot be fully financed by the market. The Bank promotes entrepreneurship and fosters transition towards open and democratic market economies. The proposed decision is intended to permit the European Union to subscribe for additional callable shares in the EBRD in the framework of the capital increase decided by the EBRD Board of Governor on 14/15 May 2010. The decision will also authorise the Governor of the EBRD for the European Union to deposit the requisite instrument of subscription. The European Union 1 became a member of the EBRD subsequent to Council Decision of 19 November 1990 on the conclusion of the Agreement establishing the EBRD (90/674/EEC). The initial capital of the EBRD was fixed at ECU 10 billion, of which the EU subscribed 3%. In 1996, the Governors of the EBRD decided to double the authorised capital of the EBRD for which the EU subscribed an additional 30.000 shares of EUR 10.000 each, bringing the EU subscribed capital at EUR 600 million 2 . The EU share in the EBRD total authorised capital was maintained unchanged. The EU subscription of additional shares followed Council Decision 97/135/EC adopted on 17 February 1997 providing that \"the European Community should subscribe for extra shares as a result of the Decision to double the capital of the EBRD\". At the Annual Meeting of the Governors of the EBRD on 14/15 May 2010, the Board of Governors adopted two Resolutions providing for an increase in the authorised capital stock of the Bank of 50% from EUR 20 billion to EUR 30 billion. The capital enhancement of the Bank was agreed in response to the financial crisis and the recognised need by the Bank\u2019s shareholders to step up its activity to help promote and support recovery in its region. The capital increase comprises EUR 1 billion paid-in capital and EUR 9 billion of new callable capital. According to Resolution 126 adopted by the Board of Governors, the paid-in shares have been funded through the incorporation of unrestricted reserves pro rata shareholders' actual shares in the Bank's subscribed capital. Following the first capital increase of the EBRD, EUR 19,794 million was subscribed instead of EUR 20,000 million authorised. Consequently, the EU share in the EBRD's subscribed capital is 3.031 %. The EU paid-in capital is therefore increased by EUR 30.31 million. The increase of the paid-in shares was effective on 14 May 1 According to Council Decision 90/674/EEC of 19 November 1990, the EU is represented by the Commission in the EBRD. 2 The EU subscribed capital in the EBRD was composed of EUR 157.5 million paid-in capital and EUR 442.5 million callable capital. ",
        "EN 3 EN 2010, the date of the adoption of Resolution 126. Consequently, no further action on the part of the shareholders is necessary for the issuance of the additional paid-in shares. The subscription of callable shares amounting to a total of EUR 9 billion will become effective as soon as the individual shareholders have completed their internal procedures and deposited their instruments of subscription, as it was the case for the 1996 capital increase. The Bank would expect that the callable capital increase will become effective at the end of April 2011, but in any event not later than 31 December 2011. Resolution 128 (attached to the Decision) foresees that each member of the Bank is entitled to subscribe to a number of additional shares (rounded down), up to, but not exceeding, 42.857% of the number of shares the member owned prior to the Effective Date of the capital increase. For the EU, it means that the EU shall subscribe up to an additional 27,013 callable shares amounting to EUR 270.13 million taking into account the EU proportion of 3.031% in the subscribed capital. The following table summarises how the EU shares will evolve following the new capital increase. It shows notably the existing paid-in shares before the 2010 capital increase, the capitalisation of reserves, the existing callable capital, the proposed callable capital increase and the total of subscribed capital after increase. Existing and proposed EU subscribed capital (EUR million) Paid-in shares Callable capital Existing (Pre May 2010) Capitalisation of reserves in 2010 Total Existing (Pre May 2010) Proposed increase Total Total subscribed capital after increase 157.50 30.31 187.81 442.50 270.13 712.63 900.44 Resolution 128 also provides for a review mechanism that may allow a partial or total redemption of unused callable capital part of the increase which could be returned to shareholders after the end of the period 2010-2015, under specific conditions still to be agreed in 2015. If this were the case, this unused callable capital would no longer constitute a contingent liability for the shareholders in 2016. 2. RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS The EBRD fourth Capital Resources Review (CRR4) for the period 2011-2015, which was undertaken during the past year, reflected the need for the Bank to respond effectively to the crisis and to redirect its medium term strategy taking account of the significant impact the crisis is having on its region of operations. EBRD shareholders (which include all EU member states, the EIB and the Commission representing the EU) were actively involved in the process. In this framework, the EBRD carried out an analysis of capital enhancement options, based on the need to comply with the Bank\u2019s statutory \u2018gearing ratio\u2019 and economic capital requirements, the maintenance of the Bank\u2019s Triple-A credit rating, as well as the effective and efficient use of shareholders' capital. The current decision on the EBRD capital enhancement reflects a compromise achieved among the Bank's shareholders. The efforts undertaken by the EBRD to mitigate the impact of the crisis in all its countries of operations through the proposed capital increase will allow the Bank to sustain a high level of ",
        "EN 4 EN activity and accompany the recovery in its region of operations, in cooperation with the EIB and other International Financial Institutions. It is expected that the capital increase would enable the EBRD to have an annual business volume of about EUR 9 billion for 2011 and 2012, and about EUR 8.5 billion until 2015. Therefore, it is appropriate for the EU to subscribe to those additional shares in order to promote the EU's objectives in the field of economic external relations and preserve its present voting power within the EBRD. By its nature, this capital subscription would require no actual cash payments from the EU budget, unless very serious and unforeseen losses lead to an actual call of the Bank\u2019s capital beyond its paid-in portion. Against this background and in accordance with the proportionality principle and past practice, the Commission proposes not to develop a formal impact assessment. 3. LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL In the context of the 1996 capital increase, the participation of the EU was decided by Council Decision 97/135/EC 3 providing that the European Community should subscribe for extra shares as a result of the decision to double the capital of the EBRD. Council Decision 97/135/EC was adopted under Article 235 of the Treaty. EBRD's countries of operations are countries from Central and Eastern Europe 4 and from Central Asia, with the largest share of activity being in countries outside the EU. The bulk of EBRD activity over the period covered by the CRR4 is expected to be in EU Candidates and Potential Candidates and other middle income countries, including Russia. Since the entry into force of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Article 212 provides the legal bases to the EU for carrying out economic, financial and technical cooperation measures, in particular assistance with third countries and is proposed as the legal basis for the present legislative proposal. The proposal complies with the proportionality principle, as the EU participation in the EBRD's capital has proved to be an efficient means to contribute adequately to promote EU objectives and will serve to mitigate the impact of the crisis in EBRD's countries of operations and to sustain a high level of EBRD's activity. 4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION The modalities of participation do not foresee any cash payments by shareholders. Considering that the EU share in EBRD subscribed capital equals to 3.031%, the EU would increase its subscribed capital by EUR 300.44 million, of which EUR 270.13 million as subscribed callable shares and EUR 30.31 million as paid-in shares through incorporation of 3 OJ L 52, 22.2.1997, p. 15. 4 Since their accession to the EU in 2004 and 2007, EBRD countries of operations include also some EU Member States: Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Slovak Republic, Estonia, Slovenia, Hungary, Latvia, and Lithuania. While EBRD has been very active in the transition process, its role has been diminishing in these countries in the past years and will be further diminishing in the future. In particular, several countries are expected to engage in graduation by 2015. ",

As regards the callable part of the capital increase, its budgetary impact will be catered for by the budget line 01 03 01 02 \"European Bank for Reconstruction and Development - Callable portion of subscribed capital\", which has been established in the 2011 budget, so as to reflect the EU budget's liability deriving from the callable part of the EU participation in the EBRD's capital. The budget line should be endowed with a 'p.m.' reflecting the contingent nature of the call and a budgetary comment defining the size of the contingent liability. Although a call is considered to be highly unlikely, the budgetary line and its comment will reflect the financing needs which could arise in the event of a payment request by the EBRD relating to the callable part of the capital subscribed by the EU. 5. OPTIONAL ELEMENTS Detailed explanation of the proposal Article 1 Under the terms and conditions of Resolution 128 on capital increase in the form of additional subscription of callable capital, the authorised capital stock of the Bank shall be increased by 900,000 callable shares, each share having a par value of EUR 10,000 which shall be subject to redemption in accordance with the provisions of the above Resolution. The EU is entitled to subscribe up to 27,013 callable shares Article 1 aims at authorising the EU to take part in the callable part of the EBRD capital increase by subscribing to the shares it is allowed to. Article 2 According to the terms of the Resolution 128, each member of the EBRD shall deposit with the Bank an instrument of subscription whereby the member subscribes to the number of callable shares specified in such instrument. In addition, the member shall deposit a representation that the member has duly taken all legal and other internal action necessary to enable it to make such subscription. ",

(2) Prior to these Resolutions, the capital of the EBRD was fixed at EUR 20 billion of which the European Union subscribed 60 000 shares, each share having a par value of EUR 10 000. (3) Pursuant to Resolution 126 on increase in authorised capital stock, issuance of paid-in shares, and payment through reallocation of net income, the authorised capital stock of the EBRD is increased by 100 000 paid-in shares, and each member is issued a number of whole shares, rounded downwards, pro rata to their existing shareholding. The paid-in part of the capital increase will be paid through integration in the capital of part of the EBRD's unrestricted general reserves. All EBRD shareholders will automatically receive paid-in shares in proportion of their existing shareholding, without any further procedural steps to be taken by the shareholders themselves. Accordingly, the EU is issued 3 031 new shares, each share having a par value of EUR 10 000 increasing the number of paid-in shares of the EU to 63 031. (4) Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Resolution 128 on increase in authorised capital stock, issuance and subscription of callable capital, and redemption, the authorised capital stock of the EBRD shall be increased by 900 000 callable shares, each share having a par value of EUR 10 000 which shall be subject to redemption in ",

The EU is thus entitled to subscribe up to 27 013 callable shares. The effective date shall be on or before 30 April 2011, or such subsequent date not later than 31 December 2011 as may be determined by the Board of Directors of the EBRD. (5) Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Resolution 128 on increase in authorised capital stock, issuance and subscription of callable capital, and redemption, the EBRD Board of Governors could decide in 2015 that part of unutilised callable capital could be redeemed under specific conditions to be agreed in 2015. Under Resolution 128, the EBRD Board of Governors resolved that such a redemption of callable shares would be automatic and applicable to all EBRD members who have subscribed to the callable shares authorised by this Resolution. In such a situation, the Commission would take note of the EBRD Governors' Resolution and implement it.

Grounds for the proposal/initiative 1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term Article 5.3 of the Agreement Establishing the EBRD stipulates that the Board of Governors shall review the capital stock of the EBRD at intervals of not more than five years. The fourth Capital Resources Review (CRR4) for the period 2011-2015 reflected the need for the EBRD to respond effectively to the crisis within statutory limits and to redirect its medium term strategy taking account of the significant impact the crisis is having on its region of operations. In order to maintain enough capital to sustain over the medium term a reasonable level of activity, the EBRD Governors at their 2010 Annual Meeting decided to increase by EUR 10 billion the authorized capital stock of the EBRD. The modalities of the EU participation in the capital increase of the EBRD do not foresee any disbursement: Following the adoption of the Resolution 126 by the Governors, the paid-in part (EUR 1 billion) of the capital increase has been paid through integration in the capital of part of the EBRD's unrestricted general reserves. All EBRD shareholders automatically receive paid-in shares in proportion of their existing shareholding (equivalent to EUR 30.31 million for the EU), without any further procedural steps to be taken by the shareholders themselves. The present proposal aims at increasing the callable portion of the EU subscribed capital. Following the adoption of the Resolution 128 by the Governors, the callable portion of EU subscribed capital will increase by EUR 270.13 million (27 013 shares of EUR 10 000 each). EU subscription to those additional shares aims at preserving the EU voting power within the EBRD. ",
        "EN 15 EN Members are expected to deposit instruments of subscription on or before 30 April 2011, or such subsequent date as the Board of Directors may determine but in any event not later than 31 December 2011. 1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement The EBRD transition mandate is unique among International Financial Institutions (IFIs) in directing it to support systemic change rather than delivering development outcomes. This choice was based on the conviction that a democratic and pluralistic market economy is the form of social organisation best capable of achieving results that people care about: meaningful jobs, poverty reduction, higher incomes, high-quality services, a sustainable environment and gender equality. Twenty years of economic and political transition have produced impressive results for many of the countries in the EBRD region of operations, but the process of transition is far from over and has become more fragile. Experience has shown that transition to well-functioning markets is not a linear process, and the crisis has brought with it important insights into the resilience and sustainability of past transition achievements. Between the fourth quarter of 2008 and the second quarter of 2009, the EBRD region underwent the steepest economic contraction since the early years of transition. The economic decline in late 2008 and the first half of 2009 was driven by severe and simultaneous shocks to exports, commodity prices and capital flows to the region. These shocks were aggravated by well-known vulnerabilities in many countries in the region, including high private external debt, excessive reliance of credit growth on external funding, and, in some cases, denomination of household and corporate debt in foreign currency. The EBRD responded in a swift and determined manner to the needs of its countries of operations and clients during the crisis. In very adverse circumstances, the EBRD was able to play its counter-cyclical role fully and to offer a flexible and robust crisis-response, both quantitatively and qualitatively, in close cooperation with other IFIs. In particular, the EBRD was instrumental to further help the region sustain and strengthen its recovery, by financing mainly the private sector and leveraging its impact through equity and other innovative risk- sharing instruments. The EBRD played also a key role in supporting the financial sector and SMEs, but also energy efficiency and security, nuclear safety, as well as environmental and municipal infrastructure. The capital increase will allow the Bank to maintain enough capital to sustain over the medium term a reasonable level of activity. 1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past EBRD shareholders (which include all EU member states, the EIB and the Commission representing the EU) were actively involved in the CRR4 process. Based on the capital requirements analysis and consultations with shareholders, the following points have been considered in deciding the capital increase: \u2013 The EBRD should have the operational capacity to support its region of operations in the aftermath of the global financial crisis within the proposed annual business volume path; \u2013 Any proposed capital enhancement method should seek to minimise the impact on the budgets of shareholders; ",
        "EN 16 EN \u2013 The structure of a capital increase should reflect the temporary nature of crisis and post- crisis demands on the EBRD so that any unutilised callable capital would be redeemed and \u201creturned\u201d to shareholders after the end of the CRR4 period. The level of redemption will be calculated on the basis of an agreed formula (statutory capital utilisation test) but will also take account of the Bank\u2019s financial situation and the economic environment prevailing at the end of the CRR4 period; \u2013 The EBRD needs to maintain its Triple-A rating to be effective in implementing its mandate; and \u2013 An increase in subscribed capital through capitalising part of the general reserve will be recognised by bondholders as further confirmation of shareholder support. 1.5.4. Coherence and possible synergy with other relevant instruments The Commission systematically promotes close cooperation and joint initiatives with the EBRD, the EIB and other IFIs as efficient donor/IFI concerted actions are increasingly necessary to sustain recovery in a fragile and fiscally constrained economic environment. Close cooperation with the EBRD also underpins the achievement of EU objectives in the field of economic external relations activities. Enhancing cooperation with IFIs is one of the Commission's priorities as inter alia stipulated in the overall policy framework laid down in the European consensus on development adopted in 2005, which stresses the need to improve aid co-ordination. In addition, new and more pressing existing challenges are to be addressed by the EU in the context of climate change and development financing. These stem respectively from the UN climate change conference in Copenhagen (2009), which has underlined the need to find solutions to finance the fight against climate change in developing countries, and the Lisbon Treaty (2009) which sets the reduction and the eradication of poverty as the primary objective of the Union\u2019s development cooperation policy. Against this background, the Commission supports, in particular, its cooperation with the EIB and the EBRD in the framework of tripartite (EC-EIB-EBRD) Memoranda of Understanding, as well as within grant and loan blending mechanisms, such as the Western Balkans Investment Framework and the Neighbourhood Investment Facility.

        "EN 18 EN 2. MANAGEMENT MEASURES 2.1. Monitoring and reporting rules Specify frequency and conditions. EBRD Financing Operations will be managed in accordance with the EBRD's own rules and procedures, including appropriate audit, control and monitoring measures. As foreseen in the Agreement Establishing the EBRD, the Audit Committee of the EBRD, which is supported by external auditors, assists the EBRD Board of Directors and is responsible for verifying the regularity of the EBRD operations and accounts. The Board of Directors, where the EU, represented by the Commission, has a Director, submits the audited accounts for each financial year for approval of the Board of Governors at each annual meeting and approves the budget of the EBRD. The Board of Governors approves, after reviewing the auditor's report, the general balance sheet and the statement of profit and loss of the EBRD. Furthermore, the Board of Directors establishes policies and takes decisions concerning loans, guarantees, investment in equity capital, borrowing by the EBRD, the furnishing of technical assistance and other operations of the EBRD in conformity with the general directions of the Board of Governors. Finally, the Board of Directors has established three Board Committees to assist it in its work: the Audit Committee mentioned above, the Budget and Administrative Affairs Committee and the Financial and Operations Policies Committee. The EU Director (or his alternate) attends all these Boards Committees. 2.2. Management and control system 2.2.1. Risk(s) identified In the framework of CRR4, the analysis of capital enhancement options was based on the need to comply with the EBRD\u2019s statutory \u2018gearing ratio\u2019, economic capital requirements arising from the application of the \u201cEconomic Capital Policy\u201d, the maintenance of the EBRD\u2019s Triple-A credit rating, as well as the effective and efficient use of shareholders' capital. A risk for the EU budget relates to the callable nature of part of the capital. In accordance with the Agreement establishing it, the EBRD could request payment relating to whole or part of the callable part of the capital subscribed by the European Union if it is needed to meet its liabilities. The likelihood of this event is however judged very low. 2.2.2. Control method(s) envisaged Article 5.3 of the Agreement Establishing the EBRD stipulates that the Board of Governors shall review the capital stock of the EBRD at intervals of not more than five years. The fifth Capital Resources Review (CRR5) for the period 2016-2020 shall be implemented at the end of the CRR4 period. ",
        "EN 19 EN 2.3. Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities Specify existing or envisaged prevention and protection measures. The EBRD has an independent Office of the Chief Compliance Officer (OCCO), which is headed by a Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) reporting directly to the President, and annually, or as necessary, to the Audit Committee. The OCCO\u2019s mandate is to promote good governance and to ensure the highest standards of integrity are applied throughout all of the activities of the EBRD in accordance with international best practice. The responsibilities of the OCCO include dealing with issues of integrity due diligence, confidentiality, conflicts of interest, corporate governance, accountability, ethics, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing and the prevention of fraudulent and corrupt practices. The OCCO is responsible for investigating allegations of fraud, corruption and misconduct. It also trains and advises, as necessary, EBRD staff members who are appointed as directors to the boards of companies in which the EBRD holds an equity interest. Financial and integrity due diligence are integrated into the Bank's normal approval of new business and the monitoring of its existing transactions. The EBRD publishes the OCCO\u2019s anti-corruption report on its web site. Moreover, the OCCO has the specific responsibility for administering the EBRD\u2019s accountability mechanism, currently the Independent Recourse Mechanism soon to be replaced with the Project Complaint Mechanism, which assesses and reviews complaints about projects financed by the EBRD and provides, where warranted, a determination as to whether in approving a particular project, the EBRD acted in compliance with its relevant policies.
