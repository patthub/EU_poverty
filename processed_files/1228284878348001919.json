        "STRIVE for Development 2 1 Introduction T hE woRld is becoming less peaceful: global incidents of conflict, terrorism and violent crime are all rising, some quite significantly. Yet understanding and responding to the drivers of this insecurity is becoming increasingly challenging, whether in relation to insurgent conflict, ideology-related violence or a return to inter-state conflict. The impact is felt in the form of chronic humanitarian needs, unprecedented migration flows and growing inequality, which can in turn exacerbate the root causes and drivers of insecurity. It is in this broad context that violent extremist ideologies are gaining an unprecedented level of traction across the globe, taking root in local communities in a range of fragile states, and attracting a growing number of disenfranchised citizens in other, more stable states. Their incitement of hate, violence and terror should have no place in a modern and civilised world. It is important to emphasise that violent extremism is a global problem, which can manifest itself in all places, amidst all cultures and ideologies, but with different characteristics. Radicalisers work by pointing to social, political and economic injustice and playing on the grievances, real or perceived, of their followers. Often, they promote a belief that these grievances result from a corrupt system of politics or ideologies, which they incite their followers to fight against. To be persuasive, many of the arguments put forth are based on facts, but portrayed in a highly selective and incomplete way, thus distorting reality. Equally importantly, the means by which radicalisers incite followers to seek redress for injustices is through violence, oppression and victimisation. The challenge for policy-makers has arguably never been greater; the international community needs to bring all of its tools to the table both to resolve on-going crises and prevent their re-occurrence. The European Union (EU), with its Member States, is the world\u2019s largest development actor, with a comprehensive global reach and a range of instruments to allow it to engage on continental, regional and national levels. These cover a range of different approaches, from long-term preventive engagements on trade, infrastructure and development-orientated service delivery, to short-term stabilisation, targeted humanitarian relief and recovery measures. \u2018The EU is the world\u2019s largest development actor, with a comprehensive global reach\u2019 ",
        "Strengthening Resilience to Violence and Extremism \u00a9 PA Images Addressing both manifestations of, and the conditions conducive to, violent extremism is a developmental challenge. A core part of addressing this challenge lies in strengthening the fundamental building blocks of equitable development, human rights, governance and the rule of law. A diverse range of stakeholders need to be brought into the process and empowered, including state actors and security institutions, as well as members of communities and civil society who can speak courageously and compellingly about truth, tolerance and acceptance. While a strong response to violent extremism is required, this should be based on civil liberties and should address insecurity, inequality and marginalisation. The EU is committed to working with partners across the globe to achieve this in the interests of all citizens. Over the last decade, the European Commission has invested heavily in combating this threat by addressing conditions conducive to violent extremism, building capacity to reinforce the rule of law and promoting development. As a core part of this, the European Commission aims to strengthen and build the resilience of vulnerable communities through capacity building initiatives. This brochure highlights a number of projects funded or supported by the European Commission worldwide that contribute to this effort. \u2018A diverse range of stakeholders need to be empowered\u2019 \u2018Violent extremist ideologies are gaining an unprecedented level of traction across the globe, taking root in local communities and controlling territory in a number of fragile states\u2019 3 ",
        "STRIVE for Development 4 2 Concepts & Definitions T ERRORISM, RADICALISATION and extremism are subjective concepts that have different meanings for different people. Furthermore, their meanings are constantly evolving as they manifest themselves in different ways in different parts of the world, exploiting new vulnerabilities, technologies and approaches. When engaging in preventing and countering violent extremism (P/CVE) programmes and initiatives, it is important to understand and be sensitive to the different ways in which such terminology is used in different localities. At the same time, at the level of global policy, in order for the EU and its partners to work effectively together, it is vital to develop common definitions. This lexicon, which deals with very sensitive issues, has to remain neutral and non-emotive to avoid confusion, prejudice, stigmatisation or pre-emptive conclusions. This chapter provides a brief outline of the most important concepts at hand. Defining Terrorism The Member States of the United Nations (UN) have been unable to agree on a common definition of terrorism. This is because the concept is invariably political and cannot be framed in a manner that excludes the state. Instead, many Member States have developed their own, tailored definitions of terrorism from which they have developed laws to deal with terrorists. However, numerous UN conventions on terrorist acts provide global definitions for specific terrorism-related offences. In addition, whilst there is no general UN definition of terrorism, in 2006 the General Assembly adopted the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy which reflects a degree of global consensus on the issue. The important point to remember is that terrorism is a complex and contested issue, as are the associated labels of extremism, violent extremism and radicalisation. Meanwhile, the EU, according to the Treaties under which it was established, is able to establish minimum rules concerning the definition of criminal offences in cross-border serious crime and terrorism. This led to the 2002 Framework Decision on combating \u2018Defining terrorism is an emotive issue\u2019 ",
        "5 Strengthening Resilience to Violence and Extremism terrorism and its subsequent 2008 amendment, through which the EU established a list of terrorist offences, setting out a list of EU-wide standards. This list will be expanded with the adoption of a Directive on combating terrorism, planned to take place by 2017. other regional organisations such as the Council of Europe and the African Union have also adopted their own counter-terrorism conventions. These include the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism and the Organization of African Unity Convention on the Prevention and Combating of Terrorism , which also provide common definitions of terrorism. Despite the lack of a universal definition, and acknowledging the range of definitions put forward as part of the aforementioned conventions, many countries understand terrorism as \u2018 acts committed with the objective of seriously intimidating a population, destabilising or destroying structures of a country or international organisation or making a government abstain from performing actions \u2019. 1 Within this and many other definitions of terrorism, those who are perceived to have facilitated an act of terrorism, even if they did not participate in the violent act itself, are still considered to be culpable. Thus, in EU Member States non-violent behaviour such as financing of terrorism, extremist incitement or terrorist facilitation are all criminal offences. Extremism and Violent Extremism Extremism is generally understood as constituting views that are far from those of the majority of the population. Accordingly, one definition describes extremism as \u2018activities (beliefs, attitudes, feelings, actions, strategies) of a character far removed from the ordinary\u2019. 2 Though this is clearly a relative term which invites disagreement regarding benchmarks, it is broadly agreed that extremist views are not necessarily illegal and do not automatically lead to violence or harm. Indeed those with extremist views, who may also choose to observe extreme practices with no impact on the civil liberties of fellow citizens, are rightly protected under fundamental freedoms and human rights norms. Extremism becomes a concern when those views threaten democratic and tolerant societal ideas, or promote the use of violence to coerce their followers or to achieve their objectives. This form of extremism is described as violent extremism, a term which remains contested, but which generally refers to the creation of ideologically motivated or justified violence, as well as support for such acts. Neither the UN nor the EU offers an official definition of violent extremism. As highlighted in the UN Secretary- General\u2019s 2016 Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism, the definitions of terrorism 1 EU\u2019s Council Framework Decision 2002/475/JHA of 13 June 2002 on combating terrorism, and amending decision 2008/919/JHA. 2 Peter T Coleman and Andrea Bartoli, Addressing Extremism, White Paper. New York: The International Center for Cooperation and Conflict Resolution, Columbia University, p. 1. \u2018Terrorism is a complex and contested issue, as are the associated labels of extremism, violent extremism and radicalisation\u2019 ",
        "6 \u2018Radicalisers work by pointing to social, political and economic injustice around their followers\u2019 and violent extremism are \u2018the prerogative of Member States and must be consistent with their obligations under international law, in particular international human rights law\u2019. 3 However, USAID defines violent extremism as \u2018advocating, engaging in, preparing, or otherwise supporting ideologically motivated or justified violence to further social, economic and political objectives\u2019. 4 Radicalisation Like terrorism and violent extremism, radicalisation is a contested term with various definitions. 5 It is commonly understood, however, as the social and psychological process of incrementally experienced commitment to extremist political and religious ideologies. 6 It does not necessarily mean that those affected will become violent. However, when a decision is made that fear, terror and violence are justified to achieve ideological, political or social change, radicalisation to violent extremism occurs. The term \u2018recruitment\u2019 is often used in conjunction with radicalisation. However, the two cannot always be used interchangeably. Recruitment acknowledges the presence of an external influence drawing individuals into violent extremism, while the term \u2018radicalisation\u2019 has been criticised for assuming that the individual develops extreme views before searching out terrorist groups, rather than vice versa. 7 3 UN Secretary-General, Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism, January 2016. 4 USAID, \u2018The Development Response to Violent Extremism and Insurgency: Putting Principles into Practice\u2019, September 2011. 5 Alex P Schmid, \u2018Radicalization, De-Radicalisation, Counter-Radicalisation: A Conceptual Discussion and Literature Review\u2019, International Centre for Counter-Terrorism Research Paper, March 2013. 6 John Horgan, Walking Away From Terrorism: Accounts of Disengagement from Radical and Extremist Movements (London: Routledge, 2009). 7 M Sedgwick, \u2018The Concept of Radicalisation as a Source of Confusion\u2019, Terrorism and Political Violence (Vol. 22, No. 4, 2010). ",
        "7 When discussing both radicalisation and recruitment, it is essential to acknowledge that violent extremism is multi-factorial, extremely diverse, and cannot be predicted by a single variable. Indeed, the growth of violent extremist movements depends on particular alignments of situational, social, cultural and individual factors. These play out at the macro (national, regional and global), meso (community or identity group), and micro (individual) levels, with the precise combination of motivating factors varying by location. 8 8 Harriet Allan et al., \u2018Drivers of Violent Extremism: Hypotheses and Literature Review\u2019, Royal United Services Institute, 16 October 2015. \u2018When a decision is made that fear, terror and violence are justified to achieve ideological, political or social change, radicalisation to violent extremism occurs\u2019 Public Domain \u2018Violent extremist ideologies have found fertile ground in fragile communities characterised by little access to development\u2019 ",
        "8 P/CVE Concepts The primary aim of the European Commission\u2019s Directorate-General for International Development and Cooperation assistance is to promote sustainable development. However, in many parts of the world, basic development goals have not been met due to insecurity, including that caused by violent extremism. In turn, violent extremist ideologies often find space to thrive in fragile communities suffering from a lack of development. It is for this reason that the EU is committed to promoting development approaches alongside dedicated efforts to prevent and counter violent extremism around the world. This is in line with the UN Secretary-General\u2019s 2016 Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism, which recognises the need for a practical and comprehensive approach to addressing the drivers of violent extremism wherever they manifest themselves. While development organisations, practitioners and scholars have individual preferences for applying the terms \u2018preventing violent extremism\u2019 and \u2018countering violent extremism\u2019, there is often little difference in the specific objectives and actions on the ground. The overarching objective of the EU\u2019s work on P/CVE is to assist individuals and communities to become resilient to violent extremism through the development of critical thinking skills, means of self-expression, empowerment to communicate ideas, and the possession of a greater stake in the social and economic systems under which they live. \u00a9 PA Images \u2018The EU is committed to promoting development approaches alongside dedicated efforts to prevent and counter violent extremism\u2019 ",
        "9 Strengthening Resilience to Violence and Extremism In line with this, P/CVE can be understood to constitute all actions that strengthen the resilience of individuals and communities to the appeal of radicalisers and violent extremism, from interfaith dialogues to vocational training, mentorship programmes, training of state governance and security actors and community debates on sensitive topics. The concept has evolved in response to a growing understanding of the need to complement hard counter-terrorism responses with efforts to address the enabling environment for violent extremism. Though multiple definitions exist, P/CVE programming can thus be defined as \u2018a broad range of non-coercive and preventative activities that are united by the objective of counteracting the key drivers of violent extremism specific to the locations in which the programmes are taking place. Such programmes include activities that target individuals specifically identified as potentially \u201cat risk\u201d of being drawn to violence to the extent that this is feasible in each location\u2019. 9 P/CVE activities may overlap substantially with those belonging to another area of programming \u2013 that of risk reduction, which targets those with a violent extremist history. Risk reduction can be said to involve \u2018a wide range of non-coercive activities (such as vocational training, counselling, exposure to counter-ideologies \u2026 and so on) applied with the aim of ensuring that individuals who previously contributed to violent extremism (for instance, through perpetrating attacks, manufacturing explosives, planning, financing, collecting intelligence, recruiting and so on) do not return to such activities\u2019. 10 Though often confused with the terms \u2018de-radicalisation\u2019 and \u2018disengagement\u2019, risk reduction is more flexible, in that it seeks to cover both adaptations in attitudes or behaviours on the part of affected individuals. The European Commission\u2019s P/CVE projects span eight themes: development of education; media awareness; empowerment of women; youth work; socio-economic inclusion; governance capacity building; transitional justice; and inter-communal activities including sport and inter-faith dialogue. While the majority of the European Commission\u2019s development projects are not specifically focused on P/CVE, many can provide collateral benefits in strengthening community resilience to violent extremism and addressing its root causes. An EU training programme has been developed and is being delivered progressively in a number of regions, aimed at making those who are delivering, planning and resourcing development activities more sensitive to P/CVE-specific issues. 9 James Khalil and Martine Zeuthen, \u2018Countering Violent Extremism and Risk Reduction: A Guide to Programme Design and Evaluation\u2019, RUSI Whitehall Report 2-16, June 2016. 10 Ibid. \u2018The overarching objective is for individuals and communities to become resilient to extremism and radicalisation\u2019 ",
        "STRIVE for Development 10 3 EU Counter-Terrorism and P/CVE Policy T HE EUROPEAN Union has long recognised the need to address the threat of terrorism, both at home and abroad. In June 2016, the Global Strategy for the EU\u2019s Foreign and Security Policy 1 was presented as a new overarching foreign and security policy framework and reference document for the EU. The document identifies terrorism as one of the key threats facing the EU, and highlights the need to further develop cooperation with the EU\u2019s neighbourhood and other regions on countering terrorism and violent extremism. The need for enhanced international cooperation on countering terrorism and violent extremism, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa, is also emphasised in the European Council Conclusions of 9 February 2015. 2 In 2005, the EU Counter-Terrorism (CT) Strategy was adopted with the aim to \u2018reduce terrorism globally, whilst respecting human rights\u2019. The strategy is based on four pillars: \u2022 Respond : to prepare for and minimise the consequences of a successful terrorist attack. \u2022 Protect : to protect citizens and infrastructure, and reduce vulnerability to an attack. \u2022 Pursue : to pursue terrorists, bring them to justice, and build local capacity to do so. \u2022 Prevent : to prevent people turning to terrorism by tackling the factors which can lead to radicalisation and recruitment. Under the \u2018Prevent\u2019 pillar, the EU has been developing policy frameworks and implementation measures both within the EU and in key strategic locations worldwide. It is now widely accepted that \u2018hard\u2019 CT measures from the Pursue and Respond streams cannot address the complex nature of terrorism and violent extremism alone. In particular, such approaches fail to address the enabling environment for violent 1 European External Action Service \u2018A Global Strategy for the European Union\u2019s Foreign and Security Policy - Shared Vision, Common Action: A Stronger Europe\u2019, June 2016. 2 Council of the EU \u2018Council Conclusions on Counter-Terrorism\u2019 (6048/15), 9 February 2015. \u2018The European Union has long recognised the need to address the threat of terrorism, both at home and abroad\u2019 ",
        "11 Strengthening Resilience to Violence and Extremism extremism. Alongside such measures, therefore, proactive prevention is vital. Preventing violent extremism is also a key priority of the EU\u2019s Counter-Terrorism Coordinator. The basis of the EU\u2019s \u2018Prevent\u2019 work is the EU Strategy for Combating Radicalisation and Recruitment to Terrorism , which was most recently revised in May 2014. 3 The revised strategy identifies priority areas for EU action, both within and outside of the EU, including the promotion of equal opportunities, community-level efforts, counter-narratives and capacity-building. It calls for a joint effort between relevant stakeholders at local, regional, national and international levels to support vulnerable countries to counter terrorist recruitment and to build community resilience to radicalisation. The need for a comprehensive approach in preventing radicalisation to violent extremism was also highlighted in the Communication from the European Commission of June 2016. 4 Moreover, the revised strategy encourages the EU to consider radicalisation \u2013 and to raise awareness of counter-radicalisation work \u2013 within its development programming. The European Commission has long recognised the so-called \u2018security-development nexus\u2019 \u2013 which dictates that there can be no security without development, and vice versa. Fragile states, weak governance, socio-economic and socio-political grievances provide uninhibited operating spaces for violent extremists and fertile grounds for recruitment and radicalisation. Armed conflicts also offer compelling images and narratives that can be used to radicalise. P/CVE, and the stabilising impact that building resilience to violent extremism can have, is therefore both directly and indirectly relevant to improving the delivery of EU assistance and development aid in vulnerable countries. This is also reflected in the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 16 on peace and security, which states that the international community should \u2018[p]romote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development\u2019 and \u2018[s]trengthen relevant national institutions, including through international cooperation, for building capacity at all levels, in particular in developing countries, to prevent violence and combat terrorism and crime\u2019. 5 The European Commission\u2019s P/CVE programming follows a number of general principles: \u2022 It must be evidence-based. \u2022 The local context must be taken into account and programming tailored accordingly. \u2022 A multidisciplinary approach must be adopted, involving a range of actors beyond traditional law enforcement and military services, including health, educational, good-governance and human-rights agencies, and civil society. 3 Council of the EU, \u2018The European Union Strategy for Combating Radicalisation and Recruitment to Terrorism\u2019, 24 November 2005; Council of the EU, \u2018Revised EU Strategy for Combating Radicalisation and Recruitment to Terrorism\u2019, 19 May 2014 (adopted June 2014). 4 European Commission Communication on Supporting the Prevention of Radicalisation Leading to Violent Extremism, COM (2016) 379 final of 14 June 2016. 5 United Nations, Sustainable Development Goal 16, Target 16.a. \u2018The stabilising impact that building resilience to violent extremism can have is relevant to improving the delivery of EU assistance and development aid in vulnerable countries\u2019 ",
        "\u00a9 PA Images 12 EU-focused initiatives are an important component of the European Commission\u2019s P/CVE work. However, there has long been a recognition that P/CVE work at home needs to be aligned with efforts to prevent and counter violent extremism further afield. A number of EU Member States also maintain their own internal and external P/CVE policies and programmes with similar principles and objectives. In light of this, both the EU and its Member States have increasingly sought to draw on each other\u2019s experiences. EU programmes that contribute to P/CVE are drawn from the full range of European thematic and geographic instruments, such as the European Development Fund (EDF), sub-regional and regional instruments, thematic funds on governance and justice, and the Instrument Contributing to Stability and Peace (IcSP), which addresses transnational and cross-border challenges. \u2018Programmes that contribute to P/CVE are drawn from the full range of the EU\u2019s different thematic and geographic instruments\u2019 ",

The European Commission\u2019s P/CVE activities cover a wide and expanding geographic area, including West, North and East Africa; the Middle East; South and Southeast Asia. P/CVE initiatives in these regions generally fall under three broad categories, which in turn cover eight thematic areas. The first category is public engagement , which focuses on reaching broad audiences with key messaging, through media campaigns and intercommunal cultural activities. The second category involves more targeted interventions aimed at vulnerable communities or individuals. These include improving socio-economic inclusion and services, providing educational programmes, developing female and youth leaders, transitional justice and disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration (DDR) initiatives. The third broad category involves efforts to enhance the P/CVE capacities of relevant governmental and non-governmental actors. These forms of governance capacity-building include work carried out specifically with police, civil society and the media, as well as conflict-mitigation and peace-building experts, and policy-makers. Under the Instrument contributing to Stability and Peace, a number of global P/CVE-specific actions have been launched around the world under the Strengthening Resilience to Violent Extremism ( STRIVE ) programme. These STRIVE actions aim to facilitate innovative P/CVE projects in collaboration with local communities, to create conditions conducive to development, and resilience towards violent extremism. Several of these actions are included in this chapter, followed by regional and national actions that similarly aim to build resilience to violent extremism. \u2018The European Commission\u2019s P/CVE activities cover a wide and expanding geographic area\u2019 ",

High youth unemployment, growing levels of economic inequality, and a lack of voice in decision-making and democratic processes are just some of the factors that fuel youth disaffection and marginalisation worldwide. As a result, youth are especially susceptible to ideological radicalisation and recruitment by violent extremists.

This group will act as \u2018champions\u2019 of the issue, and will carry out a year-long programme in 2016 built around two key areas of activity: 1. Ongoing advocacy to increase awareness of youth-led efforts to prevent and counter violent extremism and radicalisation. Each youth advocate will produce content for digital and traditional media, including blogs and op-eds detailing their own work and experiences, as well as giving interviews and producing videos to prevent and counter violent extremism in their communities. This content will be published on a dedicated section of the Kofi Annan Foundation website, and disseminated broadly through digital platforms. 2. Development of a toolkit containing advice and strategies to empower youth worldwide to prevent and counter violent extremism in their own communities. Over the course of the year, ten youth advocates will take part in conferences, summits and meetings which address the role of young people in preventing and countering violent extremism, and in building inclusive societies. Drawing on the expertise and knowledge gained at these meetings, as well as their own experiences, these advocates will develop advice and strategies to empower youth worldwide to prevent and counter violent extremism.

The initiative builds on developments and lessons learned since the Madrid Agenda developed in the aftermath of the Madrid terror attack of March 2004. The primary asset of Club de Madrid is its membership, which includes over 90 distinguished former heads of state and government of democratic nations. The Club de Madrid seeks to leverage the first-hand experience of its members to assist countries with critical challenges they face, such as that posed by violent extremism. A distinguished group of scholars, former policy-makers and political leaders provides additional advice and assistance on such issues. Since 2015, the EU has supported the Madrid+10 project, with the overall goal of supporting the establishment of an authoritative global consensus on preventing and countering radicalisation and violent extremism. This goal is based on the following three pillars: 1. Creating a process through which expertise and political experience are channelled into the formulation of a global consensus on preventing and countering radicalisation and violent extremism. The consensus document, to be signed by all participants, will consist of a Declaration of Principles linked to four policy briefs produced as part of the Policy Dialogue (see 2).

        "STRIVE for Development Strengthening Resilience to Violent Extremism (STRIVE) in the Horn of Africa Aims and Objectives T HE 2013 Westgate shopping centre attack in Nairobi, as well as subsequent attacks across Kenya, have underlined the continued threat of terrorism in the country. Ongoing violence and instability in neighbouring Somalia and continuing tensions in the coastal region of Kenya, in particular, are just some of the factors contributing to the threat of violent extremism in the Horn of Africa. The region faces a turbulent security and development environment, suffering from terrorism and violent extremism associated with a range of social, economic, political and religious issues.

Running from January 2014 to January 2017, the programme covers three thematic priorities \u2013 youth engagement, investing in women and capacity-building \u2013 and comprises four main work streams, which are outlined below. Methods and Activities Building the capacity of security-sector and law-enforcement authorities to engage with civil society in fighting violent extremism Law-enforcement authorities are key stakeholders in P/CVE, yet government counter-terrorism policies can lead to grievances and encourage the spread of violent extremism. It is therefore crucial for law-enforcement agencies to engage in structured Prevent-type activities and build partnerships with relevant civil-society organisations. STRIVE is helping to develop P/CVE best practice in the horn of Africa through education, training and capacity-building with both law-enforcement agencies and civil-society actors. \u00a9 PA Images \u2018The programme aims to understand the drivers of violent extremism through evidence-based analysis\u2019 23 ",

STRIVE engages with women\u2019s organisations to contribute to building greater resilience in communities vulnerable to radicalisation. This includes the organisation of training workshops, which provide guidance to women\u2019s organisations on how they can more effectively engage with security providers at both the state and clan level to establish or improve de-radicalisation initiatives. Increasing understanding of the challenges faced by EU-born Somali youth in Somaliland When the programme began, it was assumed that European-born Somali youth faced a range of challenges on their return to Somaliland, including alienation from their local communities, which was believed to contribute to vulnerability to radicalisation. However, research by the STRIVE team has, to an extent, inverted such assumptions, with diaspora youth often appearing more inclined than more conservative local youth to support the use of violence as a means of expressing ideological values. Based on these findings, STRIVE has engaged with and supported key civil-society actors to facilitate dialogue between diaspora and local youth, with the aim of strengthening resilience to violent extremism. Identifying and tackling the drivers for violent extremism among youth in Kenya While factors such as limited education, blocked political participation and the absence of rule of law are drivers of youth radicalisation and violent extremism in much of the Horn of Africa, identity-based factors and narratives of historic injustice can be equally important. STRIVE aims to develop a greater understanding of these drivers in two areas affected by violent conflict: Eastleigh and its environs in Nairobi; and the coastal region of Kenya. STRIVE seeks to use this analysis to identify and support best practice by actors working with youth in those communities to prevent and counter violent extremism. 24 ",
        "Strengthening Resilience to Violence and Extremism Key Points/Lessons Learned P/CVE is still relatively new in the Horn of Africa, and there is a general lack of familiarity with this policy area among national governments and agencies, donor countries and civil-society organisations. As such, a number of STRIVE \u2019s pilot projects include workshops to educate and inform local partners about P/CVE, the differences between non-violent and violent extremism, and the process of radicalisation. Similarly, very little monitoring and evaluation of P/CVE initiatives has occurred, and documented evidence of the impact of previous and ongoing programmes is limited. Some data exists but more can be done to collect and analyse relevant information. For this reason, STRIVE was designed to develop best practices around P/CVE programming in the horn of Africa and provide recommendations to contribute to increased impact and more focused interventions. \u2018STRIVE\u2019s pilot projects include workshops to educate and inform local partners about P/CVE\u2019 Diagram Illustrating Factors Driving the Radicalisation Process Vast majority who are influenced by general grievances but not using violence \u2022 Poverty \u2022 Unemployment \u2022 Political marginalisation \u2022 Frustrations \u2022 Willingness to act on frustrations \u2022 Attracted to a message of violence \u2022 Pull factors \u2022 Will to use violence \u2022 Actively pursuing political goals with any means Smaller group who are susceptible to a violent message and could end up using violence Small group that uses violence to express their political beliefs Source: STRIVE Horn of Africa.

The vulnerability of these countries and their border areas stems from a range of factors, including weak governance, corruption, food and socio-economic insecurity and inter-ethnic tensions. All these have contributed to the creation of an environment conducive to the spread of a truly trans-regional form of radicalisation, which has allowed terrorist groups to establish themselves in some parts of the region, leading to a deeper destabilisation of those states and societies. To help address these challenges, a targeted \u20ac1.675 million EU regional support project is being implemented under the Instrument contributing to Stability and Peace. The project runs from January 2015 to November 2016, and its objective is to enrich knowledge and inform decision-making on radicalisation and violent extremism by governments, local authorities and donors in the Sahel-Maghreb regions and their border areas. The aim is to provide decision-makers at all levels with a toolbox to assist them in tackling conditions conducive to radicalisation. The approach this action takes is based on the integration of in-depth local analyses into solutions for both CVE policy-making and the formulation of strategic recommendations. By establishing a regional network of experts (scholars and practitioners), the project integrates knowledge and experience on radicalisation and CVE from a range of sources. It further aims to support practitioners in the region by contributing to the compilation of strategic and academic resources, from local, regional and international perspectives.

The \u20ac5 million project was launched under the European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI) and is set to run for four years. The aim of the programme is to launch, implement and evaluate innovative P/CVE projects and to disseminate lessons learned and best practices, in collaboration with civil society and non-state actors. Harnessing the efforts of civil society and non-state actors is crucial to both P/CVE and broader development. Within this project, triangular (South-South) cooperation is actively encouraged and facilitated. As in STRIVE Horn of Africa, a thematic approach to developing counter-radicalisation programmes is taken, with this project prioiritising actions relating to the media, education, religion and culture. Media, in particular, is an increasingly important theme in light of growing concern over online violent-extremist messaging. This project supports a range of activities that focus on counter-narrative messaging, the use of the Internet and social media, disengagement, awareness-raising and sensitisation of front-line workers. Furthermore, in light of the problem posed by foreign fighters, there is a focus on preventing their radicalisation and recruitment across the Sahel-Maghreb region.

In 1950, the population was around 100 million; today it is around 380 million. One third of the region\u2019s population is under the age of 15, with 70% under the age of 30. Research suggests that large youth populations such as this are often correlated with conflict, posing a distinct challenge to government and civil society as they seek to address their needs. The conflict in Syria, the scale of recruitment to Daesh from Tunisia particularly, as well as recent terrorist attacks in the country, has made this situation even more challenging. To address the specific challenges relating to violent extremism and youth in the MENA region, the EU is funding the pilot project \u2018Strengthening Resilience in MENA\u2019 under the Instrument contributing to Stability and Peace.

Violent extremist prisoners can network in prisons, radicalise other prisoners, gain access to a large pool of potential recruits, or coordinate violent extremist actions outside of their prison. Certain prisons have become incubators for radicalisation and recruitment, whilst others have managed to contain the problem and promote reform through implementing positive prison standards and practices. The UN Secretary-General\u2019s January 2016 Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism emphasises the risk of radicalisation in prisons, particularly as a result of inhumane detention conditions and treatment of inmates. The Plan stresses the need for the development of safeguards to prevent the spread of extremist ideology in prison settings. As a joint EU and UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) initiative, the Prison De-Radicalisation Project aims to increase the capacity of selected countries in the Middle East, North Africa and Asia to effectively manage violent extremist prisoners and to prevent radicalisation in prison systems.

As of May 2014, the EU has funded crisis-response measures, assisting the Nigerian government in establishing national programmes and strategies to counter terrorism, and in adapting judicial proceedings and mechanisms to better address terrorist threats. The programme was implemented over a period of 24 months, with a budget of \u20ac9.9 million, under the Instrument for Stability (IfS). The EU\u2019s assistance on this action has focused on two key areas. These include, first, the work of the justice sector and, second, the work of the Office of the National Security Advisor, an institution mandated to implement and coordinate actions in the fight against terrorism. With regard to the Nigerian justice sector, EU assistance has been used to adapt and improve legislation affecting the investigation, prosecution and adjudication of terrorism-related crime. As a result, Nigerian justice authorities have been able to improve evidence-based prosecution and adjudication, and to adapt legislation to the specific requirements of terrorism-related cases, in line with international human rights standards and best practices.

        "STRIVE for Development The Mindanao Trust Fund \u2013 Reconstruction and Development Programme in Conflict- Affected Areas M INDANAO IS the second largest island of the Philippines, and is home to about 23 million people, almost a quarter of the total population of the Philippines. Government statistics from 2009 show that of the 20 poorest municipalities in the Philippines, seventeen are in Mindanao, with poverty affecting the majority of the population. These persistent, high levels of poverty can largely be attributed to conflict and instability, fuelled by widespread socio-economic disparities. Addressing poverty and deprivation are therefore key components of the region\u2019s peace and development needs. Peace and development efforts in Mindanao have followed a two-pronged approach. First, formal peace talks between the Philippine Government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, the leading revolutionary group, which culminated in the signing of the Comprehensive Agreement on Bangsamoro in March 2014, ended almost fifteen years of peace negotiations. Second, in parallel to the peace talks, a calibrated approach to development was pursued to reduce poverty through the focused delivery of social and economic services, improved governance, and community-level capacity building to promote participation and inclusion, resolve disputes and promote peace. It is against this backdrop that the multi-donor Mindanao Trust Fund for Reconstruction and Development Programme in Conflict-Affected Areas in Mindanao was established. It was setup in 2005 as a confidence-building measure to accompany peace talks. Since then, the programme has deepened and expanded its partnership with local communities by supporting community-driven development and reconstruction activities on the ground. It has contributed not only to promoting economic opportunity and access to basic services, but also to building capacity among institutions and enhancing social cohesion among diverse community groups.

In the meantime, communities have become restless \u2013 and there is a real risk that this could lead to a rise in extremism, radicalisation and violence. It is important at this time for both the Philippine Government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front to show an ongoing commitment to peace, with the support of the international community. Moreover, it is essential that marginalised communities receive better access to basic social services and livelihood opportunities. The operations of the Mindanao Trust Fund are crucial in this context, as it seeks to provide targeted support to vulnerable and conflict-affected communities.

These groups are in turn often influenced by foreign organisations and frequently linked to regional crime and trafficking networks. In recent years, the number of terrorist attacks in Mauritania has increased. Large groups of Mauritanian youth are vulnerable to recruitment by violent extremist groups, faced as they are by economic and social insecurity and the demographic challenges posed by a rapidly expanding youth population. The unemployment rate is estimated at 50% for young men (aged between 15 and 24) in urban areas and 69% for young women. The European Commission\u2019s \u2018Programme for Conflict Prevention and Intercultural Dialogue in Mauritania\u2019 aims to strengthen the resilience of these youth to violent extremism in Mauritania. The \u20ac6-million programme is supported under the European Development Fund and will run from March 2015 to September 2018. The nature of recent terrorist attacks perpetrated in Mauritania supports the claim that disadvantaged groups, including youth, are particularly susceptible to violent extremist ideas.

Taysir Micro-Finance Greenfield was launched in September 2012 as a \u20ac9.17 million programme, to run until December 2018. The EU is contributing \u20ac1.4 million to the programme, which aims to improve rural populations\u2019 access to finance under the framework of rural development. It does so by establishing a micro-finance institution, addressing the needs of the poor through the provision of financial education and support in the expansion of their economic activities. The programme aims to increase active micro-entrepreneurs\u2019 access to loans. The programme currently provides financial services to at least 40,000 clients, of which 24,000 live in marginalised zones, and many are unemployed, especially in rural areas. Taysir loan recipients benefit not only from financial inclusion, but also from technical assistance and mentoring through the Taysir Conseil, the institution\u2019s social-inclusion branch. The provision of micro-credit is prioritised in rural areas where no other micro- finance institutions operate. The programme supports efforts to raise awareness and build capacity, with a specific focus on financial inclusion and the use of mobile banking. Programme managers are tasked with assisting loan recipients to establish sustainable and regular sources of income. Meanwhile, local economic actors are empowered to reinforce local networks to support social and financial inclusion of the poor. The programme is, in particular, working to develop practical tools and facilitate knowledge-sharing amongst farmers on how they can improve the quality and quantity of their milk production for commercialisation. These actions are expected to generate a number of positive outcomes in terms of enhancing financial inclusion in Tunisia, including, amongst others, increased access to micro-finance via Taysir and the provision of support systems to clients, through assistance in the use of mobile banking and household bookkeeping EU Action on P/CVE: Tunisia 42 \u2018The programme aims to increase active micro- entrepreneurs\u2019 access to loans\u2019 \u00a9 E U a n d T a y s i r \u00a9 E U a n d T a y s i r ",

In support of this process, the EU has funded the project \u2018Renewed Jewish-Arab Relations in Israel: A Dialogue Platform\u2019 in Israel, under the EU Partnership for Peace programme. The EU has contributed \u20ac470,000 to the project, which has a total budget of \u20ac643,000.

The project aims to transform conflicting views held by Israeli citizens to encourage more harmonious Arab-Jewish relationships. Addressing all aspects of the relationships between Arab and Jewish communities in Israel, and using the Applied Deliberative Dialogue (ADD) technique, a productive dialogue is ongoing both between policy-makers and between citizens. By engaging a pilot group of Israeli citizens in the ADD technique, the project targets key communities through faith-based groups which rarely interact with each other. Using these skills to discuss core and often sensitive issues with groups that are often thought of as \u2018the other\u2019, dialogues supported under this project were developed through the writing of position papers, which were distributed amongst decision-makers to encourage calls for action. Notably, these activities engaged citizens from the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community, who had never participated in intercommunal activities, leading eventually to the integration of Arab participants into the dialogue forum.

These bespoke training courses are designed and delivered to enable participants to better recognise the warning signs of radicalisation, and to orientate their programmes to address vulnerable communities, and prevent and counter incipient violent extremism. The objectives are to increase understanding of P/CVE concepts, terminology and policy, as well as to provide methods, tools and approaches to design and implement P/CVE programmes. The training is based on international development and P/CVE best practice and has a distinct operational focus. It includes user- friendly guidelines on, and constructive ideas for, P/CVE programming and implementation, especially in relation to how third countries could be effectively supported in their own efforts. Region-specific three-day workshops for practitioners were delivered in East, West and North Africa and South Asia during 2013 and 2014, and in the Middle East, Central Asia and South-East Asia in 2015. Four workshops are planned for 2016/17, covering the Western Balkans, North Africa and East Africa, with a fourth region still to be determined. One-day courses for EU policy and strategy staff in Brussels and half-day briefings for EU senior staff in Brussels were also delivered in 2015, with more planned for 2016/17. The workshops consider what kinds of P/CVE engagement may be suitable in each country or region, how existing development programming in different areas may contribute to addressing the challenge, and the way in which specific interventions can reduce the appeal and recruiting potential of violent extremists. Each workshop is tailored to the region in which it is conducted.

While this brochure has an external focus, it is useful to keep in mind the P/CVE initiatives that the EU is undertaking at home. This chapter highlights two specific initiatives undertaken within the EU. Terrorism and Radicalisation, Europe Aims and Objectives Terrorism and Radicalisation in Europe (TerRa) has four main objectives. These are, first, to support front-line workers who come into daily contact with groups who may be vulnerable to radicalisation; second, to support victims of terrorism and former radicals in using their testimonies to contribute to prevention work; third, to integrate state-of-the-art knowledge on radicalisation and de-radicalisation into the European Citizenship Programme through a curriculum for high-school and university students; and, fourth to deliver practical policy advice to European governments based on in- depth research and expert consensus. description of Activities TerRa is a European programme supported by the European Commission Directorate- General for Migration and Home Affairs, comprising a European network-based prevention and learning programme. It is now in its second phase \u2013 TerRa II, initiated in 2014 upon completion of TerRa I.

On the basis of this research, TerRa\u2019s aim has been to make a practical contribution to the prevention of radicalisation and political violence in a European context. As part of this, one of TerRa\u2019s objectives was to support target groups coming into professional contact with individuals vulnerable to radicalisation by providing practical tools for use in their daily work. One of the main tasks was to identify these target groups, who mostly comprise teachers, youth workers, social workers, police officers, prison, probation and parole officers, journalists and religious leaders. Alongside this, TerRa I involved a focus on the personal experiences of victims and those previously involved in terrorism. The aim was to assess how the testimonies of these individuals might offer an effective platform from which to engage in dialogue with at- risk individuals. Building on these experiences, TerRa I aimed to provide a broad platform for member states and other stakeholders to exchange available materials, lessons and experiences, as well as practical tools, advice and policy input. This platform was designed to allow network coverage in all member states, in close cooperation with the network of Associations of Victims (nAVT) and the Radicalisation Awareness network (RAN). Other outputs, developed on the basis of the initial research phase, include an overview and description of methods and approaches to screening victims and recognising signs of radicalisation; a manual with recommendations for a broad group of front-liners; and guidance for journalists and policy-makers. Following on from this, TerRa II seeks specifically to develop a citizenship curriculum for European secondary students, deliver policy advice to European governments on radicalisation and de-radicalisation, and provide training to professionals across Europe.

        "STRIVE for Development 50 Aims and Objectives The prevention of radicalisation is a key part of the fight against terrorism, as highlighted in the European Agenda on Security. 1 The European Commission Communication of 14 June 2016 addresses the EU\u2019s contribution to supporting Member States in preventing radicalisation leading to violent extremism in the form of terrorism. 2 Countering radicalisation and preventing individuals \u2013 particularly the young and vulnerable \u2013 from joining terrorist groups remains an essential part of EU counter- terrorism efforts. However, it is at a local level \u2013 in schools, communities, youth centres, and the health-care sector \u2013 where this work can most effectively be delivered. It is in this spirit that the European Commission\u2019s Directorate-General for Migration and Home Affairs established the Radicalisation Awareness Network (RAN) in 2011, bringing together a range of different actors, from psychologists to educators, social workers, community leaders NGOs, police, prison and probation officers, as well as representatives from government ministries. The RAN provides the opportunity for these actors to exchange experiences, pool knowledge and identify best practices in tackling radicalisation. Practitioners gather in nine working groups, each targeted at a specific group of stakeholders. These groups include: education; prison and probation; exit; health and social care; youth, families and communities; communications and narratives; local authorities; police and law enforcement; and remembrance of victims of terrorism. Today the RAN connects over 2,400 practitioners, with over 1,700 having attended RAN events. In October 2015, the European Commission bolstered the RAN by establishing it as a Centre of Excellence, and committing a further \u20ac25 million over the next four years. The main objectives of the RAN Centre of Excellence are: \u2022 to facilitate and enhance the exchange of experiences and cooperation between relevant stakeholders (inside and outside the EU), in particular through the RAN; \u2022 to support the EU and the relevant stakeholders in Member States in their Prevent efforts, through support services, practical tools and policy contributions; 1 The European Agenda on Security, COM (2015) 185 of 28 April 2015. 2 European Commission Communication on Supporting the Prevention of Radicalisation Leading to Violent Extremism.

It is important to clarify and refine the language employed as the basis for mutual understanding and effective cooperation. This lexicon of key terms in P/CVE programming has thus been developed specifically to facilitate and improve dialogue, understanding and coordination amongst those engaged in similar work. It should serve as a valuable reference guide in training and in practical P/CVE programming. It will also facilitate more effective programming, whose impact can be more easily and rigorously monitored and evaluated. This chapter presents a glossary of P/CVE terms. It is designed to act as a reference guide for practitioners and those engaged in P/CVE policy-making processes. It also offers a non- exhaustive list of key policy and good-practice documents in the field of P/CVE. ",
        "53 Strengthening Resilience to Violence and Extremism P/CVE Glossary Conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism and violent extremism This term refers to the broader contexts in which radicalisation occurs. Conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism and violent extremism are sometimes also described as \u2018underlying drivers\u2019 or \u2018root causes\u2019, although the EU generally prefers not to use the term \u2018root causes\u2019. This preference relates to the fact that the word \u2018causes\u2019 in particular can be misused or abused by those who might seek to imply that terrorist acts could be excused or justified \u2013 by seeking to establish an automatic and inevitable link between particular circumstances and terrorism. To the contrary, processes of radicalisation to violent extremism and terrorism are multifaceted, highly complex and variable, involving numerous paths and channels. Counter-terrorism Actions taken directly against terrorist networks, and indirectly to influence and render global and regional environments inhospitable to terrorist networks. This includes the use of both military and non-military methods such as surveillance and intelligence gathering. Preventing and countering violent extremism Though multiple definitions of \u2018preventing violent extremism\u2019 and \u2018countering violent extremism\u2019 exist, P/CVE programming is generally understood as actions that strengthen the resilience of individuals and communities to the appeal of radicalisers and violent extremism. Along those lines, one definition describe P/CVE as \u2018a broad range of non- coercive and preventative activities that are united by the objective of counteracting the key drivers of violent extremism specific to the locations in which the programmes are taking place. Preventing and countering violent extremism programmes include activities that target individuals specifically identified as potentially \u201cat risk\u201d of being drawn to violence\u2019. 1 De-radicalisation The social and psychological process whereby an individual\u2019s commitment to, and involvement in, violent extremism is reduced to the extent that they are no longer at risk of involvement in violent activity. De-radicalisation may also refer to any initiative that tries to achieve a reduction of risk of re-offending through addressing related disengagement issues. De-radicalisation implies a cognitive shift \u2013 a fundamental change in understanding and a modification of attitudes. Disengagement The process whereby an individual experiences a change in role or function that is usually associated with reduced participation in violent activity. It may not necessarily involve leaving a terrorist or extremist movement, but is most frequently associated with significant temporary or permanent role change. It is, therefore, predominantly a behavioural shift. Additionally, while disengagement stems from role change, that role 1 James Khalil and Martine Zeuthen, \u2018Countering Violent Extremism and Risk Reduction: A Guide to Programme Design and Evaluation\u2019, RUSI Whitehall Report 2-16, June 2016. ",
        "STRIVE for Development 54 change may be influenced by psychological factors such as disillusionment, burnout or the failure to reach the expectations that influenced initial involvement. Disengagement differs from de-radicalisation because it does not entail a full psychological withdrawal or change in values and ideals, requiring instead an individual to relinquish the objective of achieving change through violence. Extremism Any political theory favouring immoderate, uncompromising policies, often entailing a tendency or disposition to go to extremes, especially in relation to political or religious issues. An individual can have extremist views and not undertake acts of violence or terrorism. The level of extremism exhibited by an individual instead relates solely to his or her commitment to the fundamental ideology. Insurgent An individual or group that fights against a government or an occupying force with the aim of overthrowing it. Interventions In the P/CVE context, these comprise projects intended to divert individuals from being drawn into violent extremist activity. Interventions can include the provision of mentoring, counselling, religious guidance, or support for processes of civic engagement, for example. Multiculturalism The preservation and proactive inclusion of a diverse range of cultures, religious practices and ethnicities within a unified society, region or state. This can be an overall policy aim or it can be encouraged by local authorities and citizens. It can be seen as both a practice and a normative target. Prevent The branch of the EU\u2019s Counter-Terrorism Strategy with which P/CVE activities are most closely associated. It aims to reduce or eliminate the risk of individuals being drawn into violent extremism and terrorism by addressing the enabling environment in which processes of radicalisation occur. Prevention involves the identification and targeting of those individuals susceptible to violent extremism through appropriate interventions, which aim to prevent them from embarking on a pathway towards radicalisation. Protect The branch of the EU\u2019s Counter-Terrorism Strategy that seeks to protect citizens and infrastructure, and reduce their vulnerability to attack. Pursue The branch of the EU\u2019s Counter-Terrorism Strategy that focuses on pursuing terrorists, bringing them to justice, and building local capacity to do so. ",
        "55 Strengthening Resilience to Violence and Extremism Radicalisation There are many definitions of radicalisation, which can be understood in essence to be the social and psychological process of incrementally experienced commitment from mainstream to extremist political or religious ideologies. It does not necessarily mean that those affected will become violent, and so represents the precursor to violent extremism. However, when a decision is made, as part of this process, that fear, terror and violence are justified to achieve ideological, political, or social change, radicalisation to violent extremism and terrorism occurs. Recruitment This term is often used in conjunction with the term \u2018radicalisation\u2019. However, the two terms are not always interchangeable. Recruitment implies that there is some external agent or influence that draws individuals into engaging in terrorism or violent extremism. Meanwhile, the term \u2018radicalisation\u2019 has been criticised by some for assuming that the individual develops extreme views before searching out terrorist groups, rather than vice versa \u2013 ignoring the influence of recruitment. 2 Recidivism In P/CVE, this relates to the return or relapse of an individual back into old patterns of extremist or radical behaviour usually associated with violence or terrorist activity. Rehabilitation A purposeful, planned intervention to address the characteristics of an offender (attitudes, cognitive skills and processes, and social, educational or vocational skills) that are believed to be the cause of the individual\u2019s violent/criminal behaviour, with the intention of reducing the chance that the individual will reoffend. Rehabilitation efforts can include religious (re-)education by respected clerics, psychological counselling, community and family activities and vocational training. Reintegration A safe transition whereby an individual previously involved in violent extremism or terrorism rejoins mainstream society and proceeds to live a law-abiding life, acquiring attitudes and behaviours that generally lead to productive functioning in society. Resilience The factors, ideas, institutions, issues, trends, or values that enable individuals and communities to resist or prevent violence. This can also be described as the capability of people, groups and communities to rebut and reject proponents of violent extremism and the ideology they promote, and to recover from violent extremism when it manifests itself. Respond The branch of the EU\u2019s Counter-Terrorism Strategy that seeks to prepare for and minimise the consequences of a successful terrorist attack. 2 M Sedgwick, \u2018The Concept of Radicalisation as a Source of Confusion\u2019, Terrorism and Political Violence (Vol. 22, No. 4, 2010).

It is a more flexible term than disengagement and de-radicalisation, in that it does not seek to distinguish between adaptations in attitudes or behaviours. Social Cohesion The communal integration of societies with different ethnic, religious or national backgrounds in a local area. It is one of the attributes of a multicultural society in which ethnic or community tensions are resolved via effective local initiatives, good police practice and removal of rigorously enforced social boundaries that can aggravate community relationships. Terrorism Acts committed with the objective of seriously intimidating a population, destabilising or destroying structures of a country or international organisation or making a government abstain from performing actions. Violent Extremism The creation of ideologically motivated or justified violence, as well as support for such acts. USAID defines the term as \u2018advocating, engaging in, preparing, or otherwise supporting ideologically motivated or justified violence to further social, economic and political objectives\u2019. Vulnerability The condition of being capable of being injured; difficult to defend; open to moral or ideological attack.

It is based on four pillars, which aim to reduce both the threat of, and vulnerability to, terrorism. These pillars include: Respond (preparing for the consequences of a terrorist attack); Protect (reducing the vulnerability of civilians and infrastructure to terrorist attack); Pursue (bringing terrorists to justice); and Prevent (stopping people turning to terrorism by tackling the enabling environment). European Union Strategy for Combating Radicalisation and Recruitment to Terrorism This Strategy focuses on preventing and countering violent extremism (the \u2018Prevent\u2019 pillar of the EU\u2019s Counter-Terrorism Strategy). It was first drawn up in 2005, and has since been revised twice, with the latest version produced in 2014. The Strategy has a predominantly EU security focus, however it also forms the basis of the EU\u2019s \u2018Prevent\u2019 actions further afield. It aims to prevent radicalisation to all forms of violent extremism and terrorism. The strategy acknowledges that much radical ideology stems from groups which operate within the law. It also recognises the need for an all-inclusive, holistic response across a range of sectors and stakeholders that includes disrupting existing networks and preventing new recruits from joining the cause. The strategy is designed to help states develop, where relevant, their own programmes and policies, which take into account their own specific needs, objectives and capabilities. Preventing Radicalisation to Terrorism and Violent Extremism: Strengthening the EU\u2019s Response This policy paper is an official Communication from the European Commission from January 2014, and sets out how the European Commission, in collaboration with the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and with the support of the EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator, can support Member States in preventing radicalisation. It identifies ten areas in which Member States and the European Commission can work together, from consolidating expertise and training practitioners to cooperating with civil society and private sector actors. The paper focuses mainly on P/CVE efforts within the EU; however, it also identifies the need to align internal and external aspects of preventing and countering violent extremism, identifying areas for further work. Communication from the European Commission of the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions Supporting the Prevention of Radicalisation Leading to Violent Extremism This Communication was published in June 2016 and outlines the EU\u2019s approach to supporting Member States in preventing radicalisation to violent extremism and terrorism. It argues that the challenge can only be met through a combination of actions across several policy areas, bringing together competent authorities and societal actors at all levels \u2013 local, regional, national and European.

They mark the first time that UN Member States adopted a common strategic approach to countering terrorism. The Strategy is built around four pillars. These include: addressing conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism; preventing and combating terrorism; building capacity to prevent and combat terrorism and strengthen the role of the UN system; and ensuring respect for human rights and the rule of law as the fundamental basis of countering terrorism. On 1 July 2016, the UN General Assembly adopted by consensus a resolution reviewing the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. The resolution affirmed the importance of integrated and balanced implementation of all four pillars of the Strategy and urged all Member States, as well as the UN, to unite against violent extremism, as and when it was conducive to terrorism. Substantial references were made to the role of women and youth, the phenomenon of foreign terrorist fighters, terrorism financing and radicalisation in prisons. The resolution also gave further consideration to the Secretary-General\u2019s Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism, recommending that Member States consider the implementation of relevant recommendations of the plan, with the support of the UN. The UN Secretary General\u2019s Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism In January 2016, the Secretary-General presented the General Assembly with a Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism. The Plan aims to systematically apply preventive measures that address the drivers of violent extremism at the local, national, regional and global levels. The Plan provides a new framework to tackle violent extremism through measures that address the drivers of violent extremism. It identifies a range of push and pull factors driving individuals towards violent extremism and calls for a practical and comprehensive \u2018all-of-government\u2019 and \u2018all-of-society\u2019 approach to addressing them. The Plan provides more than 70 recommendations to Member States and the UN system, one of which is for Member States to consider adopting their own National Plans of Action. ",
        "59 Strengthening Resilience to Violence and Extremism Ankara Memorandum on Good Practices for a Multi-Sectoral Approach to Countering Violent Extremism Under the auspices of the Global Counterterrorism Forum (GCTF) and specifically its dedicated Working Group on Countering Violent Extremism, this document was produced in September 2013 and draws upon the experience of GCTF Members. It aims to promote a comprehensive approach to P/CVE by setting out the possible roles that governments, agencies and civil-society actors can play in this regard. It divides these roles into a number of sections, including identifying the problem; multi-agency approaches within the state; public- private partnerships; socio-economic approaches; and the role of law enforcement agencies. It also identifies a range of priority themes of focus, including the role of women, the promotion of economic opportunity, education, intercommunal efforts, and working with youth. The UN Sustainable Development Goals In September 2015, the 193 countries of the UN General Assembly adopted a set of goals to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all as part of a new sustainable development agenda. Each goal has specific targets to be achieved over the next fifteen years. According to Sustainable Development Goal 16 on peace and security, the international community should \u2018[p]romote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development\u2019 and \u2018[s]trengthen relevant national institutions, including through international cooperation, for building capacity at all levels, in particular in developing countries, to prevent violence and combat terrorism and crime\u2019. Abu Dhabi Memorandum on Good Practices for Education and Countering Violent Extremism This document was also produced under the auspices of the GCTF Working Group on P/CVE, and was drafted and developed in cooperation with the Hedayah Center in September 2014. The Memorandum focuses on how P/CVE policies and programmes can be developed at primary and secondary school levels, and in higher education. The aim of the document is to provide concrete options through which educational institutions can engage positively and proactively in P/CVE activities. Good Practices on Community Engagement and Community-Oriented Policing as Tools to Counter Violent Extremism This document was produced in August 2013 under the GCTF Working Group on P/CVE. It focuses on the importance of locally relevant P/CVE initiatives, and highlights two key P/CVE tools: community engagement and community-oriented policing. These tools focus on building trust with local communities and engaging them as partners in activities to raise awareness of the threat of violent extremism, initiatives to build resilience, and efforts to provide tools to prevent radicalisation and violence. It sets out a number of good practices, while stressing the need for context-sensitive and tailored actions. ",
