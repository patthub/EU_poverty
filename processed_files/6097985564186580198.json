        "2015 EESC CIVIL SOCIETY PRIZE Rewarding excellence in civil society initiatives Combating poverty European Economic and Social Committee ",
        "2 Civil society: a force in the fight to end poverty and social exclusion in Europe Combating poverty and social exclusion has to be a top priority in today\u2019s European Union for the obvious moral reasons, but also because it is expressly written into the Treaty and because the Union must show that it cares for its citizens in order to regain their support. That is why the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) decided to dedicate this year\u2019s Civil Society Prize to organisations that have distinguished themselves by their creativity and success in confronting these problems and making a difference. Poverty is a violation of human rights. It undermines all aspects of well-being in society, including education, long-term health, and family relationships. Poverty damages the future prospects not only of individuals but of the whole community. In 2010, the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth identified the need to combat poverty and reduce inequality, enabling everyone to contribute to \u2013 and benefit from \u2013 a prosperous Europe. One of its seven headline targets was to lift 20 million people out of poverty by 2020. But tragically the economic crisis has knocked the European Union off course. Austerity measures have cut essential services and increased unemployment across Europe, generating more poverty instead of reducing it. Official statistics show that poverty now threatens five million more EU citizens than in 2008. Last year over 24% of the population \u2013 122 million people \u2013 were at risk of poverty or social exclusion. My own country, Greece, has suffered one of the highest rates, with 36%* of the population at risk: an increase of 7.9 percentage points compared with 2008. Across the Union, almost 9% of citizens were severely materially deprived, meaning they could not afford to pay bills, heat their homes, eat healthily or buy basic goods. Child poverty is a particular concern. Children are Europe\u2019s future and we need to recognise their rights. Investing in children is a social and economic necessity. Member States play a crucial role setting policies that impact on children\u2019s well-being, and the EESC wants to see more accountability and the meaningful involvement of civil society in decision-making and implementation of measures nationally. In-work poverty is another alarming development. Employment has always been regarded as the best way to escape poverty, but the increase in precarious and low-paid jobs in Europe in recent years has left whole families struggling to cope, even when parents are working. *Eurostat latest data: October 2015.

        "3 The Commission\u2019s communication Taking stock of the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth recognised that the number of people at risk of poverty might remain close to 100 million by 2020, concluding: \u201cThe crisis has demonstrated the need for effective social protection systems.\u201d It is therefore all the more important for one of the key flagship initiatives of the Europe 2020 Strategy \u2013 the European platform against poverty and social exclusion \u2013 to be reformed to make it a real hub for involving civil society, sharing social and anti-poverty initiatives and taking more decisive action. The original aim of the platform, which was set up in 2010 and will continue operating until 2020, was to create a dynamic framework uniting EU institutions, Member States and civil society. Yet up until now Member States have been focusing their efforts on economic growth and neglected the vital social and environmental objectives of Europe 2020. The EESC recognises that poverty and social exclusion can be multi-faceted challenges, encompassing problems with housing, health, education, access to employment, indebtedness and addiction, to name but a few. Civil society organisations across the European Union are addressing these issues, often focusing their efforts on local needs and \u2013 crucially \u2013 involving people experiencing poverty in their planning and activities. With its 2015 Civil Society Prize, the EESC is rewarding outstanding initiatives that aim to combat poverty in Europe by improving economic and social inclusion and countering the increasing risk of exposure to poverty. Here I would like to thank colleagues in the Communication Group who managed the process \u2013 under chair Jane Morrice during the previous term, and then Gon\u00e7alo Lobo Xavier \u2013 as well as our Committee\u2019s administrative services that assisted them. I am proud to be able to introduce the winners of the 2015 EESC Civil Society Prize and congratulate them on their achievements. I also take this opportunity to welcome, on behalf of all my colleagues representing European civil society within the institutions, all the women and men fighting courageously to alleviate suffering, to reduce the impact of poverty \u2013 or banish it altogether \u2013 in their own countries. Their efforts must be acclaimed. Georges Dassis President of the European Economic and Social Committee European Economic and Social Committee ",
        "4 1 st prize: Armut und Gesundheit in Deutschland Poverty and bad health go hand in hand. Decisive evidence shows that poorer people suffer more illness and die earlier than their wealthier counterparts. Armut und Gesundheit in Deutschland (Poverty and Health in Germany) was set up in Mainz in 1997, to offer good healthcare to all, regardless of financial resources. Poverty in Germany is at its highest level since the country\u2019s reunification. In 2013, it affected more than 15% of the population: some 12 million people including 2.5 million children. Poorer people cannot afford the medicines and treatment they need. And as poverty generates sickness, sickness in turn increases poverty. A study in Hamburg showed that disease is the cause of 10% of debt problems. Armut und Gesundheit implements the innovative \u201cMainz Model\u201d, providing comprehensive medical care to homeless people and integrating them into the regular health system. Its \u201cMobile Doctor\u201d clinic offers medical, nursing and social support to people on the streets. \u201cThe most fundamental aspect is the basic working approach\u201d, explains Deputy CEO Jari Trabert. \u201cThis is participatory and based on respect, equality, and contact at eye level.\u201d The walk-in \u201cclinic without borders\u201d supplies services to anyone lacking money or health insurance. In 2014, it treated 1 500 patients from over 30 countries. Another initiative, the Street Jumper, is a brightly decorated camper van that travels around deprived neighbourhoods, giving local children and young people a safe place to read, play games, and share their problems. \u201cReceiving a prize is always a great experience, but for a relatively small organisation it is more than that\u201d , says Mr Trabert. \u201cPublicity and good press are essential for our survival because Armut und Gesundheit is financed solely by donations. In the winter especially, the situation of homeless people is highly parlous, and with the growing number of refugees we are increasing our work in this domain. The prize money will be poured into these projects.\u201d This award is a great sign that the EESC stands not only against poverty but also for the health and welfare of every human being, without restrictions. 1 ",
        "5 The organisation also campaigns politically and through the media to raise awareness of poverty. It supports similar projects in Romania, Ukraine, Greece, and further afield in Congo and Indonesia, with a new healthcare unit for street children planned in Kenya. According to Mr Trabert, \u201cThis award is a great sign that the EESC stands not only against poverty but also for the health and welfare of every human being, without restrictions\u201d. 1 st prize: Y-Foundation Reducing homelessness by promoting social housing as a human right The Y-Foundation has a clear objective: to end homelessness in Finland by providing affordable, good-quality rental housing. In 1985, when local authorities, churches, trade unions, NGOs and others launched the Y-Foundation, there were 20 000 homeless people in Finland. Over 2000 slept in overnight shelters in Helsinki alone. Since then, the foundation has helped reduce the total to 7 100 single people and 420 families. Its innovative approach involves buying flats on the private market and renovating them into social housing, with rents up to 30% lower than average, making them accessible to some of the most vulnerable people, including ex-prisoners, drug abusers and people with psychiatric problems. The letter \u201cY\u201d comes from the Finnish word yksin\u00e4inen, meaning \u201clonely\u201d. Homelessness is closely linked to poverty and social exclusion. \u201cWe were one of the first organisations to practise the \u2018housing first\u2019 principle,\u201d explains Chief Executive Officer Juha Kaakinen. \u201cA home gives people a platform to make other changes in their lives.\u201d It promotes not only human dignity but better health and employment opportunities, too, and benefits welfare systems. For example, two of Y-Foundation\u2019s tenants now have jobs in the organisation\u2019s office. www.armut-gesundheit.de MORE INFORMATION: 1 ",
        "6 Building partnerships is key to the foundation\u2019s success, including cooperating with local authorities and involving tenants in managing their properties. Environmental sustainability is important, so properties are adapted to reduce energy use, and where possible have access to public transport. The Civil Society Prize will make a big difference, says Mr Kaakinen. \u201cThis kind of European recognition is a great motivator for our personnel. And it\u2019s important nationally, to make our work better known in Finland. It also raises awareness of homelessness and poverty, so that it\u2019s easier to discuss these issues publicly.\u201d The Y-Foundation has already received other accolades, including the World Habitat Award. This year, the foundation has launched a new project. \u201cWe have started looking at ways of getting employment opportunities for our tenants,\u201d explains Mr Kaakinen. \u201cThe prize money can be used in a very targeted way to build up this system to provide jobs.\u201d The Y-Foundation now owns 7 700 apartments in 53 cities, and has inspired interest not only in other European countries but also in Japan, USA, Russia and South America. 2 nd prize: National Association for the development of Social and Solidarity Food Shops (ANDES) Uniterres programme Just as food poverty has affected more people in Europe in the wake of the economic crisis, at the same time many small farmers and producers have found it increasingly difficult to make a living. The Uniterres programme, set up in France in 2011, benefits both groups by supporting social and solidarity food shops selling locally grown produce at below-market prices while paying farmers a fair price. As well as strengthening the link between consumers and producers, this gives poorer people access to fresh, good-quality fruit and vegetables and promotes healthy eating. www.ysaatio.fi/in-english/ MORE INFORMATION: A home gives people a platform to make other changes in their lives. Our organisation is composed of people who are dedicated to what they do. 2 ",
        "7 Uniterres protects small farmers\u2019 incomes by a system of pre-ordering. \u201c Prices are fixed from the beginning to the end of the season, which is not the case on the conventional market\u201d, says vegetable-grower Christian Brunet, whose business was on the verge of collapse before he joined the programme. \u201cOur organisation is composed of people who are dedicated to what they do; we really function as a team in partnership with many grass-root associations supported by volunteers\u201d, explains Uniterres assistant manager Isabelle Techoueyres. \u201cWe work with small-scale farmers, food-aid beneficiaries, people in precarious situations, and we are supported by public and private institutions. For each one of these people, the Civil Society award is meaningful and highly gratifying. European recognition for all the people involved!\u201d The programme currently supports 124 small farmers in south-western France, supplying 53 social and solidarity shops, providing food aid for 20 000 beneficiaries each year. Contributing, rather than receiving \u201chandouts\u201d, promotes personal independence and dignity. The shops prevent food waste by carefully planning the products required, and they counter health inequalities by making good food available to vulnerable people. \u201cMany beneficiaries are happy to lose or to gain weight, because they feel they eat better\u201d , notes Ms Techoueyres. In June 2015, Uniterres won the French prize \u201cLa France s\u2019engage\u201d. \u201cThe Civil Society Prize represents yet another recognition, which indicates that most EU regions share similar visions of the challenges they face and objectives they want to achieve\u201d, says Uniterres Manager V\u00e9ronique Blanchot. \u201cThe prize money will be used to employ a dozen young people to develop relations between food-aid beneficiaries and local farmers.\u201d Uniterres is eager to share its experience. Partners in Spain and Belgium are considering similar programmes, and it has been asked to help set up a new scheme in Mumbai, India. www.epiceries-solidaires.org/ news/uniterres-des-circuits- courts-dans-le-reseau-des- epiceries-solidaires MORE INFORMATION: ",
        "8 2 nd prize: Third Age F\u00e1ilte Isteach project Getting old can lead to poverty and isolation, whether in the towns or rural areas of a country like Ireland. Third Age encourages older people to remain actively involved in their communities through a range of activities and services. F\u00e1ilte Isteach (Welcome In) is a community-based project benefiting from the skills, wisdom and experience of older people by recruiting them as volunteer English tutors. Over the last 15 years, many immigrants have come to Ireland seeking work. They now make up 12% of the population: more than half a million people from 199 different countries. Yet 80 000 of them do not speak good English, preventing them from integrating fully into Irish society. F\u00e1ilte Isteach\u2019s 800 volunteer tutors deliver 40 000 hours of free tuition every year, catering for all levels of proficiency and helping students to secure work and escape the risk of poverty. \u201cF\u00e1ilte Isteach gives older people the opportunity to show that rather than being a \u2018burden on society\u2019, they can be part of the solution to many of the concerns we face\u201d, says Manager Ariana Ball. The volunteers also offer their own insight into Ireland\u2019s traditional values and ways of life. The project fosters mutual understanding and helps to counter xenophobia and racism. \u201cWe are acutely aware of the unfolding refugee crisis in Europe\u201d, says Ms Ball. \u201c Winning a Civil Society Prize will allow F\u00e1ilte Isteach to play an integral role in supporting refugees who are resettled in Ireland in the future and to share the project with a wider European audience.\u201d Third Age launched F\u00e1ilte Isteach in 2006, in County Meath, and by the end of 2015 aims to have branches in all Ireland\u2019s 26 counties. Each week more than 2 200 migrants and asylum-seekers use its services. It is contributing to a caring society which values diversity and sees our new migrants as a positive force. 2 ",
        "9 Poles make up Ireland\u2019s largest minority community: 53-year-old Maria is just one beneficiary. \u201cWe can socialise with Irish people and other nationalities, but best of all we learn to speak and write in English, which is most important\u201d, she says. \u201cWe have seen the sustained change F\u00e1ilte Isteach has brought to 83 communities in urban, suburban and rural Ireland,\u201d confirms Ms Ball. \u201cIt is contributing to a caring society which values diversity and sees our new migrants as a positive force. The Prize validates the tremendous contribution being made by our many volunteers.\u201d 2 nd prize: Barka Foundation for Mutual Help Integrated system of support for education and social entrepreneurship The Barka Foundation (Barka means \u201clifeboat\u201d in Polish) was launched in 1989 during Poland\u2019s painful transition years. It creates conditions for the empowerment and growth of vulnerable people and communities, by developing a pro-active system of social and vocational reintegration, serving more than 5 000 individuals a year. Barka started by establishing 30 self-sufficient communities in Poland, turning former state farms into organic farms and social enterprises. Currently, 1000 vulnerable individuals and families live in these communities. Between 1989 and 2000, Barka created model institutions and educational centres for the unemployed. At the same time, it worked with the Polish Government to develop four laws governing partnerships between NGOs and public institutions, social and vocational integration centres, social cooperatives and enterprises supporting accessible housing. In 2004-2015, the Foundation established over 200 social integration centres to support unemployed and vulnerable adults including addicts, ex-prisoners, single mothers and disabled people, and encourage them to become social entrepreneurs. Some 1 200 social enterprises providing tens of thousands of jobs have been created, in partnership with local authorities and voluntary organisations. Two of them were selected as the Best Social Enterprises of 2015 by the Ministry of Labour. www.thirdageireland.ie MORE INFORMATION: EESC recognition through the Civil Society Prize is important because it confirms that the system based on social economy and social entrepreneurship has been efficient and impactful. 2 ",
        "10 \u201cEESC recognition through the Civil Society Prize is important because it confirms that the system based on social economy and social entrepreneurship has been efficient and impactful\u201d, says Ewa Sadowska, a Foundation trustee. \u201cIt will significantly strengthen our role in developing the social economy internationally.\u201d Recently, the Barka Foundation has been approached by NGOs and institutions in Macedonia and Serbia, interested in replicating the Polish system. It has also been working with the African diaspora in Europe and local communities in Kenya and Ethiopia to rebuild rural communities in East Africa through local partnership schemes and social enterprises. As a result, Barka\u2019s founder was formally admitted to the Council of Elders of the Pokomo Tribe in Kenya. Barka already works in Belgium, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands and the UK, supporting Central and Eastern Europeans who migrated to another EU country for work and a better life, but ended up in need. Over the last nine years it has helped 12 000 vulnerable citizens in Western European cities to reintegrate into their communities at home, through rehabilitation, addiction treatment and vocational training. One of them is Jerzy, a former seaman, who worked unofficially on construction sites in London until he lost his work and home due to alcoholism. With Foundation support, he recovered and now helps homeless migrants in Ireland \u2013 living proof of Barka\u2019s policy of breaking down the barrier between support recipients and providers, and recognising the potential in everyone. The prize money will enable Barka to set up a new Multicultural Centre for migrants and refugees in Poznan, helping them to integrate in local communities and the labour market. \u201cIt will help cover the cost of renovation and refurbishment of buildings and vocational training facilities\u201d, says Ms Sadowska. www.barka.org.pl MORE INFORMATION: ",
        "11 Due recognition for the role of civil society organisations The European Economic and Social Committee launched the Civil Society Prize in 2006 to highlight and reward the achievements of active citizens all over Europe who are working to make life better for their communities. In 2015, the award goes to civil society organisations or individuals who are fighting the growing risk of poverty, and the economic and social exclusion of people living under its shadow. The EESC is the only body working at European Union level to represent the interests of all sectors of organised civil society. As such, one of its impor- tant tasks is to raise awareness of the vital role civil society organisations play, day in and day out, in fostering European solidarity and integration and promoting the common values and principles on which European unity is based. Those principles in- clude the right of every citizen to live in dignity and be free of need. In awarding the prize, the Com- mittee has looked for innovative projects in a wide range of areas such as social support, housing, edu- cation and health; in-work poverty (the \u2018working poor\u2019); energy poverty; child poverty; homeless- ness; financial exclusion and over-indebtedness; or cooperation with public authorities. The prize is worth a total of EUR 50 000, shared between the five winners. The annual competition is open to any officially registered civil society organisation or individual within the EU, acting at European, national, regional or local level. But candidates have to be nominated by a Pan- European civil society organisation, a member of the EESC or a national economic and social council. In previous years, awards have gone to projects supporting Roma people, promoting sustainable lifestyles and creating green jobs, networking, educating, campaigning, combating injustice and defending the interests of young people. In 2015, at the mid-term point of the EU\u2019s Europe 2020 strategy, which set a target of saving an additional 20 million people from the risk of poverty, practical and effective initiatives to combat poverty and social exclusion are an urgent priority. This year, there were more than 100 entries from 24 Member States \u2013 the largest number ever received. The 86 eligible applications were evaluated by a four-member group of assessors who made a shortlist of the best candidates. The EESC President, the two Vice-Presidents, the Presidents of the three Groups and the Secretary-General then selected the final winners. They applied a range of specific criteria to make their choice, from assessing the initiative\u2019s success in serving its target audience, its long-term impact and sustainability, geographical coverage, and its contribution to community well-being; to implementing human rights and raising awareness of the problem of poverty. The winners had to be innovative, creative, unique, and above all involve people actually experiencing poverty and social exclusion.
