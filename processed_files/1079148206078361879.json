It is the first of five reflection papers announced in the White paper on the future of Europe which are intended to offer different ideas, proposals, options or scenarios for Europe and to open a debate without presenting definitive decisions at this stage. Also this week, the Commission has presented the European Pillar of Social Rights, which sets out twenty key principles and rights to support fair and well-functioning labour markets and welfare systems. To provide a wider context for this important debate, the Publications Office presents a selection of recent titles on the social aspects of policy-making in the EU.

The authors explore responses by socioeconomic and political actors at national and EU level to these tensions. A summary of the key findings and recommendations of the study can be found here.
