        "EN 2 EN EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL \u2022 Reasons for and objectives of the proposal Since early 2011, the Jordanian economy has been significantly affected by the ongoing regional unrest, notably in neighbouring Iraq and Syria. Combined with a weaker global environment, this regional unrest has taken a heavy toll on external receipts and has strained public finances. Lower tourism and FDI inflows, blocked trade routes, and repeated disruptions to the flow of natural gas from Egypt, which forced Jordan to replace gas imports from Egypt with more expensive fuels for electricity generation, have put a drag on growth and weighed on Jordan's external and fiscal position. The Syrian conflict has impacted Jordan not only by disrupting trade with and through Syria but also by causing an inflow of around 1.3 million of Syrian refugees into Jordan that has increased pressure on Jordan's fiscal position, public services and infrastructure. In 2012, Jordan and the IMF agreed on a first adjustment programme, which was supported by a three-year Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) in the amount of USD 2 billion. This programme was successfully completed in August 2015. The IMF programme was complemented by a first Macro-Financial Assistance from the European Union (the EU) in the amount of EUR 180 million (MFA-I), which was adopted by the European Parliament and the Council in December 2013 and was disbursed in two tranches of EUR 100 million and EUR 80 million in February 2015 and in October 2015, respectively. While the country made progress with macroeconomic stabilisation and reform under the first programme supported by the IMF, the EU and other donors, the persistence of the conflicts in neighbouring Syria and Iraq continued to disrupt Jordan's foreign trade and undermine investor and tourist confidence, with the economic situation deteriorating again in 2015. In this context, the Jordanian government has called for increased support from the international community to address the economic consequences of the Syrian crisis, and in particular the presence of a large number of Syrian refugees in Jordan. At the conference 'Supporting Syria and the Region', held in London on 4 February 2016, the international community pledged about USD 10 billion to help the countries most affected by the Syrian refugee crisis. Of this amount, the EU pledged EUR 2.39 billion for the countries affected by the Syrian refugee crisis including a EUR 200 million loan for the purpose of a second Macro-Financial Assistance operation for Jordan (MFA-II). On 3 March 2016, through a letter from the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation to the Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs Taxation and Customs, the Jordanian authorities formalised their request for a new MFA from the EU 1 . The new proposed MFA operation will be part of the so-called EU-Jordan Compact (annexed to EU-Jordan partnership priorities), a document that the EU and Jordan are discussing and that would contain precise commitments on both sides (including financial assistance from the EU) aimed at addressing a number of policy priorities. At the same time, Jordan and the IMF have been negotiating a successor financial arrangement, which is expected to be put in place in the second half of 2016. The 1 In this letter, the authorities requested a new MFA in the amount of EUR 350 million. ",
        "EN 3 EN arrangement, which will probably take the form of an Extended Fund Facility (EFF), would support a new economic programme probably covering 3 years. In this context, and consistent with the pledge made at the London conference, the European Commission is submitting to the European Parliament and the Council a proposal for a Decision providing a new MFA to Jordan of up to EUR 200 million, in the form of medium- term loans. The proposed amount seems justified based on an updated assessment of the country's external financing needs, the size of the expected IMF programme, burden-sharing considerations and the room for manoeuvre available in the EU budget. The proposed EU MFA would help Jordan cover part of its residual external financing needs, for the period 2016-17, estimated at about USD 3.2 billion. Since it is intended that the assistance would be channelled to the budget, the new assistance (as the previous one) would also help Jordan cover part of the fiscal costs associated with the Syrian refugee crisis. As further elaborated in the Commission Staff Working Document accompanying this proposal, the Commission considers, based also on the assessment of the political situation made by the European External Action Service, that the political and economic pre-conditions for the proposed MFA operation are satisfied. \u2022 General context Following a period of robust growth averaging 6.5% during 2000-2009, Jordan's GDP growth has decelerated to an average of 2\u00be% in 2011-2014. While growth recovered to 3.1% in 2014, the intensification of the Syrian crisis in 2015, through its effects on trade, tourism and investor confidence, as well as the slowdown in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) economies, which are major trading partners for Jordan and also an important source of tourism, remittances and financial flows, contributed to a deceleration of growth back to 2.4% in 2015. The deceleration of the economy resulted in a sizeable increase in unemployment . After declining from 12.6% in 2013 to 11.9% in 2014, the unemployment rate increased again to 14.6% in the first quarter of 2016. Unemployment remains particularly high for young people and women (33% and 23.7%, respectively, in the first quarter of 2016). Helped by sharp declines in food and fuel-related prices, consumer prices fell by 0.9% in 2015 (with core inflation at about 2%, however, partly reflecting the demand from Syrian refugees). Consumer price inflation is expected to recover this year as fuel prices stabilise or pick up somewhat, but it is expected to remain low (in the 1%-1.5% range). Reflecting this subdued inflation trends and the weakening of growth, the Central Bank of Jordan reduced the rediscount rate from 4.25% in early 2015 to 3.75% in July 2015. Jordan has made substantial progress with fiscal consolidation since its fiscal deficit jumped in 2012-2013, largely reflecting adjustment measures taken in the context of the IMF programme (including the introduction of a new income tax law in 2015) and the decline in oil prices, which allowed to reduce markedly the operating loss of NEPCO (the national electricity company) and the state transfers to this company. Thus, the overall fiscal balance, which includes transfers to NEPCO and to WAJ (the Water Authority of Jordan) as well as grants, declined from a peak of about 11% of GDP in 2013 to 3.5% of GDP in 2015. The improvement in the underlying fiscal position is, however, less substantial when looking to the primary deficit of the central government, excluding grants and transfers to NEPCO and ",
        "EN 4 EN to WAJ. This measure deteriorated in 2015 (increasing to 5.2% of GDP) and remains more than three percentage points of GDP above what the IMF had programmed. The combined deficit of the central government and NEPCO (which adds to the above-mentioned primary deficit measure NEPCO's operating loss) remains above 6% of GDP and is also substantially above what had been targeted under the IMF's SBA programme (3.5% of GDP). The persistent fragility of Jordan's fiscal position is further highlighted by the fact that the country continues to be very dependent on foreign grants (which are expected to remain lower in the coming years, reflecting the impact of lower oil prices on the finances of GCC donors) and by the risk that oil prices will recover more markedly than currently assumed. Moreover, Jordan must continue to accommodate the significant fiscal cost related to the Syrian refugees, which mainly reflects higher expenditure in subsidies, health, education and infrastructure. According to the Jordanian authorities, the cost of direct and indirect expenses related to the hosting the Syrian refugees has amounted to approximately USD 6.6 billion since the beginning of the Syrian conflict. Reflecting substantial borrowing from foreign donors, as well as the issuance of international bonds, Jordan's gross public debt increased further to 93.4% of GDP end the end of 2015, continuing an upward trend observed since 2008, when the ratio stood at 60.2% of GDP. The public debt's dynamics are, however, judged by the IMF to be sustainable provided that the country continues to deliver on further medium-term fiscal adjustment and continues to receive substantial grants from the international community. While Jordan has achieved a substantial correction of its current account deficit since 2013 (reflecting fiscal consolidation, the decline in oil prices and the shift to cheaper types of fuel), the deficit remains very large, amounting to 11.7% of GDP in 2015. The escalation of the conflicts in Syria and Iraq in 2015 weighed on exports, tourism and investor confidence. Exports decreased by 6.6% as a result of disrupted trade routes while income from tourism dropped by 7.1%, reflecting a sizeable decrease in tourists' arrivals from 4.1 million in 2014 to 3.7 million in 2015. This partly compensated for the decline in imports in a context of weaker growth and low oil prices. External pressures continued in the first quarter of 2016, leading to a sizeable widening of the trade deficit (by 13% on a year-on-year basis), reflecting new declines in exports and tourism revenues. The current account deficit excluding grants is expected to remain close to 10% of GDP in 2016-2017 (or around 6% of GDP including foreign grants). The decline in foreign direct investment , from USD 1.8 billion in 2014 to around USD 1.2 billion in 2015, created further pressures to the external position. Despite the decline in FDI, the capital and financial account recorded a net inflow of USD 2.2 billion in 2015, compared to a net inflow of USD 1.2 in 2014. This was made possible by the issuance in June of two Eurobonds guaranteed by the US Treasury for a total of USD 1.5 billion and the issuance in November of a non-guaranteed Eurobond of USD 500 million. In March 2016, net international reserves stood at a comfortable level of USD 13.4 billion, equivalent to around 7 months of next year's imports. Including gold, international reserves stood at about USD 15 billion. In the context of the adjustment and reform programmes supported by the assistance of the IMF, the World Bank and the EU's first MFA operation, which was completed in October 2015, the Jordanian authorities made significant progress in a number of key structural reform areas. This included the reform of fuel subsidies and introduction of a compensatory ",
        "EN 5 EN cash transfer scheme, efforts to diversify energy sources, tax reform and the revamping of the investment framework. However, the country continues to face significant structural reform challenges. The tax base is still narrow, entailing many tax-exemptions, and there is still scope for strengthening tax administration and for further reforming income taxation in order to increase both revenues and progressivity. These reforms should support fiscal consolidation. Jordan also suffers from rigid labour markets and skill mismatches, which contributes to high unemployment, particularly among the youth, as well as from very low rates of participation among women. Efforts to diversify energy sources and increase energy efficiency should continue, in order to meet the increased demand for electricity and reduce further Jordan's dependency on oil fuel. Water sector reform is another key reform challenge, with transfers to WAJ remaining a substantial burden on the budget. There is also scope for further improvement the business and investment climate, which is key for raising investment inflows under the current difficult regional environment. Also, economic governance and transparency should be strengthened, including by pursuing efforts to improve public finance management, for example by adopting the new legislation on the Audit Bureau and by modernising debt management. The projections by the IMF, in February 2016, point towards significant balance of payments needs for the period 2016-2017, with the total external financing gap estimated at USD 3.2 billion (USD 2 billion in 2016 and USD 1.2 billion in 2017). This financing gap can broadly be attributed to three factors: a persistently large current account deficit large debt amortization requirements expected, especially for 2016, and the need to maintain a prudent foreign exchange reserve level. The proposed new MFA operation of EUR 200 million would cover 7.4% of the estimated residual financing gap (after deducting net IMF financing and the expected disbursement of World Bank policy-based loans). As in recent years, other donors (including France, Japan, the US and the GCC countries and the Arab Monetary Fund, as well as the EU through its grant-based budgetary support financed by the European Neighbourhood Instrument) are expected to contribute substantial additional funds in the coming period, ensuring a reasonable burden-sharing in the donors' support effort. \u2022 Existing provisions in the area of the proposal Decision No 1351/2013/EU providing a first macro-financial assistance to Jordan in the amount of EUR 180 million was adopted by the European Parliament and the Council on 11 December 2013 2 . The assistance was fully disbursed during 2015. \u2022 Consistency with the other policies and objectives of the Union policies The EU and Jordan have developed a close political and economic relationship over the years. In 2010, an Advanced Status partnership was agreed between the EU and Jordan that entails expanded areas of cooperation. The legal basis for the EU-Jordan relationship is the Association Agreement that entered into force on 1 May 2002 and the different cooperation and dialogue instruments created under the ENP. Jordan is also a member of the Union for the Mediterranean. The EU aims to assist Jordan in the implementation of its own reform process based on the priorities and actions defined in the Single Support Framework adopted for 2014-2017. In response to the conflicts in Syria and Iraq, and with a view to further 2 Decision No 1351/2013/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2013 providing macro-financial assistance to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan (OJ L 341, 18.12.2013, p. 4). ",
        "EN 6 EN strengthening the solid and multi-faceted relationship between the EU and Jordan, the two sides have started discussions on a new Partnership Priorities Agreement which should guide EU-Jordan relations for the period 2016-2018. The partnership priorities involve the fulfilment of mutual commitments, specified in the EU-Jordan Compact, also currently under discussion. Jordan has developed important economic ties with the EU. In 2014, the EU was Jordan's second largest trading partner, with a trading share of 15.5% after Saudi Arabia with 17.7% and before the US (third trading partner with a share of 8.5%). A preparatory process for launching negotiations on a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) is on- going. The DCFTA would aim at improving market access opportunities and the investment climate and promoting closer economic integration between the EU and Jordan. While the actual negotiations on the DCFTA have yet to be launched, the parties have started discussions on a temporary relaxation of the rules of origin on the part of the EU applied in their bilateral trade. It is hoped that this initiative, which forms part of the EU's support for Jordan in the present Syrian refugee crisis, will provide a boost to Jordanian exports to the EU and create additional employment opportunities for both Jordanians and Syrian refugees. The EU MFA would complement the grants mobilised under the ENI and other EU programmes and in particular the conditionalities envisaged under the budget support packages being implemented by the EU. By supporting the adoption by the Jordanian authorities of an appropriate framework for macroeconomic policy and structural reforms, the EU\u2019s MFA would enhance the added value and effectiveness of the EU\u2019s overall financial interventions, including through other financial instruments. Jordan has taken important steps towards strengthening democratic rights and the rule of law. A Constitutional Court and an Independent Electoral Commission have been set up and a number of major laws, including the Electoral Act and the Political Parties Act as well as laws on decentralisation and municipalities, have been passed by the Jordanian Parliament. While there is still room for reinforcing its democratic institutions and legal framework and for making its democracy more representative of the different social and ethnic groups, Jordan has managed to make progress in this area despite a difficult regional environment and continues to exert a stabilising and moderating role in the region. In this context, Jordan is deemed to meet the political preconditions for the granting of MFA, notably in terms of respect for democracy, human rights and the rule of law, and of being a country with which the EU maintains close political and economic relations. A detailed assessment of the satisfaction of these political criteria for MFA produced by the European External Action Service is annexed to the Commission Staff Working Document accompanying the proposal. The proposed new MFA is also consistent with the EU's commitment to support Jordan's economic and political transition. 2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY \u2022 Summary of the proposed action The EU shall make MFA available to Jordan for a total maximum amount of EUR 200 million, provided in the form of a medium-term loan. The assistance will contribute to cover Jordan's residual external financing needs in 2016-2017, as identified by the Commission based on the estimates of the IMF. The assistance is planned to be disbursed in two loan instalments of EUR 100 million each. The disbursement of the first instalment is expected to take place towards the end of 2016. ",
        "EN 7 EN The second instalment, conditional on a number of policy measures, could be disbursed in the second quarter of 2017. The assistance will be managed by the Commission. Specific provisions on the prevention of fraud and other irregularities, consistent with the Financial Regulation, are applicable. As usual with the MFA instrument, the disbursements would be conditional on successful programme reviews under the new IMF's financial arrangement. In addition, the Commission and the Jordanian authorities would agree on specific structural reform measures in a Memorandum of Understanding. The Commission will target structural reforms aimed at improving the overall macroeconomic management and the conditions for sustainable growth. As noted above, these reform measures would support the authorities\u2019 reform agenda and complement the programmes agreed with the IMF, the World Bank and other donors, as well as the policy programmes associated with the EU\u2019s budgetary support operations. They would be consistent with the economic reform priorities agreed between the EU and Jordan in the context of the Single Support Framework for 2014-2017 and other strategic documents (including the future Partnership Priorities and the Jordan Compact). They would also build upon the structural reforms implemented under MFA-I. The decision to disburse the full MFA in the form of loans is justified by Jordan's level of economic development (as measured by its per-capita income) and debt indicators. It is also consistent with the treatment given to Jordan by the World Bank and the IMF. Indeed, Jordan is not eligible for concessional financing from either the International Development Agency or the IMF's Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust fund. \u2022 Legal basis The legal basis for this proposal is Article 212 TFEU. \u2022 Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) The subsidiarity principle is respected as the objectives of restoring short-term macroeconomic stability in Jordan cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States alone and can be better achieved by the European Union. The main reasons are the budgetary constraints faced at the national level and the need for strong donor coordination in order to maximise the scale and effectivenes of the assistance. \u2022 Proportionality The proposal complies with the proportionality principle: it confines itself to the minimum required in order to achieve the objectives of short-term macroeconomic stability and does not go beyond what is necessary for that purpose. As identified by the Commission based on the estimates of the IMF in the context of the future Extended Fund Facility, the amount of the proposed new MFA corresponds to 7.4% of the estimated residual financing gap for the period 2016-2017. This is consistent with standard practices on burden-sharing for MFA operations. Given the assistance pledged to Jordan by other bilateral and multilateral donors, it is deemed an appropriate level of burden- sharing for the EU. \u2022 Choice of the instrument Project finance or technical assistance would not be suitable or sufficient to address these macroeconomic objectives. The key value added of the MFA in comparison to other EU ",
        "EN 8 EN instruments would be to alleviate the external financial constraint and to help create a stable macroeconomic framework, including by promoting a sustainable balance of payments and budgetary situation, and an appropriate framework for structural reforms. By helping to put in place an appropriate overall policy framework, MFA can increase the effectiveness of the actions financed in Jordan under other, more narrowly focused EU financial instruments. 3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS \u2022 Consultation of interested parties MFA is provided as an integral part of the international support for the economic stabilisation of Jordan. In the preparation of this proposal for MFA, the Commission services have consulted with the IMF and the World Bank, which have already put in place sizeable financing programs and are preparing new ones. The Commission consulted the Economic and Financial Committee on 2 June 2016, receiving an endorsement for the proposal. The Commission has also been in regular contact with the Jordanian authorities. \u2022 Collection and use of expertise An Operational Assessment for verifying the quality and reliability of Jordan's public financial circuits and administrative procedures will be carried out by the Commission with the assistance of external experts before the effective implementation of the assistance. Its results, which will be shared with Jordanian authorities and the EU Delegation for further work on possible areas for improvement, might also be reflected in the policy conditionality of the proposed MFA. \u2022 Impact Assessment The EUs macro-financial assistance is an exceptional emergency instrument aimed at addressing severere balance-of-payment difficulties in third countries. Therefore, this MFA proposal is exempted from the requirement to carry out an Impact Assessment in accordance with the Commission's Better Regulation Guidelines (SWD(2015) 111 final) as there is a political imperative to move ahead quickly in this emergency situation requiring a rapid response. More generally, the Commission's MFA proposals build on lessons learned from ex-post evaluations carried out on past operations in the EU's neighbourhood. Like MFA-I, MFA-II and the economic adjustment and reform programme attached to it will help alleviate Jordan's short-term financing needs while supporting policy measures aimed at strengthening medium- term balance of payments and fiscal sustainability and raising sustainable growth, thus complementing the programme to be agreed with the IMF. These measures are likely to cover reform areas such as public financial management and other aspects of economic governance, tax reform, the strengthening of the social safety net, energy and water sector reforms, trade and investment, and the labour market, including measures to facilitate the integration of Syrian refugees into the Jordanian labour market.

        "EN 9 EN 4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS The planned assistance would be provided in the form of a loan and would be financed through a borrowing operation that the Commission will conduct on behalf of the EU. The budgetary impact of the assistance will correspond to the provisioning of the EU's Guarantee Fund for external actions, at a rate of 9% of the amounts disbursed, from budget line 01 03 06 (\"Provisioning of the Guarantee Fund\"). Assuming that the first loan disbursement (of EUR 100 million) will be made in 2016 and the second loan disbursement (of EUR 100 million) in 2017 in accordance with the rules governing the guarantee fund mechanism, the provisioning will take place in the 2018-19 budgets. Based on current projections on the utilisation of the budget line 01 03 06, the Commission assesses that the budgetary impact of the operation can be accommodated. 5. OTHER ELEMENTS \u2022 Review/revision/sunset clause The proposal includes a sunset clause.

Under the Association Agreement the EU and Jordan gradually established a Free Trade Area over a transitional period of 12 years. In addition, an agreement on further liberalisation of agricultural products entered into force in 2007. In 2010, an Advanced Status partnership was agreed between the EU and Jordan that entails expanded areas of cooperation. A protocol on Dispute Settlement Mechanisms for trade between the EU and Jordan initialed in December 2009 entered into force on 1 July 2011. Bilateral political dialogue and economic cooperation have been further developed within the framework of ENP Association Agreement and the Single Support Framework adopted for 2014-2017.

Combined with a weaker global environment, this regional unrest has taken a heavy toll on external receipts and has strained public finances. Tourism and foreign direct investment inflows have been negatively affected, trading routes blocked and the flow of natural gas from Egypt disrupted. In addition, the Jordanian economy has also been impacted from a large inflow of Syrian refugees, which has increased pressure on its fiscal position, public services and infrastructure. ",

It has increased its financial support to Jordan, strengthening its cooperation in many fields, including the civil society, the electoral system, security, regional development and social and economic reforms. And the Union has offered the possibility of concluding a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area agreement.

Under this programme, Jordan made considerable progress with fiscal consolidation (also helped by the decline in oil prices) and with a number of structural reforms. (6) In December 2012, Jordan requested complementary macro-financial assistance from the Union. In response, macro-financial assistance of EUR 180 million in the form of loans was adopted in December 2013 3 (MFA-I). The Memorandum of Understanding defining the policy conditions related to this first macro-financial assistance entered into force on 18 March 2014. Following the implementation of the agreed policy measures, the first tranche of MFA-I was disbursed on 10 February 2015 and the second tranche was disbursed on 15 October 2015. (7) Since the outbreak of the Syrian crisis, the EU has allocated almost EUR 1.13 billion to Jordan. This includes, in addition to the EUR 180 million from the first macro-financial assistance operation, EUR 500 million in regular programmed bilateral cooperation for Jordan financed under the European Neighbourhood Instrument, about EUR 250 million from the humanitarian budget and more than EUR 30 million from the Instrument contributing to Stability and Peace. Moreover, the European Investment Bank has made available loans in the amount of EUR 264 million since 2011. (8) The intensification of the Syrian crisis in 2015 affected severely Jordan through its effects on trade, tourism and investor confidence. Jordan was also affected by a decline in financial support from the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, affected by the decline in oil prices. As a result, economic growth has slowed down again, unemployment has increased and new fiscal and external financing needs have emerged. (9) In this challenging context, the Union has reaffirmed its commitment to supporting Jordan in its economic and social challenges and reform process. In particular, this commitment was expressed at the conference 'Supporting Syria and the Region', held in London on 4 February 2016, where the EU pledged 2.39 billion in 2016-2017 in financial support for the countries most affected by the refugee crisis, including Jordan.

(12) Given that Jordan is a country covered by the ENP, it should be considered to be eligible to receive macro-financial assistance from the Union. (13) The Union\u2019s macro-financial assistance should be an exceptional financial instrument of untied and undesignated balance-of-payments support, which aims at addressing the beneficiary\u2019s immediate external financing needs and should underpin the implementation of a policy programme containing strong immediate adjustment and structural reform measures designed to improve the balance-of-payments position in the short term. (14) Given that there is still a significant residual external financing gap in Jordan's balance of payments over and above the resources provided by IMF and other multilateral institutions, the Union macro-financial assistance to be provided to Jordan is, under the current exceptional circumstances, considered to be an appropriate response to Jordan's request for support to the economic stabilisation, in conjunction with the IMF programme. The Union's macro-financial assistance would support the economic stabilisation and the structural reform agenda of Jordan, supplementing resources made available under the IMF's financial arrangement.

(16) The determination of the amount of the Union's macro-financial assistance is based on a complete quantitative assessment of Jordan's residual external financing needs, and takes into account its capacity to finance itself with its own resources, in particular the international reserves at its disposal. The Union's macro-financial assistance should complement the programmes and resources provided by the IMF and the World Bank. The determination of the amount of the assistance also takes into account expected financial contributions from multilateral donors and the need to ensure fair burden sharing between the Union and other donors, as well as the pre-existing deployment of the Union's other external financing instruments in Jordan and the added value of the overall Union involvement.

Indicators of results and impact The authorities will be required to report on a set of indicators to the Commission services on a regular basis and provide a comprehensive report on the compliance with the agreed policy conditions ahead of the disbursement of the second instalment of the assistance. The Commission services will continue to monitor public finance management, following the operational assessment of the financial circuits and administrative procedures in Jordan that will be carried out in preparation of this operation. The EU Delegation in Jordan will also provide regular reporting on issues relevant for the monitoring of the assistance. The Commission services will remain in close contact with the IMF and the World Bank to benefit from their insights from their on-going activities in Jordan. An annual report to the Council and European Parliament is foreseen in the proposed legislative decision, comprising an assessment of the implementation of this operation. An independent ex-post evaluation of the assistance will be carried out within two years after the expiry of the implementation period. 1.5. Grounds for the proposal/initiative 1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term The disbursement of the assistance will be conditional upon a satisfactory track record in the implementation of a disbursing economic programme between Jordan and the IMF, which is expected to be in place in the second half of 2016. In addition, the Commission shall agree with the Jordanian authorities on specific policy conditions, listed in a Memorandum of Understanding, to be met before the second instalment is released by the Commission. 1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement By helping the country overcome the economic shock caused by the regional instability and the Syrian refugee inflow the proposed MFA will contribute to promoting macroeconomic stability, economic reforms and political progress in the country. By complementing the resources made available by the international financial institutions, the EU and other donors, it will contribute to the overall effectiveness of the package of financial support provided by the international donor community. The proposed programme will also strengthen the government's reform commitment and its aspiration towards closer relations with the EU. This result will be achieved, inter alia, through appropriate conditionality for the disbursement of the assistance. In a larger context, the programme will signal to the other countries in the region that the EU continues to to support countries embarking on a clear path towards political reforms in times of economic difficulties.

        "EN 22 EN 1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past Since 2004, a total of sixteen ex-post evaluations have been carried out on macro-financial assistance operations. These evaluations conclude that MFA operations do contribute, albeit sometimes modestly and indirectly, to the improvement of the external sustainability, the macroeconomic stability and the achievement of structural reforms in the recipient country. In most cases, MFA operations had a positive effect on the balance of payments of the beneficiary country and helped to relax their budgetary constraints. They also led to a somewhat higher economic growth. 1.5.4. Compatibility and possible synergy with other appropriate instruments The EU is among the major donors of Jordan. Financial assistance committed for Jordan under the European Neighbourhood Partnership Instrument (ENPI) for the period 2007- 2013 totalled EUR 589 million. This amount includes additional funding granted through the incentive-based SPRING programme. For the period 2014-2017, under the European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI), EU's assistance to Jordan may range between a minimum allocation of EUR 312 million and a maximum allocation of EUR 382 million. Jordan will benefit from the EU Regional Trust Fund, the \u2018Madad fund, established in December 2014 to support Syria and the neighbouring countries, including Jordan. A first series of programmes for an amount of EUR 41 million financed by the Madad fund was approved in May 2015. These funds were complemented by financing from other EU instruments such as the Neighbourhood Investment Facility (NIF). In addition to bilateral cooperation programmes, Jordan also benefits from various regional programmes, mainly in the areas of rule of law and justice, environmental and climate protection, migration and culture and youth. Jordan also participates in initiatives open to all Neighbourhood partner countries such as: Erasmus+, which enhances mobility and co-operation with the EU in the field of higher education, TAIEX and SIGMA. Moreover, Jordan is also eligible for additional funds under several EU's thematic programmes and instruments, including the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR), the Non-State Actors and Local Authorities programme and the Migration and Asylum programme. The European Investment Bank is also supporting Jordan with a total amount of contracted loans of EUR 264.9 million since 2011, of which EUR 115.9 million in 2015. Lastly, the MFA-I of EUR 180 million approved in 2013 was satisfactorily implemented and fully disbursed in 2015. The key value added of the MFA in comparison to other EU instruments would be to help create a stable macroeconomic framework, including by promoting a sustainable balance of payments and budgetary situation, and an appropriate framework for structural reforms. MFA does not provide a regular financial support nor is meant to support the economic and social development of the recipient countries. It is to be discontinued as soon as the country's external financial situation has been brought back into a sustainable path. Afterwards, regular EU cooperation assistance instruments are meant to take over. MFA is also meant to be complementary to interventions by the international financial institutions, in particular the adjustment and reform programme to be supported by the IMF's Extended Fund Facility, and the Development Policy Loan of the World Bank. 1.6.

Management mode(s) envisaged 13 X Direct management by the Commission 2. MANAGEMENT MEASURES 2.1. Monitoring and reporting rules This assistance is of macroeconomic nature and its design will be consistent with the future IMF-supported economic programme. The monitoring of the action by the Commission services will take place on the basis of progress in the implementation of the IMF programme and specific reform measures to be agreed with the Jordanian authorities in a Memorandum of Understanding (see also point 1.4.4). 2.2. Management and control system 2.2.1. Risk(s) identified There are fiduciary, policy and political risks related to the proposed MFA operation. There is a risk that the macro-financial assistance, which is not dedicated to specific expenses, could be used in a fraudulent way. In general terms, this risk is related to factors such as the quality of management systems in the central bank and the ministry of finance and the appropriatedness of internal and external audit capabilities. Another key risk to the operation stems from the regional economic and political uncertainty, notably in Syria and Iraq, which has direct implications for the Jordanian economy. On the domestic front, the main risk is related to difficulties in the economic reform process and to existing macroeconomic vulnerabilities, including the fiscal implications of the Syrian refugees' inflow. Jordan also remains vulnerable to possible new disruptions in the supply of imported natural gas from Egypt. Finally, there are risks stemming from a possible weakening of the European and global economic environment and an increase in international energy and food prices. 2.2.2. Control method(s) envisaged The macro-financial assistance will be liable to verification, control and auditing procedures under the responsibility of the Commission, including the European Antifraud Office (OLAF), and by the European Court of Auditors. 13 Details of management modes and references to the Financial Regulation may be found on the BudgWeb site: http://www.cc.cec/budg/man/budgmanag/budgmanag_en.html ",
        "EN 24 EN 2.2.3. Costs and benefits of controls and probable non-compliance rate The basic costs for the Commission related to the methods of verification and control, as well as the cost of the Operational Assessment of financial and administrative circuits conducted prior to the operation, are described in Table 3.2.1. In addition, there are costs for the European Court of Auditors and of possible interventions of OLAF. The Operational Assessment not only helps assess risks of misuse of the funds but, as a collateral benefit, it provides useful information on the necessary reforms in the area of public finance management, which may be reflected in the policy conditionality of the operation. Regarding the probable non-compliance rate, the risk of non-compliance (in the form of non-repayment of the loan or misuse of the funds) is judged to be low, based on the experience with the MFA instrument since its creation. 2.3. Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities To mitigate the risks of fraudulent use several measures will be taken: First, the proposed legal basis for macro-financial assistance to Jordan includes a provision on fraud prevention measures. These measures will be elaborated further in the Loan Agreement, envisaging a set of provisions on inspection, fraud prevention, audits, and recovery of funds in case of fraud or corruption. It is further envisaged that a number of specific policy conditions will be attached to the assistance, mainly in the area of public finance management, with a view to strengthening efficiency, transparency and accountability. Second, before the agreement on the Memorandum of Understanding is reached, the Commission services, with the support of duly mandated external experts, will carry out a new Operational Assessment of the financial circuits and administrative procedures at the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of Jordan, in order to fulfil the requirements of the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the Union. This review will determine whether the framework for sound financial management of macro-financial assistance is sufficiently effective in Jordan by covering areas such as management structure and organisation, management and control of funds, security of IT systems, internal and external audit capacity as well as the independence of the central bank. In the light of this assessment, specific mechanisms applying to the management of the funds by the beneficiaries may be introduced in agreement with the national authorities. Also, the assistance will be paid to a dedicated account at the Central Bank of Jordan. Finally, the assistance will be liable to verification, control and auditing procedures under the responsibility of the Commission, including the European Antifraud Office (OLAF) and the European Court of Auditors. 3.
