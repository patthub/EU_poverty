        "bridge 6 BRIDGE BROCHURE 2021 1. Foreword In July 2021, the Council's and the European Parliament's reached a political agreement setting into law the objective of a climate-neutral EU by 2050, and a collective, net greenhouse gas emissions reduction target of at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990. To reach these ambitious objectives, the European Commission has updated its climate and energy policy framework in the \"fit-for-55\" climate package. This package contains policy measures to reach the EU targets, including the revision of the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Directives. Moreover, the European Commission proposed a Path to the Digital Decade, a concrete plan to achieve the digital transformation of our society and economy by 2030. This will pave the way for the ongoing twin digital and green transformation of the energy sector to benefit from state-of-the-art digital solutions with lower environmental footprint and higher energy and material efficiency, leading to a more resilient, efficient and greener energy system. Translating these ambitions into reality and successfully completing the digitally enabled energy transition requires the engagement of all market actors and policy makers, including citizens. The EU Multiannual Financial Framework for the next 7 years and the new recovery instrument will provide an unprecedented opportunity to support them. A total EU budget of EUR 1.8 trillion has been agreed. This is the largest EU budget ever in the EU. It will help rebuilding a post-COVID Europe, which is greener, more digital and more resilient. At least 30% of the funds will be spent on fighting climate change, which represents the highest share ever. The EU\u2019s increased ambition will spur sustainable economic growth, create jobs, deliver health and environmental benefits for EU citizens, and contribute to the long-term global competitiveness of the EU economy by promoting innovation in green and digital technologies. It will not be possible to achieve the EU overarching ambitions without a smarter and digitalized energy system enabling dynamic and interlinked flows of energy, allowing for more diverse markets, and creating flexibility required for the integration of higher shares of renewables in an efficient way. Ensuring the integrity and resilience of the data infrastructure, networks, and communications as a basis for the European technological and data sovereignty and compliance to policies on data protection and data governance are also needed to reach the energy policy targets. The BRIDGE initiative \u2013 that started with Horizon 2020 and continues now under Horizon Europe, the biggest Research and Innovation funding programme ever supported - unites R&I projects in the areas of smart grid, energy storage, islands, and digitalization to create a structured view of cross-cutting issues encountered in the demonstration projects. It aims to foster knowledge sharing among projects as well as a dialogue between innovation and market regulation, through different Working Groups. The goal is to increase the impact that projects have to speed up the energy transition. The initiative was launched in 2015 and since then 90 projects, from which 58 are ongoing, have been actively involved. So far, these projects received around EUR 1 billion of EU support. Altogether, they involve close to 1000 organizations from 40 countries. The initiative also facilitated the drafting of dedicated policy and technical reports, policy feedback discussions, and webinars. We welcome this brochure of BRIDGE projects, which provides a very good overview of the technologies and innovations, the projects\u2019 partners, and the geographical coverage. We look forward to welcoming new projects when they start, thus making it a living platform. Please also keep an eye on the website for the most up-to-date information. Enjoy the reading!

        "bridge 9 BRIDGE BROCHURE 2021 2.1 Stakeholders involved in BRIDGE projects Different types of stakeholders are participating in the BRIDGE initiative. Consumers include residential, professional and industrial consumers, as well as cities acting as consumers in projects. Regulated Operators are TSOs and DSOs as defined by the Electricity Directive. Regulators are the National Regulatory Authorities as defined by the Electricity Directive. Local Energy Communities are defined as associations, cooperatives, partnerships, non-profit organisations or other legal entities which are effectively controlled by local shareholders or members, generally value rather than profit-driven, involved in distributed generation and in performing activities of a distribution system operator, supplier or aggregator at local level, including across borders. Power technology providers are hardware manufacturers for power transmission, distribution and generation technologies. Storage providers are considered in a separate category (all storage technologies are considered, including batteries from EVs and hot water tanks). ICT providers are software and telecommunication vendors. Research & Innovation stakeholders include research centres, universities, think-tanks, consultants and other services. Energy Suppliers include power generators, retailers, energy service companies (ESCOs) acting in the competitive energy market. Aggregators are market participants that combine multiple customer loads or generated electricity for sale, for purchase or auction in any organised energy market. Market operators include power exchanges, brokers and traders on the energy markets. Others is a category that covers stakeholders that do not fall in any of the above-defined categories such as international organisations, communication agencies, water supply operators\u2026 ",
        "bridge 10 BRIDGE BROCHURE 2021 Some stakeholders fall into several categories: electricity operators on islands for instance, act both as energy suppliers and DSOs; some power technology providers sell ICT tools and storage devices. The following diagram categorises stakeholders according to their dominant role within the BRIDGE projects, as seen by the project coordinators: \u25aa Around 66% of the regulated operators are DSOs and almost 34% are TSOs. \u25aa Technology providers comprise 30% power technology providers, 23% storage providers and 47% ICT providers. \u25aa Energy suppliers constitute the main electricity market players involved in BRIDGE projects followed by aggregators and market operators. \u25aa Research and Innovation actors are the dominant category of stakeholders in BRIDGE projects.

        "bridge 11 BRIDGE BROCHURE 2021 2.2 Geographical distribution of BRIDGE projects 2.2.1 Geographical distribution of stakeholders BRIDGE projects involve stakeholders from 40 countries as presented by the figure below. \u25aa The number of projects per country is calculated based on the stakeholders involved in ended and ongoing projects. \u25aa The number of stakeholders involved per country corresponds to the total number of partners from this country in all the BRIDGE projects. When the number of stakeholders involved per country is higher than the number of projects, it means that more than one partner from the same country is participating in each project. In some cases, there are more projects than stakeholders involved for a given country, meaning that the same stakeholders participate in several projects ( examples from Austria, Romania, Cyprus\u2026 ). Some stakeholders from outside the EU are participating in BRIDGE projects: Norway (28), Switzerland (18), Turkey (8), Iceland (1), Montenegro (2), Bosnia and Herzegovina (1), Albania (1), Serbia (9), UK (59), USA (1), China (1), India (1) and Israel (2). 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 Country Representation in BRIDGE Projects Number of projects (at least one partner) Number of stakeholders involved ",

        "bridge 15 BRIDGE BROCHURE 2021 2.3 Technologies and services tackled by BRIDGE projects A broad range of technologies and services are being tested by BRIDGE projects. Five main categories are considered here: Technologies for Consumers: Demand response, smart appliances, and smart metering. Grid technologies: HVDC, HVAC, protections, HVDC breaker, inertia, network management, monitoring and control tools 1 , and micro-grid. Large-scale storage technologies, in general connected at transmission level 2 : Power to Gas (P2G), Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) and hydro storage. Small-scale storage technologies, in general connected at distribution level 3 : batteries (including from electric vehicles), thermal energy storage (including power to heat, heat pumps, hot water tanks, geothermal storage), and flywheels. Generation technologies: wind turbines, photovoltaic (PV), solar thermal, biogas, tidal energy, and micro-generation. 1 Noted further on in Project fact sheets \u2018Network management and control tools\u2019. 2 It might happen however that such technologies, at a smaller scale, are connected at distribution level (in particular CAES). 3 Batteries might also be connected at transmission level. ",
        "bridge 16 BRIDGE BROCHURE 2021 The next figure indicates the number of BRIDGE projects deploying the five main categories of technologies and services. It appears that 88% of the BRIDGE projects (78 out of 88) are dealing with technologies for consumers. Around 86% of the projects (76 out of 88 projects) are dealing with grid technologies. On the other hand, generation technologies are addressed by 58 projects (65%). Storage aspects are mainly addressed at small-scale level by 64 projects (72%) while large-scale storage is addressed by only 21% of the BRIDGE members (19 projects). DIGITALISATION Digitalisation as enabling technology is used in almost all BRIDGE projects (92%) dealing with technologies for consumers such as demand response or smart appliances and operation and management of the grid. MARKET SERVICES Many BRIDGE projects (85%) deal with electricity market services in terms of market aspects, electricity markets and ancillary services are almost equally addressed. ",
        "bridge 17 BRIDGE BROCHURE 2021 The next figures show more specifically the exact distribution of the BRIDGE projects for each category of technologies or services. Technologies for consumers mainly address demand response and smart metering; 35 projects also deal with smart appliances to be deployed at consumer level. In terms of grid technologies, a high number of projects deal with network management, monitoring and control tools, as well as with micro-grids. Regarding storage technologies, 10 projects work with power to gas, 4 projects with CAES and 9 projects involve hydro storage. The most addressed small-scale storage technologies by the BRIDGE community are batteries (with more than a third of the projects working with electric vehicles). Last but not least, thermal energy storage and flywheels are being tested by 41 and 6 projects respectively. With regards to generation technologies, PV, wind and micro-generation are the most commonly addressed. ",

The SMILE project aims at demonstrating different innovative technological and non- technological solutions in large-scale smart grid demonstration projects in the Orkneys (Scotland), Sams\u00f8 (Denmark) and Madeira (Portugal) islands (with different policies, regulations and energy markets), paving the way for their introduction in the market in the near future. SMILE pilots will demonstrate operation of the distribution grid under stable and secure conditions to implement solutions for demand response, intelligent control and automation of distribution networks; they have high shares of RES in the electricity grid or have planned increasing shares in the next years Scope. The objective is to test solutions while establishing mutual learning processes and providing best practice guidance for replication in other regions. The three pilots will test different combinations of technological solutions according to local specificities and conditions and the existing infrastructure and will involve all value chain actors needed to efficiently implement projects system- wide. The sites are therefore effectively representative of the majority of the EU energy markets and offer excellent demonstration settings which will deliver maximum impact in terms of replicability. It is important to highlight that the Orkney Islands and Sams\u00f8 are electrically connected to the mainland network and Madeira is the only case of a total energy island. Technical description and implementation. The main technological solutions faced by the project vary from integration of battery technology, power to heat, power to fuel, pumped hydro, electric vehicles, electricity stored on board of boats, an aggregator approach to demand side management (DSM) and predictive algorithms. Within this framework and to maintain the replicability of procedures the following activities are to be implemented in each demo site: \u2022 Development of common frameworks and controls, demand response strategies and cyber security. \u2022 Life Cycle Assessment/Costing (LCA/LCC), cost/benefit analyses, socio-economic studies, definition of financial mechanisms for incentivizing participation in smart grid operations, business modelling and business planning activities. \u2022 Legal and regulatory analysis of smart energy supply concepts which are relevant for developing smart energy supply systems. \u2022 Impact analyses, including energy system impacts, energy strategies and energy market design. \u2022 Communication, dissemination and replication of results. Impact . Replicability: As SMILE relies on plug-and- play scalable software, the proposed smart grid solutions will be modular and scalable. Socio-economics: Establishing market opportunities for new smart grid products and services, thus stimulating companies\u2019 growth and the creation of job opportunities. Also, reduction of investments for increased generation capacity and grid reinforcement thanks to the exploitation of demand- side flexibility. Environment: Reduction of the environmental impact and carbon footprint of the whole electricity supply system, alleviation of fuel poverty and promoting self-consumption. Market Transformation and Policy: By facilitating the connection of distributed energy sources of all sizes/natures in the energy grid and by allowing consumers to play their part in optimizing the operation of the system through demand response schemes. Moreover, allowing consumers to play an active role in electricity retail, thus reaping the benefits and value added associated to energy markets. In addition, by demonstrating smart grid solutions in real-life settings, the project will strongly support ongoing policy developments in the field of the design of the internal electricity market.

        "bridge 25 BRIDGE BROCHURE 2021 Project Description Context . With the increased share of renewable energy sources (RES), the electricity system is expected to be exposed to new or increased risks, for instance in terms of security of supply, congestion, system stability, curtailments, difficulty to meet the demand at some periods of time. To face this evolution, there is a growing need for more flexibility and more active involvement of all the stakeholders at all levels (from distribution to pan-European) to ensure an efficient and reliable operation of the electricity system. Enhanced synergies between different energy carriers appear now as one of the means to provide flexibility to the electricity system but also to drive efficiency and business innovation in the energy sector. Scope. MAGNITUDE\u2019s goal is to identify flexibility options from enhanced synergies between electricity, heating, cooling and gas networks, to support the cost-effective integration of RES and enhance security of supply. MAGNITUDE brings under a common framework, technical solutions, market design and business models, to ensure that its results can be integrated in the overall ongoing policy discussion in the energy field. Technical description and implementation. The project approach is based on the following main activities: \u2022 Characterize the most relevant services that can be provided by multi-energy systems (MES) to the electricity system in order to increase the share of RES, enhance security of supply and increase trading between energy sectors. \u2022 Study the actual flexibility options that cross- sector technologies and systems can provide to the electricity sector. \u2022 Simulate and optimize control strategies to improve the operation of such technologies and MES to maximize flexibility provision. \u2022 Quantify the benefits of pooling flexibilities from decentralized MES through an aggregation platform. \u2022 Propose innovative market designs for synergies maximization at market level that are assessed on a market simulation platform. \u2022 Assess business models for the MES stakeholders and the aggregator. \u2022 Develop recommendations and policy strategy in a pan-European perspective \u2013 including technology, market, business models, and regulation. The project results are validated on seven real life case studies of multi-energy systems of different sizes and technological features, located in Austria, Denmark, France, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and United Kingdom. Impact . Replicability: Located in 7 different countries, the real-life case studies allow to cover different regulatory frameworks, sector-coupling technologies, stakeholders and business models, and to analyse the results in a pan-European perspective. A dedicated task further addresses the replicability of the studied MES in the 9 countries of consortium partners. Socio-economics: the project will contribute to stimulate new economic and social benefits at different levels. In particular, it will contribute to the creation of business opportunities by enhancing the current roles and businesses of actors among multi energy systems. Environment: MAGNITUDE will contribute to increase the share of RES while ensuring the security of supply in the electricity system. Increased flexibility and multi energy carrier integration will allow to smooth energy consumption, reduce peak load and offset the need for additional power generation. It will contribute to reducing the environmental footprint and the greenhouse gas emissions. Market Transformation: MAGNITUDE will provide and assess market options, based on a transnational perspective, to enable multi energy systems participation in the markets. In particular, it will address the specific role of the aggregator in different national markets and will provide adapted software solutions. Policy: Through its results and learnings, MAGNITUDE will identify the barriers to the participation of MES in the markets and will propose recommendations. MAGNITUDE will provide insights to the ongoing discussions to shape the European energy markets. ",

        "bridge 27 BRIDGE BROCHURE 2021 Project Description Context. The EU committed to reach a share of renewables of at least 27% by 2030. These targets aimed at helping the EU achieve a more competitive, secure and sustainable energy system and to meet its long-term 2050 greenhouse gas reductions target. Indeed, the increasing share of fluctuating Renewable Energy Sources (RES) has become key to improve the carbon footprint of the European electricity system and achieve energy and climate change policy goals. This increase has been accompanied by an emerging decentralized and transnational RES ecosystem and the promotion of specific interconnection projects. With low penetration levels, the effects of renewable generation and distributed energy resources (DER) may be ignored; but as the penetration levels rise, a new approach is required to integrate and manage the vast amount of DER which is expected to drive the grid in the -not so distant- future. In the case of the South Eastern Europe (SEE), even if all its MSs are on track to achieve their RES penetration targets, the region still has a huge potential to become a clean energy hub for Europe, reducing the 53% of imported energy at a cost of 400 billion. Scope. CROSSBOW is a TSO driven project with the goal to successfully deploy a set of technological solutions which enable increasing the shared use of resources to foster transmission networks cross-border management of variable renewable energies and storage units , making possible a higher penetration of clean energies whilst reducing network operational costs and improving economic benefits of RES and storage units. CROSSBOW results will be evaluated during 18 months by one of the European RSC and 8 TSOs in SEE, demonstrating how CROSSBOW tackles the regional challenges faced by these TSOs. Technical description and implementation. The project technological solutions will be packaged in the form of 9 different products/results: \u2022 CROSSBOW Regional Operation Centre Balancing Cockpit ( ROC-BC ) \u2022 CROSSBOW RES Regional Coordination Centre ( RES- CC ) \u2022 CROSSBOW Hybrid RES Dispatchable Unit ( RES-DU ) \u2022 CROSSBOW Regional Storage Coordination Centre ( STO-CC ) \u2022 CROSSBOW Virtual Storage Plants ( VSP ) \u2022 CROSSBOW WAMAS (Wide Area Monitoring and Awareness System) \u2022 CROSSBOW Regional DSM integration platform ( DSM- IP ) \u2022 CROSSBOW Wholesale and Ancillary Market toolset ( AM ) \u2022 CROSSBOW Cooperative ownership of flexibility assets ( CFP ) Impact . Replicability: The project involves all relevant actors in SEE to guarantee not only replicability, but also scalability beyond the context of CROSSBOW. Socio-economics: The project will have a significant impact in the commercial operation and innovation activities of the consortium - with a planned ROI for the partners of less than 36 months after full deployment and commercialisation of CROSSBOW products and services starts- and the European sector at large, contributing to the creation of jobs and the access to better quality energy services for EU citizens and businesses. Environment: The project will trigger a saving of 3 MTons of GHG, and the increase of 10% in the share of RES (15,2 TWh). Market Transformation: One of the main mechanisms that the project will propose to achieve higher penetration of RES, is the evolution towards a Regional flexibility market. Policy: CROSSBOW not only counts with the participation of 8 TSOs in SEE, but also with the active support in the User Group of 5 National Regulatory Authorities (NRA) of the region and the Energy Community Secretariat.

        "bridge 29 BRIDGE BROCHURE 2021 Project Description Context . European policy makers have set ambitious targets for the decarbonisation of the energy system, demanding increased levels of energy efficiency and world leading levels of renewable energy technologies (RES). Scope. EU-SysFlex will make an important contribution in meeting the European Union (EU) world leading RES objectives. The results and later impacts of the project will be decisive for the cost-effective transformation of the electricity system, by enhancing the flexibility required, while maintaining the level of resilience that consumers and society expect from the European electricity system. A key characteristic of the transformation of the electrical system is that existing conventional plant and the flexible services they provide will be increasingly displaced by new RES and technologies including wind, solar and battery storage. This raises two issues: 1/ the conventional plant are today\u2019s service providers and their displacement leads to shortfalls in flexibility and needed services, 2/ the nature of the power system is transformed requiring a range of new or different technical shortfalls to be addressed. Failing to meet the required long term flexibility and system services will undermine Europe\u2019s ability to enable the cost-effective transformation of the electrical system, and the additional costs which will be borne by consumers. Technical description and implementation. Firstly, the technical needs of the pan-European system will be defined for scenarios with more than 50% RES. This requires advanced simulation of the technical performance of the future system from load generation balancing including different aspects of flexibility to electromechanical and electromagnetic issues. Secondly, the electricity market design and regulation need to be enhanced to efficiently and effectively procure the appropriate combination of flexibility and system services. Thirdly, implicit and explicit barriers to competitive forces being applied need to be removed. The project will develop and demonstrate innovative approaches to utilise, dispatch and schedule a range of new technologies to meet the flexibility and system services required to facilitate meeting European long term policy objectives. Impact. Replicability: EU-SYSFLEX will provide a product range of solutions that will be demonstrated or simulated during the project. A validation of scalability approaches, based on the models developed within the project, will be undertaken to check that technical issues are being solved and considered appropriately. Replicability of all the solutions will be assured. Socio-economics: Some solutions will derive in the creation of start-ups which will commercialise them and further develop them, creating highly skilled and value adding jobs and thus strengthening Europe\u2019s smart SMEs ecosystem: it will contribute to achieve a resilient and secure European power system, with citizens at its core taking ownership of the energy transition, benefitting from new technologies to reduce their bills, participating actively in the market, and where vulnerable consumers are protected. Environment: EU-SysFlex will make an important contribution to meeting European world leading RES objectives. Meeting these objectives will represent an opportunity for society from both the perspective of climate change mitigation and a driver for innovation, competitiveness of our industries and job creation. Market Transformation: The EU-SysFlex project will impact several critical areas of the European energy sector such as: \u2022 Transnational problems, namely cross-border and cross sectoral issues. \u2022 Market design and regulatory options for innovative services, as well as business models and Pan- European market integration. Policy : The project will develop a flexibility roadmap to remove and overcome the technical, regulatory, communication and system operator issues that limit the full benefit of each of the solutions developed and demonstrated, thus presenting a potential for tangible benefits to the pan-European cost-effective system by reducing system costs and CO 2 emissions.

        "bridge 31 BRIDGE BROCHURE 2021 Project Description Context . Renewable energy is gaining a continuously increasing share in the production mix throughout the world. System decarbonization, long-term energy security and expansion of energy access in developing countries, due to the distributed nature of renewable sources are only a few of the benefits they introduce. However, the further integration of renewables remains a challenge. Their intermittent production and unpredictability, combined with the need for large-scale storage integration and the lack of valorisation of the services that they offer by the energy market pose as barriers against their establishment. The FLEXITRANSTORE project identifies the need for flexibility integration in the European power system as the main driver to overcome the aforementioned barriers and reaching higher RES penetration. At a technical level, novel smart grid technologies, control and storage methods will be introduced into the existing power system. At a market level, new business plans, players and market rules will facilitate the valorisation of flexibility services offered by renewables and enable increased cross-border flows. Scope. The FLEXITRANSTORE project will assist the evolution towards a pan-European transmission network with high flexibility and interconnection levels. The Flexible Energy Grid proposed includes adaptation and integration of technologies to ensure that their management demonstrates flexible resource applications that mitigate the effects of RES variability on the network. The project will, thus, work towards the advancement of the Internal European Market, focusing on technologies that facilitate the networking of cross-border players and further enabling energy trading. Within this context the strategic objectives of the project have been defined as follows: \u2022 To enhance and accelerate the integration of renewables into the European energy systems. \u2022 To increase cross-border electricity flows across Europe. Technical description and implementation. A range of state-of-the-art ICT technologies and control improvements will be exploited to enhance the flexibility of the energy grid by integrating storage and demand response management. The FEG components and the market infrastructure will be deployed in 8 Demonstrations installed in 6 countries. Key technologies that will be introduced include: \u2022 Power System Stabilizers for conventional generation and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) integration at TSO/DSO border substations, at wind farms substation and at synchronous GT plants to increase flexibility in the power system. \u2022 Power Flow Controllers and Dynamic Line Rating sensors and algorithms to relieve congestion and to mitigate weather effects. \u2022 A representative grid model which predicts the dynamic behaviour of the grid following big disturbances, thus improving the grid\u2019s observability and stability. \u2022 An integrated market platform based on an enhanced EUPHEMIA market model, which valorises flexibility services. Impact . Replicability: Work is ongoing at the moment to develop a liberalized energy market in Cyprus. FLEXITRANSTORE can feed into this project. Once the approach succeeds in the Cypriot system it can be seen as a starting point for scaling the approach on a regional and finally pan-European level towards the development of a single European IEM. Socio-economics: The new market approach will include consumer participation in the market and the novel technologies will facilitate the improved utilization of the available energy, thus reducing operational and capacity costs. The project will ensure that the EU electricity network operates within a wholesale market, providing consumers with competitive prices and integrating renewable sources. Environment: By enabling higher RES penetration, FLEXITRANSTORE will contribute towards the reduction of CO 2 and other greenhouse gases emissions. Market Transformation: FLEXITRANSTORE is in line with the ETIP SNET 10 Year R&I Roadmap and the ENTSO-E R&I Roadmap 2017-2026 and will impact both new and existing market participants. Policy: FLEXITRANSTORE will provide policy recommendations to TSOs, DSOs, Market Regulators, Power Plant owners and other actors of the energy value chain. ",

        "bridge 33 BRIDGE BROCHURE 2021 Project Description Context . Six TSOs, eleven research partners, together with sixteen industries (manufacturers, solution providers) and market (producers, ESCo) players address, through a holistic approach, the identification and development of flexibilities required to enable the Energy Transition to high share of renewables. This approach captures synergies across needs (energy markets, system services, grid flow control) and sources of flexibilities (renewable generation, demand response, grid, storage), such as multiple services from one source, or hybridizing sources, thus resulting in a cost- efficient power system. Scope. OSMOSE proposes four TSO-led demonstrations (RTE, REE, TERNA and ELES) aiming at increasing the techno-economic potential of a wide range of flexibility solutions and covering several applications, i.e.: synchronisation of large power systems by multiservice hybrid storage; multiple services provided by the coordinated control of different storage and FACTS devices; multiple services provided by grid devices, large demand- response and RES generation coordinated in a smart management system; cross-border sharing of flexibility sources through a near real-time cross- border energy market. The demonstrations are coordinated with and supported by simulation-based studies which aim (i) to forecast the economically optimal mix of flexibility solutions in long-term energy scenarios (2030 and 2050) and (ii) to build recommendations for improvements of the existing market mechanisms and regulatory frameworks, thus enabling the reliable and sustainable development of flexibility assets by market players in coordination with regulated players. Interoperability and improved TSO/DSO interactions are addressed so as to ease the scaling up and replication of the flexibility solutions. A database is built for the sharing of real-life techno-economic performances of electrochemical storage devices. Technical description and implementation. For the integration of high-shares of non-dispatchable renewables, to foster the cost-efficient roll-out of flexibility solutions required for energy markets, for existing and future system services and for the dynamic control of grid flows: \u2022 by demonstrating flexibility solutions enabling synergies across flexibility sources and applications, thus assessing and increasing their techno-economic feasibility; \u2022 by increasing the techno-economic scalability of these solutions; \u2022 by forecasting the economically optimal mix of flexibilities for the European power system, taking into account these synergies, for the best social welfare; \u2022 by proposing evolutions of market designs & regulations leading to this mix and capturing these synergies, in order to achieve this social welfare. Impact. Replicability: The demonstrations have a large coverage of the needs for flexibility, three of them focussing on the coordinated use of flexibility solutions mostly based on proven technologies (in stand-alone applications). Dedicated tasks will address the scaling-up and replicability issues, together with interoperability. Socio-economics: the pan-European roll-out of flexibility solutions and (new) associated services will be beneficial for the industrial partners of the project by creating new market opportunities supporting this deployment. Environment: The project, by facilitating the integration of very high shares of RES generation, improves the overall GHG emissions reduction of the pan-European power system. Market Transformation: A real- time \u201cFlexEnergy\u201d dispatching market platform operating simultaneously at the national and cross-border levels, providing a supply-demand matching of bids maximising social welfare in a given time interval will be operated based on calculation of cross-border flexibility exchange capability close to real time. Policy: The OSMOSE project will provide recommendations on market designs and regulations to ensure sufficient and cost-efficient provision of flexibilities and will also make a critical assessment of the current framework.

        "bridge 35 BRIDGE BROCHURE 2021 Project Description Context . Development in RES and IT technologies together supported by social activity creates new opportunities for setting up Energy Community (EnC). The main aim of COMPILE is to show the opportunities of energy islands for decarbonisation of energy supply, community building and creating environmental and socio-economic benefits. Scope. COMPILE objectives are: \u2022 Empowering Local Energy Systems (transition from a centralized system into a flexible but secure decentralized network); \u2022 Optimal integration and control of all the energy vectors, storage and electromobility options to maximize decarbonisation and energy savings; \u2022 Foster the creation of energy communities taking into account positive effects on the local economy and user acceptance considering vulnerable groups; \u2022 Create new ways to stimulate actors in the value chain to cooperate and maximize the social benefit, to foster the adoption of the technological solutions and enable a large-scale replication of the developed technological solutions and business models. Technical description and implementation. In order to reach the objectives of the project, 4 technical tools and 2 EnC creation/support tools will be developed/enhanced and tested at 5 pilot site locations in 5 different countries. The pilot sites vary in organizational maturity from starters Rafina municipality (Greece) to mature EnC in Crevillent (Spain). Pilot sites also vary in size from individual multi apartment building in Lisbon (Portugal) to small city of Crevillent (Spain) in order to test the replicability and scalability potential of developed tools. Impact. Replicability: Replicability of COMPILE results are ensured by understanding the roles, opportunities and limitation of the actors, as well as their interplay. The COMPILE tools are validated and tailored to the needs of different actors, improving their replicability. Socio-economics: COMPILE aims to understand what are the factors that are relevant for community building, for behaviour changes and for the uptake of new technologies by citizens. These factors are included in the community building activities in the pilot sites. Environment: The methods of COMPILE include also life cycle analysis (LCA), so that the environmental impact of all the results is understood. LCA also guides the optimization of Local Energy Communities and contributes to the overall aim of the decarbonization of the economy. Market Transformation: To successfully contribute to market transformation, we need to understand new value chains, the roles of different actors and their revenue streams. COMPILE covers all stages of an innovation system, from knowledge generation through demonstration to market formation. It investigates and even shapes the enabling framework, the \u201cinnova tion ecosystem\u201d in which the COMPILE solutions can be deployed. COMPILE solutions enable different actors to pursue new business models and use the knowledge gathered in the project to arrive at positive business cases. Policy: COMPILE is one of 4 sister projects under the LC- SC-3 call. The demonstrations cover pilot sites in more than 12 EU countries. This way, the policy recommendations can be shared and harmonized via BRIDGE and direct cooperation among sister projects. Insight and learnings can be better generalized, guaranteeing robust conclusions for national and EU legislation. International dimension: COMPILE also shares the results with goal of increasing the replicability of solutions through cooperation with 2 international partners: Institute of Rural Management Anand (IRMA) from India and China University of Mining and Technology-Beijing from China.

        "bridge 37 BRIDGE BROCHURE 2021 Project Description Context. In the era of urgency to tackle the climate change, synergies between multiple energy vectors can support decarbonization of local energy islands and, at the same time, relieve constraints from the electricity grid. Multi-vector energy systems offer flexibility to integrate variable and economic local energy generation. However, the implementation and operation of multi-vector energy systems face technical, societal and business-related challenges. Scope. E-LAND addresses previously identified challenges by developing and implementing the E- LAND Toolbox for Multi-Energy Islands. Technologically, E-LAND bridges the communication and information flow between different local energy systems to create and implement an integrated solution. Socially, E-LAND incorporates citizens and other local community members as part of the solution development team to facilitate bottom-up solution development. Involving citizens to co-create solutions ensures better acceptance of novel technologies and facilitates changes in behaviour, which together strengthen energy reliability and increase the self-sufficiency of communities. In the business field, E-LAND develops tools, which will support market players to innovate their business model to cope with energy-transition and rapid implementation of renewable energies, storage facilities and data-analytic tools. Technical description and implementation. The final product will be a powerful toolbox consisting of tools to build decarbonised, multi-vector Energy Islands on a foundation of advanced ICT and data analytics technologies, strong community engagement tools and solid business models. To meet the goals of the project, a co-creative process has been designed which involves active participation of end-users together with technology developers. The toolbox will be modular and customizable to specific local requirements, expandable to incorporate new tools and interoperable with standards-based legacy systems. The tools will be implemented and validated at three pilot locations in Europe (Spain, Norway & Romania) and two simulated pilots in India. Impact. Replicability: E-LAND ensures the potential for wide rollout of the Toolbox by validating the replicability of the tools with different locations in terms of geography, demography, sociography and maturity. Socio-economics: The E-LAND project seeks to develop, pilot and validate new and innovative solutions suitable for the European market as well as the global market. The project involves many stakeholders, each seeking to gain different benefits and link many energy topics. It strengthens the foundation of multiple industry sectors, and for each of these sectors the project opens additional employment opportunities and new business ventures. Environment: Through the 3 European pilots implemented in the project, E-LAND will demonstrate a reduction of CO 2 emissions, an increase in renewables utilisation and self-sufficiency. E-LAND tools have potential to simultaneously decarbonise electricity sector, transport sector and gas sector. In countries like India where rural areas are still dependent on the burning of fossil fuels E-LAND will make implementation of renewable-based microgrid affordable. Market Transformation: As a general goal for sustainable business creation, E-LAND aims for financially self-sustainable pilots after the project execution. The new business models developed for energy islands will support communities to run their own energy system in a self-sustaining and profitable way. E-LAND will develop a business model innovator tool which can be readily used by broader market players to design new business models or to improvise on existing ones under changing energy paradigm. Policy: The project will expose existing regulatory barriers in general and specific barriers existing in the pilot countries. Results of the work will lead to the identification of current regulatory barriers, including risk preparedness regulations and regulations on crisis management. ",

        "bridge 39 BRIDGE BROCHURE 2021 Project Description Context . The objective of IElectrix is to develop innovative technical solutions and economical business models to facilitate the implementation of Citizen Energy Communities (CEC). This is also a way to speed up the integration of Renewable Energy Sources in Smart Grids and to take part in the decarbonisation of the energy system. In this context, Distribution System Operators need to ensure an appropriate connection of CEC within the grid. Scope. The IElectrix project gathers European and Indian partners towards the achievement of a common technical and economical goal. It consists in implementing different Smart Grids demonstrators to test a set of functionalities required to keep up with the current energy sector transformation: renewable intermittent energies, digitization, decentralizat ion, and consumer\u2019s implication . To reach such goals, IElectrix project brings forward innovative technical solutions: \u2022 Mobile storage systems and digital substations \u2022 Implementation of demand-side management schemes \u2022 Microgrid and islanding solutions \u2022 Low voltage grid digitalization Technical description and implementation. The 5 demonstration pilots are based on different regulatory and ecosystem contexts: one is located in India, two in Hungary, one in Germany and one in Austria: The Indian demonstration pilot anticipates the large amount of photovoltaic panels (PV) which will be connected at the low voltage level in the coming years following recent governmental plans. The Hungarian demonstration pilots address issues that are located at an early stage of renewable deployment in two distinct regions. The German demonstration pilot is carried out in a region with a high amount of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) already integrated in the grid. Within the demonstration, a mobile storage system is used in order to both postpone costly network reinforcements and integrate more RES in a faster way. The Austrian demonstration pilot involves an existing energy community in the G\u00fcssing District where RES investments have already been made. Impact. Replicability: The scalability and replicability analysis of the use cases aims at learning from the solutions tested in the demonstrators and evaluating the impacts of their implementation at a larger scale within a similar or a different energy background. In parallel, a coordination with similar EU-funded projects is implemented to address four policy relevant issues: regulatory framework, business models, data management, and customer engagement, in support of the deployment studies. Socio-economics: The project aims at stimulating the pan- European and Indian roll-out of flexibility solutions and associated services: this will be beneficial for the industrial partners of the project by creating new market opportunities supporting this deployment. The systemic technical and market optimisation proposed by the consortium partners should also help optimise social welfare and guarantee adequate signals for investors and competitive electricity prices for end users. Environment: The project facilitates the integration of very high shares of RES generation, and thus improves the overall GHG emissions reduction of the pan-European power system. Policy: The present project aims at providing recommendations on market designs and regulations to ensure sufficient and cost-efficient provision of flexibilities at DSO level, while making a critical assessment of the current frameworks. The costs supporting these recommendations is first studied with a regional focus (Germany, France, Hungary) and next extrapolated at pan European level. These outputs, based on the results from the demonstrations and replication studies, support the Clean Energy for all Europeans package in general. ",

MERLON spans local generation output, energy demand, storage flexibility and options offered by EVs, and interconnection among different energy vectors to facilitate RES integration into the grid, curtailment avoidance and satisfaction of balancing/ancillary grid needs. This is achieved through integration of innovative technologies for local energy system integration, human- centric demand response, optimised energy storage, Grid- to-Vehicle (G2V), Virtual Thermal Energy Storage and coordination with local CHP plants as well as their operational optimisation. Scope. The key objectives of MERLON are: \u2022 To introduce and integrate Smart Inverter technology combined with Battery Energy Storage Systems connected at key network locations of the Integrated Local Energy Systems; \u2022 To facilitate maximum RES integration, self- consumption and satisfaction of balancing/ ancillary grid needs through holistic integration and optimal coordination of local flexibility resources (generation, demand, storage, EVs); \u2022 To contribute to the establishment of local energy communities with their local flexibility markets; \u2022 To introduce innovative technologies able to automatically modify demand profiles, without violating prosumer preferences/ schedules; \u2022 To democratise energy flexibility markets via corresponding business models accompanied by clearly defined and transparent rules, standardised contracts and appropriate technological tools for local energy markets. Technical description and implementation. MERLON brings together a wide range of mature and proven technologies and integrates them in a holistic and interoperable framework, comprising in a fully-fledged suite of tools and applications for all major stakeholders involved in the Optimisation of Local Energy Management Systems. The backbone of the MERLON solution consists in a modular and extendable Smart Inverter system connected at substation level, which is responsible for the Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) integration and its operation orchestration while enabling temporal intentional islanding and grid forming when required to ensure security of supply and power quality. Impact. Replicability: The diversity of the selected MERLON pilot sites ensures a sound validation process and a high replication potential around EU. The scale of the prominent pilots, the diversity of involved stakeholders and the population size actively involved, establish the necessary critical mass upon which the large-scale promotion and uptake of project results is pursued. Socio-economics: Based on an assumption that, for every conventional GWh reduction, around 0.17-0.6 jobs are created in the EU, 40,000-150,000 jobs can be created until 2050 only by avoiding the curtailment. MERLON will contribute to tackling the energy poverty problem around EU directly through the pilot sites. Environment: The avoidance of extra conventional generation capacity will lead to significant reduction of CO 2 emissions. MERLON will also support the self- consumption model. Self-consumption can make an important contribution to finance the energy transition. Commercial consumers can reach high rates of renewable energy self-consumption (e.g. 50%-80%). Market Transformation: MERLON solution will be validated in two local energy systems/pilot sites in Austria and France, enabling the extraction of conclusions, policy recommendations and market reform requirements addressing diverse political, market/ business, demographic and cultural contexts. Policy: MERLON adopts and establishes a user-driven innovative environment that accelerates collaborative knowledge, technology customisation, validation against real market and end-user needs as well as end-product definition and go-to-market strategy creation. MERLON brings together all the value-chain stakeholders in an effort to leverage their multi-disciplinary expertise towards setting the basis for the efficient co-creation of market-ready, cutting-edge, innovative solutions.

MUSE Grids aims to demonstrate, in two weakly connected areas (a town on a top of a hill and a rural neighbourhood), a set of both technological and non- technological solutions targeting the interaction of local energy grids (electricity grids, district heating and cooling networks, water networks, gas grids, electromobility etc.). This would enable maximization of local energy independency through optimized management of the production via end user-driven control strategies, smart grid functionality, storage, CHP and RES integration. Scope. MUSE Grids promotes two concepts \u2013 Smart Energy System and Local Energy Community \u2013 not only in physical pilot sites, but also in virtual demo sites in India, Israel and Spain. Social and environmental aspects of the smart multi-energy system transition will be investigated, and citizens in the physical pilot sites will be directly involved. The project involves leading EU companies and energy utilities, and will inspire dedicated policy redaction by also providing insights to the BRIDGE initiative. Technical description and implementation. The two MUSE Grids physical demo sites help in understanding the energy system and defining baseline scenarios for the main challenges faced by EU local energy systems with weak connections to the main grid: \u2022 Belgian demo: the rural district of Oud-Heverlee (part of a municipality with around 10,800 inhabitants, in the province of Flemish Brabant) brings into MUSE Grid a street on a weak grid from transformer to end of line. Voltage swings measured show values of below 200V and up to over 260V. Additionally, a severe imbalance between the phases can be observed, leading to unacceptable deviations, mainly on the third harmonic. These two phenomena cause damage to electronics and have a negative impact on the lifetime of electrical devices; \u2022 Italian demo: the town of Osimo (an old city with around 35,000 inhabitants, in the province of Ancona in the Marche region) has a challenging single line connection to the main electricity grid. Due to the high penetration of renewable energy generation (mostly PV), the municipal microgrid witnesses a huge variance in the netload exchange with national grid throughout the year, swinging from 30MW of peak absorption, when the renewable generation is not sufficient to cover for the local energy demand, down to 20MW of peak injection towards the national grid, when the local generation exceeds the total loads (mainly during summer weekends). These demos are complemented with four virtual demonstration cases, located in Spain, Israel, India, representing a significant variety of urban / rural contexts. Impact. Replicability: MUSE Grids focuses on technology demonstration, as well as on the market viability and the replicability of the MUSE Grids technologies and the targeted subcomponents (products and services). Socio-economics: MUSE Grids empowers citizens to consume energy more responsibly, contributes to energy savings and help grids become more flexible so they can operate more efficiently and qualitatively. Environment: MUSE Grids aims to increase the perception and the importance of interconnecting grids towards a more robust and RES based energy scenario. Market Transformation & Policy: MUSE Grids is committed to making a major contribution to the BRIDGE initiative and in doing so, to ongoing policy developments in areas of internal electricity market design, retail market design and ongoing discussions on self-consumption.

        "bridge 45 BRIDGE BROCHURE 2021 Project Description Context . Energy is mainly generated outside the community where it is consumed. This layout is a consequence of a distribution grid designed and built for centralised production in large power plants: energy is transported to the consumer placed kilometres far from the production site. Such a grid results in both contributing significantly to GHG emissions and in being inherently inefficient and costly in energy transmission and distribution. LECs could allow for energy trading within and among communities, increasing the amount of locally produced energy and the share of renewable energy in the whole picture. While underlying technology solutions for LESs have already been mostly developed, and new business models emerge \u2013 especially where legislative changes enable it \u2013 there is a lack of consumer-centric solutions. Scope. The operational scope of RENAISSANCE is the low- voltage network, mostly at the level of one or several sub- stations level. To compare; a single substation typically has a capacity of up to 10MW, covering buildings (residential, commercial and small-scale industrial), renewable generation and storage, and other assets such as e-vehicles. Socially, such systems serve up to 10,000 people or 10 medium sized business (offices or light industrial). Financially, the consumer end price of energy is \u20ac1 to \u20ac5M per year. For Demand Response and trading purposes, RENAISSANCE will virtually connect several LECs. Technical description and implementation. RENAISSANCE will mature its approach through 3 tiers of demonstrators, which will bring its TRL from 6 to 9. The base is the site of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, where advanced generation, storage and management hardware is installed, and highly detailed data is made open source. RENAISSANCE will be demonstrated in 3 sites with different settings; a publicly controlled urban community (GR), an end-user driven urban community (NL) an and- user driven remote community (ES). Finally, the integrated approach will be presented to sites in India, USA, Poland, UK to be \u00b4localised\u00b4 and tested against market conditions. Impact. Replicability: The RENAISSANCE project aims to activate the high potential of replicability of smart grid solutions provided by the RENAISSANCE consortium. The approach is a breakthrough in reaching widely applicable and replicable pathways for local energy systems, in particular relevant for small to medium sized communities. To maximise the expected impact, RENAISSANCE has set up an approach for in-project demonstration, replication and wide validation for key markets within Europe and at global level. Socio-economics: Consumer activation will be explored in two ways; where possible, the percentage of consumers in a defined catchment area voluntarily switching to RENAISSANCE energy communities, and as secondary indicator, the percentage of consumer in a defined catchment actively using supporting applications. Environment: The EC maintains as 2030 target for RES share in Gross Final Energy Consumption of 27%. While there are ambitions to localising, there are no targets for local RES. As baseline, RENAISSANCE therefore aims to demonstrate the commercial feasibility of achieving the 2030 target of 27% of energy production at local level. By offsetting non-RES with RES, the annual CO2 emissions savings - measured against CO2 loads for national energy mixes \u2013 for the project are 565 tonnes per year. Market Transformation: The RENAISSANCE project could potentially have a major impact on the overall average costs and environmental impact of energy consumption in Europe once replicated at large scale \u2013 across all low voltage energy nodes of Europe. Assumptions; other energy islands have a similar local RES capacity as the demonstrators, and the strategic value of oversized DSO/TSO connections is not taken into account.

        "bridge 51 BRIDGE BROCHURE 2021 Project Description Context . Energy prices on geographical island are typically 100% to 400% higher than on the mainland; therefore the large-scale deployment of local renewable energy sources brings economic benefits and, at the same time, contributes to decarbonise the energy system of the island, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve, or at least not deteriorate, air quality. European islands have to abidec by the law of their countries that push toward a greener energy mixc to comply with the European and international agreements. Scope. GIFT is willing to develop innovative systems to allow islands to integrate vast amount of renewables. In order to reach that goal, the coordinator INEA has built a well-balanced consortium gathering a total of 17 partners of 7 countries, including 1 industrial partner, 9 SMEs, two municipalities, 3 research centres and 2 universities. Through the development of multiple innovative solutions, GIFT increases the penetration rate of renewable energy sources into the islands\u2019 grid, reducing their needs for diesel generation and thus decreasing the greenhouse gases emissions directly related to it. During 4 years, the partners will develop and demonstrate the solutions in two lighthouse islands, in Hinn\u00f8ya, Norway\u2019s largest island and the small island of Procida in Italy and study the replicability of the solution in a Greek and Italian islands at the minimum, respectively Evia and Favignana. The complementarity of these islands in terms of climate, energy mix, population and activities is meant to have solutions adaptable to different situations. Technical description and implementation. In the project, we will demonstrate several technical solutions, each specifically designed to address real life scenarios in the electric grid. The main differentiator of the GIFT project is focus on the integration. We will deliver a comprehensive integrated solution that will fit to several different environments. This approach will significantly improve the exploitation potential of the GIFT solution. We segment our technologies in the following segments: \u2022 Grid observability: short-term prediction algorithms, IoT, GIS, modelling; \u2022 Predictions of energy supply and demand; \u2022 Visualisation of energy supply and demand; \u2022 Enterprise Service Bus: integration with legacy systems, supporting interoperability; \u2022 Virtual power system: addressing the flexibility in a standardised way, through techno-economical optimisation; \u2022 Several types of storage solutions: Ship/Harbour EMS, EVs, Virtual storage in processes, Factory EMS, Smart Energy Hub (multi vector storage), HBr storage system. Impact . Replicability : Our project carries on the work from several different projects under FP7 and H2020, as well as privately funded and national projects. Most of the partners in the consortium are from industry and the technologies they bring on board are part of their strategic development. Furthermore, those partners are active on the market and will exploit the results through their market channels. We construct a special replication board within the project, which is responsible to disseminate our technologies to interested islands. Socio-economics: Our project will enable the electricity users to become active players in optimization of electricity system. Through gains for all players, we also stimulate investments. With reducing the stress on the grid, as well as solving the congestions, we help ensuring stable and reliable supply to end users. Environment : Our technologies are low or zero carbon. Furthermore, the whole GIFT system allows for high level penetration of renewables that would otherwise endanger the normal grid operation. Market Transformation and Policy: We are promoting new business models through our roles and players model, which is based on European harmonized role model.

        "bridge 57 BRIDGE BROCHURE 2021 Project Description Context. The pan-European power system is experiencing a major and profound change as a result of the massive integration of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) and the increasing role of consumers as active participants under various forms (e.g. self-generation, energy efficiency or demand response). The shift of generation is multifold: generation is moved from conventional sources connected to the transmission grid towards the distribution grid thereby becoming more dispersed, less predictable and less dispatchable. All these aspects require an additional change to make both generation and consumption more flexible. This is leading to an evolved role of the end- consumer and the emergence of new actors as market participants (e.g. storage, aggregators, virtual power plant). Scope. CoordiNet aims to demonstrate how DSOs and TSOs, by acting in a coordinated manner, can provide favourable cooperation conditions to all actors while removing barriers to participation for customers and small market players connected to distribution networks. CoordiNet also develops new mechanisms, which are more suitable for real time operations, in order to define requirements for the development of standard European platforms. The proposed CoordiNet mechanisms is tested at three large-scale demonstration projects across 10 different locations spread out Spain, Sweden and Greece. They apply different coordination schemes and test the complete set of products for grid services defined within the project. Technical description and implementation. The CoordiNet project contribute to, among others a smart, secure and more resilient energy system through demonstrating cost-efficient model(s) for electricity network services that can be scaled up to include networks operated by other TSOs and DSOs, that are replicable across the EU energy system, and provide the foundations for new network codes, particularly on demand- response. Impact . Replicability: contribute to a smart, secure and more resilient energy system through demonstrating cost- efficient model(s) for electricity network services. Replicability of the very same standardized products and market platforms tested within the ten demonstration pilots will be assessed and through consultations within the Stakeholders Forum (targeted stakeholders in other geographic areas and though other load, voltage and grid morphology contexts). The result of this analysis will be a set of rules on how to replicate the proposed solutions at the national level but also in other EU countries, considering their specificities and the overall European framework. Socio-economics: Opening up significant new revenue streams for consumers to provide grid services. The industrial partners (utilities, energy service companies, aggregators and RES providers) benefit from clear market rules and platforms allowing transparency and non- discriminatory access to grid services market. Environment: Increase the share of RES in the electricity system. CoordiNet contributes to the overall GHG emissions reduction of the pan-European power system through increased market integration of RES. Market Transformation: As an innovation action CoordiNet capitalizes some R&I results in terms of lessons learned from previous projects and demonstrations. New knowledge will consist in new market design schemes, new operation protocols and new use of data resulting from operations to draw recommendations and improvement of standards. The project explores new types of interaction between project partners (System Operators - IT industry \u2013 academic - market participants). Several tasks also investigates brand new routes. Potential game changer technologies to facilitate consumer participation and reduce transaction costs. New market mechanisms for local services to solve constraints at DSOs networks constitute real test cases for extending current market designs as well as opening the existing markets (at TSO level) to new participants: demand-side resources, energy storage and small agents (tested in the Spanish demonstration). Policy: CoordiNet provides recommendations on market designs and regulations that are the object of consultation by targeted stakeholders. The outputs of the project will support the Clean Energy for all Europeans Package in general, but both the Market Design Directive and the Market Design Regulation will be object of specific recommendations.

        "bridge 59 BRIDGE BROCHURE 2021 Project Description Context . With an increasingly RES-dominated future grid, both TSOs and DSOs are expected to face similar problems and challenges in grid operation and the collaboration between these operators is crucial. Digitalisation is a key driver for coordination and active system management in the electricity grid, enabling TSOs and DSOs to optimise the use of distributed resources to ensure a cost-effective and secure supply of electricity for all customers. The measures encourage procurement of services at both the transmission and distribution level, recognizing that this will enable more efficient and effective network management, will increase the level of demand response and will increase the capacity of renewable generation that is connected to the European electricity network. TSOs and DSOs must now define the services they want to procure in collaboration with market participants and must set up ways to procure them in a coordinated manner. Scope. The INTERRFACE project demonstrates the added value of sharing data among all participants in the electricity system value chain (customers, grids, market), from local, regional to EU level. Also, it enables TSOs, DSOs and customers to coordinate their efforts to maximise the potential of distributed energy resources (DERs), demand aggregators and grid assets, to procure energy services in a cost-efficient way and create consumer benefits. It therefore facilitates renewable energy integration and demonstrates global leadership by the EU electricity sector in a way that is cost effective and secure. It also simulates an integrated wholesale and retail market at local and global levels, engaging consumers/prosumers to exploit the DERs capacity and channel it into the common EU electricity market. INTERRFACE demonstrates services for congestion management and local flexibility in the network, supporting the integration of new and existing distributed generation projects. Technical description and implementation. A range of state-of-the-art ICT technologies and control improvements will be exploited to enhance the interconnection among system operators and customers. Digital tools based on blockchains and big data management will provide new opportunities for electricity market. The INTERRFACE project designs, develops and exploits an Interoperable pan-European Grid Services Architecture (IEGSA) to act as the interface between the power system (TSO and DSO) and the customers and allow the seamless and coordinated operation of all stakeholders to use and procure common services. INTERRFACE incorporates a design phase, providing the design of new services, market and INTERRFACE system architecture design, based on customers, grid, and market participants\u2019 perspective, as well as a demonstration phase, including the elaboration of well-designed demonstrations, in three discrete pillars: (a) Congestion management and balancing issues, (b) Peer to peer transactions, and (c) Integrated retail and wholesale market. The project provides an architecture that can integrate the main tools and data for TSOs, DSOs, consumers, power exchanges and market participants, and enables communication between different data hubs and market participants, facilitating market integration. Impact . Replicability/Scalability : Solutions are replicable across the EU energy system and architecture is interoperable \u2013based on a plug\u2019 n\u2019 play concept that enables inclusion of new actors and platforms- across borders and is suitable for deployment in energy systems throughout Europe. It decreases the cost to deliver renewable energy projects and flexibility services. Socio-economics: INTERRFACE assists national markets in acquiring a pan-European monitoring framework that ensures integrity and transparency at the European level. The project ensures that the EU electricity network operates within a wholesale market, providing consumers with competitive prices and integrating renewable sources, upgrading at the same time consumers\u2019 position within the value chain and constituting them active market participants. Environment : The project facilitates the increased integration of renewables into the European electricity mix. This increase in RES would lead toward the reduction of CO2 and other greenhouse gases emissions. It would also reinforce the preservation of natural resources. This increase in RES will lead toward the reduction of CO 2 and other greenhouse gases emissions. Market Transformation: The coupling of the retail and wholesale markets also creates revenue visibility that does not exist in today\u2019s electricity market. This drives price signals, creating much stronger commercial incentives for flexibility service providers to participate in the market. Policy : INTERRFACE provides policy recommendations to TSOs, DSOs, Market Operators and other actors of the energy value chain. ",

        "bridge 61 BRIDGE BROCHURE 2021 Project Description Context . Power and Utilities sector undergoes a series of digital transformations in the latest period. The electricity sector is at the centre of this transformation as it breaks the boundaries between generation and consumption. The benefits of the digitalization are major and include performance improvements and cost savings, but makes energy systems more vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Moreover, the use of digital devices and interconnected systems exposes Electrical Power and Energy Systems (EPES) to external threats such as worms, viruses, hackers and data privacy breaches.. Scope. EnergyShield will test different attack scenarios in a live cyber-defence exercise: a small-scale attacks targeting specific organizations and a large-scale disruption attacks targeting the entire EPES value chain. Project Objectives . The project addresses the implementation gap between research projects and industrial applications. The Consortium focuses on applied interdisciplinary research, industry-driven requirements, knowledge and technology transfer. Technical description and implementation . Although the selected technologies are currently available, their combination within this project will go beyond the state of the art as the technologies represent already leading-edge developments in their fields and will be combined for the first time in the EPES domain. Generators (cogeneration thermal power plant, small hydro power plan) DSOs, TSOs, aggregators and prosumers are recognized as EPES value chain. Impact . The project will combine best-of-breed cybersecurity tools into a holistic solution able to address all the requirements of EPES operators, and specifically vulnerability assessment (automated threat modelling and security behaviour analysis), monitoring & protection (anomaly detection and DDoS mitigation) and learning & sharing (security information and event management), resulting in the following impacts Replicability: EnergyShield architecture relies on an open, modular architecture (toolkit concept). Keeping the module operation separate enables applications to run independently and to potentially be swapped out / replaced by other modules to accommodate future evolution of the platform). This methodology ensures interoperability and future-proof. Socio-economics: EnergyShield proposes a complete socio-cyber-physical threat model based on cyber security risks evaluation and risk cost modeling to decrease the impact of cyber-attacks on EPES value chain. Environment: The proposed solution also aims at increasing awareness on the necessity to clearly define and address the particularities of cybersecurity in energy sector. Market Transformation: The toolkit can be used as a development environment for third party application developers joining the EnergyShield ecosystem. Policy: Improving the European cyberdefence capabilities by sharing early results through participation in relevant associations and working groups and via promoting standardization initiatives related to cybersecurity in energy sector.

        "bridge 67 BRIDGE BROCHURE 2021 Project Description Context . In 2018, the EC presented the long-term strategy to achieve a low carbon neutral economy by 2050. It was focused on a fully-integrated internal energy market aiming at: (i) allowing EU free energy flows without technical and legal barriers, (ii) promoting renewable energy sources (RES) and other efficient technologies, (iii) proposing new EU Directives to transform the energy market and (iv) empowering energy consumers. This context requires increasing the number of electric substations with monitoring and control devices as well as developing cost-effective storage system and smart solutions to engage consumers in energy issues and promoting new market models. Scope. ebalance-plus develops an ICT Energy Management Platform (EMP) to integrate and demonstrate a variety of solutions in 4 different energy market frameworks (Spain, Italy, France and Denmark) with specific technical challenges. The goal is to unlock the energy flexibility and provide ancillary services that improve the grid resilience and open new market options regarding energy aggregators, communities and cooperatives. The EMP is based on a hierarchical architecture of Management Units (MU), where each level is related to the electricity domains of the standard Smart Grid Architecture Model (SGAM): customer, DER, distribution and transmission. Every MU integrates a set of balancing algorithms and prediction models to coordinate the MU located at the immediate lower level in the hierarchical structure. The EMP guarantees interoperability: it allows deploying new flexibility solutions (storage, IoT, V2G, district RES, power-to- heat\u2026) based on a common data exchange format and integrating it into existing Building Automation Systems (BACS) to operate technical facilities and appliances according to the grid and market conditions. Furthermore, the solution is designed following user centric approaches, including social studies in the design of appealing and engaging end user interfaces (mobile app). Technical description and implementation. The MU is developed and integrated at building and grid level. The Customer Management Unit at building level (CMU) will control the smart appliances, IoT devices and technical facilities through BACS. At grid level, three MU will be developed for: the Distributed Energy Resources (DERMU), secondary (LVGMU) and primary (MVGMU) substations. The grid management units increase the system observability and improve its control capabilities. Besides, ebalance-plus develops and test a variety of technologies in different demo sites: (1) smart-batteries (Li-ion) for large buildings; (2) high-efficient power inverters based on silicon carbide (SiC) transistors that enable DC networks; (3) vehicle-to- grid (V2G) charging points for DC networks and PV generation; (4) IoT devices to integrate smart-appliances and technical facilities; and (5) user-friendly mobile app to engage end-customers in demand response services. Impact . Replicability: ebalance-plus solution is based on the concept of MU\u2019s which are scalable and replicable in a hierarchical architecture. Scalability and replicability are at the core of this project concept. Besides, the variety of energy solutions tested different market contexts will boost the replicability chances. Socio-economics: ebalance-plus will empower customers with further information about their energy costs and friendly end-user interfaces. It will also increase the new markets flexibility potential transparency. As a result, the potential end-user acceptance is high. Environment: ebalance-plus allows integrating RES and power-to-heat facilities in the electric grid and facilitates its control for an optimal grid operation which reduces power peaks and power losses and thus, carbon emissions. Market Transformation: ebalance-plus quantify and manage the available and foreseen energy flexibility of buildings and other grid facilities, enabling ancillary services that can impact most of electricity stakeholders (energy suppliers, aggregators, DSO, among others). Policy: The demonstration in 4 real sites and countries with different regulations, market frameworks and customer behaviours will support the development of new policies and provide tools to motivate the role of new energy aggregators, communities and cooperatives.

The demand for electricity in Europe\u2019s internal market triggered a radical change project, starting with the shift to the single internal market, then followed by the energy transition towards 2030 Climate-Energy objectives and the negotiation of the Clean Energy Package. Europe has seen paradigm shifts on the decentralization of generation with renewable and variable electricity demand, as well as electrification of thermal and transport sectors. The result is a shift to an energy system with high levels of fluctuation in supply and much greater demand elasticity. Scope. The overall objectives of FlexiGrid are: \u2022 To develop an integrated architecture for flexibility measures and electricity grid services provided by storage of electricity, vehicle charging, power to-heat, demand response and variable generation to enable additional decarbonisation; \u2022 To define, test, deploy and demonstrate markets and market mechanisms that incentivise flexibility, in particular for mitigating short-term and long-term congestions or other problems in the distribution network such as voltage issues; \u2022 To drive cooperation between distribution system operators, TSOs, consumers and generators by defining market interactions, facilitating the integration of wholesale and retail markets and cross sector interactions; \u2022 To deploy smart grid technologies to enable the architecture and markets, bringing actors together to participate as distributed energy sources, driving increased resilience of the electricity grid, increased system security, greater observability, higher automation and improved control of the grid; \u2022 To enable future technical and commercial innovation by identifying barriers to innovation, developing pathways to regulatory and policy reform, developing business models, and through strategic collaboration. Technical description and implementation. Through intelligent clustering, near real-time transition between energy and grid services markets and various storage systems, FlexiGrid maximizes the utilization of existing assets and circumvent the need of extensive investment for network reinforcement. On the one hand, this increases the renewable hosting capacity of distribution networks, while on the other hand it promotes increasing self- consumption at the end-user levels. Integrated solutions for managing flexibility are delivered including different energy storage systems (stationary batteries, as well as EV batteries, vehicle-to-grid), power-to-heat, power-to-gas and demand response schemes. Impact. Replicability: Demonstration sites prove that cutting-edge technology such as improved grid monitoring, Energy IoT platforms, peer-to-peer trading, and blockchain can be deployed to manage future loads such as electric vehicles and electric heating. Demonstration sites in Switzerland, Turkey, Bulgaria and Sweden prove peak demand and congestion management in the distribution network by optimizing both supply and demand schedules. The leading-edge nature of the demonstration projects reinforces Europe as a global leader in renewables and provide new export opportunities for knowledge and technology. Socio-economics: Distribution grid and local markets flexibility lower the overall investment cost for infrastructure by leveraging smart resources with possible support services towards stakeholders. This creates viable business models to have sustainability impacts on the social economy. Better exploitation of local resources and increased self-consumption further improve the overall economics off DSOs and customers. In the long run, FlexiGrid contributes to the development of sustainable buildings and in a larger scale, sustainable cities. Environment: FlexiGrid contributes to improve environmental and sustainability issues in the following ways: \u2022 Enhanced RES penetration, resulting in smaller environmental footprint; \u2022 Decreased RES curtailment due to grid\u2019s flexibility and real-time clustering ability; \u2022 Improved exploitation of local resources, resulting in decreased energy loss and less emissions. Market Transformation: The development of bankable business models (realized in WP2) decreases risks and cost of capital and supports deployment pace, as they are attractive for lenders, associated with relatively low risk and easy to replicate. Policy: The major policy and regulatory impacts Flexigrid contributes are: \u2022 Policy which enables the DSO to manage the markets for services from the demand-side to support grid operation; \u2022 Regulation regarding the ability of the DSO to alter grid structure depending on the existing condition and markets signals.

        "bridge 97 BRIDGE BROCHURE 2021 Project Description Context . The rising decentralization of the energy system is unveiling an enormous opportunity for energy stakeholders to leverage on big data & AI technologies to improve decision making. Moreover the Energy system progressive decarbonisation and decentralization and the EC Green New Deal policy towards an integrated energy system are pushing for cross-stakeholder multiple value chain use cases, data-driven applications, platforms, architectures and services, facilitated by Open Energy \u2013 centered Cross-sector Digital Platforms. There are however some barriers hampering the exploitation of this potential, such as the lack of standardized big data architectures for smart grids and regulatory frameworks not facilitating data sharing. Scope. The overall BD4NRG service analytics reference framework and the underlying technology enablers will be deployed and validated in 12 large-scale demo-sites across 9 countries. Rationale of pilot applications is to address in a combined way two of the major challenges actually hindering big data analytics value capturing in smart energy grids, i.e. i) nurturing the shifting towards Predictive/prescriptive analytics and ii) enabling multiple data source (cross \u2013 functional and/or cross-contexts and/or cross-domain) analytics for multiple applications Technical description and implementation. BD4NRG will i) deliver a reference architecture for Smart Energy, which aligns BDVA SRIA, IDSA and FIWARE architectures, SAREF standard to enable B2B multi-party data exchange, while providing full interoperability of leading-edge big data technologies with smart grid standards and operational frameworks ii) evolve and upscale a number of technology enablers, such as scalable sovereignty-preserving hybrid DLT/off-chain data governance, big data elastic pipeline orchestration, IoT/edge AI-based federated learning and multi- resource sharing tokenized marketplace, loosely integrate and deploy them within the BD4NRG framework iii) deliver a TRL8 open modular big data analytic toolbox as front-end for one- stop-shop analytics services development by orchestrating legacy and/or third party assets (data, computing resources, models, algorithms) iv) validate such framework through the delivery of predictive and prescriptive edge AI-based big data analytics on 12 large scale pilots, deployed by different energy stakeholders (TSOs and DSOs power network operators, aggregators, storage/renewable assets operators, local energy communities, ESCOs, power market operators, municipalities, financial institutions and ENTSO-E), fully covering the energy value chain v) setup a vibrant data-driven ecosystem, which will federate new energy data providers, attract SMEs for novel energy services provisioning through cascading funding and validate a hybrid energy/industry value chain supporting B2B joint digital platforms Impact . Replicability: the large geographical coverage of the pilot sites aims to support the large-scale EU-wide replicability and market take-up of services and solutions in different socio- economical contexts to maximize the impact of BD4NRG services across Europe. Socio-economics: the data-driven BD4NRG analytics toolbox and services will enable the significant changes which are expected in the energy industry thanks to the adoption of new disruptive processes aimed at integrating different energy resources at local level. ICT technologies allow the usage of new market logic able to propose innovative customer-centric more decentralized business models exploiting the potential of digitalization. Tokenized DLT/Blokchains/smart contract marketplaces on the other hand will facilitate local-community level trade and exchange of heterogeneous assets, including energy surplus, social services, share of computing resources, hence contributing to the improved social welfare of local communities. Environment: The solutions proposed in BD4NRG will clearly bring a significant positive benefit on the environmental footprint of the grid operation and on the decarbonisation of the overall energy systems. As matter of fact, using flexible demand optimized mobilization, via BD4NRG optimized small scale DER flexibility assets management, and leveraging on enhanced integration of asset management and grid operation, BD4NRG will contribute to reduce peak loads, improve the efficiency of the utilization of the electricity network, postpone any unnecessary investment in grid capacity reinforcement and minimize the necessity to turn on the emergency peaking plants (which are much less efficient than the baseload power plants that normally power the grid). In addition to this, BD4NRG will increase the local consumption of locally generated electricity, which heavily contributes to reduce network losses reduction, due to the reduced need of long-distance electricity transportation. Hence the environmental footprint of the grid operation during peak load times will be greatly reduced. Market Transformation : Thanks to the deployment of near real time data driven analytics services , BD4NRG will slightly contribute to open up and redesign the energy value chain and the way through which energy and beyond-energy stakeholders will interact one each other, contributing to more liquid and competitive energy marketplaces, and to lowering transaction costs and energy price for the consumers The latter ones, on the other way around, will be brought center stage as new relevant actors of the energy value chain, whose profile and preferences will be taken into due consideration to achieve a fair, effective, consumer-entered energy system Policy: The vision pursued and the big data-driven analytics technologies deployed by BD4NRG will slightly contribute to further nurture some of the most relevant EC policies, ranging from EC Data Strategy, to the Green New Deal, and the Energy Digitization Plan , while at the same time offering increased accessibility of energy-centered local community social services hence contributing to energy poverty mitigation.

        "bridge 101 BRIDGE BROCHURE 2021 Project Description Context . The increasing electrification of heat and transport coupled with larger RESs deployment of decentralized RESs is disclosing new additional opportunities for demand response. However, DR potential has been exploited so far to a very limited extent at end consumer residential level, due to technologies immaturity, regulatory fuzziness, distorted business framework preventing end consumers to capture an appropriate value. To cope with the above challenges, BRIGHT will leverage on a participatory co-creation process to bring individual consumers center stage to deliver a multi-layered community-centred cross-domain adaptable multi-timescale DR supporting framework. This framework will combine social-science-driven user experience design -for user behavior motivations and monetary/non-monetary incentive design-, Digital Twins models -for improved consumer predictability-, multi- layered P2P DLT/blockchain/ smart contracts based semi- decentralized VPPs -for capturing intra-community interaction dynamics, value stacking flexibility management algorithms and other AI data-driven energy and-non energy services at the interplay among energy (power, heat, gas), mobility, health (comfort), smart home (AAL, personal safety). Scope. The proposed approach and the underlying enablers will be deployed and validated in 4 demo-sites across 4 EU countries in Blegium, Italy, Slovenia and Greece, where around 1000 mostly residential consumers will be engaged along a variety of different community configurations (LEC, CEC, Virtual Energy Communities, Communities on the Move) Technical description and implementation. BRIGHT will develop and deploy an ensemble of leading- edge digital technologies, by leveraging on IoT, AI-based big data, DLT/Blockchain, to support new community- enabled ways for engaging consumers in DR. In doing so, BRIGHT will provide the means to enact energy cooperatives, Local Energy Communities and peer-to-peer sharing/trading mechanisms, whose effectiveness will be validated along the proposed field pilots. BRIGHT will combine leading technology enablers from relevant H2020 projects to develop social and technological tools for hybridizing DR and other energy and non-energy services, which builds on around 2000 end consumers out of which 670 directly involved in pilots and recruited through awareness workshops. BRIGHT will upscale and validate Digital Twins models for electricity residential and non- residential (tertiary, commercial, industrial, self- consumption of locally generated renewable energy) individual and community consumers which couple data- driven AI-based ML models for end user community with flexibility assets data-driven models along a different dimension to increase consumption predictability. Impact . Replicability: the co-creation approach will explicitly design user experience, identify end user behavioral change motivations and will put end user in a community and social context, with a view to identify the most important social dimensions, hence designing end user incentive as well as the magnitude of such incentive. In doing so, BRIGHT will identify replicable patterns for incentive design, where the context (location, climate, sex, gender, and other levers) under which a given incentive could be working in other similar situation, hence guaranteeing a larger replication of the best practices as well. Socio-economics: the local aggregation mechanisms and tools will allow to mitigate energy poverty of some members at community level by leveraging on a voluntary energy demand shift or reduction by other members, which gain \u201cimmaterial\u201d benefits, aka token, which could be used to offset energy bills and other energy services cost, through tokenized cross-domain neutral sharing marketplace. This decentralized mechanism will allow to link effect of increased DR mobilization with increased accessibility of energy services for people exposed to energy poverty. Environment: the ensemble of data-driven AI-based energy services will include energy efficiency and flexibilization optimized mobilization Market Transformation : data-driven mechanisms will provide commercial operators with more reliable estimation of electricity consumption. Appropriate models for home or residential buildings will enable aggregators to develop effective services for the valorization exploitation of the available flexibility. Policy: the privacy-preserving self-enforcing smart contracts in order to manage appropriately the risk for insufficient data protection and consumer privacy infringement due to data breach and incidents.

This is especially true in a world that is becoming increasingly connected, and where energy consumers demand innovative technologies. It is within this energy ecosystem that HESTIA project is developing a cost-effective solution for the next-generation demand-side response services. The key will be to encourage residential consumers to engage in flexibility sharing and grid balancing. According to HESTIA, user- personalised services will help lay the foundation for an open marketplace and new grid reality. Scope. HESTIA aims to provide a cost-effective solution for the next-generation DR services which will leverage the consumer engagement, energy and non-energy services, while dealing with both energy supply and demand side in a holistic manner. HESTIA intends to engage with residential consumers, while enabling them to play an active role in flexibility sharing and grid balancing. HESTIA will be demonstrated in 3 different residential pilot setups, in Italy, Netherlands and France, with different infrastructural, climatic, market and regulatory contexts, enabling different business models and levels of provided energy services, across different social categories of consumers. Technical description and implementation. HESTIA will enable residential DR services through: \u2022 exploitation of energy demand flexibility by engaging the consumers in demand-side management activities, \u2022 valorisation of energy efficiency in multi-carrier energy dispatching and optimal operation of building systems. HESTIA will exploit the consumer engagement as part of cooperative DR strategy at the community level. HESTIA will involve the residents in the designing of the solution through participatory co-design processes. In addition, HESTIA will exploit the aggregated energy resource flexibility at the demand-side, in terms of cumulative energy consumption, distributed energy generation and storage, to better manage the disparity between energy demand, RES availability and grid requirements. User- personalized services will be delivered via a fully service- oriented, flexible ICT platform, underpinned by agent-based concepts, consumer digital twin and non-intrusive data analytics. This way, HESTIA will set the foundation for an open marketplace and a new grid reality, while steering consumer engagement according to the grid requirements and promoting RES and sustainable behaviour. Impact . Replicability: This will be achieved by leveraging the agent-based concepts. The underlying optimisation approach is also suitable for multi-user scenarios enabling the identification of optimal interaction between the users . These concepts will contribute directly to high scalability and replicability potential, while creating the opportunities for fast up-take of services within the residential sector. Moreover, this will be facilitated owing to the truly non-invasive solution provided by HESTIA. Socio-economics: HESTIA is aiming to transform residential customers from static consumer into active participants in the energy sector. The vision is to establish an open flexibility marketplace where community residents can trade and share their energy and flexibility. Environment: HESTIA will be dedicated to reduction of GHG and air pollutants emission while delivering the proposed energy services for residential communities. Leveraging the multi- objective optimisation approach as one of its core services, HESTIA will embed the emission reduction as one of its objectives under the optimisation. Market Transformation: Under the cooperative DR strategy, HESTIA will enable sharing of produced energy and demand flexibility among the residents . This will be achieved by establishing the open flexibility marketplace, deployed on top of the distributed ledger LES platform which will enable automated DR settlements and interaction of prosumers. Policy: HESTIA will analyse, also within the BRIDGE initiative, the current regulatory frameworks to lift any barriers lifted to steer the necessary evolutions or to avoid potential hurdles at national level. Social : HESTIA will create 20-50 skilled jobs during the project, increase social benefits related to energy cost reduction, and improve health by integrating assisted living services. ",

        "bridge 105 BRIDGE BROCHURE 2021 Project Description Context. The consumption and production in energy systems must be in balance at all times. In the European energy system, this balance is mainly managed by controlling power generation so that it matches the power demand. However, this status quo is gradually changing due to the increase of renewable energy sources (RES) deployed across the European energy system. The generation of RES such as photovoltaics (PV) and wind turbines is typically highly variable and difficult to forecast. Additionally, RES generation cannot be controlled in the same way as traditional power plants, which means that the demand-side becomes increasingly important for balancing the European energy system. Scope. Consumers have a key role as they control a large share of flexible resources that can be used for balancing the European energy system with Demand Response (DR) programs and various aggregation methods. Recent advances and increasing popularity of automation and Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) have opened new possibilities for empowering consumers with innovative flexibility management services. Advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies such as deep learning (DL) in turn enable development of autonomous systems that adapt to consumers by learning their behaviour and dynamics of energy systems. Together these advances make it possible to develop intelligent assistants for consumer flexibility management that optimize the comfort, energy costs and environmental footprint on consumers behalf and according to their wishes, while at the same time offering the flexibility for power grid management purposes. The development and validation of such intelligent assistants for flexibility management, referred to as iFLEX Assistants, is the main goal of the iFLEX project. Technical description and implementation. An innovative concept of software agent that facilitates consumer participation in demand response will be designed, implemented and packaged as a general- purpose software framework. The iFLEX Framework is a collection of libraries, tools and configuration scripts that provide the means for developing application-specific iFLEX Assistants that learn consumer behaviour and the dynamics of relevant energy systems in order to optimize and personalize flexibility management. iFLEX in a nutshell aims to: \u2022 Enable consumers/prosumers to become key market actors by providing solutions for automating and personalizing demand response and holistic energy management. \u2022 Enable secure, private and interoperable data exchange for demand response, following the principles of privacy and security by design and by default. \u2022 Design sustainable business models for energy utilities, aggregators, technology providers and facility managers that enable consumers/prosumers to become key market players in the European energy system. \u2022 Validate the iFLEX Assistant, associated innovations, and incentive models through active end-user engagement in multi-site demonstrators. \u2022 Promote and facilitate the adoption of the iFLEX Assistants as the next-generation user-centric flexibility management solution within and beyond the EU. Impact. The project develops iFLEX Assistants that will be core components in empowering end-users in a variety of DR and holistic energy management services demonstrated in operational environment (TRL7) via pilots in Finland, Greece and Slovenia.

        "bridge 107 BRIDGE BROCHURE 2021 Project Description Context The European Union (EU) is aiming at transforming the energy systems towards a sustainable, low-carbon, and climate-friendly economy, putting consumers at its centre. Buildings play a key role in this transition as they are responsible for approximately 40% of energy consumption and 36% of CO 2 emissions in the EU and, on the other hand, for the potential engagement of consumers through demand response (DR) mechanisms. To enable this transformation, distribution grids will face new paradigms in the ways they operate, relying more on flexible smart grids with the capacity to safely host more renewable energy sources (RES) and integrate new loads, such as the power to heat/cold, the power to gas/liquid and new technologies, as well as electric vehicles (EVs) while advancing in the security of supply and affordability. This global picture asks for the generation of a new concept of a connected ecosystem between energy system players and consumers. Scope. The ReDREAM project consortium is developing a user-centric ecosystem, which not only will enable the effective participation of the consumers/prosumers in the energy market but also drive a profound change turning traditional company's value chain into a value generation chain, based on the revolutionary Service-Dominant Logic paradigm. As a result, ReDREAM will gain the following competitive advantages, compared to its competing solutions: \u2022 New user-centric ecosystem \u2022 Consumer-engagement through a holistic methodology \u2022 Open co-creation approach \u2022 Open services and virtualization capabilities. This avant-garde solution will be exhaustively tested in 4 large-scale pilots: located in Castilla y Le\u00f3n (Spain), Lazio (Italy), Vara\u017edin (Croatia), and Bath & North East Somerset (UK) and involving 3 climate areas, 744 users and 3.7 GWh/year . Technical description and implementation. ReDREAM's approach will change the current paradigm by maximizing the UX to effectively reach all types of consumers. To achieve this, a new ecosystem will be deployed using previous developments of Stemy Energy and RIMOND. The ecosystem will rely on 5 structural layers: \u2022 Consumer engagement strategy \u2022 Open co-creation \u2022 Energy \u2018social network\u2019 \u2022 Virtualisation and Digital Twins \u2022 Open service pool with the catalogue of tools and services for the consumer. ReDREAM`s approach entails different actors, highly heterogeneous data sources, dimensions, backgrounds, goals and multifunctional effects for the underpinning energy system encouraging a new role for the consumers. The viability and universality of the concept will be demonstrated in several distinct environments, comprised of different types of consumers, climate areas and energy loads. All demo sites cover the overarching goal of putting the consumer at the centre of the energy system through the validation of the full version ReDREAM ecosystem. Impact . Replicability: The consumer engagement strategies, ecosystem, and tools and services will be tested and realised to ensure the potential and replicability of the solution across Europe. After the end of the project, the solution will be replicated in two ways: \u2022 by engaging the remaining members of the demo cooperatives, and involving cooperative\u2019s networks such as RESCoop, which will gather alone over a million users \u2022 by engaging new users following the exploitation strategy and the envisioned business plan prioritizing the countries involved in the project and according to the status of each country in terms of legislation. It has been estimated that in 5 years after the project, ReDREAM could sell 11,211 licenses for householders , 4,086 for the tertiary sector and 1,449 for industries . Socioeconomics: The ReDREAM ecosystem will provide different tools capable of combining functionalities in terms of energy efficiency, demand response and other services which impact the daily life of the consumer, ranging from energy to non-energy services, related to: \u2022 Mobility \u2022 Health \u2022 Comfort It is expected that the combination of the two types of services (energy and non-energy) has a take-up rate of 80%. Furthermore, ongoing collaboration with local actors will study how to determine and deal with energy poverty . ",

        "bridge 109 BRIDGE BROCHURE 2021 Project Description Context . As the EU moves towards sustainable energy, co-creation processes are the future for the design of energy service markets. This entails a shift in the balance of power, turning customers into a new generation of collaborators and putting them at the heart of the energy sector. The EU-funded SENDER project will develop energy service applications for proactive demand response (DR), home automation, convenience, and security mechanisms. By engaging customers in a co-creation process, the project will shift DR from a reactive to a proactive approach. Consumer data will be collected and processed to identify typical consumption patterns, mirror them by digital twins (DTs) based on artificial intelligence technologies and aggregate the DTs' supply/demand characteristics. Scope. The SENDER project is focused on: \u2022 Developing innovative DR and smart home solutions by placing consumers at the centre of the project using a co-creation approach. \u2022 Integrating more renewables into the electricity system by applying innovative DR tools. \u2022 Using consumer data to improve behaviour predictions to create consumer DTs and DR tools. \u2022 Establishing interoperability of system components by testing them in a virtual lab prior to implementing DT and DR tools at three pilot sites targeting mainly households. \u2022 Developing sustainable business models and a roadmap for the deployment of the solution after the project lifecycle using a replicability study approach. Technical description and implementation. The developments being performed cover two specific areas: \u2022 ICT innovations based on artificial intelligence and machine learning as well as peer-to-peer trading options will lead to an active involvement of new actors, notably household consumers, in local energy markets. \u2022 Business-related innovations will strengthen the consumer role and foster their improved cooperation with DSOs/aggregators in a co-creation process to design, develop and implement a new local energy market. Impact . Replicability: SENDER applies the project solutions at three demonstration sites with highly diverse characteristics. This strongly increases the replicability potential of the solution all over Europe. Socio-economics: SENDER puts consumers at the centre of the electricity market by applying consumer engagement strategies. A dedicated co-creation steering group with consumer integration has the potential to increase the number and types of consumers engaged in DR across Europe. Environment: The customizable, user-specific home automation bundle product developed by SENDER combines DR with energy efficiency applications. The close cooperation with DSOs during the project lifecycle allows for the provision of flexibility to the grid and increases the hosting capacity for RES. Market Transformation: SENDER strengthens the market role of consumers based on their higher market integration; so far segmented DR and smart home automation applications are bundled into one integrated product. Policy: SENDER actively supports smart grid standardization activities and provides recommendations to national and EU regulatory and political decision bodies ",

        "bridge 111 BRIDGE BROCHURE 2021 Project Description Context. The main idea behind the conception of the TwinERGY project lies on the interest of the project partners to exploit the new business opportunities that project implementation delivers and increase the relevance of the Demand Response optimization tools and strategies in the new generation of energy management systems. By coupling mature practice for citizen engagement with service innovation through the lenses of public value, TwinERGY will ensure that a wide range of interests and especially of consumers/ prosumers will be represented and supported in the energy marketplace. Scope. TwinERGY will develop, configure and integrate an innovative suite of tools, services and applications for consumers, enabling increase of awareness and knowledge about consumption patterns, energy behaviours, generation/ demand forecasts and increase of local intelligence via properly established Digital Twin- based Consumer-Centric Energy Management and Control Decision Support mechanisms that locally optimize demand response. Key use cases will be trialed across 4 pilot regions making use of cutting-edge methods and tools. Special focus will be given on standardization and policy & market reform as key enablers for the successful commercialization of the TwinERGY results. Technical description and implementation. The TwinERGY interoperable infrastructure (ecosystem) will constitute the backbone for all demonstrators\u2019 support and will assure the replicability and scalability potential of the proposed solution. TwinERGY comprises of: \u2022 A Components and Communication layer, which provides the means to collect data being generated by the employed sources of TwinERGY architecture \u2022 An Information layer, at the heart of which lies the Core Data Management Platform (CDMP). This layer brings into the TwinERGY platform the content of the multiple data sources \u2022 A Function layer, that will act as a virtual working space for the different tools and applications of the architecture, to consume datasets through the CDMP and run according to the functions envisioned in the different use cases and the offered services \u2022 A Business layer, that will allow for the first time the creation of a decentralized mass market structure on a large scale to actually compensate prosumers for participating in energy markets in a local level, which also will solve grid problems and create sustainable outcomes for the benefit of consumers and the society at large \u2022 A vertical Cyber-Security/ Data Privacy layer, that assures end-to-end secure data exchange and manipulation Impact . Replicability: TwinERGY\u2019s primary targets are residential and tertiary consumers/ buildings around the EU (including office buildings, university campus and retail stores) that represent over 99.9% of the European building stock. Hence, TwinERGY open, modular and plug and play solution, presents not only a high replicability potential but also a huge business opportunity if appropriate engagement strategies are applied. Socio-economics: Nearly 11% of the EU\u2019s population is in a situation where they are not able to adequately heat their homes at an affordable cost. TwinERGY will contribute to effectively tackling this situation, both directly during the project (in demo countries), but also indirectly through the definition of a targeted exploitation strategy, considering energy poverty-affected countries as a primary target. Environment: Energy consumption in households constitutes a considerable amount of the total energy in use. Changing energy consumption behavior within the household has a great potential to preserve environmental resources, especially if executed collectively. Market Transformation: In TwinERGY Consumers will be encouraged and empowered to form tribes with one another, exchange views or co-create with firms thus, transforming symbolic systems in the energy market. These new \u201clogics\u201d will change the role of individuals within energy systems \u2018from the rather passive and individualistic notion of an \u2018energy consumer\u2019, towards a more participative and communitarian notion of an \u2018\u2018energy citizen. Policy: TwinERGY aims at significantly contributing to the short-, mid- and long-term EU energy policy targets and facilitate the realization of multiple benefits mainly focusing on: i) the significant reduction of Green House Gas emissions, ii) the decrease of electricity prices, iii) better electricity market integration, iv) enhanced security of supply and independence from energy imports and v) more democratized energy markets.

This goal will be achieved, by having in mind all the potential benefits achievable for the different actors involved and by promoting the Energy Hub concept, as a conceptual model for controlling and managing multi- carrier and integrated energy systems in order to optimize their architecture and operation. In order to ensure both the short-term and the long-term sustainability of this new energy paradigm and thus support an effective implementation and deployment, economic and environmental aspects will be taken into account in the optimization tools through a multi-objective approach. Scope. eNeuron\u2019s proposed tools enable tangible sustainability and energy security benefits for all the stakeholders in the LEC. Local prosumers (households, commercial and industrial actors) stand to benefit through the reduction of energy costs while leveraging local, low carbon energy. Developers and solution providers will find new opportunities for technologies as part of an integrated, replicable operational business model. Distribution system operators (DSOs) benefit from avoiding grid congestion and deferring network investments. Policy makers benefit from increasingly sustainable and secure energy supply systems. eNeuron is a high TRL project and proposes innovative approaches and methodologies to optimally plan and operate integrated LECs through the optimal selection and use of multiple energy carriers and by considering both short- and long-run priorities. Technical description and implementation. eNeuron will develop a cloud-based tool with a web-based user interface for the long-term design optimisation of multi- carrier local integrated energy systems, aiming at identifying the optimal architecture of such systems, in terms of optimised configuration alternatives through a multi-objective approach to account for both technical, economic and the environmental priorities / objectives. The eNeuron tool will also deal with the optimal daily operation of the integrated systems through a stochastic approach and the simulation of peer-to-peer energy trading to investigate the feasibility and convenience of the optimised scheduling strategies from the prosumers point of view in a local real time market employing block chain technology. This integrated approach will allow offering a set of functionalities for LEC (e.g. minimizing CAPEX through optimal investments on RES and other assets), operators (e.g. local congestion management) and prosumers (e.g. activate demand response and energy sharing). The technical solutions developed will be put to the test at four pilot sites in Europe: a city and its major energy nodes (Bydgozecz, Poland), a football stadium and its vicinity (Skagerak, Norway), a naval district with its own distribution grid (Lisbon, Portugal), and a university campus spread over several sites (Ancona, Italy). The ultimate objective is to check the effectiveness of the eNeuron solutions to be replicable and scalable, ready to be adapted to different local contexts in Europe. Impact . Replicability: eNeuron focuses on technology demonstration, as well as on the market viability and the replicability of the developed tools and the targeted subcomponents (products and services). Socio-economics: eNeuron solutions aim to empower European citizens to consume energy more responsibly and at lower prices, while engaging them in the context of LEC by contributing to energy savings and providing flexibility to the grids. Environment: Through the multi-objective approach proposed for the optimal design of the integrated LEC, eNeuron takes into account the environmental priority in terms of reduction of CO 2 emissions, thereby ensuring the long-run sustainability of this new energy paradigm. Market Transformation and Policy: eNeuron will propose new business models based on the LEC concept. Moreover, eNeuron is committed to making a major contribution to the BRIDGE initiative under different prisms as feedback on the ongoing policy developments in areas of local energy communities. eNeuron is also already supported by EERA and will provide insights to ETIP SNET on the energy transition.

        "bridge 119 BRIDGE BROCHURE 2021 Project Description Scope . Future smart grids require the effective interaction between energy markets and electricity grid management systems in order to introduce new services and mitigate risks introduced by high RES penetration. FLEXGRID envisages the orchestration and integration of: \u2022 advanced electricity grid models and tools, \u2022 flexibility assets\u2019 management tools, \u2022 data analytics and accurate forecasts of the various markets and RES production, in order to guarantee cost-effective and stable electricity grids. Technical description and implementation. Towards this end, the FLEXGRID project proposes a holistic future smart grid architecture able to accommodate high RES penetration through the advancement, interaction and integration of: \u2022 innovative models that are based on recent advances in game theory in order to quantify and highly improve the trade-off between the various future energy markets\u2019 requirements (Real Time, Efficient, Strategy Proof, Competitive, Scalable, Fair and Privacy Protecting) and guarantee, theoretically and in practice, the \u201cfairness\u201d of the equilibrium points that energy markets reach, \u2022 grid system models that use optimization theory to achieve more efficient market clearing and Optimal Power Flow (OPF) algorithms to achieve scalability, in a way that must also be Low Overhead, Multi-period, Robust and Network Upgrade Planning Aware, and \u2022 innovative Business Models through the use of artificial intelligence, which can be exploited by modern Energy Service Providers (ESPs) and RES Producers (RESPs) to achieve economic and operational benefits through their efficient interaction with FLEXGRID\u2019s advanced markets and electricity grid models. FLEXGRID will help: \u2022 DSOs/TSOs manage safely and at low cost their electricity grid by interacting with ESPs and ESPs through novel flexibility market procedures, \u2022 modern ESPs become more competitive and sustainable, and \u2022 RESPs optimally compose and exploit their production in a risk-averse manner by making their RES generation dispatchable. Impact . Replicability: FLEXGRID designs a generic Automated Trading Platform (ATP) that brings together stakeholders from both FlexDemand (i.e. DSOs/TSOs) and FlexSupply sides (i.e. ESPs/aggregators). The proposed ATP aims at facilitating the easy, deep and dynamic collaboration between the various energy market stakeholders. The ATP could be operated by an independent local market operator, which operates a novel distribution level flexibility market. As such, FLEXGRID ATP can be a replicable solution for many distribution level areas within Europe, where flexibility assets can have a level playing field to provide flexibility to the system operators. Socio-economics: FLEXGRID will provide advanced energy services\u2019 planning and operation to ESPs/aggregators (i.e. FlexSupplier companies). This is expected to boost RES and FlexAsset penetration. On the other hand, FLEXGRID will develop advanced tools for system operators to dynamically detect frequency, local congestion and voltage problems and solve them in a proactive manner. Environment: FLEXGRID will help to cater more environmentally-friendly energy and help to regulate the system to reduce energy losses, improve the energy balance and to help reduce the vulnerability of the energy system to undesired impacts. Market Transformation and Policy: FLEXGRID introduces a novel distribution-level flexibility market concept and proposes ways that this framework can be integrated in the existing EU regulation. The results of the extensive lab testing and system-level simulations within FLEXGRID will serve as useful recommendations in order for EC to derive new policy implications that are related with the development of flexibility markets in EU area.

        "bridge 121 BRIDGE BROCHURE 2021 Project Description Context \u2022 The current high-speed deployment rate of non-dispatchable Renewable Energy Sources (RES) is making transmission and distribution network planning activities more and more complex. \u2022 Planning activities require greater coordination between transmission and distribution system operators in order to cope with the high level of uncertainty and complexity related to energy transition. \u2022 The long times required to build up a network reinforcement (that can easily overcome 10 years for an important new transmission infrastructure) can prove no longer compatible with the pace at which the electric system is getting transformed, also due to the need to withstand climate change and improve system resilience against extreme climate events. \u2022 Storage and flexibility elements close to RES generation could potentially alleviate grid planning needs Scope \u2022 Creating a new grid planning methodology analysing transmission and distribution (T&D) grid expansion options while considering the deployment of new storage facilities and grid technologies as well as the activation of flexibility resources (distributed generation and demand side management) located in key places as an alternative to building new lines or reinforcing existing ones. \u2022 Creating a set of tools able to implement the methodology above. These tools should be capable to work on real planning problems (dimensionality problem) and constitute a prototype for a set adoptable by TSOs and DSOs in their activities. \u2022 Validating the set of tools on 6 regional cases covering nearly the whole of Europe. Beyond the validation of the methodology and of the tools, these regional cases should be able to cast a view on the real possibility to deploy flexibility and storage as an alternative to traditional grid expansion, to the timeframes 2030, 2040 and 2050. \u2022 The 6 regional cases above should be able to provide a background for the regulatory guidelines whose elaboration will occupy the last phase of the project development. Technical description and implementation \u2022 The project starts by analyzing which technologies could be mature to provide flexibility for the system at the target years 2030-2040-2050. \u2022 A new planning tool is developed, able to calculate the optimal expansion path for the tested transmission grids where spatial location of flexibility elements and exploitation of flexibility resources is considered as an alternative or complement to building new lines (best expansion path) in the light of selected optimization criteria. \u2022 Pan-European scenarios are then elaborated for the years 2030-2040-2050 in order to create a coherent set of border conditions for the subsequent development of six regional simulation cases covering nearly all Europe with nodal grid detail. The 6 regions are: Iberian Peninsula, France and Benelux, Germany Switzerland and Austria, Italy, Balkan region, Northern Europe. \u2022 Finally, regulatory lessons are drawn for specific countries as well as at pan-European level, regarding optimal entity and location of flexibility elements, how to exploit flexibility in the most effective way and what type of incentivization policy could be the most opportune for stimulating an optimal flexibility deployment. Impact . \u2022 Replicability: coherently with grid planning subject, the project performs the whole analysis in simulation by constructing real size planning models replicating the ones that could be considered by the System Operators and based on ENTSO-E scenario storylines for 2030, 2040 and 2050. The result provided by the mathematical models are supposed fully replicable in the real world. \u2022 Socio-economics: the models are based on a market framework, where the solution, calculated every hour simultaneously for the three reference years (2030, 2040, 2050), is based on the typical merit order logics adopted by the electricity markets. \u2022 Environment: environmental externalities (air quality, CO2 lifecycle and landscape constraints) are seen in terms of costs for the society and completely internalized into the target function \u2022 Market Transformation: the project creates a full modelling framework able to model in the most correct band efficient way flexibility elements and system storage. FlexPlan doesn\u2019t directly market elaborations but its results (in particular, the regulatory guidelines) aim at contributing to the creation of a new more efficient and integrated market for congestion management services \u2022 Policy: The final regulatory guidelines aim at contributing to the on-going policy by clarifying: (a) what role flexibility can have in the future as a supporting element to T&D grid planning; (b) which kind of regulation could support the deployment of flexibility element in the most opportune places; (c) which kind of relationship should be put in place between NRAs, SOs and investors I order to foster efficiency and costs reduction for the system ",

        "bridge 125 BRIDGE BROCHURE 2021 Project Description Context . Over the last two decades, the high proliferation of RES together with the increase in DC loads linked to the use of electronics, LED lighting and novel technologies such as electric vehicles and energy storage, has increased the attractiveness of DC grids. The main drivers behind this paradigm shift are related to the increase in energy efficiency, less complex control of power quality and seamless integration of renewable energy and energy storage, thus increasing the sustainability of the energy distribution system. However, the lack of DC microgrids prevents them to evolve from a promising solution for future smart grids to a commercially available technology. Scope. TIGON has been conceived to design, model and develop innovative DC-technologies aiming to improve their reliability, resilience, and performance in a smart and cost-efficient way. In order to do so, a modular concept of DC-based hybrid grid topology is proposed consisting on a MVDC line connecting the main grid through a Solid-State Transformer (SST) with the LV hybrid grid. Based on this concept, TIGON demonstrators located in France and Spain will integrate in a more efficient way distributed RES, energy storage and a variety of loads including electric vehicles. At the same time, the MVDC line will be exploited by integrating a higher amount of RES and providing ancillary services through energy storage systems and their related operation modes and control strategies. Technical description and implementation. The novelty of this approach relies on the integration of TIGON main physical and software developments, which are the key enablers for the smart and cost-effective operation of the whole DC-based hybrid grid. The main technologies of TIGON Project are: \u2022 Solid State transformer \u2022 SiC DC/DC converters \u2022 MVDC PV plant \u2022 WAMPAC system \u2022 Smart Energy Management System \u2022 Decision Support System tool \u2022 Cybersecurity Defence System To be able to validate the performance of the solutions, they will be tested in two real microgrid Demo-Sites located in France and Spain, while additional use cases in the residential and urban railway sectors (Finland and Bulgaria) will act as niche markets for analysing and further solidifying the replication of TIGON developments after the project\u2019s end. In the demo-site in France, one of the main challenges for renewable energies penetration into the grid and specifically for solar power is to reduce drastically the LCOE through reducing CAPEX. The pilot will improve the CAPEX of PV plants, through the reduction of cost of electrical equipment: cables, reduction of components through specific topologies and WBG components through the reduction of passive components size, along with an improvement of reliability on a global scale. In the demo-site in Spain, the increasing share of variable and unpredictable RES connected to the centre is challenging their electricity grid in terms of reliability, stability and security of supply. Impact . Replicability : TIGON focuses on technology demonstration, as well as on the market viability and the replicability of the TIGON technologies and the targeted subcomponents (products and services). Socio-economics : The digitalisation of the power system with the deployment of smart grid technologies, upon which TIGON\u2019s solutions are built, rises concerns on data security and privacy among both operators and consumers. TIGON will develop a robust defence system to face potential cyberattacks that might damage the system. Environment : Solutions implemented in TIGON will allow a smoother deployment of DC-based hybrid grid architectures which will transform current and future energy grids in more sustainable, since they improve the energy efficiency of the system and allow for better management and operation of the energy sources thanks also to the reduced number of energy conversion stages. The TIGON emissions reduction is a true benefit and will also serve as motivation for more active engagement in demand-response plans. Market Transformation and Policy : TIGON will place emphasis in the development of new business models and opportunities will arise due to the dawn of new concepts and systems/tools ideas. Moreover, a dedicated DSS tool facilitating the planning of grid expansions or the development of new hybrid-grids will be developed during the project ",

        "bridge 127 BRIDGE BROCHURE 2021 Project Description Context . Almost 3.5% of European citizens live in geographical islands. Although each island has its own characteristics and challenges, most EU islands face specific energy-related challenges which lead to very high energy costs compared to the mainland. However, opportunities can also arise as, compared to the highly complex mainland energy systems, solutions towards RES integration are easier to deploy and have a significant decarbonization impact on islands\u2019 ecosystems. Scope. IANOS aims to demonstrate, under real-life operational conditions, a group of both technological and non-technological solutions adapted to harsh islandic conditions, in two lighthouse islands: Terceira (Portugal) and Ameland (Netherlands). The project covers a multitude of energy supply, storage and end-use vectors on different climatic and socio-economic conditions, while taking the appropriate measures for their replication into three Fellow islands: Lampedusa (Italy), Bora Bora (French Polynesia) and Nisyros (Greece). Bringing together 34 experienced partners from 9 European countries, the project will adopt an island energy transition strategy focussed on energy efficiency, decarbonisation through electrification and support from carbon-neutral fuels, and the empowerment of local energy communities. Technical description and implementation. IANOS will demonstrate an intelligent Virtual Power Plant (iVPP) based on AI which sets up a virtual network of decentralized renewable energy resources, both non- dispatchable such as wind, solar, tidal resources and dispatchable ones such as geothermal and green gas CHP plants as well as Energy Storage Systems integrated as a single unit, providing flexibility services and fostering island renewable energy self-consumption. Cross-cutting novel technologies will be demonstrated in the 2 Lighthouse islands in 3 different areas: \u2022 Smart Grid (fog-enabled intelligent device, smart energy router, hybrid transformer) \u2022 Storage (flywheel, biobased saline batteries, heat batteries) \u2022 Renewable Energy (tidal kite, auto generative high-pressure digester). An Island Energy Planning and Transition Suite (IEPT) toolkit will be introduced to assist key island stakeholders in developing an effective renewable energy portfolio and island decarbonisation plan. The toolkit comprises a crowd equity platform; a dedicated Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) / Life Cycle Costing (LCC) toolkit to further assist in the decision-making process; and a grid-oriented optimiser providing detailed modelling and grid scenarios simulations. Impact . Replicability: IANOS ensures a large-scale uptake of validated solutions on the same geographical island and/or on other geographical islands with similar problems. The majority of the elements included in IANOS allows a strong degree of automization and interoperability. Socio-economics: IANOS will facilitate the creation and/or increase the number of renewable energy communities. IANOS is supporting the integration of renewables in existing islands\u2019 power systems, avoiding and/or limiting expensive and inefficient investments on new grid infrastructures as far as possible. Environment: IANOS inherently contributes to decreasing the ecological footprint and improving the carrying capacity of islands by reducing energy needs and increasing energy self-sufficiency. Market Transformation: Enhanced innovation capacity will enable IANOS to identify and assess new market opportunities. The whole approach of making rich data streams available to a wide potential audience of innovators is designed to generate new services to islanders and businesses. Policy: IANOS will facilitate the development of an island- wide action plan on clean energy that clearly describes the necessary actions, timeline and budget to achieve each island\u2019s vision. ",

        "bridge 129 BRIDGE BROCHURE 2021 Project Description Context . Borkum is an island of about 30 km2 and 5,500 residents, located 20 miles from the north-western coast of Germany. Following concerns of the population regarding air quality due to a new coal fired power plant on the Dutch coast, Borkum started on a path towards renewable energy many years ago. Following several initiatives in that direction including a citizen dialogue and the previous H2020 NETfficient project, the island decided to become emission-free and fully decarbonized by 2030. Yet, the challenges associated with the intermittent nature of power supplied by renewable sources remain: consumption peaks cannot be met readily by solar and wind energy and expensive grid electricity needs to be bought in. Vice versa, peak generation leads to energy exports at unfavourable conditions. Scope. ISLANDER aims at developing an even more integrated and efficient central energy management platform in order to manage the various energy assets and balance fluctuations between generation and demand, using local flexibility options such as storage technologies and demand response in combination with renewable energy sources. In addition, an innovative concept for heat supply based on a seawater-powered heat pump and a heat storage tank will be installed in a newly built district close to the port of Borkum. A large hydrogen-based storage will also be deployed. Moreover, a Renewable Energy Community will be created in order to engage the citizens of Borkum and strengthen their participation in the island\u2019s energy transition. T hese measures will set the course for the creation of a largely carbon-free energy system on the island of Borkum by 2030. Technical description and implementation. Within this framework, the ISLANDER project will showcase the process of making Borkum a fully autonomous and decarbonised island energy system. Specifically, the project will focus on delivering: \u2022 Distributed RESS systems (Renewable Energy + Small- scale Storage) composed of household and building roof-mounted PV and Li-ion storage, to involve consumers in the active management of the grid. \u2022 Complementary short-to-seasonal, large-scale electricity storage: peak-shaving fast-response storage (Ultracaps), intra-day storage (Li-ion battery) and seasonal storage (H2-based storage). \u2022 Seawater district heating coupled with heat storage for residential units, to make use of the thermal capacity of the North Sea water as a source of heating and cooling. \u2022 Deployment of an EV charging network setting up 5 stations to promote the electrification of the island\u2019s transport. \u2022 A smart IT platform conceived to holistically perform the optimal aggregation of all these components while also implementing Demand Response (DR) to further balance the energy grid. Multi-scale forecasting through comprehensive modelling of demand and supply will be key for it. \u2022 An optimisation tool to optimally design zero-carbon island energy systems thanks to advanced modelling and optimisation and which will be distributed as an open-source software tool to all interested islands. Impact . Replicability: ISLANDER aims to replicate its results to the widest possible adopters. To do so, the project entails a 3-wave replication strategy along with the dissemination measures required to support it: First wave replication in Follower Islands in Great Britain, Greece, and Croatia; Second wave replication in the related archipelagos; Third wave replication in other EU islands by means of the cooperation with the European Islands initiatives. Market Transformation: The indicators shows that the market potential for the ISLANDER advances exploited as energy services, innovative storage approaches and smart IT platform is very relevant within the EU. Taking full advantage of new business models will require the creation of new companies, the training necessary for the new jobs, and the creation of new regulation. ",

        "bridge 131 BRIDGE BROCHURE 2021 Project Description Context . More than 16 million people live on the 2400 islands of the European Union. Although the features of their environments are very diverse, they all face common challenges regarding energy supply. Indeed, due to their high dependency on imported fossil fuels, their energy sectors are extremely polluting, and the lack of interconnections often impacts the resiliency of their networks. Furthermore, the state of their power plants, often aging and lacking efficiency, results in energy costs that can be up to ten times higher for insular inhabitants than on the mainland. But European island geographical conditions often offer high production potential for either solar, wind or biomass technologies. The large penetration of RES would ensure a higher independence, a better security of supply and better grid stability while reducing the costs of energy for households. Scope. The MAESHA project will decarbonise the energy systems of geographical islands by fostering the large deployment of RES through the installation of tailored innovative flexibility services based on a close study and modelling of local energy systems and community structures. MAESHA will demonstrate the solutions on the French overseas island of Mayotte and study replicability potential on 5 follower islands representing more than 1.2 million inhabitants spread in geographical Europe and overseas territories. Technical description and implementation. At the core of the MASHA project, a Flexibility Management and Trading Platform (FMTP) will be developed, where different technologies can offer their flexibility. Such technologies include already existing assets, which must be managed and aggregated to operate in a grid-friendly manner, such as residential and industrial appliances and devices, but also innovative technologies, which will be introduced during the project. These include especially smart EV charging station, combined with PV production, seasonal hydrogen storage, battery storage and technologies to provide virtual inertia. The technical solutions and implementations will be accompanied with an iterative consultation process of representative community members, assembled as a Transition Board. Impact . The MAESHA project will reduce the GHG emission on geographical island energy system and reduce fossil fuel consumption by triggering synergies of relevant energy sectors with a flexible electricity grid. Establishing supporting regulatory frameworks and markets will incentivize the local population to create Local Energy Communities (LECs), increasing the community\u2019s participation and influence in the energy transition. Associated market schemes will decrease the population\u00b4s expenditure on energy consumption, freeing up resources for other goods and thereby improving quality of life and development in multidimensional scope.

        "bridge 133 BRIDGE BROCHURE 2021 Project Description Context . The islands need clean, cost-efficient and reliable solutions tailored to fit their geographical situation, the fluctuating population and the local economy. Combining the intermittent RES with suitable storage, together with other available dispatchable sources such as biomass, along with a variety of operational strategies such as demand side management and management of all the available energy vectors, represents a huge challenge but also an immense business opportunity for the European Island. Scope. ROBINSON aims to help decarbonise islands through developing an intelligent, flexible and modular Energy Management System (EMS), better integration of Renewable Energy Sources (RES), biomass and wastewater valorisation, industrial symbiosis, and the optimisation and validation of innovative technologies. The integrated ROBINSON energy system will ensure a reliable, cost-efficient and resilient energy supply contributing to the decarbonisation of the European islands by helping to decrease emissions. To support islands\u2019 decarbonisation, ROBINSON\u2019s EMS will integrate newly developed and/or adapted technologies, such as a small gas turbine based Combined Heat and Power unit (CHP); Anaerobic Digester assisted by BioElectrochemical Systems (AD+BES) to enable the conversion of liquid waste into biomethane; a mobile innovative wind turbine; a gasifier to covert bio-waste; and hydrogen-related technologies (electrolyser and storage system). The system will be demonstrated on the island of Eiger\u00f8y (Norway) and lab-scale level replication studies will be conducted for the island of Crete (Greece) and the Western Isles (Scotland). The user-friendliness and high modularity of the system ensure a great potential for replication on other islands, as well as in remote areas in Europe and beyond. The project will also encourage business opportunities for local communities and open up markets for the developed technologies. Impact . Replicability: ROBINSON will demonstrate that a smart and integrated energy system can be crucial in reducing fossil fuel consumption drastically by overcoming intermittency issues usually related to renewables. Replicability will be facilitated by the high flexibility and modularity of ROBINSON. Socio-economics: In general, the ROBINSON system is expected to be cost-competitive compared to other variable RES and electrochemical storage (i.e. batteries). The lower cost will be achieved by a combination of storage and buffer capacity for the different energy vectors, but mostly by making use of hydrogen as a storage medium. Environment: ROBINSON will help achieve a faster decarbonisation, enabled by reduction of fossil fuel consumption, increased efficiency, better RES integration, and waste valorisation. Market Transformation: The combination of local energy generation and longer-term storage in the form of hydrogen, bio-methane and heat developed in ROBINSON will stabilize the local grid. ROBINSON will also allow for self-sustainable operation in cases of no grid connection (smoothing of the grid congestion issues and reverse energy flows). ",

        "bridge 135 BRIDGE BROCHURE 2021 Project Description Context . As a result of the geographic insularity, the energy systems in Islands are characterized by high investment, installation and exploitation costs, low profitability, limited connection to the energy market, overdependence on fossil fuels, high greenhouse gas emissions level and poor electrical grid quality. Those barriers limit the improvement of the local energy infrastructure and slow down the economic development of the Islands. Scope. VPP4Islands aims to develop a new concept for energy production, distribution and monitoring dedicated for islands. The new concept will promote RES use and revolutionize the existing small grids and Energy Communities (ECs) in Islands. The proposed flexible VPP will not be considered as a conventional power plant constituted of small distributed energy sources but as a flexible green power plant that can store surplus energy and modify their behaviour and architecture to support unpredictable growth and change of energy demand, climate and market, delivering stability to the grid. VPP4Islands will enhance the innovation capacity and competitiveness of the VPP in Europe based on demand- centred approaches to address the uncertainties and the weakness of the existing VPP. Technical description and implementation. VPP4Islands is mainly based on three concepts: Digital Twin, Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and Virtual Energy Storage System (VESS). The project aims to develop three tools: (1) VPP4I-Platform (2) VPP4I-Node (3) VPP4I-Box. The validation of the proposed solutions will be carried out in three Demo- sites: (1) FLEXIS in United Kingdom, (2) G\u00f6k\u00e7eada island in Turkey, and (3) Formentera island in Spain. FLEXIS demonstration area is a real-life pseudo island case study which will be exploited to assess and validate the economic benefits of the VESS. In G\u00f6kceada and Formentera islands, small RES and storage systems will be deployed in order to ensure the decarbonisation of the Island and increase the flexibility of the Grid. Both islands will become test zones for intelligent smart energy solutions, then new frame conditions for distributed energy resources can be tested too. Impact . Replicability: During the project, the qualified VPP4Islands solutions will be replicated in 3 follower islands and a replication plan will be proposed. Socio-economics: VPP4Islands will put citizens in the center of the energy systems and promote the building of sustainable energy communities. The VPP4I tools will increase the awareness of the energy transition and consumers will become more engaged and active. Grid upgrade and manipulation will contribute to create new jobs. Moreover, the dynamic incentive prices solution will help to increase the income and reduce the investment cost compared to conventional energy storage. Environment: VPP4Islands will contribute to the energy savings thanks to load scheduling via Digital twin optimization, Time of Use, eco-collective action (VPP platform), consumer engagement behaviour through dynamic incentive prices (VESS) and Peak Shaving through the increasing of mix storage systems penetration and controllable loads. Also, VPP4Islands is devoted to 100% renewable energy systems integration and participates considerably in the reduction of CO2 emissions. Market Transformation: The proposed open technologies (DLT/ Digital Twin/ KB) will unlock the constrained energy market and catalyse the economic potential of the region. The proposed advanced forecasting tool, based on machine learning, will predict transparency and KB precisely when the electricity produced can be traded on the spot markets. Policy: The Collaborative Knowledge Management (CKM) platform will allow to share best practices and increase users\u2019 knowledge and experience for energy management and trading, to develop a vision for applying the VPP4ISLANDS technologies, addressing business and societal demands, and to provide recommendations to policy and decision makers.
