The declared expenditure shall be audited based on a representative sample or, where appropriate, on substantive testing and, as a general rule, on statistical sampling methods. A non- statistical sampling method may be used on the professional judgement of the audit authority, in duly justified cases, in accordance with internationally accepted audit standards and in any case where the number of operations for an accounting year is insufficient to allow the use of a statistical method. In such cases, the size of the sample shall be sufficient to enable the audit authority to draw up a valid audit opinion in accordance with point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 59(5) of the Financial Regulation.

Where the total amount of support from the Fund to an OP I does not exceed EUR 35 000 000, the audit authority shall be allowed to limit the audit activities to an annual system audit that includes substantive testing on a combination of random and risk-based testing of operations. The audit work shall be carried out in accordance with internationally accepted audit standards and shall quantify annually the level of error included in the declarations of expenditure certified to the Commission. 2. Where audits are carried out by a body other than the audit auth\u00ad ority, the audit authority shall ensure that any such body has the necessary functional independence. 3. The audit authority shall ensure that audit work takes account of internationally accepted audit standards. 4. The audit authority shall, within eight months of adoption of an operational programme, prepare an audit strategy for the performance of audits. The audit strategy shall set out the audit methodology, the sampling or, where appropriate, substantive testing method for audits on operations and the planning of audits in relation to the current \u25bc B ",

The audit strategy shall be updated annually from 2016 until and including 2024. Where a common management and control system applies to two operational programmes, a single audit strategy may be prepared for the operational programmes concerned. The audit authority shall submit the audit strategy to the Commission upon request. 5. The audit authority shall draw up: (a) an audit opinion in accordance with point (b) of the first subpara\u00ad graph of Article 59(5) of the Financial Regulation; (b) a control report setting out the main findings of the audits carried out in accordance with paragraph 1, including findings with regard to deficiencies found in the management and control systems, and the proposed and implemented corrective actions.

The designations referred to in paragraph 1 shall be based on a report and an opinion of an independent audit body that assesses the fulfilment by the authorities of the criteria relating to the internal control environment, risk management, management and control activities, and monitoring set out in Annex IV. The independent audit body shall be the audit authority, or another public or private law body with the necessary audit capacity, which is independent of the managing authority and, where applicable, of the certifying authority, and which shall carry out its work taking account of internationally accepted audit standards. 3. Member States may decide that a managing authority or a certifying authority which has been designated in relation to an ESF co-financed operational programme pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 is deemed to be designated for the purposes of this Regulation. 4.

The Commission shall decide whether to request those documents on the basis of its risk assessment. The Commission may make observations within two months of receipt of the documents referred to in the first subparagraph. Without prejudice to Article 46, the examination of those documents shall not interrupt the treatment of applications for interim payments. 5. Where existing audit and control results show that the designated authority no longer fulfils the criteria referred to in paragraph 2, the Member State shall, at an appropriate level, fix, according to the severity of the problem, a period of probation, during which the necessary remedial action shall be taken. Where the designated authority fails to implement the required remedial action within the period of probation determined by the Member State, the Member State, at an appropriate level, shall end its designation. The Member State shall notify the Commission without delay when a designated authority is put under probation, providing information on the respective period of probation, when following implementation of remedial actions the probation is ended, as well as when the designation of an authority is ended. The notification that a designated body is put on probation by the Member State, without prejudice to the application of Article 46, shall not interrupt the treatment of applications for interim payments. \u25bc B ",

Commission officials or authorised Commission representatives may carry out on-the-spot audits or checks subject to giving at least 12 working days' notice to the competent national authority, except in urgent cases. The Commission shall respect the principle of propor\u00ad tionality by taking into account the need to avoid unjustified duplication of audits or checks carried out by Member States, the level of risk to the budget of the Union and the need to minimise the administrative burden on beneficiaries in accordance with this Regulation. The scope of such audits or checks may include, in particular, verification of the effective functioning of management and control systems in a programme or a part thereof, in operations and assessment of the sound financial management of operations or programmes. Officials or authorised repre\u00ad sentatives of the Member State may take part in such audits or checks. Commission officials or authorised Commission representatives, duly empowered to carry out on-the-spot audits or checks, shall have access to all necessary records, documents and metadata, irrespective of the medium in which they are stored, relating to operations supported by the Fund or to management and control systems.

The Commission shall accept the accounts where it is able to conclude that the accounts are complete, accurate and true. The Commission shall reach such a conclusion where the audit authority has provided an unqualified audit opinion regarding the completeness, accuracy and veracity of the accounts unless the Commission has specific evidence that the audit opinion on the accounts is unreliable. 3. The Commission shall inform the Member State by the deadline set out in paragraph 1 whether it is able to accept the accounts. 4. If for reasons attributable to Member State, the Commission is unable to accept the accounts by the deadline set out in paragraph 1 the Commission shall notify the Member States specifying the reasons in accordance with paragraph 2 and the actions which are required to be undertaken and the time period for their completion. At the end of that period the Commission shall inform the Member State whether it is able to accept the accounts. \u25bc B ",

Issues related to legality and regularity of the underlying trans\u00ad actions concerning expenditure entered in the accounts shall not be taken into account for the purposes of acceptance of the accounts by the Commission. The procedure for examination and acceptance of the accounts shall not interrupt the treatment of applications for interim payments and shall not lead to suspension of payments, without prejudice to Articles 46 and 47. 6. On the basis of the accepted accounts the Commission shall calculate the amount chargeable to the Fund for the accounting year and the consequent adjustments in relation to the payments to the Member State. The Commission shall take into account: (i) the amounts in the accounts referred to in point (a) of Article 49(1), and to which the co-financing rate defined in Article 20 is to be applied; (ii) the total amount of payments made by the Commission during that accounting year, consisting of the amount of interim payments paid by the Commission in accordance with Article 21 and Article 40(1). 7. After the calculation carried out under paragraph 6 of this Article, the Commission shall pay any additional amount due within 30 days of the acceptance of the accounts. Where there is an amount recoverable from the Member State, it shall be subject to a recovery order issued by the Commission which shall be executed, where possible, by offsetting against amounts due to the Member State under subsequent payments to the same operational programme. Such recovery shall not constitute a financial correction and shall not reduce support from the Fund to the operational programme. The amount recovered shall constitute assigned revenue in accordance with Article 177(3) of the Financial Regulation. 8. Where after applying the procedure set out in paragraph 4, the Commission is unable to accept the accounts, the Commission shall determine, on the basis of the available information and in accordance with paragraph 6, the amount chargeable to the Fund for the accounting year, and shall inform the Member State. Where the Member State notifies the Commission of its agreement within two months of the transmission by the Commission of the information, paragraph 7 shall apply. In the absence of such agreement, the Commission shall adopt a decision, by means of implementing acts, setting out the amount chargeable to the Fund for the accounting year. Such decision shall not constitute a financial correction and shall not reduce support from the Fund to the operational programme. On the basis of the decision, the Commission shall apply the adjustments to the payments to the Member State in accordance with paragraph 7. 9. The acceptance of the accounts by the Commission, or a decision by the Commission under paragraph 8, shall be without prejudice to the application of corrections under Articles 55 and 56. 10. Member States may replace irregular amounts which are detected after the submission of the accounts by making the corresponding adjustments in the accounts for the accounting year in which the irregu\u00ad larity is detected, without prejudice to Articles 55 and 56. \u25bc B ",

CHAPTER 3 Financial corrections and recoveries Article 53 Financial corrections by Member States 1. The Member States shall in the first instance be responsible for investigating irregularities and for making the financial corrections required and pursuing recoveries. In the case of a systemic irregularity, the Member State shall extend its investigation to cover all operations potentially affected. 2. The Member States shall make the financial corrections required in connection with individual or systemic irregularities detected in oper\u00ad ations or operational programmes. Financial corrections shall consist of cancelling all or part of the public contribution to an operation or operational programme. The Member State shall take into account the nature and gravity of the irregularities and the financial loss to the Fund and shall apply a proportionate correction. Financial corrections shall be recorded in the accounts by the managing authority for the accounting year in which the cancellation is decided. 3. The contribution from the Fund cancelled in accordance with paragraph 2 may be reused by the Member State within the operational programme concerned, subject to paragraph 4. 4. The contribution cancelled in accordance with paragraph 2 may not be reused for any operation that was the subject of the correction or, where a financial correction is made for a systemic irregularity, for any operation affected by the systemic irregularity. 5. A financial correction shall not prejudice the Member States' obligation to pursue recoveries under this Article. \u25bc B ",

The Commission shall make financial corrections, by means of implementing acts, by cancelling all or part of the Union contribution to an operational programme and effecting recovery from the Member State in order to exclude from Union financing expenditure which is in breach of applicable law. 2. A breach of applicable law shall lead to a financial correction only in relation to expenditure which has been declared to the Commission and where one of the following conditions is met: (a) the breach has affected the selection of an operation by the body responsible for support from the Fund or in cases where, due to the nature of the breach, it is not possible to establish that impact but there is a substantiated risk that the breach has had such an effect; (b) the breach has affected the amount of expenditure declared for reimbursement by the budget of the Union or in cases where, due to the nature of the breach, it is not possible to quantify its financial impact but there is a substantiated risk that the breach has had such an effect. 3. When deciding on a financial correction under paragraph 1, the Commission shall respect the principle of proportionality by taking account of the nature and gravity of the breach of applicable law and its financial implications for the budget of the Union. The Commission shall keep the European Parliament and the Council informed of decisions taken to apply financial corrections. Article 55 Criteria for financial corrections by the Commission 1. The Commission shall make financial corrections by means of implementing acts by cancelling all or part of the Union contribution to an operational programme in accordance with Article 54 where, after carrying out the necessary examination, it concludes that: (a) there is a serious deficiency in the effective functioning of the management and control system of the operational programme which has put at risk the Union contribution already paid to the operational programme; (b) the Member State has not complied with its obligations under Article 53 prior to the opening of the correction procedure under this paragraph; (c) expenditure contained in a payment application is irregular and has not been corrected by the Member State prior to the opening of the correction procedure under this paragraph. The Commission shall base its financial corrections on individual cases of identified irregularity and shall take account of whether an irregu\u00ad larity is systemic. Where it is not possible to quantify precisely the amount of irregular expenditure charged to the Fund, the Commission shall apply a flat-rate or extrapolated financial correction. \u25bc B ",
        "02014R0223 \u2014 EN \u2014 17.02.2021 \u2014 003.001 \u2014 47 2. The Commission shall, when deciding on a correction under paragraph 1, respect the principle of proportionality by taking account of the nature and gravity of the irregularity and the extent and financial implications of the deficiencies in management and control systems found in the operational programme. 3. Where the Commission bases its position on reports of auditors other than those of its own services, it shall draw its own conclusions regarding the financial consequences after examining the measures taken by the Member State concerned under Article 53(2), the notifications sent under Article 30(2), and any replies from the Member State. 4. The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 62, laying down detailed rules concerning the criteria for determining serious deficiencies in the effective functioning of management and control systems, including the main types of such deficiencies, the criteria for establishing the level of financial correction to be applied and the criteria for applying flat-rates or extrapolated financial corrections. Article 56 Procedure for financial corrections by the Commission 1. Before taking a decision on a financial correction, the Commission shall launch the procedure by informing the Member State of the provi\u00ad sional conclusions of its examination and requesting the Member State to submit its comments within two months. 2. Where the Commission proposes a financial correction on the basis of extrapolation or a flat-rate, the Member State shall be given the opportunity to demonstrate, through an examination of the docu\u00ad mentation concerned, that the actual extent of irregularity is less than the Commission's assessment. In agreement with the Commission, the Member State may limit the scope of that examination to an appropriate proportion or sample of the documentation concerned. Except in duly justified cases, the time allowed for this examination shall not exceed a further period of two months after the two-month period referred to in paragraph 1. 3. The Commission shall take account of any evidence provided by the Member State within the time limits set out in paragraphs 1 and 2. 4. Where the Member State does not accept the provisional conclusions of the Commission, the Member State shall be invited to a hearing by the Commission, in order to ensure that all relevant information and observations are available as a basis for conclusions by the Commission on the application of the financial correction. 5. In the event of an agreement, and without prejudice to paragraph 7 of this Article, the Member State may reuse the Fund in accordance with Article 53(3). \u25bc B ",

In order to apply financial corrections the Commission shall take a decision, by means of implementing acts, within six months of the date of the hearing, or of the date of receipt of additional information where the Member State agrees to submit such additional information following the hearing. The Commission shall take account of all information and observations submitted during the course of the procedure. If no hearing takes place, the six month period shall begin to run two months after the date of the letter of invitation to the hearing sent by the Commission. 7. Where the Commission in carrying out its responsibilities under Article 36, or the European Court of Auditors, detects irregularities demonstrating a serious deficiency in the effective functioning of the management and control systems, the resulting financial correction shall reduce support from the Fund to the operational programme. The first subparagraph shall not apply in the case of a serious deficiency in the effective functioning of a management and control system which, prior to the date of detection by the Commission or the European Court of Auditors: (a) had been identified in the management declaration, annual control report or the audit opinion submitted to the Commission in accordance with Article 59(5) of the Financial Regulation, or in other audit reports of the audit authority submitted to the Commission and appropriate measures taken; or (b) had been the subject of appropriate remedial measures by the Member State. The assessment of serious deficiencies in the effective functioning of a management and control system shall be based on the applicable law when the relevant management declarations, annual control reports and audit opinions were submitted. When deciding on a financial correction the Commission shall: (a) respect the principle of proportionality by taking account of the nature and gravity of the serious deficiency in the effective func\u00ad tioning of a management and control system and its financial impli\u00ad cations for the budget of the Union; (b) for the purpose of applying a flat-rate or extrapolated correction, exclude irregular expenditure previously detected by the Member State which has been the subject of an adjustment in the accounts in accordance with Article 50(10), and expenditure subject to an ongoing assessment of its legality and regularity under Article 49(2); (c) take into account flat-rate or extrapolated corrections applied to the expenditure by the Member State for other serious deficiencies detected by the Member State when determining the residual risk for the budget of the Union. \u25bc B ",

Any repayment due to be made to the budget of the Union shall be effected before the due date indicated in the order for recovery drawn up in accordance with Article 73 of the Financial Regulation. The due date shall be the last day of the second month following the issuing of the order. 2. Any delay in effecting repayment shall give rise to interest on account of late payment, starting on the due date and ending on the date of actual payment. The rate of such interest shall be one-and-a-half percentage points above the rate applied by the European Central Bank in its main refinancing operations on the first working day of the month in which the due date falls. Article 58 Proportional control of operational programmes 1. Operations for which the total eligible expenditure does not exceed EUR 150 000 shall not be subject to more than one audit by either the audit authority or the Commission prior to the submission of the accounts for the accounting year in which the operation is completed. Other operations shall not be subject to more than one audit per accounting year either by the audit authority or the Commission prior to the submission of the accounts for the accounting year in which the operation is completed. Operations shall not be subject to an audit by the Commission or the audit authority in any year if there has already been an audit in that year by the European Court of Auditors, provided that the results of the audit work performed by the European Court of Auditors for such operations can be used by the audit authority or the Commission for the purpose of fulfilling their respective tasks. 2. The audit of an operation supported by an OP I may cover all stages of its implementation and all levels of the distribution chain, with the sole exception of control of the end recipients, unless a risk assessment establishes a specific risk of irregularity or fraud. 3. For operational programmes for which the most recent audit opinion indicates that there are no significant deficiencies, the Commission may agree with the audit authority in the subsequent meeting referred to in Article 37(2) that the level of audit work required may be reduced so that it is proportionate to the risk estab\u00ad lished. In such cases, the Commission shall not carry out its own on- the-spot audits unless there is evidence suggesting deficiencies in the management and control system affecting expenditure declared to the Commission in an accounting year for which the accounts have been accepted by the Commission. 4. For operational programmes for which the Commission concludes that the opinion of the audit authority is reliable, it may agree with the audit authority to limit the Commission's own on-the-spot audits to audit \u25bc B ",

Notwithstanding paragraph 1, the audit authority and the Commission may carry out audits of operations in the event that a risk assessment or an audit by the European Court of Auditors estab\u00ad lishes a specific risk of irregularity or fraud, in the case of evidence of serious deficiencies in the effective functioning of the management and control system of the operational programme concerned, and, during the period referred to in Article 51(1). The Commission may, for the purpose of assessing the work of an audit authority, review the audit trail of the audit authority or take part in the on-the-spot audits of the audit authority and, where, in accordance with internationally accepted audit standards, it is necessary for the purpose of obtaining assurance as to the effective functioning of the audit authority, the Commission may carry out audits of operations. CHAPTER 4 Decommitment Article 59 Decommitment 1. The Commission shall decommit any part of the amount in an operational programme that has not been used for payment of the pre- financing and interim payments by 31 December of the third financial year following the year of budget commitment under the operational programme or for which a payment application drawn up in accordance with Article 41 has not been submitted in accordance with Article 45, including any payment application for which all or part is subject to an interruption of the payment deadline or suspension of payments. 2. That part of commitments still open on 31 December 2023 shall be decommitted if any of the documents required under Article 52(1) has not been submitted to the Commission by the deadline set out in Article 52(1). Article 60 Exception to the decommitment 1. The amount concerned by decommitment shall be reduced by the amounts equivalent to that part of the budget commitment for which: (a) the operations are suspended by a legal proceeding or by an admin\u00ad istrative appeal having suspensory effect; or (b) it has not been possible to make a request for payment for reasons of force majeure seriously affecting implementation of all or part of the operational programme. \u25bc B ",

On the basis of the information it received as of 31 January, the Commission shall inform the Member State and the managing authority of the amount of the decommitment resulting from that information. 3. The Member State shall have two months to agree to the amount to be decommitted or to submit its observations. 4. By 30 June, the Member State shall submit to the Commission a revised financing plan reflecting, for the financial year concerned, the reduced amount of support of the operational programme. Failing such submission, the Commission shall revise the financing plan by reducing the contribution from the Fund for the financial year concerned. 5.
