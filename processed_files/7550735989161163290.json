        "7. asks the European Commission to present a proposal for a revision of the Troika system in order to guarantee democratic scrutiny and its accountability to the European Parliament; 8. calls for negotiations to be reopened on the Deposit Guarantee Scheme Directive in parallel with the proposal for a Directive establishing a framework for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investment firms; 9. notes the successful introduction of project bonds in the market in the context of the on-going pilot phase and demands the extension of this initiative to the full period of the next multiannual financial framework (2014-2020) and to other policy areas than energy, transport, and telecom infrastructures; proposes extending the scope of participation to small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) in order to channel regional investment funds towards SMEs and to bolster a European venture capital industry based on the regions; 10. encourages the European Commission to continue to monitor the situation and development of public finances at regional and local level in its annual Report on Public Finances in the European Monetary Union; Europe 2020 strategy and the European Semester 11. considers that the unsatisfactory state of play of Europe 2020 so far is due not only to the economic crisis and the lack of ambition of the Member States but also to the lack of involvement of the local and regional authorities in the design and implementation of the strategy and, more generally, to the lack of a true territorial dimension in Europe 2020; 12. calls on the Commission to quickly provide a framework for its mid-term review of the Europe 2020 strategy, going beyond its stated intention to launch a methodology; 13. recalls that it is constantly monitoring the progress made on all Flagship Initiatives of the Europe 2020 strategy and is already working on a mid-term assessment from a local and regional perspective; 14. deplores the fact that neither the 2013 Annual Growth Survey nor the Country Specific Recommendations made reference to the need for a place-based approach and for multilevel partnership in the implementation of Europe 2020 strategy and demands that the European Commission fulfils its obligations to ensure that Member States build up partnerships with local and regional authorities in the drafting and imple\u00ad mentation of national reform programmes (NRP); Single market and industrial policy 15. encourages the European Commission to identify and give priority in the functioning of the single market to those areas which are most likely to generate innovation and create quality jobs; 16. encourages the Commission to make proposals for a European industrial policy as one of the pillars of the European project, treated as a genuine political priority on the same political footing as cohesion, infrastructure and agri\u00ad culture; 17. supports the European Parliament's proposal to set up a steering group on industrial policy in order to bring together European, national, regional and local powers and the resources currently scattered across all levels and sectors; 18. requests the European Commission to formally consult the CoR in relation to the elaboration of the new guidelines governing the application of EU state aid rules; 19. encourages the European Commission to promote the development of regional blueprints for innovation including also industrial development; 20. requests the Commission to follow up on its communi\u00ad cation Entrepreneurship 2020 by further analysing the real obstacles faced by young entrepreneurs and would encourage further cross-border exchange and possibilities for them; Cohesion policy and transport 21. reiterates its request to the European Commission to prepare a White Paper on territorial cohesion which would analyse the interplay between the Territorial Agenda 2020 and the Europe 2020 strategy, as well as the ex-post territorial impact of cohesion policy in 2007-2013; 22. calls upon the European Commission to report on whether regional and local authorities were involved in a timely and structured way in the drafting of Partnership Agreements and Operational Programmes for 2014-2020, in line with the partnership and multilevel governance principles inserted in the Common Provisions Regulation as well as with the Code of Conduct on Partnership; 23. asks the European Commission to publish a practical easy-to-use guide for local actors on how to use the new structural funds as soon as the new regulations are adopted; 24. in relation to the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI), expresses strong concerns about the lack of sufficient funding over the entire next programming period and its concentration in 2014/2015 which puts its sustainability and efficiency into question. Calls therefore in particular for article 9f of the MFF regulation to be amended in order to remove the explicit limi\u00ad tation of the new YEI budget line to EUR 3 bn. This move would be all the more necessary in order to avoid any back\u00ad loading after 2016 of programmes which are critical for cohesion such as cross border cooperation programmes or parts of the Connecting Europe Facility; EN C 280/2 Official Journal of the European Union 27.9.2013 ",
