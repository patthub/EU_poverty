Is deeply committed to preserving the full integrity of the Rome Statute and the effective functioning of the International Criminal Court; 2. Stresses that no immunity agreement should ever afford the possibility of impunity for any individual accused of war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide; 3. Regrets the EU Council\u2019s conclusion which envisages the possibility for countries to enter into such agreements with the USA, even if subject to certain conditions; 4. Recognises that the agreements proposed by the USA are contrary to the Rome Statute and to the Treaty commitments of the EU Member States; 5. Urges the EU Council to make all efforts to start a frank dialogue with the US Government and Congress in order to stop the pressure and the threat of sanctions on the countries which have ratified the Rome Statute and to engage the US administration in a cooperative attitude with the ICC; ( 1 ) Adopted by the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly on 3 April 2003 in Brazzaville (Republic of the Congo).

Stresses that the Rome Statute was ratified by all EU Member States and by many ACP countries and is an essential component of the democratic model and values the international community should share; 8. Expects the EU and ACP governments and parliaments to refrain from adopting any agreement which undermines the effective implementation of the Rome Statute; considers therefore that ratifying such an agreement is incompatible with membership of or association with the EU or the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly; 9. Encourages the parliaments of those governments that have signed agreements with the United States under Article 98 of the Rome Statute not to ratify these agreements; 10. Invites all Signatory States to ratify the Statute; 11. Invites the EU and ACP to commit fully to the ICC and to enable it to succeed in preserving its independence, impartiality and integrity; 12. Invites the governments and national parliaments of countries associated with the EU or the ACP under various agreements to sign and ratify the ICC Treaty immediately; 13.

Reminds Member States of their obligations regarding the prohibition of the death penalty, and calls for an in-depth analysis of the legal implications of Article 98 in this area; asks ACP countries to proceed in the same way; 15.

Strongly believes that the international community needs to commit to concrete actions that will support lasting peace and development in Africa and that steps must be taken immediately to tackle conflict through concerted diplomatic action; 2. Notes that critics of NEPAD question the soundness of economic policy, the development vision and the means to achieve its objectives; 3. Calls on the European Union to support efforts by the Joint Parliamentary Assembly in general, and African parliamentarians in particular, to ensure democratic control of NEPAD programmes; 4. Calls on NEPAD and African Union bodies to take the necessary measures to avoid any duplication regarding use of resources in implementing NEPAD and African Union objectives; 5. Believes that NEPAD\u2019s legitimacy should be based on it being approved by the African people, and calls therefore for an open and democratic debate on NEPAD\u2019s development strategy, including citizens\u2019 democratic rights to participate in decision-making; 6. Supports in this respect the various African civil society requests to reformulate NEPAD so that it addresses the population\u2019s basic needs; 7. Supports the African civil society organisations\u2019 call for a sustainable, just and viable development strategy which paves the way for the achievement of the right to food, health, education, gender balance, housing and other needs for all the people of Africa; 8. Attaches the highest importance to the implementation and democratic parliamentary control of the African peer review (APR) mechanism as a means of realising the fundamental principles and objectives of NEPAD by providing a framework for monitoring and fostering better policies, standards, and practices; urges African countries\u2019 parliaments to guarantee that the peer review process is conducted in a democratic way; 9. Also urges countries to act on the results of the peer reviews, which are envisioned to start in early 2003, with resources to come predominantly from Africa; 10.

Notes that the WSSD concluded with the adoption of a Johannesburg Declaration on Sustainable Development, together with an accompanying Plan of Implementation, and that, in addition, a large number of partnership agreements were also announced; 2. Welcomes the broad principles set down in the Johannesburg Declaration but considers that the WSSD outcome needs to be judged, in particular, by the content of the accompanying Plan of Implementation; undertakes to contribute to putting into practice the plan for implementation of the results of the Johannesburg Summit, in particular item VIII entitled \u2018Sustainable development for Africa\u2019 and item VIIIa entitled \u2018Other regional initiatives\u2019 regarding the Caribbean and the Pacific; 3. Is of the opinion that, in less-developed countries in particular, there will be no sustainable development without economic development and social cohesion; underlines therefore in this context that the fight against poverty, a change in consumption and production patterns, and the protection and management of natural resources are mutually reinforcing sustainable development objectives which require balanced implementation so as to achieve global prosperity, security and stability; ( 1 ) Adopted by the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly on 3 April in Brazzaville (Republic of the Congo).

Regrets that no real efforts were made to agree on a plan to assist developing countries in their efforts to support technology leapfrogging, notably in relation to energy production, transportation, agriculture, waste management and chemicals, which would make it possible to bypass the more pollutant phases of the modernisation process; 6. Regrets that the Kyoto Protocol had not yet been ratified by enough States to come into force in time for the WSSD, but welcomes the Conference\u2019s reaffirmation of the importance of the Protocol; 7. Expresses its particular disappointment at the lack of any specific targets for renewable energy, along the lines of either those proposed by the EU or the even more ambitious target mooted by Brazil; 8. Expresses its concerns that, although the challenges facing the world have been described, the necessary determination to achieve common action does not include express recognition of the contribution of science and technology to sustainable development and, more particularly, does not promote better understanding of the relationship between the environment and technological development; 9. Regrets the insufficiently strong commitment to tackle the loss of world biodiversity and the weak formula that was agreed, namely the \u2018achievement by 2010 of a significant reduction in the current rate of loss\u2019; regrets that no further statement was made regarding the need to curb habitat destruction and the loss of biodiversity; 10. Supports in particular the effort to provide world-wide assistance to increase employment opportunities, taking into account the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work; 11.

Believes that it is of the utmost importance to ensure that agreements resulting from the present round of WTO negotiations make a meaningful and significant contribution to addressing imbalances and inequities in the global trading system, and that the developmental concerns of developing countries in general, and least-developed countries in particular, are prioritised in practice in both the conduct and outcome of negotiations; 2. Supports the European Commission\u2019s efforts to reach a compromise in the WTO TRIPS Council on access to affordable medicines for developing countries and deplores the lack of results so far; considers that, in this respect, the possible solution is to be found in Amendment 196 to the European medicine directive; 3. Stresses that the EU occupies a strategic position in the negotiating process and within the international financial institutions and must therefore ensure that, in parallel with the trade negotiations, the policies of financial institutions are reviewed, structural adjustment plans of various types, coming under different names, are cancelled and the unpayable external debt of developing countries is significantly reduced or cancelled so as to enable these countries to revitalise public investment and production; 4. Acknowledges that the ACP is one of the most important groupings of developing countries; 5. Notes the major disparity between the industrialised countries on the one hand and the developing countries on the other regarding their capacity to supply services; therefore calls for the matter to be considered with the greatest care, taking into account the needs of the ACP countries to establish and maintain public services; 6. Considers that private investment may, together with the necessary public investment, be a driving force behind development but that the countries concerned must retain full sovereignty to administer such investment; 7. Takes the view that all negotiations must consider the question of monitoring by multinational companies and foreign investors of respect for human rights, the right of minorities, and the environment, and monitoring by the ACP countries of good governance (absence of corruption) on the part of multinational companies; 8. Considers that foreign debt is for many ACP countries an insurmountable obstacle to their development which is essential for real integration into the world economy; considers that the EU should enter into specific undertakings to reduce and, if possible, cancel bilateral and multilateral ACP debt; 9. Believes that parliamentary monitoring of both the ongoing negotiating process and the final outcome will be of critical importance in the struggle to ensure that Doha becomes a \u2018developmental round\u2019; 10. States that the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly has a particular character among interparliamentary bodies in that it groups together in regular meetings parliamentarians from the EU and 77 ACP countries, thereby enabling it to play a meaningful ongoing monitoring and supervisory role; 11. Supports all ongoing efforts to promote parliamentary monitoring of the WTO process, including the initiative by the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) and the European Parliament at the conference in Geneva in February 2003; 12.

RESOLUTION ( 1 ) on WTO negotiations on health issues The ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, \u2014 meeting in Brazzaville (Republic of the Congo) from 31 March to 3 April 2003, \u2014 having regard to the Doha WTO Ministerial Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health adopted on 14 November 2001, and in particular paragraph 6 thereof, A. whereas the agreement on the Doha Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health was a significant achievement and was seen as a key indicator of the seriousness with which developed countries take the concerns of developing and least developed countries on public health issues, access to essential medicines for all and the need to put people before patents, B. whereas the Declaration, in paragraph 4, states that \u2018... the TRIPS agreement does not and should not prevent Members from taking measures to protect public health\u2019, and the same paragraph states that: \u2018 the [TRIPS] Agreement can and should be interpreted and implemented in a manner supportive of WTO members\u2019 right to protect public health and, in particular, to promote access to medicines for all\u2019, C. whereas paragraph 5(b) of the Doha Declaration reaffirms the right for countries to grant compulsory licenses and the freedom to determine grounds upon which such licenses are granted and paragraph 5(c) reaffirms that each member has the right to determine what constitutes a national emergency or other circumstances of extreme urgency in which case a fast track procedure can be used, D. whereas WTO members which have sufficient domestic manufacturing capacities are not limited in any way on the use of the compulsory license and do not need to refer to the WTO to use their rights under TRIPS, but, as recognised by paragraph 6, members with insufficient or no manufacturing capacities in the pharmaceutical sector could face difficulties in making effective use of compulsory licensing under the TRIPS Agreement since Article 31(f) of the TRIPS agreement limits compulsory licensing predominantly to supplying the domestic market, ( 1 ) Adopted by the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly on 3 April 2003 in Brazzaville (Republic of the Congo). ",
        "C 231/32 EN 26.9.2003 Official Journal of the European Union E. whereas the WTO TRIPS Council was therefore mandated to find an expeditious solution to this problem \u2014 in ensuring that production for export to a country that has issued a compulsory license or that has no patent, but does not have manufacturing capacity, can take place from a country that provides pharmaceutical patents \u2014 and to report to the General Council before the end of 2002, F. whereas this mandate clearly intended that those countries which lack such capacity should not be put at a disadvantage by discriminatory restrictions and that the solution sought should be workable, automatic and economically viable; in this perspective the December 2002 proposal is not satisfactory and does not respect the spirit of the Doha Declaration, G. whereas the deadline was not met, primarily due to the insistence by some pharmaceutical companies and by the United States Government that there needed to be further restrictive definitions of public health crises together with a specified list of diseases to which the provisions applied, H. whereas the European Commission has now proposed that the advice of the World Health Organisation could be sought in the event of a dispute but that such advice would be non-binding, 1. Strongly regrets the position taken by the United States, motivated by the interest of some pharmaceutical companies, in blocking the adoption by the TRIPS WTO Council of an expeditious solution to the problem of access to medicine for developing countries, before the end of 2002 as agreed in Doha; 2. Reaffirms that access to health care is part of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which should be respected; 3. Asks the European Commission and the EU Member States to assume a strong position in the TRIPS WTO negotiations, in order to ensure that priority is always given to public health and not primarily to commercial considerations, patents and the profits of pharmaceutical companies; 4. Considers that the language of the Doha Declaration is clear and unambiguous and the question of what does or does not constitute grounds for the issue of compulsory licences does not require further interpretation, either by means of an \u2018approved list\u2019, or any external approval mechanism; and that any allegations of abuse of the provisions of TRIPS should be dealt with through the relevant disputes procedure; 5. Believes that the ongoing negotiations should not result in discrimination between WTO members with differing capacities to respond to public health problems and asks the European Commission to find an equitable solution to the problem stated in paragraph 6 of the Doha Declaration; 6. Insists that the European Commission must therefore respect the clarifications provided in the Doha Declaration and reject any position that would result in limitations regarding the scope of diseases or the countries that could make use of an effective solution to the problem defined in paragraph 6; 7. Believes that the ongoing negotiations in the WTO on a solution to paragraph 6 of the Doha declaration should aim at placing the WTO members without sufficient manufacturing capacities in the same position as the WTO members who do have manufacturing capacities; 8. Considers that the most effective solution is a limited exception under Article 30 of the TRIPS Agreement whereby WTO members may permit third parties to make, sell, and export patented medicines and other health technologies to address public health needs; considers that this would allow production for export activities to be defined under national law as exceptions to the rights of patent holders; 9. Calls for Article 31, which defines the compulsory licence system, to be retained; 10. Insists that neither the countries with insufficient manufacturing capacities nor the countries that will utilise the mechanism to produce for export should be subject to any conditions, notification procedures or any other procedural mechanism more onerous than the ones already provided for under WTO rules; ",
        "26.9.2003 EN C 231/33 Official Journal of the European Union 11. Recognises that the WTO is not the most appropriate body to arbitrate or make rules on questions of public health or access to essential medicines and that, in this regard, the TRIPS Agreement has to be subservient to other values and authorities, as is implicit in the Doha Declaration; 12. Agrees with the European Commission that the World Health Organisation (WHO) could play an important role, but warns that the autonomy and authority of the WHO should not be compromised; in this context encourages the European Commission to consider the WHO\u2019s proposal for a solution to paragraph 6 which was presented to the TRIPS Council on 17 September 2002; 13. Considers therefore that the European Commission\u2019s proposal to draw up a list of concerned diseases is not exhaustive since, if it were, it would represent a further restriction on developing countries\u2019 use of compulsory licensing or Article 30 mechanisms, while developed countries are not subject to any such limitations; 14. Considers that when conflicts arise, as is evident in this case, between intellectual property rights and public policy questions, they should always be resolved first in favour of people and not only patents; underlines, further, that there is a timetable laid down in the TRIPS Agreement for overall review of its workings which has not been met and notes that this process also is stalled in Geneva; 15. Asks the European Commission and the EU Member States to support a broader discussion under the auspices of the WHO on how the TRIPS agreement affects the availability of affordable generic medicines; 16. Asks the European Commission also to investigate alternative strategies to address the issue of the lack of product development for neglected diseases and to support the WHO in including this issue in its agenda; 17. Instructs its Co-Presidents to forward this resolution to the ACP-EU Council, the European Commission, the WTO, the WHO and the Secretary-General of the United Nations.

Calls on the European Commission and ACP countries to propose, in the course of EU-ACP trade negotiations, an ambitious set of trade regulation arrangements seeking to achieve major sustainable development objectives including the eradication of poverty; 4. Calls for a review of the free trade arrangements currently in force and their replacement with equitable arrangements, taking account of the concerns of the countries of the South so as to avoid any future slump in commodity prices; 5. Takes the view that international financial institutions, together with the European Union, have a share of responsibility in this crisis having made the provision of aid conditional on trade liberalisation and prompted the countries concerned to follow an external market-oriented economic policy; 6. Strongly urges the major coffee-roasting companies to pay coffee growers a decent price which is sufficiently above their cost of production and purchase beans that meet the International Coffee Organisation (ICO) quality standards, and to increase the amount of coffee they buy under fair trade conditions; 7. Calls on the European Commission to provide the necessary financial and material support for the rescue plan for coffee introduced by Oxfam and adopted by the major coffee producing and exporting countries; 8. Calls on the European Commission to redeploy former STABEX funds or to urgently allocate additional funds to address the crisis faced by the coffee-producing communities and take the necessary measures to enable the countries to benefit, without any condition, from the \u2018B\u2019 envelope of the 9 th EDF; 9.

Expresses its sympathy in connection with the distress and damage caused to the flood victims in all the affected countries; 2. Warmly welcomes the swift response of the Commission to the flooding in Austria, Germany and several applicant countries; 3. Underlines the need for more action, particularly in the transport and energy sectors, to reduce CO 2 emissions by promoting energy saving and renewable sources; 4. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to rapidly agree on EU and national measures to implement the targets agreed within the Kyoto Protocol, as a first step towards reducing greenhouse gases; 5. Calls on the United States of America to join hands with the international community in fighting climate change and to ratify the Kyoto Protocol at the earliest opportunity; 6. Calls on the Member States to adapt their policy and legislation towards reduced and sustainable land use, to maintain existing flood plains in their natural state or reconstruct former ones, to finance and promote restructuring measures in favour of eco-systems in rivers and valleys, to respect landscape and forests and to protect eco-systems in flood-sensitive areas of rivers and their valleys; 7. Calls on the Member States to clean up their chemical sites and to ensure that they are protected against flooding, so as to avoid contamination of the environment; 8. Instructs its Co-Presidents to forward this resolution to the ACP-EU Council and the European Commission.

        "26.9.2003 EN C 231/67 Official Journal of the European Union Declaration of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly at its 5th session in Brazzaville (Republic of the Congo) from 31 March to 3 April 2003 on the war in Iraq Following an in-depth discussion, a large majority of members attending the 5th session of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly from 31 March to 3 April 2003 in Brazzaville (Republic of the Congo) considers the war against Iraq to be in breach of international law and to have a destabilising effect on the region as a whole, but a small minority strongly opposes this view. The majority of both ACP and EU members deeply regret the fact that the UN inspectors were not given more time to check for the possible presence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and, where necessary, to ensure their destruction. Again, a large majority of members considers that, even though Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime shows utter contempt for human dignity, a war which brings death and suffering to large sections of the population, destroys vital infrastructure and has a devastating effect on the economy cannot be justified. Concerned at the serious consequences of this war, the Joint Parliamentary Assembly, at its 5th session, calls for an immediate stop to the war and speedy reconstruction measures under a UN mandate, and welcomes the following statement made by the Co-Presidents on 31 March 2003: \u2018As this fifth session of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly begins, we are profoundly concerned by the war in Iraq, the many casualties and the massive destruction it has caused. We wish to commemorate those who have died and express our deepest sympathy with all those mourning the victims of the conflict. The Joint Parliamentary Assembly hopes for a rapid end to hostilities. The international community must, in the near future, meet the challenges involved in the reconstruction of Iraq. We welcome the United Nations Security Council\u2019s decision to reactivate the \u201cFood for Oil\u201d programme which could make a useful contribution to relieving the suffering of the Iraqi people. On behalf of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly we appeal to the European Union and the ACP countries to play their full part in the future reconstruction of Iraq. This should be carried out under the aegis of the United Nations, in solidarity between peoples.\u2019 ",
