        "1 I n n o v a t i o n U n i o n p r o g r e s s a t c o u n t r y l e v e l : A u s t r i a Summary: Performance in research and innovation The indicators in the table below present a synthesis of research and innovation (R&I) performance in Austria. They relate knowledge investment and input to performance and economic output throughout the innovation cycle. They show thematic strengths in key technologies and also the high-tech and medium-tech contribution to the trade balance. The indicator on excellence in science and technology takes into consideration the quality of scientific production as well as technological development. The Innovation Output Indicator covers technological innovation, skills in knowledge-intensive activities, the competitiveness of knowledge-intensive goods and services, and the innovativeness of fast-growing enterprises, focusing on innovation output. The indicator on the knowledge-intensity of the economy focuses on the economy\u2019s sectoral composition and specialisation and shows the evolution of the weight of knowledge-intensive sectors and products. Austria The challenge of further enhancing the innovation base of a knowledge-intensive economy Austria has expanded its research and innovation system over the last decade with investments in R&I growing more quickly than the EU average. These efforts have been translated into a high and growing level of excellence in science and technology and clear strengths in key technologies for energy, environment and transport. The Austrian economy is characterised by specialised niche players, which require constant innovation, in particular technological innovation, in order to remain leaders in their market segment. Hence, the level of innovation in Austrian firms is relatively high. Overall, according to several indicators on trade, company innovations and patent revenues from abroad, the Austrian economy is \u2013 partly for structural reasons \u2013 less knowledge-intensive than many other EU Member States. However, the indexes on structural change and trade balance both point towards an upgrading of knowledge intensity linked to an increase in competitiveness. Key indicators of research and innovation performance R&D intensity 2012: 2.84 % (EU: 2.07 %; US: 2.79 %) 2007-2012: +2.5 % (EU: +2.4 %; US: +1.2 %) Excellence in S&T 1 2012: 51.9 (EU: 47.8; US: 58.1) 2007-2012: +3.6 % (EU: +2.94 %; US: -0.24) Innovation Output Indicator 2012: 100.1 (EU: 101.6) Knowledge-intensity of the economy 2 2012: 45.3 (EU: 51.2; US: 59.9) 2007-2012: +1.7 % (EU: +1.01 %; US: +0.54 %) Areas of marked S&T specialisations: Energy, construction, environment, automobiles, and other transport technologies HT + MT contribution to the trade balance 2012: 3.5 % (EU: 4.23 %; US: 1.02 %) 2007-2012: +10.0 % (EU: +4.8 %; US: -32.3 %) 1 Composite indicator that includes PCT per population, ERC grants per public R&D, top universities and research institutes per GERD and highly cited publications per total publications. 2 Composite indicator that includes R&D, skills, sectoral specialisation, international specialisation and internationalisation sub-indicators. Nevertheless, the efforts to boost research must be maintained, given the specialisation of the Austrian economy in a limited number of knowledge-intensive sectors where international competition is strong. These include, for example, transport technology, biotechnology and the energy sector. The economic crisis had less impact on Austria than in other Member States and its unemployment rate is currently the lowest in the EU. To maintain its competitiveness and hence its favourable economic position, the country depends on an ongoing high rate of innovation. Austria\u2019s R&I policies are addressing these challenges by means of educational reform, improved governance of the R&D sector, establishing new research centres of excellence, setting up a more effective system of public research funding and, more generally, by promoting a further increase in the already high level of public and private investment in R&D. ",
        "2 R e s e a r c h a n d I n n o v a t i o n p e r f o r m a n c e i n t h e E U Austria has set a national R&D intensity target of 3.76 %, one percentage point above its performance in 2011 and the third highest national target among EU Member States. In the past decade, R&D intensity in Austria has progressed faster than the EU average \u2013 reaching 2.84 % in 2012. The trends during 2007-2012 imply that Austrian R&D intensity will progress further, but that additional efforts are required to achieve the ambitious national R&D intensity target. Public spending on R&D as a % of GDP in Austria has shown a clear upward trend since 2002; it also increased both during and after the recession of 2009, despite budgetary constraints. In addition, business R&D as a % of GDP has expanded strongly during the last decade and is now among the highest in Europe. However, in recent years, progress in private spending has decelerated, with the share of GDP stagnating and a decline in absolute spending in real terms during the 2009 recession. From 2010, growth picked up in business R&D, with nominal growth surpassing 5 % in 2012. Austrian R&I are also benefitting from support from the EU budget via co-funding for private and public R&D investment as well as other innovation, training and entrepreneurial activities. A key instrument in recent years has been the Seventh Framework Programme for Research (FP7). At 22.5 %, Austrian applicants\u2019 success rate in FP7 is close to the EU average success rate of 22 %. Until mid-2013, over 3300 Austrian participants had been partners in an FP7 project, with a total EU financial contribution of EUR 1100 million. Furthermore, Structural Funds are an important source of funding for R&I activities. For the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) programme period 2007-2013, nearly EUR 360 million of the EUR 1200 million have been allocated from the EU budget to activities related to research, development and innovation in Austrian regions (RTDI) 1 , whilst EUR 530 million has been spent on innovation in a broad sense (including entrepreneurship, innovative ICT, and human capital). 3 RTDI includes the following sectors: (01) RTD activities in research centres, (02) RTD infrastructures and centres of competence, (03) Technology transfer and improvement of cooperation of networks, (04) Assistance to RTD, particularly in SMEs (and RTD services in research centres), (06) Assistance to SMEs for the promotion of environmentally friendly products and processes, (07) Investment in firms directly linked to research and innovation, (09) Other methods to stimulate research and innovation and entrepreneurship in SMEs, and (74) Developing human potential in the field of research and innovation.

Reading clockwise, it provides information on human resources, scientific production, technology valorisation and innovation. Average annual growth rates from 2007 to 2012 (or the latest year) are given in brackets. The graph shows that the Austrian R&I system is balanced and performing well in all areas: human resources, scientific production, technology development and innovation. In general, progress has also been good. However, there are some warning signs from falling marketing or organisational innovation in SMEs and declining shares in R&D investments by foreign firms. There has also been a decline in the share of foreign doctoral students, in public expenditure on R&D financed by business enterprises, and in the number of scientific publications within the 10 % most often cited. In the field of human resources for R&I, Austria is performing either at or above EU average and has made good progress since 2000. Traditionally, tertiary attainment has been low in Austria, with many graduates classified as post-secondary, non-tertiary (ISCED 4), although a relatively high share of Austrian students study science and technology subjects and an above- average proportion of them graduate at doctoral level. Despite a strong inflow of foreign students, notably from Germany, Austria still has a lower share of foreign doctoral students than comparable countries \u2013 and the share has actually declined since 2007. Highly skilled graduates are quite well integrated into the Austrian economy, as evidenced by the relatively high number of business enterprise researchers and, linked to that, the country\u2019s good performance in the field of patent applications. Austria does not significantly outperform the EU average in high-quality scientific publications, nor in its success in international competitions for EU Framework Programme funding for R&D. The share of Austrian universities is high among those performing well in major international rankings, although they are not well represented at the very top of such rankings. In the past, Austria has improved public-private cooperation considerably, both in scientific production and in contract research by business enterprises working with public research organisations, and it now performs above the EU average in this field. It also performs well as regards innovation in SMEs.

Both the specialisation index (SI, based on the number of publications) and the revealed technological advantage (RTA, based on the number of patents) measure the country\u2019s scientific (SI) and technological (RTA) capacity compared to that at the world level. For each specialisation field it provides information on the growth rate in the number of publications and patents. As illustrated in the graph above, there is a notable difference in performance between scientific production (publications) and technological production (patents) in Austria. As regards publications, Austria only shows specialisation in the fields of ICT, and health. There is a lack of specialisation in the other areas, notably in other transport technologies, energy and construction. With reference to patents (technological output), Austria has obvious strengths in other transport technologies and construction, and performs above the EU average in automobiles, environment and materials. There is a certain imbalance between those specialisations measured by citations and patents. Hence, Austria could profit more from its higher education system to better underpin its technological output.

The scientific production of the country is reflected by the size of bubbles, which corresponds to the share of scientific publications from a science field in the country\u2019s total publications. Policies and reforms for research and innovation Austria is formulating R&D policies from a relatively favourable position in terms of overall R&D intensity. While research is among the priority areas in public spending, the share of private-sector expenditure on R&D in the total R&D expenditure fell from 71 % in 2007 to 69 % in 2012, thus putting at risk the achievement of the ambitious Europe 2020 R&D intensity target of 3.76 %. Among the factors attributed to the low growth in private spending in 2009-2011 are the economic crisis and a lack of venture capital (VC). However, the government has taken steps to stimulate additional private-sector spending on R&D and recently private spending growth has improved. In 2011, on the initiative of the Austrian Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Austria shows a high specialisation in health, and ICT publications, and some specialisation in automobiles. In all these areas, the scientific impact is above the global average. As regards the other areas, apart from humanities and Technology (bmvit), 22 of Austria\u2019s larger companies, representing more than one-fifth of the country\u2019s business enterprise research spending, have committed to increasing R&D spending by 20 % by 2015. This target had already been reached by 2013 (with a 24 % growth in spending). The Austrian RTDI Strategy \u2018Becoming an innovation leader\u2019, which was published in 2011, puts forward many initiatives to improve the performance of the R&I system. These include initiatives to strengthen links to the education system, to increase the share of tertiary graduates, to promote high-quality research infrastructure and fundamental research, and to use public procurement to promote innovation. socio-economic sciences (where the impact tends to be affected by a language bias) as well as new production technologies, the scientific impact is above the world level, despite a low specialisation index. \u0017 Austria \u2013 Positional analysis of publications in Scopus (specialisation versus impact), 2000\u20132010 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 Source: DG Research and Innovation \u2013 Unit for the Analysis and Monitoring of National Research Policies Data: Science-Metrix Canada, based on Scopus Note: Scientific specialisation includes 2000\u20132010 data; the impact is calculated for publications of 2000\u20132006, citation window 2007\u20132009.

        "6 R e s e a r c h a n d I n n o v a t i o n p e r f o r m a n c e i n t h e E U The Austrian government has set up a task force to implement the RTDI strategy. A key measure to stimulate private investment concerns the simplification of the tax regime for R&D activities to a single tax credit raised from 8 % to 10 %. In addition, the cap on the amount which can be subcontracted while remaining eligible for tax credit has risen from EUR 0.1 million to EUR 1 million. These measures, which are budget neutral, are expected to encourage subcontracting to research centres and universities. On the other hand, this approach favours established activities over the breakthrough research needed for an economy like Austria\u2019s. In July 2013\u2019 the public procurement law was updated and innovation was added as a secondary criterion. As regards the sustainability of economic activities, which plays an important role in the public\u2019s acceptance of innovation and which in itself can also be a source of innovation, since 2012 the National Energy Strategy has aimed at increasing efficiency, energy security and the share of renewables. Funding is available for the greening of industries and an action plan was set up in October 2010 for Green Public Procurement. In 2011, a strategy paper was prepared to promote electrical mobility, and in 2012, a resource-efficiency action plan (REAP) was adopted. A Smart Grids Strategy is currently under preparation. Innovation Output Indicator The Innovation Output Indicator, launched by the European Commission in 2013, was developed at the request of the European Council to benchmark national innovation policies and to monitor the EU\u2019s performance against its main trading partners. It measures the extent to which ideas stemming from innovative sectors are capable of reaching the market, providing better jobs and making Europe more competitive. The indicator focuses on four policy axes: growth via technology \u2013 (patents); jobs (knowledge- intensive employment); long-term global competitiveness (trade in mid/high-tech commodities); and future business opportunities (jobs in innovative fast-growing firms). The graph below enables a comprehensive comparison of Austria\u2019s position regarding the indicator\u2019s different components: Austria is an average performer in the Innovation Output Indicator. However, its performance is improving as a result of mixed performance as regards the indicator\u2019s components. The country performs relatively well on patents but only on or below average in the other areas. Austria\u2019s performance is relatively low in knowledge-intensive services exports.

Austria\u2019s relatively good performance in patents is explained by its above-average share of industries (automobile, other transport equipment, biotechnology, ICT) which are patent-intensive thanks to the quality of the R&I system. The automobile/ transport equipment industry and machinery also contribute to an above-average share of medium/ high-tech exports. Tourism is an important economic sector in Austria, which is a leading winter tourism destination. It contributes to both a low share of employment in knowledge-intensive activities and, together with the export of services such as road and rail transport, which are not classified as knowledge-intensive, to a low share of knowledge-intensive services exports, as Austria has no particular strongholds in Upgrading the manufacturing sector through research and technologies The graph below illustrates the upgrading of knowledge in different manufacturing industries. The position on the horizontal axis illustrates the changing weight of each industry sector in value added over the period. The general trend to the left-hand side reflects the decline of manufacturing in the overall economy. The sectors above the x-axis are those where research intensity has increased over time. The size of the bubble represents the sector share (in value added) in manufacturing (for all sectors presented in the graph). The red sectors are high-tech or medium-high-tech sectors. other knowledge-intensive service export areas to compensate for this specialisation pattern. Expenditure on R&D is high by European standards, although Austria may not be exploiting and maintaining its innovative potential sufficiently. One reason for this is an underdeveloped venture capital market (in 2012, VC represented 0.04 % of GDP in Austria compared to the EU average of 0.29 %). It suffers from an unfavourable legal framework and from structural and other problems related to its VC market (e.g. small size and limited differentiation, general reluctance to invest in early stages, uncertainty concerning the treatment of non- incorporated companies as VC funds, etc.). In addition, the education system is facing the challenge of providing the basic skills required for innovation and competitiveness, while the low tertiary attainment rate and the general demographic development might lead to a scarcity of skilled people in the long term.

        "8 R e s e a r c h a n d I n n o v a t i o n p e r f o r m a n c e i n t h e E U Austria is one of the EU countries with a high contribution of manufacturing industry to total value added (around 19 % compared to the EU average of 16 %). But, as in most other EU countries, the manufacturing sector\u2019s share of value added tends to decline over time. This is reflected in the general development towards a service- oriented economy, despite the fact that Austria\u2019s manufacturing industry has clearly increased its knowledge-intensity in many high- and medium- high-tech sectors as well as in most medium-low and low-tech sectors (with the notable exception of pharmaceutical products). As in many other European countries, construction is one of the largest sectors in the economy. This sector\u2019s share of the economy has declined since the economic crisis, while its research intensity has improved significantly. In general, research intensity in Austria has increased more in low-tech sectors than in high-tech and medium-high-tech ones, although coming from a lower baseline.
