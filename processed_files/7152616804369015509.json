        "Priorities for the dedicated call for Balkan reintegration (2001) (a) Environment and industry: specific regional problems RTD leading to management systems and technologies aimed at the prevention and remediation of environmental problems specific to these countries and their regions, and at the improvement of the environmental standards of industrial activities and their usage of resources. Also, RTD leading to improved quality and reduced cost of process for services and products within regional industry. Particular attention will be paid to the closer involvement of local industry within research activity. (cid:151) Environmental management for industrial metropolitan areas and areas adversely affected by the extraction of natural resources; aimed at the remediation/mitigation of pollution, the treatment of industrial and municipal waste and the use of recycled materials resulting from depuration sludge, biodepuration and (bio-)composting. (cid:151) Development of environmentally benign and sustainable industrial technologies applicable to existing regional industry: minimisation of emissions, effective and secure use of raw materials and energy. Innovative product development leading to better use of existing industrial capacity and ultimately contributing to increased employment in the region. (b) Health: specific regional problems RTD concerned with the specific diseases and health problems resulting from war and migration of refugees in the region. (cid:151) Increased understanding of the post-conflict and post- trauma health problems, leading to development of more effective rehabilitation procedures and treatments. INCO MED A3 (shared cost actions, concerted actions, thematic networks) MEDITERRANEAN PARTNER COUNTRIES (Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Malta ( 1 ), Morocco, Palestine Authority, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey) Deadline: 17.9.2001 Budget: EUR 29,5 million Call identifier: ICFP501A3PR02. Objectives and approach The objectives are those of the Euro-Mediterranean Part- nership and target long-range sustainable development around the Mediterranean Sea in the context of trans- boundary economic, environmental and socio-political problems. The approach is to concentrate on a set of five strategic areas: socioeconomic modernisation, managing scarce regional water resources, preserving and using cultural heritage, promoting healthy societies and regional environmental sustainability. These areas of specific relevance to the region are not addressed under the thematic programmes of the fifth framework programme or under the research for development part of this programme and were selected through an extensive process of Euro-Mediterranean dialogue. Synergy and complementarity between this programme, the thematic programmes and MEDA cooperation activities will be ensured. (a) Socioeconomic modernisation Safety, efficiency and interoperability of regional transport systems (shared cost, concerted actions and thematic networks) This theme targets the development of scenarios of socio- economic and transport policy reference in which the options for the economic development, the different transport policies, and the network of transport system can be enhanced. A special attention can also be given to the role of transport in the economic sustainable integration of the Mediterranean region. Specific objectives: (cid:151) research on interoperability between the Mediterranean countries and between this region and the European countries, in view to identify the regulatory obstacles and proposals for solutions, (cid:151) decision support systems for the planning of infra- structures and traffic and introduction of methods and models for evaluating the impact of transports systems on socioeconomic activity and environment, enhance the safety and efficiency of transport systems, targeting the cohesion of the various national transport systems, and their management at regional level, (cid:151) methods and criteria for identifying and for evaluating the development of transport corridors and networks in the Mediterranean within the context of the extension of the Trans-European transport networks. Thematic network dedicated to this these topics will include transport research institutions, operators and responsible authorities at the local and national levels. EN 15.3.2001 Official Journal of the European Communities C 85/17 ( 1 ) In the case of a country becoming associated to the fifth framework programme, that status will take precedence. ",
        "(b) Preserving and using cultural heritage Enabling linguistic diversity (priority shared cost and concerted actions) Language diversity in the Mediterranean area is and will remain in the foreseeable future a major challenge for information and communication systems. The renewal of the Euro-Mediterranean dialogue implies a better under- standing of each other throughout the age groups from early school to higher education level and research institutes, and thus the development of cost effective and user friendly methods and tools for cross-lingual information access, knowledge sharing and inter-personal communication. The overall objective is to turn (cid:145)language diversity(cid:146) into a priority subject for Euro-Med multidisciplinary research. This research conducted in close cooperation with the IST specific programme can only target specific Mediterranean aspects that could not be undertaken under this programme. This research should combine and integrate from a multilingual and cross-cultural perspective ongoing and upcoming efforts in areas such as: basic and value-added communications, business processes and elec- tronic commerce, education and training, cultural heritage and electronic publishing. These objectives will target the promotion and application of new approaches, standards and tools and may include where appropriate the adaptation of existing methods and techniques to Euro-Med languages. Specific objectives: (cid:151) the understanding of users\u2019 requirements from systems for multilingual information handling and the devel- opment of cross-lingual systems for digital information access, delivery and management over global networks, (cid:151) the improvement of multimedia linguistic interoper- ability between European and Semitic languages; cross- lingual/cross-cultural authoring and localisation of multimedia content, (cid:151) annotated repositories of written and spoken language data, including recording, preservation, conservation and archival work on materials relevant to the study of dialects and oral culture. (c) Promoting healthy societies (priority to shared cost actions) Research will address the new epidemiological and socioe- conomic reality, which is emerging in the Mediterranean area and will target strategies to alleviate the burden of disease on society and to support economic activity. Specific objectives: (cid:151) research on epidemiological transition and its conse- quences on health planning and sector development and on health of migrants and health of vulnerable groups, (cid:151) research on regionally specific preventative, biological and clinical aspects of important metabolic and genetic congenital disorders and research on trauma rehabili- tation, (cid:151) research in support of regional infectious disease surveillance and control in line with EU-Mediterranean collaboration activities in these domains. (d) Regional environmental sustainability Integrated policy and resource management of coastal zones (priority to shared cost actions) The aim is to develop a participatory strategic approach to planning and management of coastal areas in order to maximise their long-term contribution to socioeconomic diversification and sustainable regional development. Coastal areas are subject to an increasing diversity of demands for new opportunities to diversify local and national economies: coastal fisheries, aquaculture, wind- forms, tourism, leisure, etc. The economic imbalance between coastal and inside regions should be taken into account. Specific objectives: (cid:151) development of early warning tools and decision support systems on the equilibrium between the coastal areas\u2019 resources and inland regions. (As for example remote sensing for land use and climate impacts, airborne surveillance systems or coastal water observing buoys), (cid:151) research activities on coastal typology, monitoring and dynamics of Mediterranean countries with particular interest for estuaries and marine ecosystem protection, (cid:151) scientific research on hydromorphology, models and data collection, identifying indicators and technologies for coastal dynamics in particular for flooding, erosion or sand stabilisation, (cid:151) long-term research measuring the sustainable devel- opment in coastal areas, the impact of human activities, in particular on water quality and availability, and identi- fying potential users and beneficiaries.

        "INCO-DEV A4 (shared cost actions, concerted actions, thematic networks) RESEARCH FOR DEVELOPMENT (ACP (Africa, Caribbean, Pacific), Asia, Latin America, Gulf countries; Mediterranean partner countries (only eligible for c(i) and c(iii)) and Balkan countries (Albania, Bosnia-Herze- govina, Croatia, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) (only eligible for c(iii)) Deadline: 17.9.2001 Budget: EUR 68,5 million Call identifier: ICFP501A4PR03. Objectives and approach The objectives of the programme are: to undertake research to tackle the challenges posed to developing countries; to mobilise the strengths, expertise and resources of the European scientific community jointly with developing country research teams; and, to use RTD cooperation to support Community development cooperation policy in line with current strategy. For research on these issues to be successful, the nature of the research intervention needs to be correctly matched to the nature of the problem to be tackled. Therefore, the programme favours inter and multidisciplinary approaches in research proposals. In order to achieve this, the programme envisages an integrated scheme consisting of three levels of research: (a) policy research to determine the conditions for sustainable development, including gender issues, involving the State, market forces and civil society; (b) systems research on complex issues involving many interacting components, such as, rehabilitation and management of renewable natural resources or health care; and (c) research on specific scientific and technological problems to generate tools for sustainable development, which can be used in a particular context of system management or policy development. This three-level scheme creates unity in the programme since it can be applied to research independently of thematic area and also to cross-sectoral subjects. In the design of the programme, due importance is given to research on individual scientific or technological problems on a sectoral basis. However, it is recognised that the policy and systems backgrounds to these problems, need to be examined on a broader front. The approach thus also includes a process of thematic concentration, with policy research covering strategic sectors and representing the broadest thematic range, systems research narrowing to natural capital and the human environment, including health, and tools research focussing on specific key items. In order to guarantee quality, the programme will employ the same practical methods of operation as adopted by the FP5 thematic programmes. Developing country partnerships will be constructed on a regional basis. The programme will thus extend the scope of Community RTD to other geographical regions. Moreover, the programme will strengthen and add value to ongoing research, reduce isolation of developing country scientists, enable these to work at an international level while based in their own institutions, and provide training opportunities. The programme will complement Community development cooperation policy and therefore will not include technical assistance or other methods of operation characteristic of development aid. The priorities are continuously focused, on a regional basis, following dialogue with developing countries. Research proposals should give a high profile to training and information dissemination activities and address the coor- dination needs with existing North-South partnerships and investments committed by Member States and associated countries. (a) Policy research on the conditions for sustainable devel- opment (all regions except Mediterranean and Balkan partner countries. Priority to concerted actions and thematic networks) Research will aim to identify the socioeconomic and policy conditions and the corresponding implementation measures that favour progress in sustainable development. It will apply to public policy issues, and will involve the State, market forces and civil society. Some issues will be of broad application whilst others will be specific to a particular geographical region, ecosystem or technology application. The direct outcome will be policy options, which may be used by decision-makers to direct and influence policies. This will be achieved by looking at past policies, at the prevailing situation, and particularly at scenarios for the future. Research proposals should lead to a set of options which, without being prescriptive, will provide clear indications for decision-makers about the likely consequences of pursuing different courses of action in terms of societal objectives such as economic growth, equitability, environmental sustainability, etc. It is highly desirable that proposals should integrate partnerships of researchers with decision- makers in order to capitalise on each other\u2019s competence and viewpoint, as well as to facilitate the adoption of research results. Priorities for the year 2001 call are: (a)(i) Making the most of research: RTD in the global knowledge society The aim of this theme is to determine how to ensure effective use of the resources invested in RTD in developing countries. This means considering demand for research from users as well as supply factors, such as the often dispersed and uncoordinated sources of support to research or the relative isolation of researchers. The theme focuses on the contribution of research to: EN 15.3.2001 Official Journal of the European Communities C 85/19 ",
        "(cid:151) efficient and cost-effective RTD policies in developing countries, considering aspects such as public and private investment, regional and international coop- eration, institution-building, links to education and training, university-industry cooperation, use of mass media and telecommunications, intellectual property rights, and methodologies for impact assessment and priority-setting, (cid:151) policies for the use of innovative information society technologies in teaching and learning processes, including lifelong learning, and distance learning in the specific context of developing countries and new, existing or traditional knowledge, and information systems supporting sustainable development. (a)(iv) Promoting sustainable settlement patterns: planning, organisation, employment and rural-urban interactions In many developing countries rural migration to towns and urban growth are creating enormous conurbations where the achievement of adequate employment levels and decent living conditions presents a challenge for planning and societal organisation. These population shifts also lead to new food consumption patterns, create market oppor- tunities and place new demands on agriculture. While new settlements can be a burden on surrounding rural areas they are also a source of investment. This theme aims to explore these issues in order to contribute to the design of policies for: (cid:151) economically and environmentally sustainable urban settlements in rural areas on the periphery of cities, giving special consideration to energy, transport and how to avoid natural resource degradation in adjoining ecosystems, (cid:151) structural change in agriculture, including development of urban and peri-urban agriculture, to cope with migration to towns and evolving patterns in urban demand, (cid:151) making use of knowledge and information society tools and techniques for innovative organisation and work methods in relation to sustainable urbanisation processes, (cid:151) innovative approaches to urban and peri-urban employment creation, for example, micro-enterprises, community-based or participative actions, information society technologies, micro-credit, mini-industrial facilities or small-scale services, (cid:151) assessing the socioeconomic dynamics, patterns of savings, financial flows and new patterns of exchange associated with rural-urban migration and urban-rural investment. (b) Systems research on natural capital and the human environment, including health (all regions except Mediterranean and Balkan partner countries. Priority to shared cost actions and concerted actions) Following from the broader analysis of policy options, this activity deals with a practical approach to systems, empha- sising the relationship between human activity and the environment. (b)(ii) Managing the human environment and the rural-urban interface: health systems, water management and land use Population movement from countryside to towns, the ensuing links between these two areas and urban spread into rural areas contribute to a growing importance of the rural-urban interface. Human welfare and the environment are often casualties of the urban growth that is proceeding rapidly in all parts of the developing world. The objective of this theme is the design of systems to reduce the negative impact, contribute to human welfare and provide employment. Priorities for the year 2001 call are limited to: (b)(ii)(1) Health systems Improving health systems focusing on equitable health financing systems and inequities in the access to health care delivery, quality of care as well as development of new indicators for ascertaining efficacy of health sector reforms. In this context, attention should be given to youth, reproductive health and major infectious diseases (malaria, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS). (b)(ii)(2) Rural urban interface sustainability in water management, land use and sanitary risk: (cid:151) management systems to ensure effective use of local water resources, to ensure hygienic conditions and to prevent pollution of wetlands, coastal zones and under- ground aquifers by run-off, (cid:151) integration of small-scale agricultural systems into the urban or peri-urban environment, emphasising recycling of wastes, by-products and water, agricultural practices reducing polution by pesticides, fertilisers and heavy metals, (cid:151) sustainable systems in cities\u2019 zones of influence to provide products, such as, fuelwood, charcoal, or fodder for urban markets, and for land uses, such as domestic eco-tourism and green-belt zoning, (cid:151) prevention of sanitary risk linked to the proximity of human/animals in peri-urban area: human and animal epidemiological survey, zoonosis. (c) Tools for sustainable development (Mediterranean partner countries only eligible for parts (c)(i) and (c)(iii), and Balkan countries only eligible for part (c)(iii). Priority to shared cost actions and concerted actions) EN C 85/20 Official Journal of the European Communities 15.3.2001 ",
        "Research activities at this level focus on individual tech- nological steps, which might be of direct application or which might need combining into more complex tech- nological packages for their exploitation. In either case research should be targeted directly at significant problems, which have been identified in the context of policy or of potential application in a particular system. Proposals, which involve a multidisciplinary approach, are strongly encouraged. (c)(i) Tools for health improvement: attacking the major infectious diseases The challenges posed by the major infectious diseases (malaria, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS) and their links to poverty call for scaling-up and refocusing of the R & D efforts towards new tools to control diseases and improve case management. The proposals should be aiming at control and case management of the major diseases linked to poverty such as malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS. While the focus of the call is on these three diseases, other major gastro- intestinal, respiratory and vector-borne infections will be considered if their causative links to poverty in the region of research are clearly demonstrated. Priorities for the year 2001 call are: Clinical evaluation of: (cid:151) new vaccines and drugs for treatment and prevention, (cid:151) new drug combinations and immuno-therapy, (cid:151) other interventions based on new understandings of vector biology and disease physiopathology. Projects should address those issues in the fields of biological, epidemiological, clinical and social sciences as well as ethics with a view to enable researchers and research institutions in developing countries to organise and conduct population trials. Operational research projects addressing ways to improve delivery of inter- ventions are eligible for funding under thematic network schemes. (c)(iii) Market-oriented products and services in agro-food: adding value and meeting consumer demand Evolving European legislation and consumer demand, such as, health considerations, diet change resulting from urban living, desire for choice, particular quality and sanitary requirements as well as export specifications raise many issues for food-processing and biosafety research. Moreover, processing and adding value to raw materials is an area of interest for industry, including SMEs, and offers opportunities for employment creation. The theme concen- trates on the following issues, which should be tackled on a processing chain basis, including information systems on markets: (cid:151) processing technologies mainly targeting SMEs for adding value, increasing transportability to markets, lengthening shelf-life, total quality assurance or labelling (eco and origin, genuine foods), (cid:151) development of risk assessment methods for new (agro-food and bio) technologies considering consumer health and environment, (cid:151) developing appropriate quality standards, hygienic and aesthetic, according to the handling and processing methods used. (c)(iv) Safe and efficient water management: low-investment and ecologically suited environmental technologies for use, decontamination and recycling Rising population, industrialisation and urbanisation are just some of the processes in competition for water, which at its extreme can lead to conflict. Contamination can aggravate this process by rendering scarce resources useless or a health hazard. The challenge is to increase efficiency in the water chain and to provide the necessary inputs for the design of policies to ensure the best use of the resource. Priorities are the development of: (cid:151) viable technologies for treatment of wastewater from urban and rural settlements and from processing agri- cultural products to promote hygiene and to permit adequate reuse, (cid:151) techniques for monitoring, analysing dynamics and assessing impact on watersheds of water pollutants of urban, agricultural, geological or mining origin.
