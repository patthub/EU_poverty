        "11251/1/20 REV 1 MG/CF/evt 5 ANNEX ECOMP.3.B. EN (2a) The Programme should contribute to increasing public and private investment in R&I in Member States, thereby helping to reach an overall investment of at least 3% of the Union\u2019s GDP in research and development. The achievement of the target will require Member States and the private sector to complement the Programme with their own and reinforced investment actions in research, development and innovation. (3) To help realise Union policy objectives, activities supported under this Programe should, where relevant, take advantage of and inspire innovation-friendly regulation, in line with the innovation principle 6 , 7 , to support the faster and more intensive transformation of the Union's substantial knowledge assets into innovation. (4) The general principles of Open Science, Open Innovation, Open to the World should be adhered to the implementation of the entire Programme, as widely as possible. These principles should ensure excellence and impact of the Union's investment in research and innovation. 6 Better Regulation, Research and Innovation toolbox, https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/file_import/better-regulation-toolbox-21_en_0.pdf 7 Commission Communication of 15 May 2018 'A renewed European Agenda for Research and Innovation - Europe's chance to shape its future' (COM(2018)306).

Provisions should be laid down to ensure that beneficiaries provide open access to peer-reviewed scientific publications. Likewise it should be ensured that beneficiaries provide open access to research data following the principle \u201cas open as possible, as closed as necessary\u201d and allowing exceptions for valid reasons relating to data protection rules and security interests as well as intellectual property rights, European Union global economic competitiveness and other legitimate interests. More emphasis should in particular be given to the responsible management of research data, which should comply with the FAIR principles of \u2018Findability\u2019, \u2018Accessibility\u2019, \u2018Interoperability\u2019 and \u2018Reusability\u2019, notably through the mainstreaming of Data Management Plans. Where appropriate, beneficiaries should make use of the possibilities offered by the European Open Science Cloud and adhere to further open science principles and practices. (6) The conception and design of the Programme should respond to the need for establishing a critical mass of supported activities, throughout the EU and through international cooperation, in line with the UN 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Programme implementation should reinforce the pursuit of these goals and the commitment of the EU and its Member States to implementing the 2030 Agenda and to achieving sustainable development in its three dimensions \u2013 economic, social and environmental \u2013 in a coherent and integrated manner. (7) Activities supported under the Programme should contribute towards the achievement of the Union's objectives and priorities, the monitoring and assessment of progress against those objectives and priorities and for the development of revised or new priorities. (7a) The Programme shall ensure transparency and accountability of public funding in research and innovation projects, thereby preserving the public interest. ",
        "11251/1/20 REV 1 MG/CF/evt 7 ANNEX ECOMP.3.B. EN (7b) The Programme should support research and innovation activities in the field of social sciences and humanities (SSH). This entails advancing scientific knowledge in this domain, but also making use of insights and progress from SSH to increase the economic and societal impact of the programme. Under the Global Challenges and European Industrial Competitiveness, the social sciences and humanities will be fully integrated across all clusters. Beyond the promotion of SSH in projects, the integration of social sciences and humanities should also be supported through the inclusion, whenever appropriate, in expert committees and evaluation panels of independent experts from fields in the social sciences and humanities, and timely monitoring and reporting of social sciences and humanities in funded research actions. In particular the level of mainstreaming of SSH will be monitored across the Programme. (8) The Programme should maintain a balanced approach between research and innovation, as well as between bottom-up (investigator or innovator driven) and top-down (determined by strategically defined priorities) funding, according to the nature of the research and innovation communities that are engaged, the types and purpose of the activities carried out and the impacts that are sought. The mix of these factors should determine the choice of approach for the respective parts of the Programme, all of which contribute to all of the Programme\u2019s general and specific objectives. (8a) The Programme should support all stages of research and innovation especially within collaborative projects, also in missions and partnerships as appropriate. Fundamental research is an essential asset and an important condition for increasing the Union\u2019s ability to attract the best scientists in order to become a global hub of excellence. The balance between basic and applied research should be ensured. Coupled with innovation, this will support the Union\u2019s economic competitiveness, growth and jobs. ",
        "11251/1/20 REV 1 MG/CF/evt 8 ANNEX ECOMP.3.B. EN (8b) Evidence shows that embracing diversity \u2014 in all senses \u2014 is key to doing good science, as science benefits from diversity. Diversity and inclusiveness contribute to excellence in collaborative research and innovation: collaboration across disciplines, sectors and throughout the European Research Area makes for better research and higher quality project proposals, can lead to higher rates of societal take-up, and can foster the benefits of innovation, thus advancing Europe. (8c) A Fast Track to Research and Innovation procedure may be applied to allow a faster, bottom- up access to funds for small collaborative consortia covering actions from fundamental research to market application. (8d) In order to maximise the impact of Horizon Europe, particular consideration should be given to multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches. (8e) In view of achieving the objectives of this Programme and whilst respecting the principle of excellence, the Programme should aim to strengthen, among others, collaborative links in Europe, thereby contributing to reducing the R&I divide. (8f) Excellence Initiatives should aim to strengthen research and innovation excellence in the eligible countries, including for instance supporting training to improve R&I managerial skills, prizes, strengthening innovation ecosystems as well as the creation of R&I networks, including on the basis of research infrastructures financed by the EU. Applicants need to clearly show that projects are linked with national and/or regional R&I strategies to be able to apply for funding under the \"Widening participation and spreading excellence\" strand of the \"Widening participation and strengthening the European Research Area\" part of Horizon Europe.

        "11251/1/20 REV 1 MG/CF/evt 9 ANNEX ECOMP.3.B. EN (9) Research activities carried out under the pillar 'Excellent Science' should be determined according to the needs and opportunities of science and promote scientific excellence. The research agenda should be set in close liaison with the scientific community and include emphasis on attracting new R&I talents, early stage researchers, while strengthening the ERA, avoiding brain drain and promoting brain circulation. (9a) The Programme should support the Union and its Member States to take into account the reality of very intense international competition for attracting best brains and skills. (10) The pillar 'Global Challenges and European Industrial Compet itiveness\u201d ' should be established through clusters of research and innovation activities, in order to maximise integration across the respective thematic areas while securing high and sustainable levels of excellence and impact in relation to the resources that are expended. It will encourage cross- disciplinary, cross-sectoral, cross-policy and cross-border collaboration in pursuit of the Sustainable Development Goals by following the principles of the Agenda 2030, the Paris Agreement and the competitiveness of the Union's industries therein. The organisation of high-ambition, wide-scale initiatives in the form of research and innovation missions will enable the programme to achieve a transformative and systemic impact for society in support of the Sustainable Development Goals, also through international cooperation and science diplomacy.

EN (11) Full and timely engagement of industry in the Programme, of all types from the individual entrepreneur and small and medium-sized enterprises to large scale enterprises, should constitute one of the main channels through which the Programme's objectives are to be realised, specifically towards the creation of sustainable jobs and growth. Such engagement by industry should see its participation in the actions supported at levels at least commensurate with those under the previous framework programme Horizon 2020 established by Regulation (EU) No 1291/2013 of the European Parliament and the Council 8 ('Horizon 2020'). (11a) The Programme\u2019s actions should provide i mportant contributions to unlock the potential of Europe\u2019s strategic sectors, including Key Enabling Technologies reflecting the EU Industrial Policy Strategy objectives 9 . (11b) Multi-stakeholders consultations, including civil society and industry, should contribute to the perspectives and priorities established through the strategic planning process. This should result in periodic Strategic R&I Plans adopted by means of implementing acts for preparing the content of work programmes. (11c) The work programme should take into account the outcome of specific previous projects and the state of science, technology and innovation at national, Union and international level and of relevant policy, market and societal developments, for a particular action to be funded. 8 Regulation (EU) No 1291/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2013 establishing Horizon 2020 - the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2014-2020) and repealing Decision No 1982/2006/EC, ( OJ L 347, 20.12.2013, p.104). 9 ",
        "11251/1/20 REV 1 MG/CF/evt 11 ANNEX ECOMP.3.B. EN (12) It is important to support the Union's industry to stay or become world leader in innovation, digitisation and climate neutrality, notably through investments in key enabling technologies that will underpin tomorrow's business. The Programme's actions should address market failures or sub-optimal investment situations, to boost investments in a proportionate and transparent manner, without duplicating or crowding out private financing and have a clear European added value and public return on investments. This will ensure consistency between the actions of the programme and EU State aid rules, avoiding undue distortions of competition in the internal market. (13) The Programme should support research and innovation in an integrated manner, respecting all relevant provisions of the World Trade Organisation. The concept of research, including experimental development should be used in accordance with the Frascati Manual developed by the OECD, whereas the concept of innovation should be used in accordance with the Oslo Manual developed by the OECD and Eurostat, following a broad approach that covers social innovation. The OECD definitions regarding Technological Readiness Level (TRL) should continue, as in the previous Framework Programme Horizon 2020, to be taken into account in the classification of technological research, product development and demonstration activities, and in the definition of types of action available in calls for proposals. Grants should not be awarded for actions where activities go above TRL 8. The work programme for a given call under the pillar 'Global Challenges and European Industrial Competitiveness' could allow grants for large-scale product validation and market replication. (13a) Without prejudice to the overall MFF negotiations, Horizon Europe will contribute to space objectives at a level of spending that is at least commensurate proportionally with that under the previous framework programme Horizon 2020 established by Regulation (EU) No 1291/2013 of the European Parliament and the Council.

Those recommendations include to propose measures to promote brain circulation and facilitate openness of R&I networks to invest more ambitiously in order to reach critical mass and maximise impact; to support breakthrough innovation; to prioritise Union research and innovation (R&I) investments in areas of high added value, notably through mission-orientation, full, well-informed and timely citizen involvement and wide communication; to rationalise the Union funding landscape in order to fully use the R&I potential of the Union, including by streamlining the range of partnership initiatives and co- funding schemes; the development of more and concrete synergies between different Union funding instruments, notably by overcoming non-complementary intervention logics and complexity of the various funding and also with the aim of helping to mobilise under- exploited R&I potential across the Union; to strengthen international cooperation and reinforce openness to third countries' participation; and to continue simplification based on implementation experiences from Horizon 2020. (15) The Programme should seek synergies with other Union programmes, from their design and strategic planning, to project selection, management, communication, dissemination and exploitation of results, to monitoring, auditing and governance. Regarding funding for R&I activities, synergies should allow for harmonization of cost eligibility rules as much as possible. With a view to avoiding overlaps and duplication and increasing the leverage of Union funding, transfers from other Union programmes to Horizon Europe activities can take place. In such cases such funds will follow Horizon Europe rules. ",

Such additional resources should be used in such a way as to ensure compliance with the time limits provided for in Regulation [ERI]. 10 Such additional resources should exclusively be allocated to actions for research and innovation directed at addressing the consequences of the COVID-19 crisis, notably its economic, social and societal impact (16) In order to achieve the greatest possible impact of Union funding and the most effective contribution to the Union's policy objectives, the Union should, where appropriate, enter into European Partnerships with private and/or public sector partners. Such partners include industry, universities, research organisations, bodies with a public service mission at local, regional, national or international level, or civil society organisations including foundations and NGOs that support and/or carry out research and innovation, provided that desired impacts can be achieved more effectively in partnership than by the Union alone. (16a) It should be possible, that depending on the Member State\u2019s decision, the contributions fro m programmes co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund+ (ESF+), the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) are considered as a contribution of the participating Member State for the purpose of Horizon Europe. However, this does not prejudge the need to comply with all provisions applicable to these contributions as set out in the [new Common Provisions Regulation] and the fund-specific regulations and in particular the need to comply with provisions setting out the co-financing requirements and management and control systems. 10 Commission proposal (COM (2020) 459) amending the Horizon Europe Regulation.

Activities carried out within the FET Flagships on Graphene, the Human Brain Project and Quantum Technology, which are supported under Horizon 2020, will continue being supported under Horizon Europe through calls for proposals included in the work programme. Preparatory actions supported under the FET Flagships part of Horizon 2020 will feed the Strategic Planning process under Horizon Europe and inform the work on missions, co-funded/co- programmed partnerships and regular calls for proposals. (18) The Joint Research Centre (JRC) should continue to provide Union policies with independent customer-driven scientific evidence and technical support throughout the whole policy cycle. The direct actions of the JRC should be implemented in a flexible, efficient and transparent manner, taking into account the needs of Union policies and the relevant needs of the users of the JRC, and ensuring the protection of the financial interests of the Union. The JRC should continue to generate additional resources. 11 See e.g. the Commission's proposal for a regulation establishing a framework for screening Foreign Direct Investment into the EU (COM (2017)487).

EN (19) The pillar 'Innovative Europe' should establish a series of measures for integrated support to the needs of entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship aiming at realising and accelerating breakthrough innovation for rapid market growth. It should provide a \"one-stop shop\" to attract and support all types of innovators and innovative companies, such as SMEs, including start-ups and in exceptional cases small mid-caps, with potential for scaling up at international and at Union level and offer fast, flexible grants and co-investments, including with private investors. These objectives should be pursued through the creation of a European Innovation Council (EIC). This Pillar should also support the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) and European innovation ecosystems at large, notably through co-funding partnerships with national and regional innovation support actors. (19a) Within the meaning of this Regulation and in particular for the activities carried out under the EIC, a start-up is an SME in the early stage in its life cycle (including university spin- offs), which aims at innovative solutions and a scalable business model, and which is autonomous within the meaning of Article 3 of the Annex of Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC 12 ; and a 'mid-cap' means a company that is not a micro, small- and medium- sized enterprise as defined in Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC and that has a number of employees between 250 and 3000 where the staff headcount is calculated in accordance with Articles 3, 4, 5, and 6 of Title I of the Annex of that Recommendation; a small mid-cap is a mid-cap that has a number of employees up to 499. (20) The policy objectives of this Programme will be also addressed through financial instruments and budgetary guarantee of the InvestEU Fund, notably the Research, Innovation and Digitalisation as well as the SMEs policy windows. 12 Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC of 6 May 2003 concerning the definition of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (OJ L 124, 20.5.2003, p. 36).

        "11251/1/20 REV 1 MG/CF/evt 16 ANNEX ECOMP.3.B. EN (21) The EIC, together with other parts of the Horizon Europe, should stimulate all forms of innovation ranging from incremental to breakthrough and disruptive innovation targeting especially market-creating innovation. The EIC through its instruments \u2013 Pathfinder and Accelerator \u2013 should aim to identify, develop and deploy high risk innovations of all kinds including incremental with a main focus on breakthrough, disruptive and deep-tech innovations that have the potential to become market-creating innovations. Through coherent and streamlined support, the EIC should fill the current vacuum in public support and private investment for breakthrough innovation. The instruments of the EIC call for dedicated legal and management features in order to reflect its objectives, in particular market deployment activities. (22) The EIC Accelerator will bridge the \u201cvalley of death\u201d between research, pre -mass commercialisation and the scaling-up of companies. The Accelerator will provide support to high-potential operations presenting such technological/scientific, financial, management and/or market risks that they are not yet considered as bankable and therefore cannot leverage significant investments from the market, hence complementing the InvestEU programme established by Regulatio n \u2026 13 which will support innovative but bankable projects and entities. (22a) In close synergy with InvestEU, the EIC Accelerator, in its blended finance and equity financial support forms, should finance SMEs, including start-ups, and, in exceptional cases, projects run by small mid-caps, which are either not yet able to generate revenues, or not yet profitable, or not yet able to attract sufficient investments to implement fully their projects' business plan. Such eligible entities will be considered as non-bankable, while a part of their investment needs could have been or could be provided by one or several investors such as a private or public bank, a family office, a venture capital fund, a business angel, etc. In this way, overcoming a market failure, the EIC Accelerator will finance promising but not yet bankable entities carrying out breakthrough market creating innovation projects. Once they will become bankable, those projects may, in a later stage of their development, be financed under InvestEU. 13 ",

EN (22b) While blended finance should be the main use of the EIC Accelerator budget, for the purpose of article 43, the grant-only support of the EIC Accelerator to SMEs, including start-ups, should correspond to that under the SME instrument budget of the previous Framework Programme Horizon 2020 established by Regulation (EU) n\u00b0 1291/2013 of the European Parliament and the Council. 14 (23) The EIT, primarily through its Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), should aim at strengthening innovation ecosystems that tackle global challenges, by fostering the integration of innovation, research, higher education and entrepreneurship. In line with its founding act, the EIT Regulation and its Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda, the EIT should foster innovation in its activities and should significantly step up its support to the integration of higher education within the innovation ecosystem, in particular by: stimulating entrepreneurial education, fostering strong non-disciplinary collaborations between industry and academia; and identifying prospective skills for future innovators to address global challenges, which includes advanced digital and innovation skills. Support schemes provided by the EIT should benefit to EIC beneficiaries, while start-ups emerging from EIT KICs should have access to EIC actions. While the EIT\u2019s focus on innovation ecosystems should make it naturally fit within the pillar 'Innovative Europe', it should also support the other pillars, as appropriate. (24) Ensuring and preserving a level playing field for companies that compete in a given market should be a key requirement for breakthrough innovation to flourish thereby enabling in particular small and medium-size innovators to reap the benefits of their investment and to capture a share of the market. 14 A Commission declaration is expected to be published in the OJ C one the final text of the Regulation is adopted ",

International cooperation should aim to strengthen the Union's research and innovation excellence, attractiveness and economic and industrial competitiveness, to tackle global challenges, including the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by following the principles of the Agenda 2030 and the Paris agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and to support the Union's external policies. An approach of general opening for international participation and targeted international cooperation actions should be followed, including through appropriate eligibility for funding of entities established in low to middle income countries. At the same time, association of third countries, in particular for collaborative parts to the Programme, should be promoted, in line with association agreements and focusing on the added value for the Union. When allocating the associated countries' financial contributions to the Programme, the Commission should take into account the level of participation of legal entities of these countries in the different components of the Programme.

It should do so across the Programme and through dedicated activities in the part 'Widening participation and strengthening the European Research Area'. The engagement of citizens and civil society in research and innovation should be coupled with public outreach activities to generate and sustain public support for the Programme. The programme should also seek to remove barriers and boost synergies between science, technology, culture and the arts to obtain a new quality of sustainable innovation. The measures taken to improve the involvement of citizens and civil society in the supported projects should be monitored.

The use of unit costs for internally invoiced goods and services calculated in accordance with the usual accounting practices of the beneficiaries combining actual direct costs and indirect costs should be an option which could be chosen by all beneficiaries. In this respect, beneficiaries should be able to include actual indirect costs calculated on the basis of allocation keys in such unit costs for internally invoiced goods and services.

        "11251/1/20 REV 1 MG/CF/evt 114 ANNEX ECOMP.3.B. EN ANNEX Ia EUROPEAN INSTITUTE OF INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY (EIT) The following shall apply in the implementation of the programme activities of the EIT: 3.1. Rationale As the report of the High Level Group on maximising the impact of EU research and innovation (the Lamy High Level Group) clearly states, the way forward is 'to educate for the future and invest in people who will make the change'. In particular, European higher education institutions are called to stimulate entrepreneurship, tear down disciplinary borders and institutionalise strong inter- disciplinary academia-industry collaborations. According to recent surveys, access to talented people is by far the most important factor influencing the location choices of European founders of start-ups. Entrepreneurship education, training opportunities and the development of creative skills play a key role in cultivating future innovators and in developing the abilities of existing ones to grow their business to greater levels of success. Access to entrepreneurial talent, together with access to professional services, capital and markets on the EU level, and bringing key innovation actors together around a common goal are key ingredients for nurturing an innovation ecosystem. There is a need to coordinate efforts across the EU.in order to create a critical mass of interconnected EU-wide entrepreneurial clusters and ecosystems. The EIT is today\u2019s Europe\u2019s largest integrated innovation ecosystem which brings together partners from business, research, education and beyond. The EIT will continue to support its Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), which are large-scale European partnerships addressing specific global challenges, and strengthen the innovation ecosystems around them. It will do so by fostering the integration of education, research and innovation of the highest standards, thereby creating environments conducive to innovation, and by promoting and supporting a new generation of entrepreneurs and stimulating the creation of innovative companies in close synergy and complementarity with the EIC. ",
        "11251/1/20 REV 1 MG/CF/evt 115 ANNEX ECOMP.3.B. EN Throughout Europe, efforts are still needed to develop ecosystems where researchers, innovators, industries and governments can easily interact. Innovation ecosystems, in fact, still do not work optimally due to a number of reasons such as: \u2013 Interaction among innovation players is still hampered by organizational, regulatory and cultural barriers between them; \u2013 Efforts to strengthen innovation ecosystems shall benefit from coordination and a clear focus on specific objectives and impact. To address future societal challenges, embrace the opportunities of new technologies and contribute to environmentally friendly and sustainable economic growth, jobs, competitiveness and the well- being of Europe\u2019s citizens, there is the need to further strengthen Europe\u2019s capacity to innovate by: strenghtening existing and fostering the creation of new environments conducive to collaboration and innovation; strengthening the innovation capabilities of academia and the research sector; supporting a new generation of entrepreneurial people; stimulating the creation and the development of innovative ventures, as well as strengthening the visibility and recognition of EU funded research and innovation activities, in particular the EIT funding to the wider public. The nature and scale of the innovation challenges require liaising and mobilising players and resources at European scale, by fostering cross-border collaboration. There is a need to break down silos between disciplines and along value chains and nurture the establishment of a favorable environment for an effective exchange of knowledge and expertise, and for the development and attraction of entrepreneurial talents. The Strategic Innovation Agenda of the EIT shall ensure coherence with the challenges of Horizon Europe, as well as complimentarity to the EIC. ",
