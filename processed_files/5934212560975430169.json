        "STRESSING: 1. Culture\u2019s contribution to smart growth The CCIs are a major source of employment potential. In the last decade overall employment in the CCIs increased three times comparing to the employment growth in the EU economy as a whole ( 1 ). They are also a driver for creativity and non-technological innovation throughout the economy, producing high-quality and competitive services and goods. Finally, through relevant links with education, culture can effectively contribute to the training of a skilled and adaptable workforce, thus complementing economic performance. 2. Culture\u2019s contribution to sustainable growth Culture can contribute to sustainable growth through fostering greener mobility and the use of cutting edge sustainable tech\u00ad nologies, including digitisation which assures the online avail\u00ad ability of cultural content. Artists and the cultural sector as a whole can play a crucial role in changing people\u2019s attitudes to the environment. 3. Culture\u2019s contribution to inclusive growth Culture can contribute to inclusive growth through promoting intercultural dialogue in full respect for cultural diversity. Cultural activities and programmes can strengthen social cohesion and community development as well as enable indi\u00ad viduals or a community to fully engage in the social, cultural and economic life; INVITES MEMBER STATES TO: \u2014 take into consideration the cross-cutting character of culture when formulating relevant policies and national reform programmes regarding the achievement of the targets of the Europe 2020 strategy and to share good practices in relation to the tools and methodologies to measure the contribution of culture to these targets; \u2014 strengthen the synergies and promote partnerships between education, culture, research institutions and the business sector at national, regional and local levels with special regard to talent nurturing and the skills and competences necessary for creative activities; \u2014 make use of EU financial instruments \u2014 in particular Structural Funds \u2014 to recognise the potential of culture and CCIs as drivers for development in regions and cities and, where appropriate, to integrate them into smart special\u00ad isation strategies ( 2 ); \u2014 encourage, in order to promote sustainable development, sustainable and green technologies in the processes of production and distribution of cultural goods and services and to support artists and the cultural sector in raising awareness of sustainable development issues through inter alia non-formal and informal educational activities; \u2014 explore the role of tangible and intangible cultural heritage in community development and in promoting active citi\u00ad zenship and take it into consideration when drawing up relevant local and regional development strategies; \u2014 respond to the training needs and capacity-building priorities of the specialised institutions and professionals that carry out effective socio-cultural work; \u2014 consider the capacity development needs in public cultural organisations in order to enable them to deliver suitable services, with special regard to their socio-cultural functions; INVITES THE COMMISSION TO: \u2014 consider, without prejudice to the upcoming negotiations on the new multiannual financial framework, how its proposals for future EU policy and financial instruments can fully take into account the contribution of culture to the targets of the Europe 2020 strategy; \u2014 pursue the cooperation between all relevant Commission services in order to emphasise the role of culture in the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy and ensure that it is reflected in relevant policies, guidelines and governance arrangements; INVITES THE MEMBER STATES AND THE COMMISSION, WITHIN THEIR RESPECTIVE COMPETENCES, TO: \u2014 deploy the statistical framework being developed by ESSnet culture with a view to producing reliable, comparable and up-to-date information on the social and economic impact of culture and work on future priorities on the basis of recommendations issued by ESSnet-culture; \u2014 build upon the results contained in the Commission Staff Working Document referred to above and seize the oppor\u00ad tunity of the European Creative Industries Alliance in order to strengthen the CCIs, in particular SMEs and micro-enter\u00ad prises, and explore new ways to further increase their own innovation capacity as well as their capacity to boost inno\u00ad vation in other sectors; EN C 175/2 Official Journal of the European Union 15.6.2011 ( 1 ) European Competitiveness Report 2010, SEC(2010) 1276 final.

        "Council conclusions on mobility information services for artists and for culture professionals (2011/C 175/02) THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, HAVING REGARD TO: \u2014 the Culture Programme 2007-2013 ( 1 ) and its specific objective on transnational mobility of artists and culture professionals; \u2014 the Resolution of the Council of 16 November 2007 on a European Agenda for Culture ( 2 ), according to which mobility of artists and culture professionals makes a funda\u00ad mental contribution to achieving its strategic objectives; \u2014 the Council Conclusions of 21 May 2008 on the Work Plan for Culture 2008-2010 ( 3 ) and notably priority 1, \u2018Improving the conditions for the mobility of artists and other professionals in the cultural field\u2019; \u2014 the Council Conclusions of 18 November 2010 on the Work Plan for Culture 2011-2014 ( 4 ) and notably priority area C, \u2018Skills and mobility\u2019; \u2014 the Unesco Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions of 20 October 2005 ( 5 ) to which the EU and its many Member States are parties; they are hence committed to ensuring that artists, culture professionals and citizens worldwide can create, produce, disseminate and enjoy a broad range of cultural activities, goods and services, including their own; REFERRING TO: \u2014 the Commission Staff Working Document \u2018Analysis of the consultation launched by the Green Paper on \u201cUnlocking the potential of cultural and creative industries\u201d \u2019, and notably the chapter on mobility and circulation ( 6 ), stressing that many contributors commented on regulatory, legal and other issues impacting on mobility and called for the provision of information on those issues; \u2014 the European Parliament pilot project for artist mobility dedicated to supporting the environment for the mobility of artists, including the study on information systems ( 7 ); \u2014 the June 2010 report of the open method of coordination working group on the mobility of artists and culture profes\u00ad sionals and notably its recommendations on mobility information provision for artists and culture professionals, including the guidelines for Mobility Information Services ( 8 ); WHEREAS: \u2014 the mobility of artists and culture professionals in Europe is crucial to enhance cultural and linguistic diversity and inter\u00ad cultural dialogue. This deserves to be actively promoted by the European Union and its Member States; \u2014 the mobility of artists and culture professionals promotes creative encounters as well as production and exchange of cultural goods and services; \u2014 mobility reinforces a sense of belonging to the European Union and deeper knowledge of our common cultures; \u2014 mobility is important to the full functioning of the European labour market in accordance with the Treaties. More active and efficient use of the possibilities inherent to the single market can create new jobs and work oppor\u00ad tunities for artists and culture professionals and thereby promote employment in the culture sector and the wider economy; \u2014 cultural and artistic work is increasingly taking place in international contexts in which opportunities for work, touring, residencies, cooperation, co-production, career development, training and peer learning frequently arise beyond national borders; \u2014 more and better mobility can contribute to achieving the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, namely smart, sustainable and inclusive growth ( 9 ); EN 15.6.2011 Official Journal of the European Union C 175/5 ( 1 ) OJ L 372, 27.12.2006, p. 1.

        "\u2014 resolving administrative and regulatory issues that can create barriers to mobility of artists and culture professionals is usually beyond the remit of the culture authorities; therefore networking and cooperation between several services at European, national, regional and local level is important; \u2014 one of the main obstacles cited by artists and culture profes\u00ad sionals seeking to be mobile within the EU is the difficulty of obtaining accurate and comprehensive information and advice on mobility-related issues; CALLS ON THE MEMBER STATES AND THE COMMISSION, WITHIN THEIR RESPECTIVE SPHERES OF COMPETENCE AND WITH DUE REGARD TO THE PRINCIPLE OF SUBSIDIARITY, TO: \u2014 facilitate the provision by mobility information services of comprehensive and accurate information to artists and culture professionals seeking to be mobile within the EU. To this end, make best use of expertise within public admin\u00ad istration and cultural sector organisations. Where appro\u00ad priate, build on existing services to disseminate the information, acknowledging that in some cases these are the primary source of accurate information. For this purpose, mobility information services are understood to be services providing information to artists and culture professionals seeking to be mobile within the EU. The target group of mobility information services is understood to be incoming, residing and outgoing artists and culture professionals. The community of \u2018artists and culture profes\u00ad sionals\u2019 includes all artistic, managerial, logistic, communication and other professionals in the cultural sector and in artistic professions which are exercised in other sectors ( 1 ). In addition to individual artists and culture professionals, operators include in particular groups, ensembles and organi\u00ad sations. Since a number of the artists living and working in Europe are third-country nationals, special attention could be paid to their specific needs. In this context, mobility information services are defined by common quality standards, agreed information topics and strategic partnerships. The quality standards define a common voluntary commitment from all stakeholders involved in the (network of) mobility information service(s) in order to ensure high quality information to the users. It is envisaged that the common minimum information content available would consist of topics covering regulatory, adminis\u00ad trative and other issues concerning mobility such as social security, taxation, intellectual property rights, visas and work permits, insurance and customs, and recognition of professional qualifications. In addition, information on funding and training opportunities could also be provided. Strategic partnerships are needed to guarantee the quality of information in the abovementioned areas. Bodies concerned may include inter alia EU, national and regional authorities, cultural institutions, employers\u2019 and employees\u2019 associations, and training establishments; TO PROMOTE THE MOST EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE FUNCTIONING OF INFORMATION SERVICES FOR ARTISTS AND CULTURE PROFES\u00ad SIONALS, THE FOLLOWING SHOULD APPLY: \u2014 peer learning and training opportunities for information providers should be fostered in order to develop a good understanding of the working and living conditions of artists and culture professionals and to build up knowledge of relevant national and EU regulations and procedures. This will help ensure that information providers can fully direct users toward information on national and EU rules and regulations, procedures, rights and obligations; \u2014 networking between information providers is essential in order to ensure that providers in different Member States can enter into contact to help their \u2018home\u2019 artists and culture professionals obtain the information they are seeking on regulations and conditions in \u2018destination\u2019 Member States. Networking also provides opportunities for capacity building and peer learning. For the system to work well, it is essential that information providers in all Member States are involved; \u2014 basic data on the use of mobility information services should be collected in order to improve the quality and accessibility of these services. Recurrent and structural issues relating to regulations and their applications should be reported to the competent national administrations and to the relevant European Commission services in order to improve mobility conditions in the longer term; TO THIS END, THE COMMISSION IS INVITED TO: \u2014 establish an expert working group, as set out in the Work Plan for Culture 2011-2014, to propose common content and quality standards for information and advice services to artists and culture professionals seeking to be mobile within the EU. The group will identify the detailed topics and content guidelines for mobility information services, EN C 175/6 Official Journal of the European Union 15.6.2011 ( 1 ) The broader group of culture professionals includes, e.g. curators, directors and staff of cultural institutions, technicians, stage building workers, ICT experts, communication specialists, etc. ",
        "including information for third-country nationals. The June 2010 report of the open method of coordination working group on the mobility of artists and culture professionals, including the guidelines for Mobility Information Services, will form the basis of the consideration in the expert group\u2019s work; \u2014 without prejudice to the discussions on the future multi\u00ad annual Financial Framework, explore financial support for information services aimed at artists and culture profes\u00ad sionals seeking to be mobile when developing its proposals for future programmes; \u2014 disseminate mobility information through EU platforms ( 1 ) and direct enquiries to specialised Member State or cultural sector services capable of providing comprehensive and accurate mobility information and assistance to artists and culture professionals; MEMBER STATES ARE INVITED TO: \u2014 adopt, on the basis of inter alia the proposal of the expert working group mentioned above, common minimum content and quality standards when establishing or further developing mobility information services for artists and culture professionals and to fill gaps in existing national information services where necessary; \u2014 building on national structures and traditions ensure that mobility information services are neutral and as cost- effective, flexible and user focused as possible; \u2014 identify tools for the public dissemination of mobility information to artists and culture professionals, making use where appropriate of existing services; \u2014 provide their national information which is relevant to the mobility of artists and culture professionals on an internet multilingual website if possible. Translation, including automatic one, should be encouraged in order to promote multilingualism, make information easily accessible and facilitate mobility projects; MEMBER STATES AND THE COMMISSION ARE INVITED TO: \u2014 work in close cooperation to encourage networking between mobility information services at European level, thus improving information provision to artists and culture professionals seeking to be mobile within the EU, building on existing information and advice partnerships, including those with the cultural sector, and further developing these where appropriate; \u2014 monitor the provision of mobility information services in order to improve the quality and accessibility of these services.

        "Council conclusions on early childhood education and care: providing all our children with the best start for the world of tomorrow (2011/C 175/03) THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, HAVING REGARD TO: \u2014 the conclusions of the Council and of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States, meeting within the Council, of 14 November 2006 on efficiency and equity in education and training ( 1 ); \u2014 the conclusions of the Council and of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States, meeting within the Council, of 21 November 2008 on preparing young people for the 21st century: an agenda for European cooperation on schools ( 2 ); \u2014 the Council conclusions of 12 May 2009 on a strategic framework for European cooperation in education and training (ET 2020) ( 3 ); \u2014 the Council conclusions of 26 November 2009 on the education of children with a migrant background ( 4 ); \u2014 the Council conclusions of 11 May 2010 on the social dimension of education and training ( 5 ). RECALLING THAT: improving the efficiency and equity of education and training systems at all levels \u2014 from the early years through to adulthood \u2014 has a fundamental role to play in achieving the Europe 2020 goals of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth ( 6 ). REAFFIRMING THAT: while responsibility for the organisation and content of education and training systems rests with the individual Member States, cooperation at European level via the open method of coordination, together with the efficient use of EU programmes, can contribute to the development of quality education and training by supporting and complementing measures taken at national level and helping Member States to address common challenges. AND IN THE LIGHT OF: the Presidency conference on \u2018Excellence and equity in early childhood education and care\u2019, held in Budapest on 21- 22 February 2011, which emphasised the need to combine the quantitative and qualitative dimensions of early childhood education and care, and of the communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions \u2014 \u2018An EU agenda for the rights of the child\u2019 ( 7 ). TAKES NOTE OF the Commission communication \u2014 \u2018Early childhood education and care: providing all our children with the best start for the world of tomorrow\u2019 ( 8 ). RECOGNISES THAT: 1. high quality early childhood education and care (ECEC) ( 9 ) provides a wide range of short- and long-term benefits for both individuals and society at large. Complementing the central role of the family, ECEC lays the essential foun\u00ad dations for language acquisition, successful lifelong learning, social integration, personal development and employability. If solid foundations are laid during a child\u2019s formative years, later learning becomes more effective and more likely to continue throughout life, increasing the equity of educational outcomes and lowering the costs for society in terms of lost talent and public spending on welfare, health and even justice; 2. high quality ECEC is beneficial for all children, but particularly for those with a socioeconomically disad\u00ad vantaged, migrant or Roma background, or with special educational needs, including disabilities. By helping to close the achievement gap and supporting cognitive, linguistic, social and emotional development, it can help to break the cycle of disadvantage and disengagement that often lead to early school leaving and to the trans\u00ad mission of poverty from one generation to the next; 3. in this respect, the provision of generalised equitable access to high quality ECEC can make a strong contribution to the success of the Europe 2020 strategy, and in particular to achieving two of the EU headline targets: reducing early school leaving to below 10 %, and lifting at least 20 million people out of the risk of poverty and social exclusion; EN C 175/8 Official Journal of the European Union 15.6.2011 ( 1 ) OJ C 298, 8.12.2006, p. 3.

( 9 ) For the purposes of these conclusions, the term \u2018early childhood education and care\u2019 refers to any arrangements providing education and care for children aged 0 to compulsory school age \u2014 regardless of the setting, funding, opening hours, or programme content \u2014 and includes pre-school and pre-primary provision. ( Source: OECD Starting Strong I (2006), p. 7). ",
        "4. moreover, since ECEC provides an opportunity for the early detection of learning difficulties and early intervention, it can help to identify young children with special educational needs and, wherever possible, facilitate their integration into mainstream schools; 5. while the Member States have made good overall progress in recent years in improving the availability of ECEC, further efforts are needed in order to reach the objective of a 95 % rate of participation by 2020 agreed under the \u2018ET 2020\u2019 strategic framework ( 1 ), and in particular to ensure greater access for children from disadvantaged back\u00ad grounds; 6. providing high quality ECEC is just as important as ensuring its availability and affordability, and attention needs to be devoted to issues such as environment and infrastructure, staffing, the curriculum, governance and quality assurance; 7. a systemic and more integrated approach to ECEC services at local, regional and national level involving all the relevant stakeholders \u2014 including families \u2014 is required, together with close cross-sectoral collaboration between different policy sectors, such as education, culture, social affairs, employment, health and justice; 8. increasing the proportion of men in ECEC is important in order to change attitudes and show that not only women can provide education and care. Having role models of both sexes is positive for children and can help to break gender-stereotyped perceptions. A workplace composed of both sexes contributes to widening children\u2019s experience and can also help to reduce gender segregation in the labour market; 9. ECEC tends to receive less attention than any other level of education and training despite evidence that investing efficiently in quality early years education is much more effective than intervening later and brings considerable returns throughout the lifecycle, particularly for the disad\u00ad vantaged; 10. there has been comparatively little research on young children\u2019s education undertaken or gathered at EU level which can inform the development and implementation of ECEC policies in the Member States. There is a need to make existing research evidence more widely accessible, and to supplement this with more extensive research into ECEC provision and its effects across the Member States, taking account of cultural diversity and recording examples of good practice and experience. AGREES THAT: measures to meet the dual challenge of providing generalised equitable access to early childhood education and care, while raising the quality of provision, could include the following: 1. providing equitable access to high-quality, inclusive ECEC, in particular for children with a socioeconomically disad\u00ad vantaged, migrant or Roma background, or with special educational needs, including disabilities; 2. designing efficient funding models, including targeted funding, which strike the right balance between public and private investment in accordance with national and local circumstances; 3. promoting cross-sectoral and integrated approaches to care and education services in order to meet all children\u2019s needs \u2014 cognitive, social, emotional, psychological and physical \u2014 in a holistic way, as well as to ensure close collaboration between the home and ECEC and a smooth transition between the different levels of education; 4. supporting the professionalisation of ECEC staff, with an emphasis on the development of their competences, qualifi\u00ad cations and working conditions, and enhancing the prestige of the profession. In addition, developing policies aimed at attracting, training and retaining suitably qualified staff in ECEC and improving the gender balance; 5. promoting developmentally appropriate programmes and curricula, which fosters the acquisition of both cognitive and non-cognitive skills, whilst recognising the importance of play, which is also crucial to learning in the early years; 6. supporting parents in their role as the main educators of their children during the early years, and encouraging ECEC services to work in close partnership with parents, families and communities, in order to increase awareness of the opportunities offered by ECEC and of the importance of learning from an early age; 7. promoting quality assurance with the participation of all key stakeholders, including families; EN 15.6.2011 Official Journal of the European Union C 175/9 ( 1 ) See Annex I to the conclusions (OJ C 119, 28.5.2009, p. 7): By 2020, at least 95 % of children between four years old and the age for starting compulsory primary education should participate in early childhood education.
