        "One of the main challenges the European Union has faced in the last year is the unprecedented refugee crisis. Great efforts are made to alleviate the suffering of migrants arriv- ing in Member States, and it is clear that Cohesion Policy has a role to play in supporting effective integration poli- cies, covering education, employment, housing and non-dis- crimination policies. The European Commission is working with Member States affected by the crisis to modify European Structural and Investment (ESI) Fund programmes to respond to emergen- cies. Two of the largest entry points for migrants, Italy and Greece, have already allocated funds for migration in the 2014-2020 programmes. Greece, for example, includes ERDF support in all 13 of its regional programmes. The money will be used for building, refurbishing and opening reception cen- tres for migrants. Read more in our special report on page 20. Further ESI Fund resources can be urgently reallocated towards migrants and refugees should the crisis escalate, providing a wide range of support such as for mobile hospi- tals, sanitation, healthcare or training. Benefits of ESI Fund programmes This edition also highlights the real benefits of the EU Cohesion Policy. In particular, it focuses on investments that aim at making an impact upon Europe\u2019s economy and peo- ple\u2019s lives, by bringing and mobilising further investments. For the new 2014-2020 period, the ESI Funds allocated EUR 454 billion from the EU budget to implement over 500 national and regional programmes, as well as 79 interre- gional cooperation programmes. Those programmes are designed to get Europe\u2019s economy growing again in a sustain- able way. The most recent Communication of the European Corina Cre\u0163u European Commissioner for Regional Policy Commission on the contribution of the ESI Funds to the EU\u2019s growth strategy, the Investment Plan and the Commission\u2019s priorities over the next decade illustrate and analyse the impact, the expected results and anticipated benefits of these invest- ments on both a Europe-wide and a country-by-country basis. The ESI Funds are a forward-looking investment policy tool, ready to tackle the present challenges Europe is and will be facing in the years to come. Yet, the success will largely depend on good governance and efficient administrations managing and implementing the programmes. Promoting synergies between the EU investment funds The European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) has been launched as part of the Juncker Plan to mobilise private financing for strategic investments in infrastructure, inno- vation and businesses, so as to overcome the current invest- ment gap in the EU. EFSI can play a crucial role in optimising the impact of the ESI Funds \u2013 and indeed the reverse is also true. Purposely, the ESI Funds contribute to the Investment Plan for Europe and complement the EFSI in several ways. Their joint use can enable greater demand-driven interventions in innovative and infrastructure projects and SME financing, which in turn would lead to more growth, jobs and innovation in Europe. In the near future, the complementarity between these two funds will bring positive results for the proposed goals. \u25b6EDITORIAL 3 panorama [WINTER 2015 \u25b6 No. 55] ",

Following the conclusions of negotiations with Member States and regions on their Partnership Agree- ments and Programmes, the Commission has published a report on the anticipated benefits and deliverables of Europe\u2019s main investment policy tool. With a budget of EUR 454 billion for 2014-2020 the ESI Funds will be focused on the real needs of the European economy and support job creation and a variety of pro- grammes designed to get Europe\u2019s economy growing again in a sustainable way. National co-financing is expected to add at least a further EUR 183 billion, taking total investment to an impressive EUR 637 billion. This makes the ESI Funds an essential component of public investment in many Member States especially in times of decreasing investment from national budgets, which has fallen by around 15 % (in real terms) between 2008 and 2014. The new and refined investment tool places the focus on results and mechanisms to ensure high performance in all regions in Europe. This will enable less developed regions to catch up and maximise their potential by building on exist- ing resources to address local priorities and serve the wider regional needs.

        "Forward-looking investment The ESI Funds are an umbrella structure of five individual funds: the European Regional Development Fund, Cohesion Fund, European Social Fund, European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and European Maritime and Fisheries Fund. Following the recent reform process the ESI Funds are now a forward-looking investment policy tool, ready to tackle the challenges facing Europe today and in the years to come. Over the next spending period, the ESI Funds will provide investment in all Member States, in line with the priorities set out by the new Juncker Commission. The ESI Funds will make a substantial contribution to the Commission\u2019s political priori- ties: the Digital Single Market, the Energy Union and climate change policies, the Single Market and economic governance. EU FUNDS MAKE AN IMPAC T \u25bc GERMANY The ESF can help in achieving the economic and employment opportunities the internet offers: at the University of Dresden, the ESF supported young researchers who worked at the frontier of R&D in the field of IT technologies.

By January 2015, 129 000 people, including some 34 000 Roma, had already successfully completed training modules. \u25b6FIND OUT MORE http://europa.eu/!Cu66cm All ESI Fund support is ultimately focused on boosting jobs, growth and investment across Europe. This will bridge devel- opment gaps across regions building inclusive and stronger economies and, on the whole, a territorially more equal European Union \u2013 a trend that was reversed with the 2008 global financial crisis. More than 500 innovative programmes, defined in the Partner ship Agreements with Member States, will help deliver EU policy goals by both mobilising financial resources and improving investment conditions. Over two million enter- prises will receive support to increase their competitive- ness, develop products, find new markets and create new jobs. Investment in infrastructure will help Member States, particularly those which are less developed, to improve the competitiveness of their business environment and the con- nectivity to bigger markets. Significantly, the Funds will invest in the skills and adapta- bility of Europe\u2019s workforce, giving tens of millions of people, including young people, opportunities to (re)train or start businesses. Such opportunities will also be available for refugees and legal migrants. \u25b6FEATURE 6 ",

Financing fit for purpose The Commission is strongly encouraging the use of financial instruments instead of traditional grants in ESI Funding, par- ticularly in areas such as SME support, CO 2 reduction, envi- ronmental and resource efficiency, ICT, sustainable transport, and research and innovation. It is expected that the funds committed to innovative finan- cial instruments during the 2014-2020 period will have a direct leverage effect and will generate additional invest- ment of EUR 40 to 70 billion. This will drive an even higher multiplier effect on the real economy by attracting private HOW THE EUROPEAN STRUCTURAL AND INVESTMENT FUNDS ARE CONTRIBUTING TO DELIVERING THE COMMISSION\u2019S PRIORITIES investment. The planned allocations from all ESI Funds into financial instruments have consequently increased considerably. The synergy between the ESI Funds and the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) will also be maximised, while ESI Fund resources can be additionally combined with finan- cial instruments under Horizon 2020 and other EU pro- grammes (LIFE+, Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund, COSME, Erasmus+ or the Connecting Europe Facility). To allow more flexibility in tailoring the delivery of ESI Fund- ing based on the needs of the territory concerned, new and improved delivery mechanisms have been put in place.

The issue of youth unemployment remains endemic to most of the EU Member States. In response to a European Council recommendation in 2013 on Establishing a Youth Guaran- tee, 20 Member States are eligible for the Youth Employ- ment Initiative (YEI), which has been integrated into 34 ESF SUPPORT FOR BUSINESS RESEARCH AND INNOVATION ranging from deprived urban neighbourhoods to metro- politan areas, from cultural heritage routes to sub-regions hit by economic restructuring.

Member States will use funding allocated to the YEI to invest in quality apprenticeships, traineeships and jobs that could help bring about lasting labour market inte- gration and increase the employability of young people. Looking to the future The ESI Fund resources pave the way for long-term sustain- able growth and a better life for citizens in a better Europe, primarily by striving to support structural change recom- mendations made by the European Semester (see article on page 22). Improving the business environment and boosting administrative capacity will also contribute to meeting future challenges, as it will develop complementary projects and financing opportunities as well. This should go alongside a readiness to adapt to changing circumstances, such as the refugee crisis. Areas that par- ticularly require continued efforts throughout the 2014-2020 implementation period are related to ensuring the focus on results and the level of ambition for targets, maximising the use of financial instruments, and making full use of the syn- ergies between ESI Funds, EFSI and other funding sources such as Horizon 2020 at project level, financial instrument level and through investment platforms. The Open Data platform, launched by the DG for Regional and Urban Policy in December, makes it possible to keep an eye on progress to delivering the promised targets. This in itself is a major step forward to provide more transparency on where the funds are spent in addressing the needs of the European economy.

        "INVESTING IN JOBS AND GROW TH Commissioner Corina Cre\u0163u speaks to Panorama about maximising the contribution of the European Structural and Investment Funds to EU goals of growth and jobs. \u25b6This Communication presents the main results of the negotiations between the Member State authorities and the European Commission for the 2014-2020 period. How would you evaluate the negotiation process? Our efforts in the negotiation process on the Partnership Agreements and the programmes have paid off: we now have solid, result-oriented programmes which will have a tangible and positive impact in the EU\u2019s real economy over the decade. The performance of our investments and a greater focus on key growth-generating sectors were at the heart of the discussions we had with the stakeholders involved in the implementation of our policy. Together we committed to strategically target our investments where they could have the maximum impact \u2013 Research & innovation, the support to small businesses, to the low-carbon economy, and to the EU\u2019s digital agenda \u2013 in order to exploit the full potential of the European Structural and Investment Funds in terms of growth and job creation. The adoption of the programmes took time, as it was out of the question to compromise quality over speed. Now we have hundreds of high-quality investment packages, and the funds are ready to flow into our regions and cities, for the direct benefit of the citizens. \u25b6The expected achievements of the ESI Fund programmes mentioned in the Communication are quite detailed. How can the Commission ensure that these results will be reached? How will they be measured? The reformed Cohesion Policy for 2014-2020 is a fully fledged, performance-oriented investment policy. The new Regulation established the obligation for clear, transparent and measurable aims and targets for accountability and results. Countries and regions had to announce in their programmes the objectives they intended to achieve and how they would measure progress towards those goals. A yearly monitoring will help taking action if progress is insuf- ficient. A reward system based on performance reserve has also been put in place to motivate commitment and better performance. But I want to stress that the impact of the ESI Fund pro- grammes will have on local economies will largely be deter- mined by the dedication of the stakeholders in charge of the implementation of the programmes. As I said, the funds are now ready to flow, but I want to stress that a solid administration is as important as the money itself. People living in Europe\u2019s regions are not going to feel the ben- efit of projects supported by our policy if local and national administrations managing these funds are not robust and efficient. Helping Member States reinforce their administra- tive capacity is therefore one the priorities of my mandate. \u25b6How are the ESI Funds contributing to the 10 Com mission Priorities for 2014-2020, such as the Juncker Investment Plan for Europe? All ESI Funds are geared towards growth and job creation, with a particular focus on the least developed regions in Europe. This is aligned with the priorities of the Juncker Commission. \u2019 \u25b6 CORINA CRE\u0162U \u2013 EUROPEAN COMMISSIONER FOR REGIONAL POLICY \u25b6FEATURE 10 ",
        "All ESI Funds are geared towards growth and job creation, with a particular focus on the least developed regions in Europe. This is aligned with the priorities of the Juncker Commission. The ESI Funds contribute to achieving the objec- tives of the Digital Single Market, the Energy Union and climate change policies, the single market and economic gov- ernance, in line with the European Semester country-specific recommendations. For example, over EUR 20 billion from the ESI Funds will be invested in digital projects, such as broadband deploy- ment, online public services or better access to ICT for small businesses. In parallel, more than EUR 38 billion from the European Regional Development Fund will support the low- carbon economy, in order to enable regions and cities to invest in energy-efficient buildings, renewable energy, smart grids and sustainable urban transport. Now, in 2007-2013 our policy has helped create almost a million jobs and our overall objective over the next decade is of course to top that. \u25b6The ESI Funds refer to five funds (ERDF, Cohesion Fund, ESF, EAFRD & EMFF). What is the value-added of combin- ing the five funds in the new programming period? All five funds are designed to support the socio-economic development of Europe, as we are today faced with intercon- nected and intricate issues which need to be addressed in an integrated and coherent way.

        "The European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) aims to mobilise private financing for strategic investments in infrastructure, innovation and busi- nesses. The Directorate-General for Urban and Regional Policy considers the way in which European Structural and Investment (ESI) Funds can support the impact of the EFSI. The legal puzzle is in place \u2013 first investments On 25 June 2015, the Council adopted a regulation ( 1 ) estab- lishing the new European Fund for Strategic Investments, thus paving the way for new investments to begin in mid- 2015. The European Commission and the European Inves- tment Bank (EIB) signed the EFSI Agreement on 22 July 2015, which completes its formal establishment ( 2 ), as well as that of the European Investment Advisory Hub (EIAH) ( 3 ). The EFSI will be established within and managed by the EIB. It will be endowed with a EUR 16 billion guarantee from the EU budget and EUR 5 billion from the EIB\u2019s own resources. The EIB will use the EFSI funds and guarantee to leverage additional financing of at least EUR 315 billion for invest- ment in strategic infrastructure, innovation, and small and medium-sized enterprises. EFSI operations will take place within the EIB and there will be wide sectorial and product eligibility for EFSI operations, but no country or sectorial allocation quotas. In this context, the EIB has already started pre-financing, or \u2018warehousing\u2019, projects which are backed by the EU guar- antee. This means that the EIB is approving projects on the basis of an EU guarantee coverage, granted by the Commission pending the appointment of the Investment Committee members. \u25b6 THE INVESTMENT PL AN FOR EUROPE AND THE ESI FUNDS LAUNCH OF THE IMPLEMENTATION PHASE The EFSI governance structure On 22 July 2015, the four members of the EFSI Steering Board were appointed: Ambroise Fayolle , Vice-President, EIB; Maarten Verwey , Secretariat General, European Commission; Gerassimos Thomas , DG Energy, European Commission; Irmfried Schwimann , DG Competition, European Commission. The Steering Board sets the investment guidelines and the operating policies and procedures. On 13 October 2015, the European Parliament voted in favour of the EFSI Steering Board proposal to appoint Wilhelm Molterer ( 4 ) (see page 14) as EFSI Managing Director and Iliyana Tsanova ( 5 ) as Deputy Managing Director. They will coordinate EFSI activities within the EIB Group and support EFSI Investment Committee meetings, which the Managing Director will chair. The Investment Committee shall be accountable to the EFSI Steering Board and shall be composed of eight independ- ent experts and the Managing Director. The Investment Committee shall be responsible for examining, in a trans- parent and independent manner, potential projects in line with the EFSI investment policies and for approving the sup- port of the EU guarantee for EIB operations. Furthermore, the Investment Committee shall approve operations with (1) Regulation (EU) 2015/1017 of the European Parliament and the Council of 25 June 2015. (2) Another arm of the Investment Plan for Europe is the European Investment Project Portal (EIPP), which will be a publicly available, secure web portal where EU-based promoters seeking external financing are given the opportunity to promote projects to potential investors. (3) T he EIAH will support the development and financing of investment projects in the EU by offering a single point of contact for guidance and advice, providing a platform to exchange know-how, and coordinating technical assistance. (4) Wilhelm Molterer has served as an EIB Vice-President (2011-2015) and a Member of the Austrian Parliament. He has been Vice Chancellor and Finance Minister of Austria and chairman of the Austrian People\u2019s Party. (5) Iliyana Tsanova has served as Director in the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and Deputy Prime Minister in two separate caretaker governments of Bulgaria (2013 and 2014). \u25b6EFSI 12 ",
        "investment platforms and national promotional banks, and shall consult with the Steering Board and the Managing Director with regard to EIF instruments. The role of National Promotional Banks and investment platforms The synergy between European and national tools will be essential to rapidly start closing the investment gap for the EU economy. In order for this to happen, National Promo- tional Banks (NPBs), namely entities mandated by Member States to carry out development or promotional activities, are expected to play a key role and complement the EIB. Already nine Member States have come forward with con- tributions to the Investment Plan via their promotional banks. In the same context, investment platforms will be set up in the form of ad hoc vehicles through which financing is channelled to projects. They may be set up through various legal structures (SPVs, managed accounts, other arrange- ments), have various dimensions (geographical, product, sec- torial) and they may also receive EIB or other type of support (Member State, private investors). ESI Funds and EFSI complementarities EFSI is an ambitious plan with a clear potential to provide significant financial support and boost job creation through cooperation with various stakeholders and financing sources. In this context, there is considerable scope for ESI Funds in maximising synergies and complementarities with EFSI. Although ESI Funds and EFSI function independently \u2013 they are stand-alone mechanisms with separate implementation frameworks \u2013 they allow for contributions to support each other\u2019s objectives. ESI Fund resources can play a crucial role in optimising the impact of EFSI (and vice versa ) as their joint use would allow for more sizeable demand-driven interven- tions in innovative and infrastructure projects and SME financing which in turn would lead to more growth, jobs and innovation in Europe. Although ESI Fund resources cannot be directly transferred to EFSI, both legal frameworks allow for contributions to support each other\u2019s objectives.

        "\u25b6 OVERCOMING EUROPE\u2019S STR ATEGIC INVESTMENT GAP \u25b6INTERVIEW In July 2015, EU legislators reached a political agreement on the Regu- lation for a European Fund for Stra- tegic Investments (EFSI). Panorama speaks to Wilhelm Molterer, Manag- ing Director of EFSI. \u25b6Where do we stand now and when will the EFSI be operational? In fact the roll out of operations is very much underway. And I believe we have already made significant progress. The momentum is building too, as the governance of the European Fund for Strategic Investments takes shape. At the beginning of last month (November) I took up my role as EFSI Managing Director. My deputy, Ms Ilyana Tsanova , will take office on 1 January, and the freshly appointed members of the Investment Committee will take up duty in January, too. However, the European Investment Bank (EIB) had already started pre-financing projects in April at its own risk await- ing the launch of EFSI. So far, the EIB Board of Directors has approved 34 projects for financing under EFSI which repre- sent a volume of financing of over EUR 5 billion, based on the EU budget guarantee (13 have already been approved by the European Commission under the EU guarantee). These operations are expected to mobilise an investment of around EUR 23 billion. Of these EIB approved operations, 9 projects have been signed to date. \u25b6What type of projects will EFSI support and who can apply for EFSI financing and how? If you look at what has already been approved, you will see that around half of these projects support renewable energy, energy efficiency and other investments that contribute to the growth of a low-carbon economy. The others include R&D and industrial innovation, digital and social infrastruc- ture, transport, as well as access to finance for smaller busi- nesses. What these projects have in common, which will hold true for the future projects too, is that they will contribute to economic growth and job creation, as well as competi- tiveness across Europe. EFSI targets in particular projects and areas where there is a clear demand or specific market failure. The level of invest- ments in Europe is still lagging far behind what is needed to catch up in terms of competitiveness. That is why EFSI is targeting key areas aiming at boosting competiveness, including research, development and innovation, as well as strategic infrastructure and smaller businesses. Entities of all sizes including utilities, special purpose vehi- cles or project companies can apply for EFSI financing. Equally, small and medium-sized enterprises (with up to 250 employees) and midcaps (with up to 3 000 employees) can all apply through local partner institutions throughout the EU. National Promotional Banks and other banks will participate to provide intermediated loans, as can Funds and any other form of collective investment vehicles. The EIB\u2019s experience and expertise with such a varied range of stakeholders and financial products can really make a difference in garnering the support we need for strategic growth-inducing projects across Europe. \u25b6Many think that EFSI is only for large-scale projects but there is also an SME window. Will EFSI in particular help SMEs? 14 ",
        "Absolutely. We know that support for SMEs in Europe is vital for the future dynamism of our economies and as the prime source of new jobs. That\u2019s why around a quarter of EFSI\u2019s original endowment (EUR 5 billion of EUR 21 billion) is ear- marked to support access to finance for small and medium- sized enterprises. Both the EIF (European Investment Fund, part of the EIB Group) and the EIB itself will provide support to SMEs under EFSI through partner institutions. The EIF is already delivering impressive results. Building on our existing network of partner banks and institutions, EIF has already signed more than 50 operations under EFSI, with total financing exceeding EUR 2 billion, which is expected to generate more than EUR 17 billion of investments. Some 65 0 00 SMEs and midcaps are expected to benefit, including in Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal and the UK. \u25b6EFSI should complement, and be additional to ongoing regional, national and EU-wide programmes as well as existing EIB operations and activities. How will this work in practice? Isn't there an overlap between EFSI and the European Structural and Investment (ESI) Funds? Both funds support the EU policy objectives, however they are different instruments, each with their own design, regu- lations and timeframe. Nevertheless, there is great scope for complementarity. ESI Fund programmes can contribute to the Investment Plan objectives and complement EFSI support. These may com- plement EFSI-supported projects, thus ensuring a greater value added. We will avoid duplication and overlap by ensur- ing that the combination of these different kinds of financ- ing in one project should also happen where the added value can be clearly demonstrated and where the EU involvement can be made to work better. Sometimes it\u2019s the combination of both that allows us to attract other kinds of financing to a project. Or for example, in France\u2019s Nord-Pas de Calais region, our equity contribu- tion (which we proposed to the European Commission for financing under EFSI) is set to support a scheme target- ing small and midcap enterprises making low-carbon \u25b6 The Galloper project is a 56 turbine extension of the Greater Gabbard Offshore wind farm (UK). 15 panorama [WINTER 2015 \u25b6 No. 55] ",
        "WORLD FORUM FOR A RESPONSIBLE ECONOMY \u2013 LILLE, 2015 The World Forum for a Responsible Economy, which took place in Lille, Nord-Pas de Calais, on 20-22 October. Successive project leaders took the floor to present projects expected to be funded by this investment fund exclusively dedicated to the third industrial Revolution (REV3). FIND OUT MORE: www.responsible-economy.org/en/ investments. Here, the ESI Funds complement EIB financing and additional private funding. Furthermore, technical sup- port for the scheme is funded by the ESI Funds. This is the first instance of EFSI, ESI Funds and private investors com- ing together to support a financial instrument in a structure, which is expected to be replicated across Europe. Speaking more technically, the legal framework (EFSI regu- lation) and dedicated governance is set up in such a way that only projects with proven additionality get financed. For example, in line with the criteria outlined by EFSI regu- lations it is the role of the Investment Committee to assess whether projects are eligible to receive EU budget guaran- tee backing. A scoreboard providing a qualitative rating of each project helps Investment Committee expert members to make their decision. EFSI will also allow the EIB Group to do many more trans- actions at the higher end of the risk spectrum than it has done in the past. Doing more innovative and risky business than the EIB Group has done in the past will make a sub- stantial difference to the Group\u2019s economic impact precisely in terms of mobilising new investment. \u25b6Many observers fear that EFSI support will benefit only the top rated countries. How will EFSI ensure a certain balance between regions and sectors? EFSI clearly targets investments across the EU, so there is no bias towards higher-rated countries. At the same time, it\u2019s important to underline that there are no geographic or sectoral quotas. EFSI is demand-driven and will provide support for projects everywhere in the EU, including cross-border projects. Projects will be considered according to their individual merits. However, the strength of the approach and the guarantee means that we can scale-up our risk-absorption capacity and attract finance for investment on a different level. Success of the Investment Plan does not depend on EFSI alone. Structural reforms are necessary and so is dealing with regulatory and administrative barriers to investment at both EU and national levels. Everyone must play their part. \u25b6How will the impact be measured? The EIB will monitor and measure the results and impact of EFSI during implementation and afterwards, with a focus on the impact of projects on growth and job creation. We have moved fast to deliver first results \u2013 supporting projects that matter, mobilising investment that makes a difference as regards growth, jobs and competitiveness in Europe. Solid results and the crucial projects we manage to get off the ground show what the EU is able to achieve when we join forces and work towards a common goal \u2013 mobilising investment for more growth, jobs and competi- tiveness across Europe. \u25b6FIND OUT MORE http://ec.europa.eu/priorities/jobs-growth-investment/ plan/efsi/index_en.htm http://www.eib.org/about/invest-eu/index.htm?lang=en \u25b6INTERVIEW 16 16 16 ",

The \u2018Europe in My Region\u2019 photo competition, launched by the DG for Regional and Urban Policy, is a way to showcase the excellent work and local impact created by projects which are supported by the EU. Participants were asked to photograph an EU-funded project, the only requirements were for evidence of EU funding (for example a plaque or billboard) and the EU flag to be included in the picture. After the submission period, the public had time to vote online, thereby creating a shortlist of favourites before a jury of experts chose the final winners. More than 550 entries were accepted, the highest number (110) came from Greece, followed by Bulgaria (96) and Romania (77).

        "\u25b6 PARTNERSHIPS TO DRIVE EU URBAN AGENDA Momentum has been building towards the implementa- tion of an EU Urban Agenda. The first pilot partnerships are being prepared as the key delivery mechanism for integrating cities into EU policy making. Almost 70 % of the EU population now live in urban areas. Europe\u2019s cities are the engines of the European economy, providing jobs and services. However, they are also home to some of our greatest challenges: economic, social, envi- ronmental and demographic, which are often interrelated. These areas also absorb 55 % of public investments. There has been a growing recognition in Europe that an EU Urban Agenda is needed so that the city level can be better taken into account when designing EU policies to ensure that these are better adapted to urban realities. With increasing support for an EU Urban Agenda at the politi- cal level, including its endorsement in the Riga Declaration in June 2015, the Commission has been intensifying action through the creation of the \u2018Project Group\u2019 on urban issues, led by Commission Vice-Presidents Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d and Jyrki Katainen . The main messages emerging from the public consulta- tion, launched in 2014, on the key features of an EU Urban Agenda, were also published this year, helping to map out the possible next steps. The way forward The EU Urban Agenda is not about designing national policies but rather to strengthen the urban dimension in EU and national policies and mobilising cities in their design and implementation. The way forward is seen as being the creation of partnerships composed of experts from the Commission, Member States, cities and other stakeholders \u2013 for example, networks, NGOs, and businesses \u2013 which will ensure a timely and effective preparation of Action Plans and their subsequent implementation. Such an approach, it is recognised, can max- imise their effectiveness and ensure they are implemented at a lower cost. Twelve priority themes have been identified for implementation by the partnerships (see box). Pilot Partnerships The first four pilot partnerships will be launched at the end of 2015 addressing the following themes. URBAN POVERTY The objectives are to reduce poverty and improve the inclusion of people in poverty or at risk of poverty in deprived neighbourhoods. Urban poverty refers to issues related to a structural concentration of poverty in deprived neighbourhoods and solutions that need to be designed and applied with an integrated approach. The focus will be on spatial concentration of structural THE RIGA DECLARATION The Riga Declaration \u2018Towards the EU Urban Agenda\u2019, agreed at the 10 June informal meeting of Ministers responsible for cohesion policy, territorial cohesion and urban matters, identifies the key elements and principles to be taken into account in future work on development of the EU Urban Agenda during upcoming EU Presidencies.

        "poverty in deprived neighbourhoods (and regeneration of these areas), child poverty and homelessness. HOUSING The objective is to establish affordable housing of good quality. The focus will be on public affordable hous- ing, State aid rules and general housing policy. INCLUSION OF MIGRANTS AND REFUGEES The aim is to manage the integration of incoming migrants and refu- gees from outside the EU and to provide a framework for their inclusion. This will cover housing, integration, provision of public services, social inclusion, education and labour mar- ket measures. AIR QUALITY The objective is to realise systems and poli- cies to ensure a good air quality for human health. This will cover legislative and technical aspects linked to a wide range of polluting sources such as cars, industries, agricultural activities, etc. Organisation of Partnerships Partnerships have to prepare and implement an Action Plan with concrete actions at EU, national and local level. They are the key delivery mechanism of the EU Urban Agenda and they will develop a multilevel (vertical) and multi-dimensional (horizontal) approach. Each partnership is made up of the Commission (who facilitates the process), Member States, cities (through associations such as Eurocities and the Council of European Municipalities and Regions), and stakeholders (NGOs, business, experts, etc.). The timeframe of each partnership is about 3 years. Cooperation between the different partnerships is encour- aged because the themes are interlinked. However, the organisation and working arrangements may differ slightly between partnerships. Looking ahead The EU Urban Agenda will be a particular priority for the Dutch EU Presidency in 2016. An agreement between Member States on the main elements of an EU Urban Agenda is envisaged for the first half of 2016 leading to the conclusion of the Amsterdam Pact on the EU Urban Agenda in May 2016. The first call for the new Urban Innovative Actions is also expected before the end of 2015. The initiative has been created to test new approaches to the challenges faced by urban authorities, with a total budget of EUR 371 million over the period 2015-2020. Projects will be supported with up to EUR 5 million each from the ERDF, focused for 2015 on the following topics: Energy transition; urban poverty; investment in the integration of migrants and refugees; jobs and skills in the local economy. \u25b6FIND OUT MORE http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/newsroom/ news/2015/05/eu-urban-agenda-key-features-results- of-the-public-consultation http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/newsroom/ news/2015/11/11-04-2015-urban-innovative-actions- initiative-call 12 PRIORITY THEMES FOR THE EU URBAN AGENDA \u25b61 JOBS AND SKILLS IN THE LOCAL ECONOMY \u25b62 URBAN POVERTY \u25b63 AFFORDABLE HOUSING \u25b64 INCLUSION OF MIGRANTS AND REFUGEES \u25b65 SUSTAINABLE USE OF LAND AND NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS \u25b66 CIRCULAR ECONOMY \u25b67 CLIMATE ADAPTATION \u25b68 ENERGY TRANSITION \u25b69 URBAN MOBILITY \u25b610 AIR QUALITY \u25b611 DIGITAL TRANSITION \u25b612 INNOVATIVE AND RESPONSIBLE PUBLIC PROCUREMENT The Riga Declaration acknow\u00ad ledges the crucial role of cities and towns in reaching the objectives set by the Europe 2020 Strategy and by the Juncker Commission in terms of growth and jobs.

        "\u25b6 MIGR ATION CRISIS AND THE EUROPE AN RESPONSE THE ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN STRUCTURAL AND INVESTMENT FUNDS aligned with the EU\u2019s overarching goal of inclusive growth and equitable opportunities for all, including migrants. Whereas social integration measures are foremost the remit of the European Social Fund (ESF), planned measures on the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) side could include: significant investments in social, health, education, housing and childcare infrastructure; regenera- tion of deprived urban areas; actions to reduce spatial and educational isolation of migrants; business start-ups. In addition to medium- and long-term assistance, the Commission stands ready to examine and adopt modifica- tions to ESI Fund programmes in order to respond rapidly to emergencies encountered by Member States and non-mem- ber countries affected by the refugee crises. Although the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) with a budget Every day, thousands of refugees fleeing violence in the Middle East and other parts of the world are cross- ing European borders in the hope of finding shelter and securing a peaceful life for their families. The deterio- rating weather conditions and increasingly risky transit routes do not deter refugees bound for Europe. In fact, the numbers are expected to continue to increase dur- ing the coming months. With so many people arriving, the EU and all Member States are under pressure to deal with them quickly and to provide the conditions for a safe shelter and fast integration of those refugees that will remain in the EU. European Structural and Investment (ESI) Funds are one of the ways forward. President Juncker was resolute when he said: \u2018if ever European solidarity needed to manifest itself, it is on the question of the refugee crisis\u2019. These words reflect the Commission\u2019s decision to integrate a comprehensive migra- tion policy into the existing EU priorities. This places the issue of migration and the swift reallocation and international protection of migrants as one of the Commission\u2019s top political priorities. Migration is a cross-cutting issue, involving different policy areas and different actors, both inside and outside the EU. As such, it requires a coordinated and multifaceted approach supported by a range of budget tools. ESI Funds form part of this response. Following the recent tragic incidents in the Mediterranean and the ever-increasing influx of refugees, the Commission has published two Communications in May and September 2015 in order to respond to the immediate challenges. ESI Funds are explicitly mentioned as an important funding source to support effective integration policies covering education, employment, housing and non-discrimination policies. Providing refuge and integration of displaced refugees is thus incorporated in the existing legal framework and \u25b6MIGRATION 20 ",
        "of over EUR 3 billion is already in place to address such short-term needs, additional ESI Fund resources can be urgently reallocated towards migrants and refugees in exceptional circumstances. Prospective investments may cover mobile hospitals; hot spots; sanitation and water; infra- structure development for vocational training; extending basic social and healthcare services; building or extending reception centres, shelters or actions to reinforce the capaci- ties of the reception services, etc. In light of this, the Commission has invited all 28 Member States to have a second look at the 2014-2020 priorities to see whether measures aimed at integrating refugees and migrants require a more explicit and stronger place. Italy and Greece, the largest entry ports for migrants transiting across the Mediterranean, have already taken this into consideration and revisited some of the 2014-2020 programmes. The Italian programme \u2018Legalit\u00e0\u2019 focuses on the promotion of the rule of law in less developed regions, but in response to recent developments in the coastal areas it has also included specific actions in favour of legal immigrants and asylum seekers. The 2014-2020 national programme will allo- cate around EUR 41 million for the restructuring and rehabili- tation of assets confiscated from the mafia, with a view to using them primarily as centres for the accommodation of legal immigrants, asylum seekers and recipients of interna- tional and humanitarian assistance. In these centres, regular immigrants will be helped by social inclusion and labour mar- ket support measures to be funded by the ESF. In Greece, all 13 regional programmes for the 2014-2020 period include ERDF support for building, refurbishing and opening reception centres for migrants. Under ESI Fund (the- matic) objective no. 9 (social inclusion and poverty) additional interventions are envisaged, such as inclusive start-ups, social enterprises, social housing, childcare infrastructure, regenera- tion of deprived urban areas, etc. These interventions may be targeted at all vulnerable groups, including migrants. In summary, the Commission is using all modes and chan- nels to secure a comprehensive and place-based response to the rapidly evolving migration crisis. Numerous bilateral visits to Croatia, Greece and Slovenia among others have taken place recently and many more are scheduled for the coming period. The high level meetings with Turkish authorities, as well as the October Meeting with Heads of State or Government of Western Balkan countries and of all the Member States on the migration route to Germany, demonstrate the Commission\u2019s strong support for the joint management of migration flows and its commitment to tackle the long-term implications of the migration crisis. \u25b6FIND OUT MORE http://ec.europa.eu/priorities/migration/index_en.htm \u25b6 In Germany, the ESF-funded Lotsendienst (Pilot service) for migrants advised some 1 400 migrants who were interested in setting up their own businesses. 735 of these did just that through individual coaching. The startups were also supported by business start-up pilot schemes during their first year of operation. \u25b6 With EU financing, a local support centre for the integration of immigrants helped 1 215 immigrants in Portugal by providing social and legal assistance, as well as contacts and information to gain access to employment. 21 panorama [WINTER 2015 \u25b6 No. 55] ",
        "\u25b6 ESI FUND PROGR AMMES AND THE EUROPE AN SEMESTER ALIGNING REGIONAL INVESTMENTS WITH WIDER ECONOMIC POLICIES During the discussions and preparation of the 2014- 2020 European Structural and Investment Fund pro- grammes there was a stronger focus than before on the links between planned investment and other eco- nomic policies. One of the main ways this has taken place is through the country-specific recommenda- tions (CSRs) ( 1 ) produced under the European Semester process. How is the European Semester influencing the way national and regional programmes approach investments planned for 2014-2020? The European Semester was introduced in 2010 as a new EU economic governance structure, launched in parallel with the Europe 2020 strategy. A key part of the Semester is the annual CSRs adopted, since 2011, by the European Council. The CSRs are largely based on the analysis paper of the European Commission (now called the Country report) and they identify a short list of main economic pol- icy priorities for each Member State across the range of economic policy fields. Although CSRs are not the main way investment priorities for 2014-2020 were established, since 2010 the links between the CSRs and European Structural and Investment (ESI) Funds programming have quickly developed and CSRs have influenced the new generation of programmes. Two main links are recognised in the legislation for the ESI Funds: the link between pre-existing CSRs and the prepara- tion of the 2014-2020 programmes, and the possibility that future CSRs may contribute to reprogramming (Strand 1 under the macro-economic conditionality clause). What are \u2018cohesion relevant\u2019 CSRs? By 2014 the range of issues covered under the CSRs had become more numerous and increasingly relevant for ESI Funds. In the 2014 exercise from a total of 157 CSRs, more than two thirds were related to cohesion policy (policies funded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), Euro pean Social Fund (ESF) and the Cohesion Fund (CF)). This included 74 CSRs relevant for the ESF and 56 CSRs which were relevant for the ERDF/Cohesion Fund (with 20 CSRs relevant for both ESF and ERDF/CF). These \u2018cohesion-relevant\u2019 recommendations covered a wide range of themes and different types of policy measures and structural reforms. Broadly they related either to 1) framework conditions or policy strategies relevant for ESI Fund programmes, 2) identification of investment needs, or 3) administrative capacity themes. The themes most fre- quently covered in the CSRs relevant for the ERDF and Cohesion Fund related to energy, natural resources, SME access to finance, R&D and innovation and administrative capacity. In the case of the ESF, the fields most frequently addressed were labour market policy, education reforms and social inclusion. Interestingly, within the 110 CSRs in 2014 the vast majority concerned \u2018less developed\u2019 Member States, but only 4 CSRs (for Croatia, the Czech Republic, Italy and Romania) had rec- ommendations specifically related to the management of EU funds. Those exceptions apart, it is not always easy to identify which CSRs are relevant for cohesion policy and which are not. Analysis of the relevance of EU programmes to policy challenges can sometimes be found in the semes- ter country reports that now precede the Commission\u2019s draft (1) The English abbreviation of country-specific recommendations (CSRs) will be used throughout the article. \u25b6EU SEMESTER 22 ",
        "2014 157 CSRs \u2154 74 CSRs C S R ESF ERDF/ CF 56 CSRs CSRs. Also, some Member States made explicit references in their partnership agreements and programmes to CSRs. Finally, relevant CSRs were discussed in the drafting of the programmes and influenced the results though no specific references were made. The 2015 CSRs saw the number of CSRs reduced from over 150 to around 100 with CSRs generally shorter and containing fewer sub themes. The 102 CSRs for 2015 com- prise 161 policy recommendations. Strikingly only 61 of these policy recommendations are considered ESI Fund relevant, significantly lower than in 2014. However, the Commission stressed that the more extensive country- specific recommendations in previous years had not lost importance and that it would continue to encourage completing those reforms. Potential reprogramming under the macro-economic conditionality clause The legislation for 2014-2020 also foresees the possibility for the Commission to request the modification of adopted partnership agreements and operational programmes where necessary to support a new CSR. It should be noted that since structural reforms address long-term problems, it is anticipated that such changes will not be frequent. The Commission has recognised that frequent reprogramming could prove disruptive to multiannual investment strategies. A key policy challenge that is giving rise to early discus- sions on reprogramming is the EU response to the dramatic increase in migration. Commissioner Cre\u0163u has invited pro- grammes to look again at their investment priorities and consider self-initiated reprogramming. Next steps Linking the multi-annual programming cycle of cohesion policy and annual short-term CSRs has led to concerns amongst cohesion policy stakeholders. It is true that CSRs are updated every year and may be linked to short-term policy priorities. However, in practice, the CSRs that have been linked with cohesion policy all have a medium- and long-term nature, even if the Commission \u2013 in proposing such CSRs \u2013 is encour- aging Member States to prioritise a reform process. In terms of future links between ESI Funds and the European Semester, key challenges to be addressed in the next years are likely to include: demonstrating the contribution of ESI Funds to EU, national and regional economic priorities includ- ing the contribution to relevant CSRs; finding the right bal- ance between the medium- and long-term objectives of ESI Fund investments and the policy agendas set in the annual CSRs; using the margins within ESI Fund programmes to flexibly address important changes in needs and reprogram- ming where needed; and determining whether and how the macro-economic conditionality provisions (Strand 1) will be used for strategic reprogramming. \u25b6FIND OUT MORE http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/making-it-happen/ country-specific-recommendations/ COUNTRY-SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS (CSRs) IN 2014 RELATED TO COHESION POLICY C O H E S I O N P O L I C Y 23 panorama [WINTER 2015 \u25b6 No. 55] ",

At the same time, the early school-leaving rate decreased from 30.3 % in 2003 to 19.9 % in 2013. In total, over 50 000 stu- dents and 10 000 families benefitted from the programme which gave them a new chance at a bright future. \u25b6 www.pugliausr.it/default.aspx?Page= Office_Section&code=132&tipo=1 \u25b6 SMART GROWTH Unleashing SME growth potential for a digital economy. \u25b6SCANDINAVIAN GAME DEVELOPERS Midtjylland (Denmark) and V\u00e4stsverige (Sweden) The project offers advice and training to young entre- preneurs in the Scandinavian digital gaming industry and helps them establish viable companies in a highly competi- tive business environment.

        "\u25b6 BULGARIA \u2013 STE ADY GROW TH LE AVES ECONOMIC CRISIS BEHIND Panorama speaks to Deputy Prime Minister Tomislav Donchev about how cohesion policy is help- ing Bulgaria go from strength to strength as well as the country\u2019s plans for the future funding. \u25b6The European Commission adopted the Partnership Agreement with Bulgaria in August 2014. What main steps have been taken since? The priorities of the ESI Funds in Bulgaria are structured in ten programmes, nine of which have already been approved. Management structures are to a large extent the same as in the 2007-2013 period, but in setting up management and control systems we built on our experience aiming to simplify processes without reducing the effectiveness of control. Recently we designated the first authorities, including one for the biggest ESF programme, which supports operations on the labour market, social inclusion and youth employment, which is extremely important to support the upward changes in the Bulgarian economy which has just started to come out of the crisis. We are working to further improve the legal framework with a new law on the management of ESI Funds. Its adoption by the Parliament is forthcoming. \u25b6How important have the EU cohesion funds been since Bulgaria\u2019s accession to the EU? The investments with EU funds significantly impact the social and economic development of the country, by allevi- ating some of the main challenges we face. The effect on the real GNP value is estimated in 7.2 % higher growth com- pared to the \u2018zero\u2019 scenario. Employment is 4.5 % higher than what it would have been without the funds, and private investments have also increased by 26.9 %. In practical terms the funds affect nearly all citizens of Bulgaria with more than 1 000 renovated public buildings (educational, social and cultural purposes) and 1 1 16 km of roads, 424 km railways, 262 km motorways and 21 km of metro lines constructed or renovated. Urban projects have directly improved the lives of 3.5 million people and envi- ronmental investments in water and sewerage and waste management infrastructure now service half the population of the country. \u25b6INTERVIEW 26 ",
        "The ESI Funds will continue to be an important source of public investments. In the 2014-2020 period, however, we are more focused on education and R&D. New invest- ment priorities also include the reduction of greenhouse gases, environmental risk management and air quality. All these are to better achieve the policy objectives for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. In terms of man- agement approaches we focus on ever-greater simplifica- tion, improved access to the funds, improved transparency and accountability. In other words, we aim for strong orien- tation on results, wider use of an integrated approach and return on public money. The importance of the cities in the delivery of the Europe 2020 strategy and the urban dimension of the cohesion policy increase further the role of local authorities in ESI Funds management. They take on more responsibilities and in the framework of sustainable urban development will act as intermediate bodies. \u25b6To what extent will Bulgaria use financial instruments (FIs)? For the 2007-2013 period Bulgaria had a very positive experience with FIs. At the end of 2014, JEREMIE has dis- bursed over EUR 600 million to more than 6 300 SMEs and 320 start-ups. JESSICA supported urban regeneration and development measures in cities and the aggregate amounts signed and disbursed are more than EUR 40 million. For 2014-2020, we will build on our experience and extend the scope of the FIs. We will broaden the thematic coverage of financial instruments to include the environment, as well as diversify instruments. A particular focus is the support of innovative entrepreneurships and start-ups covering a wide range of products to help market and scale up economically sound ideas. The total amount of funds committed to FIs is around EUR 650 million from six Operational Programmes. The funds will be channelled through a state \u2018Fund of Funds\u2019 that will ensure economy of scale in management costs, help standardise procedures, increase leverage, and achieve bet- ter synergy with grant funding. In addition, Bulgaria has com- mitted EUR 102 million to the SME Initiative. \u25b6What results do you expect at the end of the seven-year period? According to our economic modelling, by the end of 2020 we can expect a real GNP growth of 9.3 % higher compared to the basic scenario. This is attributed to both the long-term effects of the 2007-2013 investments and the 2014-2020 period implementation. In the result-orientation terms, by 2023 this means increas- ing innovation/R&D activities of enterprises by 30 %; increas- ing entrepreneurial activity by 10 %; reducing the share of early school leavers aged between 18-24 to 11 %; increas- ing the share of 30-34 year olds with tertiary education to at least 36 %; achieve 3 % of people aged 25-64 participating in lifelong learning; reducing time for administrative services by 50 % compared to 2013, etc. \u25b6FIND OUT MORE www.eufunds.bg/en/ \u25b6 This mechanical-biological treatment plant in Sofia can process 410 000 tonnes of waste a year and produce Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF) fuel for cogeneration. \u25b6To what extent are local and regional bodies involved in managing various OPs in Bulgaria? Bulgarian municipalities implement nearly half of the oper- ations \u2013 both infrastructure projects and \u2018soft\u2019 measures. They have both the proper institutional place and practical experience to actively participate on all stages of the pro- gram cycle. 27 panorama [WINTER 2015 \u25b6 No. 55] ",
        "One year on from launching EU Structural Funds pro- grammes 2014-2020, Wales\u2019 Finance and Government Business Minister Jane Hutt speaks to Panorama on how vital EU Funds are to building a sustainable and thriving Welsh economy. \u25b6What progress has been made since Wales launched their 2014-2020 programme? Wales was the first nation in the UK, and among the first in the EU, to have its Structural Funds programmes 2014-2020 agreed by the European Commission \u2013 made possible by the strong co-operation between the Welsh Government and economic and social partners at Wales, UK and EU levels. I committed to hitting the ground running with the delivery of our EU funding programmes, so vital investments would continue to flow into the Welsh economy. We have made excellent progress, investing some GBP 400 million \u2013 one- fifth of the total EU funding allocation \u2013 to public, private and voluntary organisations across Wales, driving a total investment of GBP 880 million. Making Wales an innovative and globally competitive nation is at the heart of the Welsh Government\u2019s agenda for driv- ing prosperity, and I was delighted that our first funding announcement was GBP 20 million from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) to build Aberystwyth \u25b6 WALES \u2013 DRIVING GROW TH AND JOBS THROUGH COHESION POLIC Y University\u2019s new Innovation and Enterprise Centre in mid Wales. The GBP 35 million state-of-the-art development will enable researchers and industry to collaborate, turning pioneering ideas to boost the bio-economy into commercial, global success. Another important EU funds investment involves a marine energy scheme in North Wales. Backed with GBP 10 million from the ERDF, Minesto will design, manufacture and test a low velocity device \u2013 called \u2018Deep Green\u2019 \u2013 to produce elec- tricity for thousands of homes from tidal and ocean currents. With the second highest tidal range in the world, Wales has the potential to be a world-leader in the innovative field of marine energy, and drive a low carbon future. This EU invest- ment has also put the foundations in place to attract inward investment with the Swedish company now set to establish its UK headquarters in Wales. \u25b6 Finance and Government Business Minister Jane Hutt with Professor Richard B Davies, Vice Chancellor of Swansea University during the construction of Swansea Bay Innovation Campus. \u25b6INTERVIEW 28 ",
        "These are just a few examples of the significant role EU funds are having, helping to transform our economy and increase the prosperity of all Welsh citizens through invest- ments in business competiveness, research and innovation, skills, employment, renewable energy, digital and urban con- nectivity, and young people. \u25b6What role have partnerships played in creating growth in Wales so far? Partnership is, of course, essential to the successful deliv- ery of EU funds in Wales and we are working with our part- ners to maximise the impact of our investments by aligning them with existing and emerging growth opportunities in key spatial areas and sectors, including city regions and enterprise zones. This approach was the catalyst for one of Europe\u2019s leading knowledge economy projects \u2013 Swansea University\u2019s GBP 450 million Science and Innovation Bay Campus. With sup- port from the ERDF, the European Investment Bank, the Welsh Government and other public and private investments, the campus opened its doors to thousands of students, researchers and businesses in September 2015. During the construction phase alone it created over 1 000 jobs, providing skills and supply chain opportunities for the local area. It will build on this success through its dynamic research environment and is an outstanding example of the impact EU funds can have on a region \u2013 a sentiment echoed recently in the European Parliament when the project was showcased there. \u25b6What benefits has Wales experienced from collaborating with other EU regions? While EU Structural Funds play a vital role within our region, increasing participation among Welsh organisations in other EU-funded programmes such as Horizon 2020 and the European Territorial Cooperation programmes is also key to the Welsh Government\u2019s continuing policy of working in partnership with other EU regions and promoting Wales internationally. They provide an important platform for us to look beyond our geographical boundaries to tackle com- mon economic, social and environmental issues, and share and build on our expertise. In October at Wales\u2019 European Territorial Cooperation con- ference in Brussels, attended by representatives and stake- holders from Ireland, Poland, France, Spain, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Finland and the UK, I outlined how we will maxim- ise Welsh engagement in these programmes and increase joint working with our EU partners. In the very competitive Horizon 2020 research and inno- vation programme, Wales\u2019 performance has so far been encouraging, with Welsh organisations already benefiting from EU funds of almost GBP 25 million to help drive our knowledge economy. Microsemi Corporation, a multinational semiconductor solutions provider with a base in South Wales, has successfully attracted some GBP 320 000 to support the GBP 2.5 million MEDILIGHT project \u2013 developing a medi- cal device to enhance professional wound care. In November, Wales also hosted the IQNet conference in Cardiff. Representatives from several EU Managing Authorities met to discuss \u2018Simplification\u2019, a key design principle promoted by the Commission that could produce tangible benefits for organisations accessing and delivering EU projects. EU Funds are helping us achieve our goals. I am confident that they will help create a lasting legacy for people, busi- nesses and communities across Wales, and a more prosper- ous and inclusive society for all. \u25b6FIND OUT MORE www.gov.wales/eu-funding OR FOLLOW US @wefowales Swansea Bay Innovation Campus is situated on a 65 acre former BP Transit site in Neath Port Talbot and is one of the few global universities with direct access onto a beach and its own seafront promenade.

        "The European Regions Research and Innovation Net- work (ERRIN) is strengthening regional cooperation for research and exploring the practical aspects of smart specialisation through the \u2018learning journey\u2019 method with 10 of its member regions. In doing so, ERRIN promotes the open and rapid transfer of knowledge and best practices, thereby helping to increase the impact of regional projects. ERRIN is a Brussels-based platform of regional stakehold- ers, which aims to promote research and innovation capaci- ties across EU regions through its 14 working groups. Founded in 2001, ERRIN now has more than 120 members across 23 countries. Knowledge exchange between members is the key method used to enhance regional competitiveness, with a focus on joint actions and project partnerships to strengthen regional research and support project development. Through these actions ERRIN seeks to contribute to the implementation of European research and innovation policy, and highlight the role that smart specialisation strategies can play in developing synergies between the European Structural and Investment Funds and EU research funding to enhance regional competiveness. \u2018We aim to support the development of effective research and innovation ecosystems in the regions of the EU and encourage regional collaboration,\u2019 says Richard Tuffs , ERRIN Director. \u2018Innovation is now seen as the driver of economic develop- ment. There is a new role for regions to become more \u201cjoined- up\u201d inside and have better collaboration outside their own region. It is important to reduce the gap between innovation capacity both within regions and between regions. Europe needs all the innovation it can get,\u2019 Tuffs continues. \u25b6 ERRIN \u2013 PROMOTING REGIONAL VOICES IN EUROPEAN RESEARCH AND INNOVATION \u25b6SMART SPECIALISATION Smart specialisation ERRIN\u2019s Smart Specialisation working group has been exam- ining the analytical underpinning of the smart specialisation concept and sharing best practice on its implementation. Regional Innovation Strategies for Smart Specialisation (RIS3) have become a prerequisite in the development of Operational Programmes for the European Structural and Investment Funds. Smart specialisation is a key element of EU cohesion policy 2014-2020, meaning it influences spending and approaches to stimulating research and inno- vation activity. Learning journey To support research and innovation cooperation, ERRIN is involved in a European research project called \u2018SmartSpec\u2019 which includes a \u2018learning journey\u2019 to strengthen understand- ing of the concept of smart specialisation, and link theory to practice. Regions under\u00ad stand their research and innovation con\u00ad text and are the best people to develop regional innovation and smart specialisation strategies that identify and promote their competitive advantages . \u2019 \u25b6 RICHARD TUFFS \u2013 ERRIN DIRECTOR 30 30 30 ",
        "\u25b6 ERRIN \u2013 PROMOTING REGIONAL VOICES IN EUROPEAN RESEARCH AND INNOVATION The project involves 10 ERRIN member regions who organ- ise workshops where they share their smart specialisation strategies and then discuss specific aspects, such as gov- ernance issues and cluster development. \u2018The learning journey is a very rich and useful tool for learn- ing and sharing concerns, difficulties and good practices,\u2019 Tuffs explains. \u2018This process helps increase understanding and promotes the exchange of experiences and practices among regions, particularly among their representatives involved in developing smart specialisation strategies,\u2019 he adds. Additionally, the meetings in the 10 regions serve as a joint platform of partners who can work together to prepare new ideas for collaboration under the RIS3 umbrella, identifying synergies, barriers to the implementation process and new challenges for further joint projects. Creative clusters and smart specialisation One such learning journey took place in Matera, a UNESCO world heritage centre, located in the region of Basilicata, Italy. The two-day meeting focused on the role of creative clusters in smart specialisation strategies. The 10 regions participating were joined by two academics (Professor Kevin Morgan from Cardiff University [UK] and Professor Fiorenza Belussi from Padua University [IT]) for an opening day of debate and idea sharing. On the sec- ond day, representatives from Matera \u2013 including policy makers, entrepreneurs and social activists \u2013 met to discuss how the city is using its unique heritage to generate oppor- tunities for economic development. \u2018An additional aim of the learning journey is to explore the underlying theoretical basis of the smart specialisation con- cept in different regional settings and to deepen our under- standing of the strengths and weaknesses of the approach,\u2019 Tuffs explains. \u2018Feedback from regions will help strengthen the analytical underpinnings of the smart specialisation concept and con- tribute to methodological guidance for practice, generating strategic intelligence for policy makers,\u2019 he says. Key role in research and innovation Regions can and must play a crucial role in the development and implementation of the EU\u2019s Horizon 2020 programme, Tuffs stresses. \u2018Regions understand their research and innovation context and are the best people to develop regional innovation and smart specialisation strategies that identify and promote their competitive advantages.\u2019 He continues, \u2018Once they have built smart specialisation strategies to support their region, they then need to encourage active networking with other regions across Europe and farther afield to transfer know- ledge, build partnerships and support trade opportunities.\u2019 It is through truly bottom-up smart specialisation strategies that regions can identify their competitive advantages. European investment can then be targeted to these priori- ties in order to ensure maximum impact. \u25b6FIND OUT MORE www.errin.eu \u25b6 Some Brussels representatives of the partner regions of the PLACES project: (LEFT TO RIGHT) Zoltan Balogh, Claire Robertson, Henriette Hansen, Martina Hilger, Richard Tuffs and Anett Ruszanov. \u25b6 The ERRIN Secretariat Team: (LEFT TO RIGHT) Richard Tuffs, Anett Ruszanov, Ryan Titey, and Andrea Lagundzija. 31 panorama [WINTER 2015 \u25b6 No. 55] ",
        "68 % 12 % 19 % After 25 years of cross-border cooperation, significant economic potential remains untapped in border areas due to a lack of trust or occasional negative attitudes among neighbouring countries. To help ensure that future investments are as effective as possible, the Directorate General for Regional and Urban Policy has carried out the first ever Eurobarometer survey to explore the attitudes of citizens living in border areas. One-third of EU citizens live in border areas and cooperation between neighbouring regions or countries often has a direct or indirect impact on their lives. European Territorial Co- operation (the Interreg programmes) aims to help overcome any obstacles these citizens may face. The European Commission hopes to use the results of this Eurobarometer survey, which measures the views and atti- tudes of people living in EU border regions, to address reported obstacles. The identification and mapping of these attitudes of can help improve the targeting of EU pro- jects and investments. The results were generally positive, but some more negative trends also emerged, which need to be tackled through programmes and action by managing authorities. Two-thirds of the border population are not familiar with Interreg Broadly speaking, 34 % of respondents are aware of EU investments in general, and 75 % are positive about the impacts that EU funds can make on the lives of taxpayers. But an important figure to reflect upon is that the majority (68 %) of people living in border areas are not aware of EU-funded cross-border cooperation activities in their regions. Some 12 % know what they are, and around 19 % have heard of them, but do not know exactly what they are. \u25b6 INTERREG AT 25 CELEBRATIONS AND A EUROBAROMETER SURVEY MARK THE MILESTONE Building on existing trust There is, however, a solid base on which to start improving cross-border collaboration as the majority of Europeans trust each other.

They are, however, less likely to be comfortable with having a citizen of another Member State as a manager (49 %). Some 55 % of respondents say living near the border with a partner country has no impact, while 37 % consider it an opportunity, and 4 % consider it to be an obstacle. Solving problems, removing obstacles What makes cross border cooperation difficult? Citizens interviewed for the survey gave clear indications. First of all, they are well aware that cross-border cooperation is a dif- ficult exercise: 81 % of respondents can identify a problem in at least one issue related to cross-border cooperation. Respondents are most likely to say that language differ- ences are a problem for cooperation between their country and a partner country (57 %). Respondents in programmes involving Germany and Poland, and Germany and the Czech Republic are most likely to say language difficulties are a problem (roughly 80 %). More than 4 out of 10 respondents consider social or economic differences or legal or adminis- trative differences as problematic, while at least 3 out of 10 find that cultural differences or accessibility cause diffi- culties. Cultural differences are mentioned the most often as a problem in the area alongside the German-Polish border.

Renewing communication efforts The data collected is detailed and helpful for the work ahead. It can be broken down to the level of Member States and programmes and it is also possible to consult the results by gender, age, education or occupational activity. These insights should be considered vital for programme authorities when drafting their communication strategies for the 2014-2020 cooperation programmes. The DG for Regional and Urban Policy is already working closely with programmes authorities to ensure that the information gath- ered through this exercise is built upon. The Commission intends to conduct this survey on a regular basis in order to be able to analyse the trends that emerge and adapt its policies accordingly.

        "I must acknowledge that we have gained valuable experience from almost all aspects of the EU\u2019s cohe- sion policy given our region\u2019s loca- tion and economic situation. The Pilsen Region, located in the west- ern part of the Czech Republic, bor- ders the German Bavaria region, and therefore we have been focus- ing on implementing projects that enhance cross-border cooperation. The D5 highway, which stretches across the Pilsen region to Germany, the railway corridor connecting Prague to Nurnberg as well as the new path planed from Pilsen to Munich, are all part of the TEN-T network, which has been supported by the EU\u2019s cohesion fund programmes. The city of Pilsen, the region\u2019s capital, is the fourth largest city in the Czech Republic with nearly 200 000 inhabitants, but the rest of the region remains predominantly rural. That is why we\u2019re I consider it a privilege to be a pro- fessional part of the partnership and consensus-building in such an important area as cohesion policy. On the whole, I can be considered a gen- uine supporter of cohesion policy. After 16-17 years as head of the man- aging authority for the ERDF and \u2013 since 2004 \u2013 also for the ESF in Denmark, my support, however, has become subject to a number of prerequisites: cohesion policy must remain focused on growth and development. Cohesion policy must therefore be about clear strategic choices and at the same time results-driven initiatives. Equally, it must be place-based, with tangible initiatives given priority and put into effect. Cohesion policy makes sense to me if it is centred on the real socio-economic challenges of a place and its actual potential for development. This also means, for example, that it should not simply compensate for geographical characteristics, but should be based on the specific potential of these areas. The policy should not compensate for inadequate or poor govern- ance, either. Cohesion policy must not encourage a subsidy cultures nationally, regionally or locally. The champions of cohesion policy make difficult choices and decisions, execute them and stand in the firing line as regards outcome targets and critical assumptions, the eligibility of co-financing and the risks involved in an investment. Allow me therefore to strike a blow for those competent individuals involved in implementing the policy. Over the years, I have noticed that the rhetoric surrounding cohesion policy, with regard to the Structural Funds and their regula- tory framework, is often quite generic. General and non- specific speeches, often with a self-congratulatory tone, about results, flexibility, easing of administrative burdens, simplification, control, partnerships or specialisation, are easy to make and are simply begging the question. Does it make sense to endorse a demand for flexibility, for example, without taking some of the responsibility for \u25b6 INVESTING IN KEY INFRASTRUCTURES ACROSS THE REGION \u25b6 PLACE-BASED COHESION POLICY CAN TACKLE SOCIO-ECONOMIC CHALLENGES \u25b6CZECH REPUBLIC \u25b6DENMARK what that might mean; if the demand in reality means weaker management or \u2018easy money\u2019? Does it make sense to endorse positions concerning control and demands for simplification without being aware that this can also erode the sound management of public funds like the Structural Funds? I hope you will agree with me that it does not. It is my wish that, right from the outset, the work on the neces- sary ideas, drafts and rules in the area of cohesion policy and the Structural Funds will also draw on the expertise and experience of those who know how to implement these things. In all modesty, a glance at Denmark\u2019s experience with the national initiative to ease administrative burdens across policy areas may be a source of inspiration. My thanks to Panorama for requesting a personal contri- bution to the discussion. It goes without saying that what I write is entirely without prejudice to Danish approaches and positions in various EU forums.

        "\u25b6 DEVELOPING A LOW- CARBON ECONOMY WHILE BOOSTING EMPLOYMENT \u25b6FINLAND The European Union\u2019s regional and structural policies aim to increase its Member States\u2019 economic and social cohesion as well as reduce interregional disparities in development. In Finland, support from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) is used to improve focusing on urban development projects and on boosting competitiveness in the city of Pilsen and beyond. We have developed projects to support basic infrastructures such as roads, water supply and waste water treatment systems while bearing in mind the principle of solidarity towards less developed regions. A total of EUR 1.15 billion from the structural and cohesion funds have been invested since 2007. Without this financial support our region would be lagging behind \u2013 the progress would be much slower and undoubtedly we wouldn\u2019t be able to reach the threshold of 75 % of EU average GDP in the near future. To maintain a positive growth, we\u2019re committed to con- tinue the work we have been doing since 2007. Compared to the previous programming period, there is now a clear shift towards much more sophisticated projects focusing on a range of areas including Research & Development, education, renew- able energy and competitiveness. I\u2019m glad that the reformed cohesion policy follows the legacy of previous programming periods, while at the same time fea- turing new tools such as the Integrated Territorial Investments or Community-led Local Development, which truly position the structural operations in the right direction. On the other hand, this requires substantial change in strategies to iden- tify respective stakeholders \u2013 a particularly challenging task in Member States like the Czech Republic, where we are used to applying strictly sectorial approaches to project design and implementation. I am truly happy to learn that the new cohe- sion policy programmes are now much simpler. I\u2019m also glad that this is one of the matters at the top of Commissioner Cre\u021bu \u2019s agenda, and we strongly support her efforts to sim- plify the projects\u2019 bureaucratic procedures.

Support provided by the European Social Fund (ESF) is used to promote employment and a functional workplace, improve knowledge and skills, and ensure social inclusion of the most disadvantaged groups. Finland\u2019s Operational Programme is called \u2018Sustainable growth and jobs 2014-2020\u2019. This structural funds pro- gramme features 5 priority axes and 13 specific objectives, and each project is expected to deliver at least one of these specific objectives. In Finland, the EU structural fund pro- gramme findings for the period 2014-2020 reaches nearly EUR 1.3 billion. Along with national co-funding (50 %), there is approximately EUR 2.6 billion in public funding available. Finland\u2019s Structural Fund programme features five policy areas, which serve to, in particular, promote SME competitive- ness and employment. The overarching theme is promot- ing a low-carbon economy. The Structural Fund programme realises the Europe 2020 targets. The programme\u2019s main objectives include: generating new business, boosting SME company growth and internationalisation; boosting innova- tion and enhancing knowledge; broadening the use of renew- able energies and increasing energy and material efficiency. The programme also targets youth employment and aims at providing support to those in weaker positions within the labour market. Stepping up efforts to improve work pro- ductivity and occupational well-being, as well as improving education services and preventing discrimination are also among the programme\u2019s main goals. The programme will be implemented throughout Finland, except in \u00c5land. Key ERDF thematic objectives include enhancing the com- petitiveness of SMEs, producing and using new informa- tion and knowledge, and promoting a low-carbon economy. In addition, the key ESF thematic objectives focus on employ- ment and labour mobility, education, skills and lifelong learn- ing, as well as social inclusion.

It focuses on the European Regional Devel- opment Fund (ERDF) and the Cohesion Fund (CF). The study\u2019s purpose was to collect data on the cumulative allocations to selected projects and the expenditures of both ERDF and CF programmes at the NUTS-3 level of EU regions for all 28 EU Member States. It covered the convergence, Regional Competitiveness and Employment (RCE) as well as the European Territorial Cooperation (ETC) objectives for the period 2007-2013. Data was collected, with the support of a network of national experts, from the Managing Authorities at NUTS-3 level where available and broken down by 86 priority themes. Where data was not available, estimates were performed. The collected and estimated data have been stored in two easy-to-use databases for the periods 2007 to 2014 and 2000 to 2014, so that data are available for further use by the Commission, researchers and the general public. The study also integrates data on the 2000-2006 program- ming period that was created by a previous study. This data will be used for two macroeconomic evaluations on the effect of cohesion policy on, for instance, GDP and employment. The data is available for the research commu- nity at large. Results have also been published in the form of maps, to provide first insights on the regional distribution of ERDF and CF allocations and expenditure and their trends. \u25b6FIND OUT MORE http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/policy/ evaluations/ec/2007-2013/#1 SEE WORK PACKAGE 13 \u2013 GEOGRAPHY OF EXPENDITURE \u25b6COHESION POLICY EVALUATION 38 ",

First place in the European Public Communications awards went to a Dutch public-awareness campaign called \u2018Kijkdagen \u2013 Europa om de hoek\u2019, that shows how European funding is being used in neighbourhoods, cities and regions of the Netherlands. This year\u2019s campaign featured videos dedicated to 12 projects: one from each Dutch province. Second prize was awarded to \u2018Notre pays bouge, l\u2019Europe s\u2019engage\u2019, a French national television campaign that high- lighted the impact of EU funding on individuals and their businesses. The French Commissariat for Territorial Equality in collaboration with regional partners produced a series of 66 spots of 30 seconds\u2019 length broadcast on national television over six months. Third prize went to \u2018Let\u2019s Create Together Bulgaria 2020\u2019, organised by the Bulgarian minis- try for EU funds.

Cohesion policy investments in the Circular Economy have been significant over the last two decades (more than EUR 6 billion alone over 2007-2013), not least in the area of waste management, supporting Member States to close land- fills, invest in incineration where strongly justified and espe- cially in developing recycling and re-use. In parallel, more and more regions have started to invest in advanced and innovative industrial symbiosis programmes, Cradle to Cradle approaches or targeted resource efficiency projects in SMEs. For 2014-2020 with the reformed policy and the much stronger focus (with the mandatory ring-fencing) on innova- tion, low-carbon economy and resource efficiency, many Oper- ational Programmes now include significant investments directly linked to the Circular Economy, be it on design/eco- design and product conception, the bio-economy, industrial symbiosis, new business models or energy efficiency. \u25b6FIND OUT MORE http://ec.europa.eu/environment/ circular-economy/index_en.htm 41 panorama [WINTER 2015 \u25b6 No. 55] ",
        "EUROPE\u2019S CITIES IN THE SPOTLIGHT During the EU Open Days, MEP Lambert Van Nistelrooij launched his new book \u2018Cities in the spotlight\u2019 about the importance of an integrated policy for cities. Today, almost three out of four Europeans live in cities, which are more and more seen as engines for economic growth and the creators of jobs. However, previously cities in the \u2018Europe of the regions\u2019 played a supporting role: EU policy in this area is still rather fragmented and a coherent link between the existing policies is needed. The Netherlands hopes to play an important role here, and the Urban Agenda is to be a focal point during the Dutch EU Presidency, with a \u2018Pact of Amsterdam\u2019 foreseen proposing a bottom-up approach where cities play a key role and are empowered. Van Nistelrooij\u2019s book outlines the chal- lenges cities face and some of the proposed solutions. \u25b6FIND OUT MORE http://issuu.com/eppgroup/docs/schijnwerpers_op_de_stad_ PUBLIC PROCUREMENT GUIDANCE New guidelines published by the Commission will help public officials across the EU identify and avoid the most frequent errors in public procurement of projects co-financed by the European Structural and Investment Funds. In line with the initiative for an \u2018EU budget focused on results\u2019, the Commission is acting to ensure that tax payers\u2019 money is spent efficiently and transparently. Nearly half of the ESI Fund allocations are channelled into the real economy through public procurement. Commissioner for Regional Policy Corina Cre\u0163u said: \u2018One of my priorities is to help Member States improve the way they manage and invest EU funds and these guidelines are a precious tool to this end. I believe that making less mistakes in public procurement will both ensure that EU investments deliver quicker on our jobs and growth objec- tives and that the EU Budget is safeguarded.\u2019 Most common errors in public procurement result from insufficient administrative capacity. This is why the Com- mission\u2019s action in enhancing administrative capacity and improving management and control systems is crucial to comprehensively tackle the issue. \u25b6FIND OUT MORE http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/policy/how/ improving-investment/public-procurement ITI HELPS LOCALISE INVESTMENTS A new Commission guide aims to clarify the use of Inte- grated Territorial Investments when implementing the Europe 2020 strategy. Integrated Territorial Investment (ITI) is a new tool for use during the ESI Funds programming period which aims to make it easier to run territorial strategies that require funding from different sources. ITI also promotes a more local or \u2018place-based\u2019 form of policy making. T his approach provokes many questions: What should a territorial strategy look like? How can different funds be combined? How should a delegation be structured? And how can outputs and results be measured? To illustrate the complete process, the guide sets out four scenarios, each describing how ITI can be used in practice. These scenarios clarify ITI\u2019s link to several provisions in the rel- evant regulations and at the same time underline its relevance to the wider concept of an integrated territorial approach. \u25b6FIND OUT MORE http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/information/ publications/reports/2015/scenarios-for-integrated- territorial-investments \u25b6NEWS 42 ",

        "\u25b6 SOL ARLEAP \u2013 MORE SOL AR ENERGY TO SOUTHWEST FINL AND \u25b6FINLAND The SOLARLEAP project aims at removing obstacles that stand in the way of broader use of solar energy in South- west Finland. The SOLARLEAP project arranges for peo- ple to continue their education, carries out pilot projects and aims at developing permit and building guidelines. There is untapped solar energy potential in Southwest Finland, despite the fact that the annual solar radiation amount of the area is similar to north Germany, where solar energy use is widespread. In recent years solar energy systems have become more affordable for homeowners, however increasing the use of solar energy is hindered by the inad- equate knowledge base of system providers and by the difficulty to combine different energy systems. Solving these problems is the starting point of SOLARLEAP, a two-year research and development project funded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the cities of the south-western coast (the LOURA network). The project is set in motion by Turku University of Applied Sciences, while Turku Vocational Institute acts as a project partner. In addition, the southwest Finland project works in close cooperation with the solar energy project carried out by Satakunta University of Applied Sciences. Training and pilots The project consists of continuing education programmes targeted at companies, the development of installation instructions and documentation, and implementation at a range of pilot sites. The first solar energy system was installed in 2015 and others will be installed in 2016. At the beginning of the project, a survey is conducted in order to find potential solar energy sites (factors such as the site\u2019s solar energy potential, shading and security of installation are taken in consideration). Based on the survey, approximately ten pilot sites are selected for project design and installation of solar energy products. The pilot sites also provide informa- tion on the energy generated by the systems. At the same time, they allow project partners to test the efficiency and usefulness of installation methods, instructions and docu- ments. One of the project\u2019s outputs is a verified and detailed installation document, which reports the specifications of cor- rect installation for solar energy systems. The overall goal is to improve the competence of companies and other parties involved in the management of compre- hensive solar energy system deliveries, system consolida- tion and profitability evaluation. As operations become more established, it will be easier for the party ordering a solar energy system to post deliveries to tendering and to ensure installation quality. Over the long term, small solar energy plants connected to the grid may constitute a significant supplement to carbon neutral, clean energy production.

Since 2009 some 14 medical research projects ranging from cancer to arthritis treatment have been undertaken at two leading medical research centres in central France: CHU (Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Clermont-Ferrand) and Le Centre Jean Perrin. The projects are paving the way to providing much-needed research and drug develop- ment to replace existing medicines and offer new forms of treatment. CIRMEN project Clermont-Ferrand hosts the Jean Perrin Centre for cancer research, within which a specialist Centre for Innovation and Research in Nuclear Medicine, CIRMEN, has been created. The CIRMEN project aims to accelerate the development and creation of radiophamaceuticals \u2013 drugs that contain radio- active materials called radioisotopes. New funding helps the Centre move from basic research to clinical research. CIRMEN is equipped with an experimental radiopharmaco- logical facility, which will permit testing and screening for cancers such as melanoma, and for bone disorders such as arthritis and chondrosarcoma. Funding has also helped acquire a second PETSCAN machine, an ultra-sophisticated machine that has revolutionised cancer treatment. This PETSCAN will be used for conventional care and research. METAPAIN The METAPAIN project, also at the Jean Perrin Centre, is devel- oping a new specialty painkiller which is urgently needed as a substitute for the painkiller Di-antalvic, which has been withdrawn from the market. The Analgesia Partnership brings together academic and industrial skills to develop a new treat- ment combining two analgesic painkillers. With increased analytical capacity, the consortium will be able to progress from proof of concept, to dosage testing and clinical trials, through to commercial marketing. The University Hospital\u2019s Analgesia Institute will be the leading European institute dedicated to pain relief research, thereby increasing the ana- lytical capacity for testing drugs such as antidepressants, paracetamol and anti-migraine, and developing new products required by cluster members. Molecular genetics platform Another investment was made in the development of a molec- ular genetics platform at Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Clermont-Ferrand. This platform is dedicated to genetic research and will permit \u2018Next Generation Sequencing\u2019 to help develop personalised medicine for cancer treatment. Today the cost of sequencing has fallen dramatically to EUR 1 000 for 10 genomes. Now it is possible to improve pre- diction and prevention, and reduce the risks of, for example, hereditary cancers.

        "\u25b6 FORMER CAR PARK TRANSFORMED INTO LEARNING NEIGHBOURHOOD \u25b6GERMANY Robinsbalje Centre, Germany\u2019s first \u2018learning neigh- bourhood\u2019 offers education, health and employment services to migrant and disadvantaged families in one facility. Grouping a grammar school and kindergarten with easy-to-access healthcare, social welfare services and a sports clubs allows often-marginalised families to learn about and use other services when dropping their children off at school. Many public and non-governmental institutions joined forces to transform a former car park in an impoverished neigh- bourhood into premises which give residents better prospects for the future. Since 2010, the Robinsbalje centre connects education with social inclusion and urban regeneration. With financial support of EUR 1.3 million from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the potent cooperation between numerous partners gave the Robinsbalje neighbour- hood and its residents a place to learn, play and receive vital care. The project is an excellent example of working to achieve the Europe 2020 objective of socially inclusive growth. The centre supports school drop-outs coming back into edu- cation and aims to reduce mental barriers to traditional edu- cation systems. It also strives to bring people, especially youth and women, into work by offering job counselling, coaching and extended childcare services for working parents. As EU Member States work to integrate migrant families into their societies, the Robinsbalje project can serve as a model for two main reasons. First, it proactively involves people from different backgrounds into the project. Second, it com- bines a broad range of services, ranging from health care and social matters to job counselling and support for migrant families, into a single, accessible location. Additionally, the school buildings, not in use during the evening and weekends, serve as community space for other activities. By rethinking the traditional role of the school and widening the understanding of education, the Robinsbalje centre has become a unique, open \u2018learning neighbourhood centre\u2019. Based on this renowned experience, Bremen has developed a second education centre with even more functions, again with ERDF support. The newly opened Morgenland centre not only provides stabilising services for its marginalised quarter, but also for all of the district\u2019s schools and other educational institutions to improve their network. Located in one of Bremen\u2019s disadvantaged neighbourhoods, the Robinsbalje was a long-awaited catalyst for urban reha- bilitation in the area. Cooperation between the city\u2019s adminis- trative units was crucial for the project, leading to important synergies and new impulses for additional projects. By investing in education and social inclusion, and creating a sustainable network amongst partner institutions, the neighbourhood is integrating disadvantaged groups into Germany\u2019s future. \u25b6 FIND OUT MORE www.105.schule.bremen.de/ Total cost: EUR 2 765 000 EU contribution: EUR 1 319 000 \u25b6PROJECTS 46 ",

Timi\u0219oara is aiming to attract big businesses through the City Business Centre (CBC), a complex of five green, A-class office buildings right in the middle of the city. Launched in 2007, the CBC complex encompasses over 43 000 square metres of office space, and has become the regional home for many top-tier businesses. Two of the five CBC buildings were developed with the financial sup- port of the European Regional Development Fund (Regional Operational Programme 2007-2013). CBC was designed to be a complete one-stop-shop for local and international firms and, alongside office space, the com- plex also offers underground parking for 650 cars, a restau- rant, green areas, banking and medical public services and 24-hour security. CBC\u2019s state-of-the-art buildings offer global corporations a world class office space in the very heart of Timi\u0219oara and provide tenants with all their practical needs. Leading com- panies have been attracted by the infrastructure and green design. It is currently home to more than 50 companies includ- ing IBM, Accenture, Alcatel-Lucent, Unicredit and Deloitte. Award-winning design The project\u2019s success is due to the growing need for high quality space in Timi\u0219oara and its progressive concept. The buildings were designed by Romania\u2019s most contemporary architects, Andreescu & Gaivoronski, already laureates of numerous national and international awards. The designers opted for originality and modernity, but also strived to ensure a pleasant and creative working environment for tenants. CBC was one of five projects chosen to represent Romania at the European Prize for Architecture 2009. It also won \u2018Office Development of the Year\u2019 at the South Eastern European Real Estate Awards (2009). Finally, the complex also won the title of \u2018Green Building of the Year\u2019, by the Romania Green Building Council. Judges highlighted the special technologies used for complex buildings.
