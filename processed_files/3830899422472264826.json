        "Country Synthesis Report \u2013 Cyprus 10 Executive summary 1 Background The country synthesis report covers the programming period up until the end of 2014 and includes the analysis of expenditure, outputs and results in Cyprus across all policy themes. It builds on the Human Capital and Social Inclusion ex post evaluations, Annual Implementation Reports and on other available ESF evaluations carried out in Cyprus. 1. Policy challenges addressed by the ESF The socio-economic trends over the programming period 2007-2013 show a constant downward trend for the employment rates, mainly after the crisis in 2008. The employment rate for women was stagnating until 2011, followed by a sharp downward trend. The overall employment rate (15-64 years-old) fell from 71% in 2007 (80% for 1 All figures are from the 2014 AIR as published in the SFC. Headline figures and key findings \uf0b7 Total ESF funding: EUR 141 million of which 85% is EU funding \uf0b7 The implementation rate at the end of 2014 is around 77.7% (AIR 2014) \uf0b7 Cyprus has one ESF OP with two broad objectives as described in the relevant Priority Axes: - Improvement of human resources and increasing the adaptability of the private and public sectors (Priority Axis 1) - Attracting and retaining more people in employment and strengthening social inclusion (Priority Axis 2). \uf0b7 Percentage of allocated expenditure to the biggest two themes: 51.9% for Human Capital and 44.1% for Social Inclusion while the remaining 4% is allocated to the horizontal technical assistance of the Operational Programme \uf0b7 Total number of participations: 40,278 (according to the AIR 2014); 61% in Social inclusion and 39% Human capital interventions \uf0b7 Of the total number of participants 12% are young people, 28% unemployed and 10% with low educational attainment (ISCED 1 and 2) \uf0b7 Relevant coverage rates (average 2007-2014) - percentage of unemployed (15-24) served by the PES network and placed in private sector jobs: 6.5% M, 6.8% W - percentage of unemployed (18-30) served by the PES network and placed in private sector jobs: 4.4% M, 3.9% W - percentage of registered unemployed young people who are offered employment opportunities in the form of job placements, training opportunity or work experience etc., within six months: 21.2% M, 27% W \uf0b7 Main results - 1,499 enterprises (VSE and SMEs) who completed specialised mentoring programmes, advisory services and training - 308 public officers who successfully completed training programmes \uf0b7 The OP design and implementation provided much needed support to tackle key socio-economic problems of Cyprus, especially during the years of the economic crisis (2012 -2015) \uf0b7 The ESF has proved to be the right tool to pilot and develop existing methodologies, especially with regard to social inclusion. New target groups like disadvantaged students and their parents have been supported. ",
        "Country Synthesis Report \u2013 Cyprus 11 males and 63% for females) to 62% in 2013 (67% for males and 57% for females). Similarly, the employment rates for older people (55-64 years-old) dropped from 56% in 2008 to 50% in 2013 and the rate for young people (15-24) from 37% to 23%. Also the rate for NEET showed an increase and doubled from 9% in 2007 to more than 18% in 2013. Unemployment for more than 12 months has also escalated to record levels and is still increasing (end of 2015). Curbing growing unemployment, including long-term unemployment, has emerged as the most urgent social and economic challenge. The main challenges identified in Country Specific Recommendations (CSR) were addressed to the following topics: \uf0b7 Increasing the participation of women in training and the labour market; \uf0b7 Increasing employment and training opportunities for young people; \uf0b7 Expanding lifelong learning (for the low skilled, unemployed, disadvantaged groups, women and older workers); \uf0b7 Addressing the high at-risk-of-poverty rate for the elderly; \uf0b7 In relation to Human Capital, reforms to VET and the apprenticeship scheme were recommended. The HC policy priorities align well with some of the Lisbon and Europe 2020 strategies targets and priorities. In the OP, the focus lies on reducing early school leaving, promoting lifelong learning and developing vocational training, including through in-work training. Improving reading, mathematics and science skills for 15 years-old is supported through the up skilling of teachers and through initiatives targeted at areas with high incidence of early school leaving. Higher education completion, early years\u2019 participation and international mobility do not particularly feature in Cyprus\u2019 ESF HC activities. Concerning the ESF contribution to the implementation of the SI relevant EU level priorities, the ex-ante evaluation of the OP revealed direct and solid coherence of the strategy selected for the OP. ESF SI investment was linked to Europe 2020 targets and various areas highlighted in the Recommendation on active inclusion. The methodology of the present research project envisaged that each Axis is associated only to one, the most relevant, policy theme. This means that there is not a Priority Axis fully devoted to Access to Employment, although it can be expected that relevant interventions are embodied in the Axis on Social Inclusion. That said, it is worth recalling that for the first part of the 2007-2013 programming period, in monetary terms, A2E related challenges were not considered as a priority in Cyprus. This is understandable, as until that time the labour market was booming. Employment rates were impressive and the unemployment rate was corresponding to full employment levels. During the second part of the programming period, this picture started to change, as the employment rates started to decrease both for males and females, and eventually, the economic crisis and the consequent deteriorating conditions in the labour market had changed the picture dramatically. Employment levels have fallen substantially and unemployment escalated to record levels. Youth unemployment in particular reached 38.9% in 2013, an increase of 11% between 2012 and 2013. Long-term unemployment has also increased rapidly, from 1.3% in 2011 to 3.6% in 2012 and 6.1% in 2013. In effect, a decrease in the growing unemployment \u2013 including the long-term unemployment \u2013 has emerged as the most urgent social and economic challenge. To this end, the country concluded on an Action Plan for Youth Employment, part of which is the Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan, which has been submitted to the Commission at the end of 2013. As an overall conclusion, it should be noted that the rapidly changed socioeconomic environment in Cyprus had led to a necessary modification of the OP in 2013. Changes concerned the OP\u2019s strategic objectives, the prioritisation of interventions and the respective funds redistribution, which seem to be realistic for the effective implementation of the OP. Due to the economic crisis in Cyprus, financial resources were transferred from Priority Axis 1 \u2018Increase of participation in lifelong learning through the upgrading of educational and training programs\u2019 to Priority Axis 2 \u2018Expansion of the labour market and social cohesion\u2019. The additional resources requested will be allocated explicitly for the employment of the unemployed, mainly through incentive schemes. ",
        "Country Synthesis Report \u2013 Cyprus 12 2. The scale of ESF investment Funding: Cyprus allocated EUR 140,904,888 total funding to ESF with an EU financing of EUR 119,769,154 for the programming period 2007-2013, a rate of co-financing of up to 85%. 2 Regarding the financial volume by theme, 52% (EUR 73 million) were allocated to Human Capital (PA1) and 44% (EUR 62 million) to Social Inclusion (PA2). Nearly 77% of the allocated financial volume for Human Capital was spent by the end of 2014. The implementation rate for Social Inclusion is lower, 57.6%. For technical assistance the absorption is higher than total funding (implementation rate 111%). Participations: In total, there were approximately 40,000 participations 3 in the interventions funded by the ESF, of which 61% (24,000) participated in the interventions funded by the theme Social Inclusion (PA2) and 39% (16,000) were supported under the theme Human Capital 4 . However, it must be noted that there exist some overlaps between themes. Priority Axis 1 (Improvement of human resources and increasing the adaptability of the private and public sectors) is related to Human Capital, but some interventions could be also attributed to the Theme Adaptability. Furthermore, as previously said, some interventions in Priority Axis 2 (Attracting and retaining more people in employment and strengthening social inclusion) (which in this report completely relates to \u2018Social Inclusion\u2019) are also aimed at promoting access to employment. In terms of participants to ESF actions, about 50% of them are employed (mainly participants of actions funded under the Human Capital theme), more than a third of all participants were unemployed (29% unemployed plus 10% LTU) and the share of inactive people is around 11%. The proportion of women participants is 62%. Examining the share of women participants by theme, one can see that the proportion is highest in Social Inclusion (68%) and just over a half (53%) in the Human Capital theme. Concerning educational status, people with high education (tertiary education, ISCED 5 and 6) make up more than half of all participants according to the AIR 2014. Among vulnerable groups migrants represent the biggest share, but with high variations across the themes (1.4% for Human Capital and 37% for Social Inclusion). The second biggest group is the one of young people (15-24 years-old), which is largely supported by the theme Social Inclusion. 3. The effectiveness of interventions In the case of Cyprus, it is difficult to calculate the effectiveness of the interventions based on output and results indicators as no targets were set and result indicators were mostly expressed in percentage. Overall, by the end of 2014, 15,597 people were supported within the Human Capital theme and 24,428 people within Social Inclusion. The output indicators of the Human Capital theme show that by the end of 2014: \uf0b7 378 Apprentices were integrated \uf0b7 736 Adults participated in Lifelong Learning activities and programs \uf0b7 8,374 Teachers participated in training programs \uf0b7 8 Educational priority zones were created/strengthened \uf0b7 67 Standards of professional qualifications were developed \uf0b7 1,722 Enterprises (VSE and SMEs) were involved in specialised mentoring programmes, advisory services and training 2 Cyprus benefited from the top-up provision. 3 As one person could participate more than once, the term \u201cparticipations\u201d is used here. In the rest of the documents \u201cparticipants\u201d is used, but may include double counting of individuals. 4 According to AIR 2014, p. ",
        "Country Synthesis Report \u2013 Cyprus 13 The output indicators of the Social Inclusion theme show that by the end of 2014: \uf0b7 2,277 Economically inactive women report they have benefited from training and work experience \uf0b7 4,932 Unemployed benefited from training and work experience \uf0b7 1,135 People from socially vulnerable groups were included in training programs (2013 and 2014) \uf0b7 1,130 Unemployed persons were benefitting from employment promotion actions (2010 and 2011) \uf0b7 69 Persons with disabilities benefit from employment promotion actions (2009-2011) \uf0b7 14 employment offices were created/strengthened. Main results \uf0b7 1,499 Enterprises (micro and SMEs) completed specialised mentoring advisory services and training programmes. \uf0b7 308 Public Officers who successfully completed training programs. Only main results expressed in absolute values are reported, since very few indicators are expressed in absolute values. The existing monitoring and evaluation framework does not allow a fuller understanding of the effects of the interventions. 4. The efficiency of interventions The cost per participant was lowest within the theme Social Inclusion, while Enhancing Human Capital had the highest costs. In terms of efficiency the unit costs of similar projects differ between the two programming periods. Thus, it is shown that for some of the key actions carried out, such as the involvement of teachers in training, the unit cost is close to the costs of action of the previous programming period. As for apprenticeship, implementation costs are similar to the unit cost of implementation of the previous programming period. 5. Sustainability Sustainability of results According to the most recent evaluation conducted 5 , preserving jobs is the main indicator to be considered in order to detect the sustainability of results. The evaluation implemented an in depth survey, that proved that in terms of the number of employed during the survey period the highest sustainability rate, with the proportion of employed standing at 72.3%, was achieved for participants in the \"Project Grant Employment with Flexible settings\" (Productivity Centre) while the lowest (35%) was registered in the scheme providing incentives for recruiting persons with disabilities. Sustainability of interventions According to the consulted officials, the intervention Zones of Educational Priority is considered as highly sustainable, mainly because the structures and processes that have been established since the beginning of the project are supported by permanent experienced personnel. Furthermore, there is a great demand for the services provided by the project, and there is strong evidence of potential funding in the period 2014-2020 for extending the Zones. 6. The gender sensitivity of interventions Existing evidence does not allow an assessment of the effectiveness of interventions by gender. However, looking at the gender proportion of beneficiaries of the OP\u2019s interventions we see that the proportion of women is higher than that of men, at 62%. Looking at the share of women by theme, we can see that the proportion is highest for Social Inclusion (68%), and slightly more than the half (53%) in the Human Capital theme. 5 REMACO SA \u201eStudy on the Effectiveness and Efficiency of the OP\u201c . p.136 ",
        "Country Synthesis Report \u2013 Cyprus 14 7. Community added value of ESF investment Some effects from the Cyprus ESF OP can be identified. The analysis of the ESF budget and of the actions supported shows that the ESF has contributed to enhancing the intensity of actions that the country traditionally funds. In that sense activities in enhancing human capital, and actions like training and gaining job experience, contribute largely to provide added value. Thanks to ESF support, new target groups like disadvantaged students and their parents have been supported. An example of a scope effect is the ESF funding of Zones of Educational Priority as they extend the provision of schools for pupils with particular disadvantages. 8. Socio-economic impact 6 Macro-level Looking at the socio-economic trends over the period 2007-2014 one can observe a similar pattern in most of the indicators. The rates worsened from 2007 to 2013 but in 2014 most of them remained at least stable or showed a positive development. The employment rate shows a constant downward trend. The employment rate for women was stagnating until 2011, followed by a considerably downward trend. The overall employment rate (15-64 years-old) fell from 71% in 2007 (80% for males and 63% for females) to 62% in 2014. Meso level Both the field of Social Inclusion and the field of Human Capital have achieved satisfactory results in terms of limiting the effects of the crisis. The impact is also evident in the overall improvement of the educational system mainly derived by the implementation of the Zones of educational priority and by the training actions for teachers. Micro level The funding was largely used to support, through the PES network, unemployed, young unemployed and inactive. Result indicators show that 24% of registered unemployed young people have been offered a job or training opportunity or work experience within 6 months. Particularly disadvantaged pupils were supported in areas registering high early- school leaving rate. 9. Overall assessment of all evaluation criteria According to the findings of the most recent evaluation conducted for the OP 7 , the OP contribute significantly to the overall improvement of the basic socio-economic problems of Cyprus during the crisis. 10. Key lessons The strengthening of lifelong learning is among the top priorities of the Cypriot OP, and this is highly coherent with relevant CSRs. The target groups selected by the OP have been fully and narrowed down during implementation. 6 Not available data from the excisting evaluations on this topic 7 According to the Evaluation on Effectiveness and Efficiecy of the OP (REMACO S.A.), ",

        "Country Synthesis Report \u2013 Cyprus 16 Introduction This country synthesis report on Cyprus is for Evaluation Task 2B: National level analysis of the ESF 2007-2013 Ex-post Evaluation Synthesis. The purpose of the present report is to summarise the most recent and most robust evaluation evidence available, analyse the most recent data available and provide a succinct overview of the outputs, results and impacts of the ESF under the main ESF Priorities as defined in the ESF Regulation. 9 These are generally: \uf0b7 increasing adaptability of workers, enterprises and entrepreneurs with a view to improving the anticipation and positive management of economic change \uf0b7 enhancing access to employment and the sustainable inclusion in the labour market of job seekers and inactive people, preventing unemployment, in particular long-term and youth unemployment, encouraging active ageing and longer working lives, and increasing participation in the labour market \uf0b7 reinforcing the social inclusion of disadvantaged people with a view to their sustainable integration in employment and combating all forms of discrimination in the labour market \uf0b7 enhancing human capital \uf0b7 promoting partnerships, pacts and initiatives through networking of relevant stakeholders, such as the social partners and non-governmental organisations, at the transnational, national, regional and local levels in order to mobilise for reforms in the field of employment and labour market inclusiveness And, additionally, in Convergence regions: \uf0b7 expanding and improving investment in human capital \uf0b7 strengthening institutional capacity and the efficiency of public administrations and public services at national, regional and local level and, where relevant, of the social partners and non-governmental organisations, with a view to reforms, better regulation and good governance especially in the economic, employment, education, social, environmental and judicial fields The ESF achievements under each Priority have been evaluated in the following sections: Extent to which resources were used, Effectiveness, Efficiency/cost-effectiveness, Socio- economic impact, CAV, Gender sensitivity and Sustainability. For the country synthesis report, existing reports have been used emanating from EU level evaluations, in particular the recent thematic ex-post evaluations on Human Capital, Social Inclusion and Access to Employment and the reports of the ESF EEN expert evaluation network as well as national evaluation material and other relevant reports. This information has been updated by the AIRs 2014 in the case of this report Given the reliance of the country synthesis reports on existing material for the most part, there is more detailed information on some policy fields than others. This concerns mainly Human Capital, Access to Employment and Social Inclusion. However, given the high financial volume of the Priorities covered thoroughly by the thematic ex post evaluations, this difference in detailed information is not material. 9 REGULATION (EC) No 1081/2006 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 5 July 2006 Article 3, Scope of assistance.

        "Country Synthesis Report \u2013 Cyprus 17 1 Background and Context 1.1 Challenges and role/position of ESF 1.1.1 Challenges faced by the country in the different policy fields at the time of programming and during the programming period Until 2009, the Cyprus economy exhibited an impressive performance. Real GDP increased by 5.1% in 2007 and 3.6% in 2008, while unemployment and inflation rates were kept low. However, from 2009 the economy slowed down due to the international crisis - and the absence of an effective policy to fend off the negative impact of this crisis. The economic climate in Cyprus continued to worsen after 2011, revealing structural weaknesses and mounting problems from an oversized, loosely regulated and overexposure to toxic assets of the banking system. Structural weaknesses included public-private sector pay imbalances, labour and product market rigidities and other distortions keeping productivity and competitiveness low, a non-sustainable state pension system, and a wasteful social insurance and health care system. To avoid the looming bankruptcy a rescue plan was agreed with Troika (ECB, EU and IMF) in March 2013. The agreement reached provided for a substantial haircut of uninsured (over EUR 100,000) deposits held at the two main commercial banks (Bank of Cyprus and Cyprus Popular Bank). This unprecedented event was combined with the free transfer of Cypriot bank branches in Greece to Greek banks and led to the closure of Cyprus Popular Bank and the placement of the Bank of Cyprus under insolvency procedures. Following the 2013 decision for the bailing-in, the restructuring of the banking sector and the imposed restrictions on capital transactions, the country experienced an abrupt and steep reduction of economic activity, causing a further loss of jobs and increased unemployment. Looking at the socio-economic trends over the programming period 2007-2013 in more detail we can see that the employment rates show a constant downward trend. Only the employment rate for older people (55-64 years-old) showed an improvement between 2008 and 2010 and the rate for young people (15-24 years-old) slightly increased between 2007 and 2008. The employment rate for women was stagnating until 2011, followed by a considerable downward trend. The employment rate for men shows a similar pattern but on a clearly higher level than for women. The overall employment rate for the age group 15-64 fell from 71% in 2007 (80% for males and 63% for females) to 62% in 2013 (67% for males and 57% for females). Similarly, the employment rates for older people (55-64) dropped from 56% in 2008 to 50% in 2013 and the rate for young people (15-24) from 37% to 23%. The unemployment rate in Cyprus experienced one of the highest increases among the EU countries and rose from 4% in 2007 to 16% in 2013 (with the highest increase after 2011). Long-term unemployment (12 months+) also escalated at record levels and is still increasing. The rate of early school leaving (ESL) in Cyprus has halved over the period 2005 to 2013, dropping to 9.1% from 18.2%. Although the rate of ESL has been consistently higher for males rather than females, a greater reduction over the period since 2005 was observed for males compared to females. In Cyprus, in the 2007-2013 period, the risk of exclusion from the labour market has increased in the context of the economic recession and rising (long-term) unemployment. Among those groups facing particular barriers to remain in the labour market are women, young people, low-skilled and people born in a foreign country. \uf0b7 The rate for NEET showed an increase and doubled from 9% in 2007 to more than 18% in 2013. \uf0b7 The unemployment rate of low-skilled individuals was below the EU average in 2007 (5% against 11%). The prospects of low-skilled individuals deteriorated over the period considered, as their unemployment rate reached 20% in 2013. At the same time, their inactivity rate increased from 44% in 2007 to 49 % in 2013. ",
        "Country Synthesis Report \u2013 Cyprus 18 \uf0b7 The unemployment rate for foreign-born individuals rose from 6% in 2007 to 16% in 2013. However, some improvements for inactive foreign-born individuals have taken place over the 2007-2013 period. 1.1.2 CSR addressed by the ESF The main challenges identified in Country Specific Recommendations (CSR) addressed by ESF between 2004 and 2013 were as follows. \uf0b7 Increasing the participation of women in training and the labour market (2004); \uf0b7 Increasing employment and training opportunities for young people (2007, 2008, 2009) and addressing youth employment (2012); \uf0b7 Expanding lifelong learning (2007, 2008, 2009). The 2009 CSR identified as a priority access to lifelong learning opportunities for the low skilled, unemployed and disadvantaged groups, while the 2011 CSR mentioned low-skilled workers, women and older workers in this context; \uf0b7 Addressing the high at-risk-of-poverty rate for the elderly (2012); \uf0b7 In relation to Human Capital, in 2009 reforms to VET and the apprenticeship scheme were recommended. However, following the years of the financial and social crisis in Cyprus, curbing the growing unemployment \u2013 including the long-term unemployment, has emerged as the most urgent social and economic challenge. 10 1.2 Support and Contribution to the Lisbon Strategy and Europe 2020 strategy and targets ESF HC policy priorities align well with some of the Lisbon and Europe 2020 strategies, targets and priorities. In the OP, the focus lies on reducing early school leaving, promoting lifelong learning and developing vocational training, including through in-work training. Improving reading, mathematics and science skills for 15 years-old is supported through the upskilling of teachers and through initiatives targeted at areas with high incidence of early school leaving. Higher education completion, early years\u2019 participation and international mobility do not particularly feature in Cyprus\u2019 ESF HC activities. Concerning the ESF contribution to the implementation of the SI relevant EU level priorities, the ex-ante evaluation of the OP revealed direct and solid coherence of the strategy selected for the OP. ESF SI investment was linked to Europe 2020 targets and various areas highlighted in the 2008 Recommendation on active inclusion. 11 10 ESF Ex post evaluation, National Templates (Human Capital, Access to Employment, Social Inclusion). 11 Ibid.

        "Country Synthesis Report \u2013 Cyprus 19 2 Scale of ESF investment Cyprus allocated EUR 140,904,888 total funding to ESF with an EU financing of EUR 119,769,154 (85%) for the programming period 2007-2013. The 2013 modification increased the co-financing rate to 85% for all axes, following the changes to the allocation between axes. Regarding the financial volume by theme, as stated in table 2, 52% (EUR 73 million) were allocated to Human Capital (PA1), where the interventions concentrated on Lifelong Learning activities, training programmes for teachers or mentoring programmes, advisory services and training for enterprises. Access to Employment (PA2), was allocated 44% (EUR 62 million) and this was focused on training for inactive women, unemployed and vulnerable groups. Nearly 77% of the allocated financial volume for Human Capital was spent by the end of 2014. The implementation rate for Social Inclusion is lower at 57.6%. For technical assistance the absorption is already higher than total funding (implementation rate 111%). The methodology of the present research project envisaged that each Axis is associated only to one, the most relevant, policy theme. This means that there is not a Priority Axis fully devoted to Access to Employment, relevant interventions are embodied in the Axis on Social Inclusion. Table 2.

The following figures provide an overview of the employment and educational status of all participants entering over the programming period. As illustrated below around 50% of the participants were employed, and the share of self-employed participants is less than 1%. More than a third of all participants were unemployed (29% unemployed plus 10% LTU). The share of inactive people is around 11% of which only a small part is in education/training (e.g. students, pupils). Figure 1. Labour market status of participants in ESF 2007-2013 (entering) Source: own figure on the basis of SFC2007 (AIR2014) The figure below shows the education status of the participants. As one can see, people with high education (tertiary education, ISCED 5 and 6) make up more than the half of all participants. This is due to both the increased levels of unemployment of highly educated people and to the high number of teachers participating in training interventions under the human capital policy field. The proportion of people with primary or lower secondary education (ISCED 1 and 2) is around 10% and those with upper secondary education is 30% of the total number of participants. 12 As one person could participate more than once, the term `participations` is used here. In the rest of the document, `participants` is used, but may include double counting of individuals. ",

Share of participants by policy field Source: own figure on the basis of SFC 2007 (AIR 2014) In the case of Cyprus, it is not possible to calculate the achievement of the output indicators, as the targets set were not included in the SFC database 13 . Looking at the outputs by theme, with reference to the table 8 in annex, we find that 15,597 participants (39%) were supported under the theme Human Capital and Adaptability and 24,428 people (61%) were supported under the theme Social Inclusion. However, it must be noted that some overlaps between themes in the Priority Axis exist. As stated above, some interventions in Priority Axis 2 (which for the purposes of this report is referred to as being completely dedicated to the ESF theme of \u2018Social Inclusion\u2019) could be also attributed to the theme \u2018Access to Employment\u2019. Increasing Adaptability and Enhancing Human Capital Under this theme 15,597 people were supported of whom 87% were employed, 10% unemployed and 3% inactive. Young and old people make up around 7% and 217 migrants (1.4% of total participants). The vast majority is well educated (66% tertiary education); this is due to the fact that a significant set of actions were addressed to teachers. With reference to table 9 in the annex, output indicators within this theme show the following numbers by the end of 2014: \uf0b7 378 apprentices were integrated in the NMA \uf0b7 736 adults participated in Lifelong Learning activities and programmes \uf0b7 8,374 teachers participated in training programmes \uf0b7 8 educational priority zones were created/strengthened \uf0b7 67 standards of professional qualifications developed \uf0b7 1,722 enterprises (VSE and SMEs) were involved in specialized mentoring programmes, advisory services and training Reinforcing Social Inclusion Overall, 24,428 people were supported under PA2, corresponding mainly to Social Inclusion. The majority (56%) was unemployed (of which 28% LTU), the share of employed participants is around 27% and the share of inactive amounts to 16% of total participants. Regarding the share of vulnerable groups, it is noticeable that 37% of all participants are migrants. The second and third largest group amongst the vulnerable are others (17%) and young people (15% age 15-24) while this theme registers also the 13 Source: SFC ",
        "Country Synthesis Report \u2013 Cyprus 23 highest proportions of people with tertiary education (42%) and upper secondary education (36%). This is due to the fact that the relevant PA covers also interventions to promote access to employment of young people, the majority of which has high educational attainment. Within this theme, output indicators by the end of 2014 show the following: \uf0b7 2,277 economically inactive women benefit from training and work experience \uf0b7 4,932 unemployed were benefiting from training and work experience \uf0b7 1,135 people from socially vulnerable groups were included in training programmes (2013 and 2014) \uf0b7 1,130 unemployed persons were benefitting from employment promotion actions (2010 and 2011) \uf0b7 69 persons with disabilities benefit from employment promotion actions (2009-2011) \uf0b7 14 employment offices were created/strengthened. 3.1.2 Results In the case of Cyprus, it is not possible to calculate the achievement of the output and results indicators, as no targets were set. Furthermore, most result indicators are expressed in percentage values, making it difficult to aggregate them. Main results expressed in absolute values are presented below. Main results \uf0b7 1,499 Enterprises (VSE and SMEs) who completed specialized mentoring programmes, advisory services and training \uf0b7 308 public officers who completed training programmes. Increasing Adaptability and Enhancing Human Capital One major result of the Priority Axis is the overall positive achievement of the completed Educational Zones. Today there are eight Educational Zones in four urban centres in Cyprus and four information and psychosocial support centres that are running pilots. An evaluation carried out in the past (for the 2004-2006 period) for the institution of Educational Zones showed that the approach considered was an appropriate solution to the problems of early school leavers (which is one of the major strategic indicators of the OP), of illiteracy and of the rapid increase in the number of foreign language students, who are threatened with social exclusion. Under the same strategic target of reducing school leavers, the New Modern Apprentice (NMA) is being promoted as an alternative means of educating pupils in vocational training and who leave the formal education system, of course with the perspective to meeting the labour market needs. Although with reference to the table 9 in annex there are no available results recorded, it is documented that more than 378 pupils have been integrated to the NMA since 2012, the first year of integration. Reinforcing Social Inclusion Within this theme, and the first Specific Objective dedicated to the increase of labour supply and employment rate of women, the result indicators show that the percentage of unemployed supported by the network of PES and who are placed in private sector jobs is around 5%, slightly higher for men than for women. In reference to the 2 nd Specific Objective \"Increase labour supply and employment of young people\" over the period 2007-2014, the results on registered unemployed young people who are given a new opportunity in the form of job placement, training opportunity or work experience within a period of six months was between 21% for men and 27% for women. By 2014, more than 4,932 people had benefitted from two grant schemes, by far in excess of the 2,500 which was the target until the end of the programming period (2015). These schemes are the two projects: \"Improving the employability of the unemployed\" and \"Unemployed young graduates to acquire work experience in companies/organisations\". The implementation rate of the relevant indicator stands at 197.3%. ",
        "Country Synthesis Report \u2013 Cyprus 24 Under the 3rd Specific Objective \"Broadening and upgrading the functioning of labour market institutions\", in the period 2007-2014 the relevant results indicators indicated that some progress was achieved only in the indicators: \u2018Percentage of unemployed (18- 30) served by the PES Network and placed in private sector jobs\u2019 (above 4% for the period 2007-2014); \u2018Percentage of registered young unemployed who are offered a new start opportunity in the form of job placements, training opportunity or work experience within six months\u2019 (24% for the period 2007- 2014) and \"Percentage of young people (15-24) served by the PES network and placed in jobs\u2019 (above 6% for the period 2007- 2014). It is reported that the unemployment rate in 2014 stood at 16.1%, compared to 3.7% in 2008. The unemployment rate among young people (15-24 years-old) has risen to 35.9% in 2014 from 8.8 % in 2008. Finally, in respect to the 4th Special Objective \"Increase of economically active and employed persons among the vulnerable social groups\", there are no specifically recorded data on the percentage of individuals of vulnerable groups that remain in jobs six months after the end of the subsidy. However, it is expected that more than 1,135 people that have been included in training programmes will have gained working experience or qualifications, compared with 1,000, which is the target by the end of the programming period. The implementation rate of output indicator \"People from vulnerable social groups included in training\" amounts to 113.5%. 3.2 Evidence of effectiveness The existing monitoring and evaluation framework does not allow a comprehensive understanding of the medium and longer term effects of the interventions. In addition, the absence of specific thematic evaluations calls for more detailed data monitoring and evaluation in the future. 14 An impact evaluation study is expected to be delivered (to the Directorate-General for European Programmes, Coordination and Development); and which is expected to provide with related data. 15 However, according to the findings of the most recent evaluation conducted for the OP 16 , the programme contributed significantly to the overall improvement of the basic socio-economic problems of Cyprus during the crisis. 14 ESF Ex post evaluation, National Template Social Inclusion 15 Evaluation Study on: Provision of Services for the Assessment of Achievements of Assistance from the OPs (1) \"Competitiveness and Sustainable Development\" and (2) \"Employment, Human Capital and Social Cohesion\" to Facilitate Access to Employment and Sustainable Integration of People in the LM. 16 According to the Evaluation on Effectiveness and Efficiency of the OP (REMACO S.A.), ",

In terms of efficiency and in terms of unit costs, it can be stated that these differ between the two programming periods for projects on integration or similar ones. For some of the key actions carried out, such as the involvement of teachers in training, the unit cost is close to those costs of action of the previous programming period. As for apprenticeship, implementation costs approach the unit cost of implementation of the action of the previous programming period. Table 3. Cost per participant by theme Theme Cost per output (in EUR) Enhancing Human Capital 4,686 Social Inclusion 2,545 Total average 3,520 Source: SFC 2007; Author\u2019s calculation Available information on efficiency and costs is available through the Social Inclusion thematic evaluation report. According to the report, the performance of most projects under this theme, with the exception of the project on Disability and Functioning assessment system, is in line with initial plans and budget. Concerning the project on Educational Zones, it is expected that it will deliver the initially planned outcomes and results in the approved budget frame. Concerning both Grant Schemes the cost per placement was as planned in the initial budget (although the Grant Scheme has been extended, the cost per placement remained stable). The final unit cost and unit cost per placement was of EUR 14,713 for the Grant Scheme for disabled individuals and of EUR 8,385 for the Grant Scheme for vulnerable groups (higher than planned). The lowest unit costs applied to the Greek language learning for third-country nationals project which at EUR 180 was slightly lower than planned. The estimated final unit cost of the new assessment for disability project is EUR 4,750 compared to EUR 1,260 that was planned (due to high initial in set-up costs and a lower number of assessments carried out). 17 17 Ex-post evaluation of ESF 2007-2013: Supporting the integration of disadvantaged groups into the labour market and society.

        "Country Synthesis Report \u2013 Cyprus 27 5 Sustainability Sustainability of results for individuals and entities According to the most recent evaluation on OP results 18 , preserving jobs, is the main criterion considered in order to detect the sustainability of results. Results on sustainability are only available for certain measures/schemes/projects: \uf0b7 The highest sustainability rate, with the proportion of employed standing at 72.3%, was observed for participants in \"Project Grant Employment with Flexible settings\" (Productivity Centre). \uf0b7 The second highest sustainability rate observed for the \u2018Special Incentive Scheme for Employment of Unemployed\", Department of Labour, with the proportion of employed standing at 71.9%. \uf0b7 Third in the ranking is the \"Plan of Incentives for Employment of Long-term Unemployed and Youth\" of the Labour Department, in which the employed make up 68.4% of the total. \uf0b7 Next in the list is the \"Grant Scheme for Inclusion in Employment with Flexible settings\" (Productivity Centre), in which employed make up 64.9% of the total. \uf0b7 The \"Scheme Providing Incentives for Recruiting Persons belonging to socially vulnerable groups of the population\u2019 of the Labour Department, witnessed a rate of employed at 61.7% of the total. \uf0b7 Finally, the lowest 35.0%, noted in the \"Scheme Providing Incentives for Recruiting Persons with Disabilities\u2019, Department of Labour. Sustainability of interventions Concerning the sustainability of interventions, the key actors consider their projects sustainable and expect further development of the projects in the forthcoming programming period 2014-2020 (on the basis of the interviews for the SI ex-post national report, 2014). Overall, according to the officials the intervention Zones of Educational Priority is considered as highly sustainable, mainly due to the following reasons: 1. Continuity of processes and management: Permanent experienced personnel support the structures and processes that have been established since the beginning of the project. 2. Policy Continuation: The project is the continuation of a long-standing policy as it is functioning since 2003. 3. Popularity: There is a great demand for the services provided by the project. 4. Funding potential: There is strong evidence of potential funding (ESF & National Funding) in the period 2014-2020 for extending the Zones to other areas and all educational levels below tertiary level (higher secondary and technical schools). Likewise, the Grant Schemes present a high degree of sustainability. Similar grant schemes are being funded by the Human Resources Development agency. It is worth underlining that in both cases the mid-term employment outcomes for the target groups were positive, as more than the 65% on average remained in their position two years after the end of the co-financed period (60% for the vulnerable and 70% for the disabled). With regard to the new assessment of disability and functionality system, despite the discrepancies and significant downsizing of the physical and financial objectives of the project, the project offered support to the existing system on disability evaluation which is due to be mainstreamed. As stated by both interviewees (Managing Authority and Implementation Agency), the government will continue to support the project financially and administratively, to carry on the investigation and assessment services for people with disabilities in the coming years, after the finalisation of the co-funded period. 18 REMACO SA \u201eStudy on the Effectiveness and Efficiency of the OP\u201c . p.136 ",
        "Country Synthesis Report \u2013 Cyprus 28 Concerning the Greek language training, although there are no plans for implementation of a similar intervention within the ESF programming period 2014-2020, the implementing agency argues that valuable experience has been gained through the project for designing relevant services by the national agencies within national budget lines. 19 The evaluation report of the Special Prevention Plan - HRDA Action Plan - shows that this substantially met the main goal, i.e. contributing to the tackling of the effects of the economic crisis on employment and the increase of unemployment in Cyprus. This derives from the estimates of volumes of participants themselves but primarily from the fact that about half of participants (47.6%) were employed during the period of the evaluation. Particularly strong seems to be the effects of those measures of the Scheme that combines training with employment at company level. This conclusion emanates also from the significantly higher job retention rates. These figures amounted to 83.9% in the case of \"Project Staffing Business Graduates with Higher Education\" and to 69.3% in the case of the \"Extraordinary Plan Training Unemployed in Business\". The lowest employment rates are presented in co-financed projects \"Improving Employability of the Unemployed\" and \"Improving Employability of Economically Inactive Women's Resources\". Overall, the employment retention rates are influenced by the general macroeconomic climate and the economic crisis. It is important to note that in the plans where training is linked to employment in the business, the majority of participants report a good or very good impact of their participation in finding a job (82.7% of the Special Training Plan for Unemployed in Business and 81.3% of Project Staffing Business Graduates with Higher Education). In contrast, the cases in which training did not lead to employment of participants in business was smaller. As a result of the above, concerning the Schemes for the placement of participants in enterprises, 56.4% were still employed in the business in which they were placed, with better performance of those in the Project Staffing Business Graduates with Higher Education and Special Training Plan for Unemployed in Business. These findings and the figures with the positive effects of individual characteristics should be used when designing new interventions. 19 Ex-post evaluation of ESF 2007-2013: Supporting the integration of disadvantaged groups into the labour market and society.

        "Country Synthesis Report \u2013 Cyprus 29 6 Gender sensitivity Existing information does not allow an assessment of the effectiveness of interventions by gender. However, it is worth to stress that in Cyprus, all beneficiaries of ESF must provide a certification from the Ministry of Justice and Public Order concerning the compatibility with the National and Community policy on equal opportunities between men and women. Moreover, the obligations of the Beneficiary on gender equal opportunities are included in the contract to be signed between Beneficiary and the Intermediate Body. Each of the reviewed interventions respected the principle of promoting equal opportunities and access for all. 20 Looking at the split of the beneficiaries of the OPs\u2019 interventions by gender, as illustrated in table 5, one can see that the proportion of women is higher than the proportion of men, at 62%. Looking at the share of women by theme, we can see that the proportion is the highest for Social Inclusion (68%), and slightly above half (53%) in the Human Capital theme. Table 5.

        "Country Synthesis Report \u2013 Cyprus 30 7 Community added value 7.1 Volume effects Some volume effects from the Cyprus ESF OP can be identified. The analysis of the ESF budget and of the actions supported by ESF, shows that the it contributed to enhance the intensity of actions that the country traditionally funds. The outcome of this was that such activities as those concerning enhancing human capital, and actions like training and gaining job experience contributed to provide added value. However, throughout the latest evaluation report 21 , it is stated that the available funds through ESF are relatively limited compared to the current needs for human resources development, especially since the beginning of 2013 when the global economic crisis had severely affected Cyprus. For example, the ESF contribution to the Greek Language teaching programme, in addition to similar projects funded by other means (Cypriot solidarity funds), has supported the national goal to provide training for third-country nationals. However, based on the numbers of individuals participating and dedicated budget, it can be stated that, through ESF the volume effect has contributed directly to the national inclusion policy. The Zones of Educational Priority (ZEP) project is also contributing to the implementation of the Educational Reform in Cyprus as well as to the Social Inclusion strategy, as ESF remains (since the previous programming period 2004-2006) the main source of funding for the respective policy. 7.2 Scope effects Thanks to ESF support, new target groups like disadvantaged students and their parents have been supported. An example of a scope effect is the ESF funding of Zones of Educational Priority as they extend the provision of schools to pupils with particular disadvantages. ZEPs are selected clusters of schools in which there is a high rate of early school leaving and academic failure, as well as large number of non-Greek speaking students. The eight ZEPs in four urban centres and the four information centres offer psychosocial support. Furthermore, the provision of the Greek Language teaching programme to third-country nationals, although not innovative, was expanded thanks to ESF funding. 7.3 Role effects There is little existing evidence on the role effects in the field of equality but the final evaluation on equality issues that is imminent will make this available soon and permit one to draw some conclusions. Concerning the new system of assessing disability and functionality, ESF has allowed Cyprus to develop it further and incorporate international standards/methodologies. The project is considered to be of significant importance in an attempt to reform and modernise the existing social inclusion administration and social policies in Cyprus. The achievements of the project on a preparatory framework form a significant basis for the deployment of the actual intervention in the future. ESF supports also the further implementation of the Educational Priority Zones. In the future, the implementation of the programme will be extended also to secondary schools and technical schools. 7.4 Process effects Little evidence concerning the process effects of the reviewed interventions has been gathered so far. 22 21 REMACO SA \u201eStudy on the Effectiveness and Efficiency of the OP\u201c . 22 EEN Country Report Cyprus and Ex-post evaluation of ESF 2007-2013: Supporting the integration of disadvantaged groups into the labour market and society.

The rates worsened from 2007 to 2013 but in 2014 most of them remained at least stable or showed a positive development. The employment rate shows a constant downward trend. The employment rate for women was stagnating until 2011, followed by a considerably downward trend. The overall employment rate (15-64 years old) fell from 71% in 2007 (80% for males and 63% for females) to 62% in 2014. The unemployment rate in Cyprus experienced one of the highest increases among the EU countries and raised from 4% in 2007 to 16% in 2014 with the highest increase after 2011. In addition, the NEET rate showed an increase and doubled from 9% in 2007 to more than 18% in 2013. Table 6. Socio-economic indicators of Cyprus, 2007-2014 Source: Eurostat 8.2 Meso level At the meso level, it can be stated that interventions both in the field of Social Inclusion and in the field of Human Capital have achieved satisfactory results in terms of limiting the effects of the crisis. The impact is also evident in the overall improvement of the educational system mainly derived by the implementation of the Zones of educational priority and by the training actions for teachers. 8.3 Micro level The funding was largely used to support, through the PES network, unemployed, young unemployed and inactive. Result indicators show that 24% of registered unemployed young people have been offered a job or a training opportunity or work experience within six months. Particularly disadvantaged pupils were supported in areas registering high early-school leaving rate. 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Trendline Access to Employment Employment rate 71.0 70.9 69.0 68.9 67.6 64.6 61.7 62.1 Unemployment rate 3.9 3.7 5.4 6.3 7.9 11.9 15.9 16.1 Young people NEET, 15-24y. 9 9.7 9.9 11.7 14.6 16 18.7 17 Employment rates, Females, 15-64y. 62.4 62.9 62.3 63.0 62.1 59.4 56.9 58.6 Human capital Early school leaving 12.5 13.7 11.7 12.7 11.3 11.4 9.1 6.8 Educational attainment 46.2 47.1 45 45.3 46.2 49.9 47.8 52.5 Population at risk of poverty 25.2 23.3 23.5 24.6 24.6 27.1 27.8 27.4 Social Inclusion ",
        "Country Synthesis Report \u2013 Cyprus 32 9 Key lessons learned 9.1 What are the key lessons in terms of policy choices? The correlation with CSRs is appropriate since some policies, such as expanding lifelong learning, were among the CSRs addressed to Cyprus. At project level, in all the approved projects financed by the OP \u2018Employment, Human Capital and Social Cohesion\u2019, the interventions relevant to the \u2018Integration into the labour market\u2019 present a strong connection with the four specific objectives. Most interventions are relevant to the goal of \"Conservation of employment of workers\", followed by the interventions that are relevant to the \"Better preparedness of people to enter the labour market\" and interventions that are relevant to the objective of \"Improving employment through flexible arrangements\". Focusing on relevant issues such as creating new jobs or opportunities for entering the labour market especially dedicated to youth represented an appropriate policy choice, in line with EC recommendations and with the needs posed by the economic crisis. An important lesson learned for the new programming period is that it is useful to keep on following EC recommendations and develop international good practices (ie. ZEPs) to face major challenge for Cyprus, such as early school leaving. 9.2 What are the key lessons in terms of target groups? Regarding target groups benefitting from the programme, in the design phase their selection fitted the intervention logic. In terms of lessons learned it should be reported that during the implementation phase, there has been a greater narrowing down of the target groups. 23 . 9.3 What are the key lessons in terms of appropriate programming? In terms of appropriate programming, the actions to deal with the labour market situation caused by the crisis can be considered appropriate. In order to improve employability of the workforce Cyprus implemented direct actions likely to have a direct impact on the target groups hit most by the crisis, such as young people. More than 48% of registered young unemployed received an opportunity in the form of job placement, training opportunity or work experience. The reprogramming occurred in 2013 and the transfer of funds from Adaptability to Access to Employment proved to be effective in supporting the employability of the unemployed, also through incentive schemes. The latest evaluation (2015) regarding the assessment of interventions of the OP \u2018Employment, Human Capital and Social Cohesion\u2019 revealed some useful insights such as: (a) the specific objectives selected meet the needs facing the social structure of Cyprus and these are specified in the Partnership Agreement and included in the Operational Programme with the intervention logic, (b) the actions selected are assessed as suitable for the achievement of the Special Objective concerned (taking into account the implementation of the respective actions of the OP 2007-2013). 9.4 What are the key lessons in terms of effective implementation? Existing evidence shows that the implementation was broadly appropriate and was able to counter the effects of the economic crisis. The implementation of the Zones of Educational Priority shows that the network approach at the local level, supported by experienced permanent personnel, is likely to lead to successful results. It appears that Priority Axis 1 \"Development of Human Capital and Adaptability\" contributes more than Priority Axis 2 \"Expansion of Labour Market and Social Cohesion\" in terms of shaping the overall effectiveness of the OP. For instance, the policy tool of the Educational Zones proved to be the right solution for tackling the problem of early school 23 See the most current Evaluation report on Effectiveness and Efficiency of the OP conducted by REMACO SA ",
        "Country Synthesis Report \u2013 Cyprus 33 leaving. However, it should also be noted that after the crisis ad-hoc actions were financed mainly in PA2. With regard to training actions, an element that has proved to be successful and that can be implemented in the future is the combination of training and work at company level. 9.5 What are the key lessons in terms of monitoring? In relation to monitoring, one main lesson learned can be drawn. Data on indicators are collected by beneficiary organisations, but are not always included and properly presented within the monitoring system. A typical example of this is represented by the indicators expressed in percentages, the achievement of which should be calculated with reference to the corresponding baseline indicator. OP indicators largely meet the criteria of relevance and clarity. The indicators of Priority Axis 1 are especially relevant to each specific objective. Some issues, especially regarding relevance, arise with the indicators of Priority Axis 2. In this case, the indicators of the OP and indicators used for monitoring partially differ. Thus, for the new programming period, it is important to establish an improved monitoring system, with baseline, output and results that can be used to measure the impact in an effective way. 9.6 What are the key lessons in terms of evaluation? The availability of evaluation findings on results is scarce. This might also be due to the gaps in the monitoring system and to the scarcity of thematic evaluations. For the new programming period, the evaluations should be based on a sound analysis of indicators and compare the results of the interventions targeted to the same target groups. With regard to the new programming period, an Evaluation Plan has been approved by the Monitoring Committee in December 2015 and impact evaluations will be carried out for each Priority Axis. ",
