The current difficult economic climate has highlighted the importance of education as a catalyst for economic growth. We are also facing the effects of an ageing population and social exclusion continues to be a serious challenge for all our countries. We have to tackle the problem of 80 million low-skilled adults whose future looks increasingly marginal in a Europe that will concentrate on knowledge-intensive jobs. Access to high-quality adult learning plays a decisive role in developing better skills and compe- tences that contribute to employability and the overall competitiveness of Europe and its Member States. But we also know that learning brings equally important benefits for adults\u2019 social inclusion and personal fulfilment. Participation in learning helps people to secure a constructive and active role in their local communities and in society at large. It can help reduce health costs and the incidence of criminality, for instance, while also helping to reduce poverty. Moreover, one cannot underestimate the importance of learning for personal development and well-being. Yet, statistics show that only a small proportion of adults participates in learning, with large varia- tions between countries. Even more alarming is the fact that the EU average rate of participation in adult learning has been slowly decreasing since 2005. Decisive and concerted action is needed to reverse this trend and to achieve the commonly agreed target of having at least 15 % adult participation in learning by 2020. The European Agenda for Adult Learning, adopted in November 2011, is set to launch a concrete joint programme that makes adult learning a stronger link in the lifelong learning chain. But the first challenge we need to address is to increase participation in adult learning and to make every- one \u2013 learners, providers, stakeholders and policy makers \u2013 aware of the benefits of a high quality, easily accessible and equitable adult learning system. This European Guide is designed to help protagonists meet this challenge. It presents strategies to raise awareness of adult learning and explores how to make adult learning more popular and more accessible for target groups. All those active in adult learning in Europe are invited to draw upon these examples as a rich source of inspiration for future activities and to advocate for adult learning that is of high quality, attractive, and within reach of all citizens.

        "T his European Guide is the final deliverable of a nine-month study conducted by the Euro- pean Commission\u2019s Directorate-General for Education and Culture (DG EAC), in conjunction with GELLIS consultancy, on the effectiveness of strategies to raise awareness of and motivation to participate in adult learning. The objectives of the study were to: (cid:98) Explore how to make adult learning more popular and more accessible for identified target groups, including potential adult learners, policy makers, education providers and social partners; (cid:98) Analyse existing initiatives already carried out in terms of awareness raising in the field of adult education, primarily at Member State level; and (cid:98) Provide recommendations for future activities and propose which existing strategies should be used. This European Guide details (i) the role of stakeholders in the field of adult education; (ii) 16 in-depth case studies on selected activities in the field of awareness raising of adult learning; and (iii) a list of activities that could be built upon and executed by different stakeholders in the field of adult learning.

        "Prior to the development of this guide, the following tasks have been executed: 1. Situational analysis, including research on target groups and on existing awareness raising activities in the field of adult education; 2. In-depth interviews with DG EAC staff and key external stakeholders; 3. Online survey disseminated to stakeholders in the field of adult learning; 4. Segmentation and classification of stakeholders; and 5. Best practice analysis of examples of existing communication and awareness-raising activities. The methodology for the Best Practice analysis was as follows: (cid:99) Identification of existing awareness-raising activities in the field of adult education In-depth desk research on existing initiatives to promote adult learning across Europe and internationally has been conducted. These were collated into a database of existing activities and classified according to the type/format of activity, geographic location, main aims of the initiative, and the key target groups. (cid:99) Development of criteria to rank each activity Set of best practice criteria has been developed and included: \u2192 Geographical scope of the activity; \u2192 Number of languages the activity is executed in; \u2192 Sustainability of the activity, and how long it has been running for; \u2192 Transferability of the activity's features to potential new campaigns; \u2192 Ease of access to information about the activity; \u2192 Number of distribution channels used for information; \u2192 How much the activity facilitates interaction among different target groups; \u2192 Success of the activity\u2019s call to action; \u2192 Best practice examples demonstrated by the activity; \u2192 Level of second-hand information available about the activity; and \u2192 Level of differentiated approach to its target groups. (cid:99) Ranking and finalisation of top 16 activities The activities on the database were ranked on a scale from 1 to 5 for each of the above criteria. The top 16 activities were finalised as a result of the ranking. (cid:99) In-depth interviews with the team behind the best practice ( 1 ) Organisations that developed the selected best practice activities have been contacted, in order to interview the representatives that were involved in their development. For the interview, a questionnaire was devel- oped on topics such as: \u2192 Specific target groups they seek to reach; \u2192 Information on the methodology applied for the development of their initiatives; \u2192 How the activity was promoted; and \u2192 Partnerships and other networking opportunities. (cid:99) Development of in-depth case studies Based on the interviews, in-depth case studies on each activity have been drafted. The case studies included an overview of the activity, how it was developed, results, and lessons learnt from each activity.

        "The following section provides an overview of the envisaged role for each of the key stakeholders operating in the adult learning field, or capable of impacting the sector. The following considerations, based on research conducted on existing awareness raising activities and the best practice analysis, have been developed. Adult education is thought to be best promoted if campaign initiatives are developed and imple- mented through joint stakeholder cooperation net- works. The proposed logic of intervention is thus based on the need to identify what each stakeholder group or category is best positioned to achieve or promote in a medium and long term perspective. Based on this premise, stakeholders can be divided into two groups: (i) actors capable of reaching out to adult learners through multiple target group-specific intervention strategies, and (ii) those who can bring forward necessary changes in policy structures and produce operational channels. The latter are seen as \u2018enablers\u2019, capable of creating both conditions and tools to strengthen advocacy, communication and coordination capacity of the former, i.e. organisa- tions directly interacting with learners. For this rea- son, in describing the potential role to be played by each stakeholder, a model differentiating between B2B ( 2 ) and B2C ( 3 ) strategies of intervention has been elaborated. Initiatives of both types of actors are expected to fulfil the goal of overcoming current existing barriers to access and participation in adult education pro- grammes. Each of these types of barriers presents different specificities and challenges depending on the target group (e.g. older people, immigrants or women at risk of social exclusion). Whether at oper- ational or communication level, it is thought that ini- tiatives should particularly focus on the following: (cid:4) Structural barriers: This type of barrier includes issues hampering or discouraging participation from the start, such as a perceived lack of suitable programmes, non-flexible education delivery sys- tems or lack of access to adequate funding. Action should thus aim at either changing these percep- tions (by promoting available options more widely) or introducing operational changes to overcome these barriers. (cid:4) Situational barriers: These arise from individ- ual circumstances due to age or family life, e.g. full-time work, child bearing responsibilities or seniority. Action should thus aim at developing awareness-raising activities and learning options suited to these needs, tying adult education in with every-day activities. (cid:4) Psychological barriers: These concern adults\u2019 life experiences and may relate to negative as- sociations with the schooling environment, lack of confidence, sense of worthlessness, or social exclusion. Action should thus aim at demonstrat- ing societal interest in including these groups of individuals, developing activities in settings other than schools or classrooms, and by adopting ap- proaches that help to overcome traditional fears.

(3) B2C stands for business (or government) to consumer (in this case adult learners) interactions. (4) LLP National Agencies are important actors in awareness raising process (which is their role beyond the management of the LLP). However, the investigation of their role was beyond the scope of this Guide. NC3112514ENC_002.pdf 8 25/07/12 16:13 ",

        "1) European Commission As emerged from the various research steps, the main role of the European Commission, specifically DG EAC, is that of collating and centralising efforts undertaken at national and sub-national level to promote adult learning in Europe. Stakeholders in the adult learning community iden- tify the Commission largely as a key actor, strongly positioned to frame and steer national public policy debates to raise the profile of adult education. DG EAC enjoys a wide-reaching network of contacts beyond national policy makers and the LLP National Agencies. By coordinating research and producing strategic analyses with respect to agreed objec- tives, DG EAC can also influence investment priori- ties, communicating the evidence for the benefits of improving adult education provision and its promo- tion in EU Member States. 2) National governments At present, EU Member States are at different stages with respect to adult learning services deliv- ery and participation rates. The specifics of national awareness-raising initiatives are thus expected to be based on and reflect contextual needs. Evidence suggests that nationwide campaigns are success- ful when efforts are concerted and adult education is turned into a common challenge for community stakeholders as well as other actors capable of impacting the sector indirectly. Secondary research suggest that this is the case when stakeholders of the adult learning commu- nity are pushed to create new working structures and improve governance and communication among groups and across organisations. Means to achieve such goals include elements including the identifica- tion and set-up of common objectives, dissemina- tion of evidence-baseline research to serve as call to action, production of training material, development of unified campaign frameworks, creation of infor- mation packages, and implementation of joined-up engagement strategies for cooperating public-pri- vate partners. The key role envisioned for national governments is thus that of developing appropriate campaign frameworks to help facilitate cross-organisational interaction and unify decentralised awareness- raising interventions independently managed by local-level actors under a common identity, and to provide necessary infrastructure (such as Learn- Direct type phone-in systems). It is expected that communications activities would be supported by necessary changes in public policy structures, so as to empower stakeholders implementing adult edu- cation programmes to be better advocates. The primary target groups are thought to be: (i) Regional and local governments; (ii) NGOs; (iii) Education providers; and (iv) Social partners. The overarching goals of national governments\u2019 strat- egies to promote adult learning should be as follows: (cid:4) Disseminate research and sectoral policy reports: The objective of this activity is to pro- vide actors implementing awareness-raising pro- grammes or adult learning initiatives with the necessary evidence to develop ideas and products addressing existing gaps. Research-based pub- lic policy awareness-raising reports and data ( 5 ) must serve as a call to action for actors execut- ing engagement plans, in order for them to bet- ter identify targets and align goals to the wider national agenda. This information will help edu- cation providers, private organisations, NGOs and fund-granting bodies better identify necessary interventions. National governments should thus ensure that these research outputs successfully reach the actors in the field. (cid:4) Set-up adult learning objectives and priori- ties at national level: In order for any national initiative on adult learning to be successful, it should be preceded with the establishment of nationwide objectives and goals. It is the remit of national governments to determine the status quo of adult learning and its progress, and to estab- lish national goals and priorities, which regional authorities and organisations can then work towards achieving within their geographical areas. (cid:4) Establish stakeholder cooperation networks: National governments have access to stakeholders across the spectrum of adult education, including education providers, funders, employers, and NGOs. National governments are therefore ideally situ- ated to encourage cross-sectoral dialogue between stakeholders to achieve more streamlined and effi- cient provision and funding of adult education. (cid:4) Conduct evaluation and quality assurance: National governments should conduct regular eval- uations on the quality of education being provided E U R O P E A N G U I D E S t r a t e g i e s f o r i m p r o v i n g p a r t i c i p a t i o n i n a n d a w a r e n e s s o f a d u l t l e a r n i n g 12 (5) Reports and datasets that would serve as basis for innovative activities include those measuring levels of digital literacy, language and foreign language skills, numeracy skills, etc. nationwide.

        "at national and regional level, and should specifi- cally target education providers in the adult educa- tion sector to push for quality improvement. (cid:4) Promote operational policy changes, partic- ularly in the following: (cid:98)(cid:553)(cid:553) Help overcome structural, situational, psycho- logical barriers to access; (cid:98)(cid:553)(cid:553) Public consultations and open dialogue with stakeholders in the adult education community; (cid:98)(cid:553)(cid:553) Create National Institutes for Adult Learning (in countries where this does not already exist); (cid:98)(cid:553)(cid:553) Incentivise, reward and recognise participation from the private sector; (cid:98)(cid:553)(cid:553) Give adult learning visibility within other policy areas; and (cid:98)(cid:553)(cid:553) Provide funding for adult learning infrastructure. Examples of potential activities can be found in section 5) List of potential new activities (by pri- mary executing actor) \u2013 National, regional, and local governments. 3) Regional and local governments Regional and local authorities execute campaign activities developed at national level or initiate pro- grammes of their own. These may consist of regional or local government-led initiatives or framework programmes to facilitate stakeholders operating at community level to best deliver their activities. It is likely that regional and local governments\u2019 capac- ity to initiate adult learning awareness-raising activi- ties will largely depend on their level of autonomy and access to funding. The positioning they enjoy, however, puts them in a privileged position to interact directly with the adult population, beyond the provision of education services. Regional and local authorities rep- resent the closest-to-the citizen public authority and thus have considerable potential capacity to re-direct citizens towards adult learning opportunities. Acting as a gateway to central government poli- cies and funding streams, regional and local author- ities are also well positioned to communicate and disseminate information to stakeholders within the adult learning community, with the potential of help- ing the establishment of networks for cooperation. Based on the above, the primary target groups are thought to be: (i) National governments; (ii) Education providers; (iii) NGOs; (iv) Social partners; (v) Media; and (vi) Adult learners. The overarching goals of regional and local govern- ments\u2019 strategies should be as follows: (cid:4) Research the local needs of the adult popula- tion: This will serve as baseline for a call to action at business and civil society level, and will help iden- tify socio-demographic targets, thereby comple- menting research efforts initiated at national level. (cid:4) Implement regional/local awareness-raising strategies: These will comprise segments of wider nationwide campaigns or locally-initiated pro- grammes. They may include outreach work, mobi- lisation of multipliers for dissemination purposes, provision of one-stop-shop information access points on adult learning, etc. (cid:4) Facilitate efforts at civil society level: Exe- cuting actors may need help in delivering their programmes, providing courses or developing cam- paign ideas. Improving action in three key identified areas is considered essential: 1. Collate and optimise visibility of informa- tion on funding opportunities: This must serve both individual learners as well as grant-seeking organisations. In some cases this information does not exist and would have to be produced; 2. Establish networks of cooperation among stakeholders: In some instances local govern- ments may also act directly as education pro- viders themselves, leveraging their networks to engage teaching professionals from education providers (e.g. of vocational training) and encour- aging local businesses to implement learning programmes; and 3. Produce pre-packaged information mate- rial: This is intended to serve the needs of actors who are more likely or expected to act as interme- diaries between potential adult learners and public authorities, such as trade union organisations and public employment offices. These intermediaries do not necessarily possess sufficient resources, time and knowledge to develop targeted material on adult education. Given their more frequent and close interaction with adults, however, they could represent a more trustworthy source of informa- tion for the intended target group. (cid:4) Provide opportunities for knowledge shar- ing with other local actors: This includes evaluation, successful best practice identifi- cation, making these practices available and E U R O P E A N G U I D E S t r a t e g i e s f o r i m p r o v i n g p a r t i c i p a t i o n i n a n d a w a r e n e s s o f a d u l t l e a r n i n g 13 NC3112514ENC_002.pdf 11 25/07/12 16:13 ",
        "leverage existing EU-wide channels and cooper- ating networks among regional and local author- ities across Europe to promote dissemination. (cid:4) Set-up advisory and mentoring services: these could be delivered through de-centralised agencies or be directly provided by regional and local authorities. They could target employers and learners to give them information on where to find suitable training opportunities relevant to their profession or field of activity, available funding, existing incentive programmes, etc. Examples of potential activities can be found in section 5) List of potential new activities (by pri- mary executing actor) \u2013 National, regional, and local governments. 4) Associations and NGOs at European and national level ( 6 ) Associations and NGOs (at European and national level) and, particularly, national institutes for adult learning currently represent the most active stake- holders within the adult learning community. Being direct advocates of adult and continuing educa- tion, these organisations maintain multi-level inter- actions with European, national and regional policy making networks and learners themselves. Operating at the grassroots of society, they also have the capacity to complement research gaps in the identification of learners\u2019 needs and necessary changes or interventions at structural policy level. The groups they seek to reach out to are thus differ- ent in nature and require multiple targeted aware- ness-raising activities. The remit of intervention of civil society organisa- tions, however, depends on resources available and scope of activities. Based on this consideration, NGOs could be grouped in three broad categories, according to the role they play: 1. National institutes for adult learning: These influence policy, promote inter-stakeholder debate, develop adult learner-specific campaigns and, in some instances, are education providers themselves; 2. Non-profit organisations in the education sector: These may be organisations participating or belonging to wider EU project networks coop- erating with other institutions to improve teach- ing quality, encourage exchange of staff and know-how, and implement different scale and scope projects for direct or indirect adult learn- ers\u2019 engagement (e.g. through intergenerational learning); and 3. Community-based organisations: Beneficiaries of different sources of EU and national level or pri- vate funding, exclusively interacting with learners (e.g. cultural and sports associations). These organ- isations mostly operate at the micro-level of soci- ety through localised intervention programmes. The main target groups are considered to be: (i) European Commission; (ii) National governments; (iii) Regional and local governments; (iv) Education providers; (v) Social partners; (vi) Media; and (vii) Adult learners. The overarching goals of NGOs\u2019 strategies to pro- mote adult learning should include the following: (cid:4) Advocacy activities towards policy makers: This includes dissemination of the needs of learn- ers they work with on a daily basis, and make them known at policy level through lobbying, cam- paigning, awareness raising, direct actions and working with the media. (cid:4) Develop/implement campaigns targeting adult learners: This includes the development and imple- mentation of multiple targeted, needs-oriented, innovative and context-based local campaigns for adults and include outreach activities, the provision of supplemental information, motivation, rewards, reinforcement or expanded access points for edu- cation like the workplace, as well as the mobilisa- tion of multipliers. (cid:4) Provide training and mentoring to other or- ganisations: This includes the provision of train- ing and mentoring courses and relevant certificates for adult learning teaching staff with a view to ini- tiate exchange of qualified training and mentoring personnel on local and regional levels. (cid:4) Create strategic coalitions with other stake- holders: Multi-stakeholder coalitions should be formed for creating a positive environment on advo- cacy for adult learning. These coalitions need not necessarily be only in the adult education sphere, but should also target associations for active and healthy ageing, media literacy organisations, pub- lishers, etc. For example, a campaign targeting under-educated adults may find opportunities to link to campaign initiatives targeting low-income E U R O P E A N G U I D E S t r a t e g i e s f o r i m p r o v i n g p a r t i c i p a t i o n i n a n d a w a r e n e s s o f a d u l t l e a r n i n g 14 (6) National institutes for adult learning do not exist in all countries.

Examples of potential activities can be found in sec- tion 5) List of potential new activities (by primary executing actor) \u2013 NGOs. 5) Education providers Education providers represent a key stakeholder in the process of adult education: they have to be con- vinced of the necessity to provide further education in response to existing demand. It is essential that they base and adapt their educational offers to the needs of learners. They also have to convince adult learners to participate in their programmes in order to achieve a return on their investments. Moreover, both public and private sector providers of learning and training services bring a wealth of experience of direct inter- action with learners and potential learners, and should therefore be encouraged to share their experiences in reaching and interacting with other stakeholders. The main target groups are considered to be: (i) Regional and local governments; (ii) NGOs; (iii) Social partners; and (iv) Adult learners. The overarching goals of education providers\u2019 strat- egies should include the following: (cid:4) Amplify offer to meet demand and target groups\u2019 needs: This includes the adjustment of course content and its delivery to integrate learn- ers\u2019 needs based on feedback and best practice examples provided by e.g. local focus groups, education providers and course participants. (cid:4) Communicate individual, social benefits of adult learning: This is necessary to convince learners of the impact adult education can have on their lives. This includes the promotion of new thinking skills which can make individuals more efficient and more competitive in a global econ- omy as well as more socially cohesive. Additionally, language courses funded by adult education pro- grammes can promote economic independence among immigrants. (cid:4) Form strategic partnerships with other stakeholders to provide education: Financial support and funding opportunities available to adult learning differ from community to commu- nity. Strategic partnerships with other education facilities as well as key players in the field will therefore enable education providers to facilitate the exchange of adult learning teaching staff, course content and best practice. (cid:4) Cooperate with businesses and NGOs: Adult education course content should address the needs of the labour market and focus on the skills development currently required. Partnerships with NGOs and businesses would provide course developers with feedback regarding current skills demand and possible work experience placements. (cid:4) Market educational offer through inter- mediaries: Intermediaries such as national institutes for adult learning, NGOs, as well as community learning champions, learner rep- resentatives, outreach workers, support work- ers, and tutors will support the dissemination of information on courses offered through their individual networks. (cid:4) Use online tools to raise awareness of and deliver education courses: This includes the use of existing online tools, and development of new ones such as social media, online platforms, forums, games, animations, videos, etc. as well as the delivery of distance learning courses via the education provider\u2019s website. Example of potential activities can be found in sec- tion 5) List of potential new activities (by primary executing actor) \u2013 Education providers. 6) Social partners (e.g. NGOs, trade unions, employers) Social partners are considered a key stakeholder group as they interact directly with target groups to educate them on the benefits and importance of adult education. Acting as a gateway to employment and the provision of professional training, social partners provide and/or receive funding and they help disseminate awareness raising tools provided by other stakeholders. Operating on a commu- nity level, they use face-to-face communications, develop print material, create networking events or develop training for employees. The main target groups are thought to be (i) Adult learners; and (ii) Member organisations. The overarching goals of social partners\u2019 strategies should include the following: E U R O P E A N G U I D E S t r a t e g i e s f o r i m p r o v i n g p a r t i c i p a t i o n i n a n d a w a r e n e s s o f a d u l t l e a r n i n g 15 NC3112514ENC_002.pdf 13 25/07/12 16:13 ",
        "(cid:4) Disseminate tools produced by other stake- holders: The objective of this activity is to con- tribute to the promotion of courses provided by adult education facilities and to the exchange of campaign ideas, ads, case studies or budgetary information. (cid:4) Interact with target groups to educate them on the benefits and importance of adult education: Social partners such as trade unions should ensure that their members to promote the benefits of adult education to their employer organisations, and convince these employers to make adult learning courses available. (cid:4) Create networking events: This aims at build- ing strategic partnerships with social partners and public and private education providers to better disseminate information on available courses and to gather information on current skills require- ments. Networking events will also mobilise multi- pliers to disseminate information about the added value of adult education and encourage education providers to exchange best practice. (cid:4) Develop work-based learning and train- ing for employees: This activity aims at ena- bling employees to learn and develop new skills that can further their professional lives and con- tribute to the overall success of an organisation. Education providers should be integrated in the development of training courses to provide best practice and knowledge.

        "a) Set objectives (cid:4) Develop a comprehensive campaign plan: Every campaign initiative should begin with a clear plan with clearly pre-defined SMART ( 7 ) objec- tives. Moreover, in addition to the objectives being SMART, they should also be differenti- ated for each stage of the campaign \u2013 covering both short-term and long-term objectives. This ensures that there is an initial realistic goal established and each promotional activity can be developed in a well-paced manner that works towards the achievement of the objectives. In addition, ensure that objectives are constantly evaluated against their results, and updated to keep them SMART. Objectives at all times have to be realistic and achievable, while taking into account the existing situation. (cid:4) Align goals with wider agendas: While set- ting up campaign objectives and goals, if pos- sible, they should be linked with goals common to other European or national stakeholders. This ensures that the messages would resonate What to do Based on the 16 best practice case studies, below find a table of main steps that should be kept in mind by stakeholders at all stages in the development of a campaign strategy: more broadly, and the campaign would be more impactful across a wider area. (cid:4) Develop a corporate identity: A campaign plan should be used to build a specific identity for the promoted programme (e.g. using a slogan or logo) and thus ensure consistency of dissemi- nation activities and easy recognition on the part of the target group. b) Identify target groups (cid:4) Thoroughly research specific target groups: Target groups are differentiated in their attitudes, disposition and approach towards adult learn- ing. This diversity can be found even within the same demographic or socio economic groups. It is therefore important to thoroughly research the specific target group that would be participating in the activity, and ensure that the approach to each group is varied to reflect their needs and to encourage their participation. It is also impor- tant to consider the preferences of each target E U R O P E A N G U I D E S t r a t e g i e s f o r i m p r o v i n g p a r t i c i p a t i o n i n a n d a w a r e n e s s o f a d u l t l e a r n i n g 18 a) Set objectives b) Identify target groups c) Identify tools / channels d) Identify partners / networks e) Identify funding f) Develop messages g) Other considera- tions h) Develop campaign i) Promote campaign j) Monitor & evaluate (cid:98)(cid:553) Develop a compre- hensive campaign plan (cid:98)(cid:553) Align goals with wider agendas (cid:98)(cid:553) Develop a corporate identity (cid:98)(cid:553) Thoroughly research specific target groups (cid:98)(cid:553) Take account of polarity in views (cid:98)(cid:553) Do not only target learners (cid:98)(cid:553) Develop activities for marginalised groups (cid:98)(cid:553) Involve policy makers (cid:98)(cid:553) Use accessi- ble activities (cid:98)(cid:553) Encourage peer-to-peer learning (cid:98)(cid:553) Identify multipurpose tools (cid:98)(cid:553) Develop toolkits (cid:98)(cid:553) Show real learning situations (cid:98)(cid:553) Allow sampling of activities (cid:98)(cid:553) Use online media (cid:98)(cid:553) Use inter- generational learning (cid:98)(cid:553) Pick suitable partners (cid:98)(cid:553) Engage educational professionals (cid:98)(cid:553) Push stake- holders to take up leadership roles (cid:98)(cid:553) Use role models (cid:98)(cid:553) Appoint social ambassadors (cid:98)(cid:553) Use teachers to promote adult education (cid:98)(cid:553) Leverage the CSR arm of bigger organisations (cid:98)(cid:553) Include adult education in other policy agenda items (cid:98)(cid:553) Identify multiple sources of funding (cid:98)(cid:553) Pool resources to reduce costs (cid:98)(cid:553) Aim to build the confidence of learners (cid:98)(cid:553) Encourage learners to stay in learning (cid:98)(cid:553) Highlight the variety of adult education (cid:98)(cid:553) Aim to promote social change (cid:98)(cid:553) Integrate your campaign within broader initiatives (cid:98)(cid:553) Ensure your campaign has one identity (cid:98)(cid:553) Aim to build capacity (cid:98)(cid:553) Build a common understanding (cid:98)(cid:553) Allow suffi- cient time to create impact (cid:98)(cid:553) Become an accredited provider (cid:98)(cid:553) Create evi- dence-based strategies (cid:98)(cid:553) Centralise campaign but decentralise implementa- tion (cid:98)(cid:553) Provide incen- tives to make education more man- ageable and sustainable (cid:98)(cid:553) Introduce adult learning by stealth (cid:98)(cid:553) Require commitment from learners (cid:98)(cid:553) Reward achievements (cid:98)(cid:553) Provide support during and a(cid:6)er activity (cid:98)(cid:553) Do not limit innovation to only the activities (cid:98)(cid:553) Highlight so(cid:6) skills examples (cid:98)(cid:553) Leverage internal promotional channels (cid:98)(cid:553) Involve learners themselves in promotional activities (cid:98)(cid:553) Build lasting relationships with the media (cid:98)(cid:553) Monitor national research (cid:98)(cid:553) Pilot programmes and use pre-testing (cid:98)(cid:553) Support external evaluation with internal monitoring (cid:98)(cid:553) Collect best practice examples (7) S pecific, M easurable, A chievable, R ealistic, T ime-bound.

        "group in terms of information delivery. Only in- depth research can reveal how specific target groups wish to receive information (as a precur- sor to engagement). (cid:4) Take account of polarity in views: Potential learners are not always disposed to join an edu- cational course or activity. While they can often be convinced through targeted campaigns, some- times their views are too polarised to change. It is therefore important to not force them these groups to enter learning. Constant reminders could cause them to further distance themselves from education. (cid:4) Do not only target learners: Whilst develop- ing a campaign, ensure that target groups include disseminators/multipliers, influencers (third party endorsers) as well as adult learners. These groups (such as the media) should be treated as a sep- arate target group, and activities and messages should be customised for them. Their inclusion will ensure that the campaign reaches a wider audi- ence. In addition, by including the media as one of the campaign\u2019s target groups, there is potential of engaging them as active promoters. This however implies developing specifically targeted activities. (cid:4) Develop activities for marginalised groups: The education needs of groups that are at risk of social exclusion have to be addressed in a dif- ferent manner than others. While developing an adult learning strategy targeted towards these marginalised groups, the focus should be on bringing them into the fold of mainstream soci- ety, before involving them in further education. (cid:4) Involve policy makers: Involving policy mak- ers through the design and development of a pro- gramme ensures that they become active stake- holders, rather than passive listeners. As seen in the Adult Learner\u2019s Week ( 8 ) case study, the organ- isations involved adapted and shaped their events and awards to suit the agenda of policy makers. These events further provided policy makers an added incentive to participate, as they were able to promote themselves to their constituents. c) Identify tools and channels to use (cid:4) Use accessible activities: As seen in the case study examples, the use of activities that are normally not associated with adult learning have proven to be successful. Similarly, there are other activities that encourage adult learners to acquire new skills, such as dance and cooking. These activities can be used as a learning experi- ence itself, or as a means to \u2018hook\u2019 learners into future activities. (cid:4) Encourage peer to peer learning: Encouraging learners to be trained and teach other learners provides numerous benefits such as: (i) provid- ing learners with the motivation to complete the course in order to become teachers and thereby receive compensation; (ii) since the teachers were once learners themselves, they are aware of the obstacles faced by learners, and can cus- tomise teaching to suit learners\u2019 needs. (cid:4) Identify multipurpose tools: During the devel- opment stage of a programme or campaign, tools could be created that serve more than one function. As an example, BBC First Click ( 9 ) uses its website as a supporting learning tool for both beginners and teachers who refer to it during the implementation of their courses. It thus serves as a cost-effective tool serving different purposes when used by different users. (cid:4) Develop toolkits: It is important to provide stakeholders who are developing programmes and campaigns with more than just other exam- ples of best practice. Guidance needs to be more structured, specific, and process-oriented in the form of operational tools to develop, implement and evaluate campaign programmes. These include communication plan guidelines, research tools, campaign ads, strategy ideas, budgeting tutorials and other operational tools. (cid:4) Show real learning situations: While pro- moting an activity, it is useful to show potential learners an actual learning situation, so they can understand the type of experience they would have should they return to learning. This can be very important to \u2018sell\u2019 formal education; often, potential learners are disinclined to re-enter edu- cation due to the negative associations they have with education in a classroom setting. (cid:4) Allow sampling of activities: During the development of an activity, build in processes that allow target audiences to \u2018sample\u2019 the activ- ity, try participating, and if they desire, continue. If they should decide not to continue, the activ- ity should still be open to them for future partic- ipation. By knowing up front that they can leave should the activity not be suitable, potential E U R O P E A N G U I D E S t r a t e g i e s f o r i m p r o v i n g p a r t i c i p a t i o n i n a n d a w a r e n e s s o f a d u l t l e a r n i n g 19 (8) Refer to case study (1).

        "learners are further encouraged to try the activ- ity, since they have nothing to lose. (cid:4) Use intergenerational learning: Learning sit- uations which encourage parents to interact with their children can be successful, as parents are more likely to be engaged when they are help- ing their children to learn. Often, parents do not have an interest in active learning, and will par- ticipate in activities simply because those of their children require their involvement. However, this should be viewed as a learning end to itself: even if parents are not participating in adult learning, their \u2018shared learning\u2019 with their children should be encouraged. This brings them into the fold of learning (in any form), and could act as a catalyst to future education activities. Intergenerational learning can also be extrapolated to adults (who are not necessarily parents) getting involved in learning to help children, if there is sufficient motivation for them. (cid:4) Use online media: The use of online tools is important as the Internet is a primary information source for today\u2019s society. Online tools increase the geographical scope of an activity and thereby raise participant numbers. They also demonstrate the versatility of an activity and facilitate interaction between learners, which ultimately supports the sustainability of the activity. However, the develop- ment and implementation of an online media cam- paign requires the same time and human resource investment as a campaign using regular media. It is thus important to ensure that any online cam- paign is established with a long term view, and that sufficient resources are dedicated to its execution. Moreover, the use of optimal online tools suitable for each activity can be determined only through usage and experimentation; therefore, if one tool does not seem to be working after a period of time, other tools should be tested. d) Identify partners and networks (cid:4) Pick suitable partners: While selecting part- ners, ensure that they have established secto- ral networks within their field of competence, to allow them to act as efficient multipliers. It is also important that the agenda of their organ- isation is aligned with all other partners, and that the final selected partners all have compli- mentary roles in the execution of the campaign. Moreover, activities should be initiated where partners are complementary to each other. In this way, each stakeholder organisation involved in the programme or campaign has a specific role, and focuses on activities that play to its strengths. Overlap of activities would be reduced, thereby minimising resources wasted. It is also important to incentivise partners; to encourage sustainable participation by partners in an activ- ity or programme, it is important to provide them with publicity, which gives them reasons to be involved in future campaigns. (cid:4) Engage educational professionals: Whilst devel- oping activities and promotional campaigns, aim to involve education professionals from the field of adult education. They have already worked with the target audiences and are familiar with their needs and requirements, and therefore more likely to develop activities that would best suit them. (cid:4) Push stakeholders to take up leadership roles: Stakeholders should not simply be engaged as executing actors of a campaign, but directly empowered to act as active advocates of the cause. This helps them drive their target groups independent of the campaign, thereby favouring greater sustainability of efforts undertaken. (cid:4) Use role models: In the publicity of adult edu- cation, it is important to use role models who are appealing to learners. As seen in the case of the Premier League Reading Stars ( 10 ), picking proper role models can make a programme pertinent and aspirational for the learners. Similarly, by using actual learners as role models, the cam- paign becomes more accessibly and real for potential learners. This is specifically pertinent if the potential learners are from varied back- grounds: listening to those similar to themselves share their positive experience, they could be encouraged to follow the path of the role models. (cid:4) Appoint social ambassadors: Appointing social ambassadors during an activity or campaign can help ensure that the life of the activity is extended and builds links with local communities. By devel- oping activities that have a social aspect such as cultural identity or helping children learn, and investing in building this relationship over a period of time, an activity can create parent ambassa- dors and volunteers. (cid:4) Use teachers to promote adult education in libraries, community centres, etc.: Local level communication campaigns should lever- age the potential influence played by teachers E U R O P E A N G U I D E S t r a t e g i e s f o r i m p r o v i n g p a r t i c i p a t i o n i n a n d a w a r e n e s s o f a d u l t l e a r n i n g 20 (10) Refer to case study (13). NC3112514ENC_002.pdf 18 25/07/12 16:14 ",
        "in promoting learning opportunities. Empowering teachers to directly reach out to learners and act as ambassadors in community organisa- tions, libraries and cultural centres gives credibil- ity to learning programmes and offers a first-hand opportunity for them to understand how the edu- cational offer should be tailored to the real needs of learners. (cid:4) Leverage the CSR arm of bigger organisa- tions: Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is increasingly becoming an important part of busi- nesses that seek to improve their perception and impact in the public sphere. Large organisations are therefore increasing their investment into CSR ini- tiatives, of which adult education is one. As seen in the case study example of Quick Reads ( 11 ), Galaxy Mars supported the initiative through a promotional campaign, which led to a higher level of sponsor- ship and wider publicity for Quick Reads. Similarly, large organisations or foundations can be encour- aged by actors such as the European Commission to champion the cause of adult learning. (cid:4) Include adult education in other policy agenda items: As seen in the case study example of Adult Learning Campaign Toolkit ( 12 ), the organisation identified areas that policy makers and educators are interested in developing that would tie into adult education. It then supported these interests, thereby propagating its adult education agenda, and provided policy makers with evidence on how improving structures for adult learning can help them achieve their socio-economic goals. Similarly, other organisations could ensure that its agenda is lobbied for by others. e) Identify sources of funding (cid:4) Identify multiple sources of funding: In addi- tion to traditional sources of funding such as the European Commission and national govern- ments, organisations should try to solicit spon- sorships from other sector specific organisations with a vested interest in educating adults in their particular fields. If the sponsor is convinced of the value in investing, they are also likely to high- light their participation, thereby assuring more promotion for the activity. (cid:4) Pool resources to reduce costs: The pooling of resources by partner organisations optimises campaign and programme outcomes, not only in terms of promotion and awareness raising of each other, but also in terms of reduced costs, avoiding the repetition of efforts, and reducing the proliferation of disjointed initiatives with lim- ited potential of impact. f) Develop campaign messages (cid:4) Aim to build the confidence of learners: By developing campaigns that aim to build the tar- get group\u2019s confidence in their ability to learn, it sends the message that society cares about including them in all social aspects, and there- fore increases their self worth and confidence. An example can be seen in the case study BBC First Click ( 13 ). It is thought that a key success fac- tor of First Click is that it makes older members of the public (i.e. the primary target group) feel that society cares about getting them involved in using modern technologies. (cid:4) Encourage learners to stay in learning: As seen in the case study examples of Written Off? ( 14 ) and Quick Reads ( 15 ), the activities them- selves are \u2018bridges\u2019 to further education. In the first case, after the conclusion of the TV show, learners were encouraged and supported in the pursuits of further education; and in the second, the books were meant to encourage readers to pick up other titles by the same author. Similarly, other activities developed should encourage a learner\u2019s educational journey. (cid:4) Highlight the variety of adult education: Adult learning is multifaceted and can take place in different forms, in terms of course content, structure, and format. Emphasis should be placed on communicating to potential learners the vari- ety of options available to them. They should be made aware that adult education opportunities are available in different formats and options, depending on lifestyle and time. (cid:4) Aim to promote social change: As seen in case study examples such as the Adult Learning Campaign Toolkit ( 16 ), the efforts of some organ- isations to promote adult learning go beyond increasing the number of adults enrolled in edu- cational programmes. These efforts try to posi- tively change the general perception and attitude towards education. This allows for investments (both financial and human resources) to be directed towards tackling challenges at their roots posed by low school achievement.

        "importance of earlier studies is more desirable than a late-intervention programme compensat- ing for missed opportunities. g) Other planning considerations (cid:4) Integrate your campaign within broader ini- tiatives: A campaign\u2019s success can be furthered by ensuring that it is not a stand-alone initiative. Campaigns, such as For Diversity. Against Dis- crimination (FDAD), that are implemented within the framework of various other undertakings ini- tiated at EU or national level are likely to be more successful, as they comprise of other parallel awareness-raising activities or legal measures being introduced. Other initiatives include the 2012 European Year of Active Ageing. (cid:4) Ensure your campaign has one identity: For campaigns with a wide geographical reach, it is important that the campaign be adapted to answer different needs across different areas. However, it is also important to define your cam- paign's on- and off-line identity and ensure it can be carried across the defined geographical areas. This could be done through the adaptation of one logo, one standardised slogan, or offering. This would ensure that it is viewed as a larger cam- paign with more resources and is instantly recog- nisable to the target audience. (cid:4) Aim to build capacity: In order for a campaign to be both successful and sustainable, it should include an aspect of capacity building. Participants and disseminators need to have a thorough grasp of the aims and objectives of the campaign, and should also feel a sense of ownership regarding the outcomes of the campaign. This ownership can be fostered through provision of in-depth training and support during the life of the campaign. (cid:4) Build a common understanding: Before begin- ning development of a campaign or programme, it is important to ensure that all organisations use the same definition and have the same under- standing of what they are working towards. With an agreement on basic definitions and principles, stakeholders can develop policy and engage in debate in line with common goals. (cid:4) Allow sufficient time to create impact: While designing programmes and campaigns, it is important to take a long-term view, and ensure that the programme runs for sufficient time to support learners through their educa- tion advancement, chart their programme, and customise the programme to support the target group\u2019s learning path. (cid:4) Become an accredited provider: As seen in the case study of Written Off? ( 17 ), Ireland\u2019s National Adult Literacy Agency ( 18 ) became an accredited provider of education in order to be able to train to adult learners. This demonstrates that the deliv- ery of education does not have to be limited to formal institutions such as schools and universities; if permitted by national regulations, any organisa- tions with the ability to deliver education and gain accreditation can teach adult education courses. h) Develop campaign (cid:4) Create evidence-based strategies: Any cam- paign, strategy or programme should be based on evidence, and should address a specific need of the target audiences. This requires upfront research and proper understanding (using both qualitative and quantitative metrics) of the envi- ronment and its target groups. Furthermore, dur- ing the course of the campaign, measurements should be collected, so that the development of future strategies is based on evidence. (cid:4) Centralise campaign but decentralise imple- mentation: Ensure that the campaign has a single visual identity and centralised plan for the roll- out, but assign responsibility for implementation to regional/local level according to a decentralised structure. Using such an approach allows enough flexibility to address local level challenges and adapt the delivery of promotional tools to each spe- cific context, whilst ensuring national consistency. (cid:4) Provide incentives to make education more manageable and sustainable: Adult learners should be convinced that whatever investment they put into learning, it should not be seen as a lost effort. Engagement programmes should empower learners to keep control over when and how to manage their education. Furthermore, providing recognition and accreditation at each step of for- mal education undertaken by an adult learner will enable the student to capitalise and build on his previous achievements, should there be a need to interrupt the educational course/programme. This would also give learners an incentive to return to education, eliminating the psychological, financial and time burden of having to re-start from zero.

        "(cid:4) Introduce adult learning by stealth: Hooking a project to a popular activity with strong inter- est of the target group combined with a learning activity is a strong recipe for a successful project. By introducing the learning aspect \u2018by stealth\u2019, programme organisations can ensure that learn- ers engage with and enjoy the project, since the primary area of focus is the target group\u2019s area of interest. Suggestions include sports, cultural activities, music, dance, cooking, etc. (cid:4) Require commitment from learners: Once learners have decided that they want to partic- ipate in a programme, it is important to ensure that they provide a commitment to the comple- tion of the activity. A time commitment ensures that the programme can bring about the expected learning outcome, and be of benefit to learn- ers. However, if learners are unable to complete the programme, it is important to provide them access to re-enter when they are able to, in order not to discourage them. (cid:4) Reward achievements: The benefits of reward- ing learners\u2019 achievements through prizes go beyond providing incentives to potential learners to re-enter education. It also highlights to policy makers the progress made in the field of adult education, and underlines future steps to be taken, where their support would be needed. (cid:4) Provide support during and after activity: It is important to provide an immediate call to action within a programme or campaign that has a tangible benefit to the potential partici- pant. This call to action should be supported by advice on the benefits available to the partici- pant, including if possible after the programme has closed. Potential learners could get discour- aged if they do not have an easy way to see what their options are. i) Promote campaign (cid:4) Do not limit innovation to only the activities themselves: There is an emphasis put on devel- oping innovative new interventions to get poten- tial learners involved in education. However, this search for innovation should not be limited only to the initiatives. If a common activity is pro- moted in an innovative way, it will also ensure uptake. This is seen in the case study of the Adult Learner\u2019s Week ( 19 ). While it has been ongo- ing for many years, the approach to its structure and delivery is constantly being re-invented. This approach helps reduce the risk of adult learning becoming rhetorical and abstract. (cid:4) Highlight soft skills: Adult learning often leads to benefits such as heightened confidence levels of learners and improved social integration. It is impor- tant to measure the progress of learners\u2019 soft skills through detailed assessment questionnaires, as this helps in the development of future programmes that allow for all round learning. Highlighting these benefits could also attract adult learners who may be interested in a non-formal environment in which they could improve their soft skills. (cid:4) Leverage internal promotional channels: During the promotion of an activity of campaign, using internal networks, contacts and informal channels of communication can prove fruitful in promoting debate or attention on specific issues. The case study example of Adult Learning Campaign Toolkit ( 20 ) demonstrates how an organ- isation can use its internal and cross-departmen- tal links to reach out to legislators, policy makers and public institutions to promote its agenda. (cid:4) Involve learners themselves in promo- tional activities: Campaigns that involve exist- ing learners in promotional activities would allow potential learners to get an idea directly as to what the learning experience is like. In addition, when potential learners share firsthand what their learning experience is, the activity becomes more accessible for potential learners. (cid:4) Build lasting relationships with the media: Cultivating lasting relationships with local and regional media would benefit successful advo- cacy on adult learning issues. This would require learning what the journalist covers, communicat- ing to them the value of the pitch, and provid- ing relevant materials when appropriate, over an extended period of time. Media coverage is one of the best ways to gain the attention of deci- sion makers, and can also be used to publicise local level activities. Each of these events could be used to contact local reporters, editorial boards and radio and television talk show hosts, that may want to cover the activities, or use the organis- ers as a resource when they write about these issues in the future. The basic steps in developing a media campaign are (i) Creating a Media List by researching journalists that adult learning. If the community is to be mobilised, local papers should be addressed. If the aim is to get the attention E U R O P E A N G U I D E S t r a t e g i e s f o r i m p r o v i n g p a r t i c i p a t i o n i n a n d a w a r e n e s s o f a d u l t l e a r n i n g 23 (19) Refer to case study (1).

        "of legislators, a paper that covers politics and reaches a broader audience is necessary. Once all the papers or stations have been researched a list of media contacts needs to be created; (ii) Planning the hook, which is the subject matter that would tap into the journalist\u2019s and their read- erships interests; (iii) Creating a message, with an overall goal (e.g. call to action, awareness raising, advocating) so that the audience can be targeted through the use of the media; and (iv) Writing con- tent that is interesting for the media, which could be done through news releases, letters to the edi- tors, opinion-editorial pieces, interviews, and hold- ing media events. j) Monitor and evaluate campaign (cid:4) Monitor national research: Monitoring existing national research enables two activities: First, it helps organisations identify existing needs of the population and develop activities to target them, without having to spend any resources itself in conducting primary research; and secondly, it allows organisations to identify gaps and com- mission further research as required. (cid:4) Pilot programmes and use pre-testing: Before launching a campaign, strategy or programme, it is important to identify the right tools, channels and messaging. In order to ensure that they are optimal for the target audience, it is necessary to pre-test and adapt them according to feedback. Moreover, if permissible by logistical and budget- ary constraints, before the full roll-out of an activ- ity, it should be piloted amongst a smaller group of the target audience. The use of consultations with relevant stakeholders can ensure that divergences in expectations are minimised, the programme answers the needs and preferences of target groups, and any aspects of the programme that do not work can be amended before it is launched. (cid:4) Support external evaluation with internal monitoring: As seen in the case study exam- ple of Adult Learning Campaign Toolkit ( 21 ), apart from the formal and independent evaluation con- ducted by grant-providing organisations, SREB [see Adult Learning Campaign Toolkit ( 22 )] regu- larly measures progress and change in policy and participation rates in its member regions. This allows for the identification of emerging best practice as well as the targeting of specific rec- ommendations to actors in charge of implement- ing the programme in its participating regions. (cid:4) Collect best practice examples: During the pro- cess of the activity or programme, it is important to collect best practice examples for other organi- sations to reference when they are developing or implementing their own activities. Best practices create a community of learning exchange, espe- cially if the examples have tangible elements that can be of value and assistance to others. What not to do Based on the 16 best practice case studies, general \u2018negative\u2019 lessons learnt that should be kept in mind by stakeholders at all levels in the development of a campaign strategy include the following: (cid:4) Do not promote adult learning as an abstract concept: While promoting adult education, it is important to link it to a specific activity. There is a need to move away from the classical arguments promoting the broad benefits of adult learning and communicate specifically what is appealing for the campaign\u2019s target groups. Potential learn- ers are not called to action by the concept of \u2018adult learning\u2019, and moreover, they often have negative associations with it. Instead, by promoting specific activities, potential learners are more likely to see the tangible benefits of participating. (cid:4) Do not rely on a campaign alone: Although awareness-raising campaigns on available oppor- tunities for adult education are essential, they need to be supported and backed up by structural changes. The aim of building the adult learning sector at national and regional levels needs to be supported by operational changes in adult learn- ing policy structures. This means that public pol- icy changes are necessary to accrue the potential benefits derived from a campaign. Examples of these structural changes include increase of fund- ing and of vocational and non-vocational training study places in the providing institutions. (cid:4) Do not implement isolated activities: Imple- menting wider-scale campaigns or activities with- out consulting, involving or engaging with other stakeholders will not be efficient. It is important to mobilise in sufficient numbers national, regional and local stakeholders to create efficient work- ing structures. These stakeholders are better posi- tioned to reach out to regional and civil society actors and customise activities for the local needs. Moreover, finding high-capacity partners who can E U R O P E A N G U I D E S t r a t e g i e s f o r i m p r o v i n g p a r t i c i p a t i o n i n a n d a w a r e n e s s o f a d u l t l e a r n i n g 24 (21) Refer to case study (3).

        "provide access to a network of contact points and valuable endorsers of the activity is important. (cid:4) Do not develop patronising activities: Whilst developing activities for adult learners, it can- not be assumed that they have a basic level of skills in the specific area. As an example, BBC First Click ( 23 ) assumes that adult learners are not familiar with how to use a computer mouse, and begins its learning course with this activity. However, there is a risk that teaching basic skills could be viewed as patronising by some adult learners. Care should be taken that activities teaching basic skills do not make assumptions such as \u2018a learner does not have a particular skill because he does not have the ability\u2019. This pitfall can be avoided by testing potential activities with the target group desired to measure their reac- tion, and adapting the activity as necessary. (cid:4) Do not assume you know what adult learners need: Although there may be a noticeable lack in skills in groups of adults, it does not always follow that these skills are essential to the learners. It is important to match activities developed to spe- cifically what learners need. In order to do this, it is important to engage learners in dialogue, and conduct research as to what their desired learning outcomes and expectations are. (cid:4) Do not target adult learners in general: Adult learners vary greatly in their attitudes, percep- tions and potential access to information on edu- cation opportunities, as well as teaching itself. Given that each target group is likely to present different needs, engaging with them success- fully will require the development of different activities for each, possibly re-adapting mes- saging propositions and tools for dissemination. Internal differentiations also exist among learn- ers belonging to the same \u2018adult learning\u2019 group (e.g. women at risk of social exclusion), and thus research is needed to identify the right target and the most suited tools and messages to engage with them. Moreover, offers should reflect dif- ferent geographic needs and objectives, funding availability and target group interests. Initiatives of similar geographic scope can consider a com- parable approach, delivering services according to different levels and type of demand. (cid:4) Do not always start from scratch: If an activity already exists that appealed to the target group, it is better to re-launch this activity, and scale it up, both in terms of reach and variety of tools and channels. This approach is generally more suc- cessful than re-developing and launching new activities, as the existing activity already includes a core participant group, enjoys brand recognition, and has implementation structures in place. (cid:4) Do not replicate activities from other coun- tries without carrying out research: Whilst some flagship adult learning activities (such as the Adult Learner\u2019s Week ( 24 )) were developed based upon existing activities in other countries, it is first essential to conduct in-depth research to see whether the activity would be feasible locally. Simple replication can lead to wasted resources and efforts: it can be seen that the Adult Learner\u2019s Week was replicated in numerous countries world- wide, only a few of which proved to be sustainable. (cid:4) Do not forget face-to-face interaction: It is important that even when flexible and distance learning options are made available, a compo- nent of face-to-face interaction between educa- tion providers and adult learners is included. This will give learners the feeling that learning is per- sonalised, and provide them with the opportu- nity to access guidance when needed. Moreover, by providing potential learners with the opportu- nity to meet teachers and peer study counsellors face-to-face, the teaching offer could be custom- ised to learners\u2019 needs, and target groups could be redirected towards the appropriate vocational training centres or employment offices. (cid:4) Do not waste resources on lobbying for TV and radio spots (or on other mass commu- nications tools): In countries such as the United Kingdom, cooperating with TV and radio stations to include subject matter within existing content is possible, as the networking stations are open to the idea. However, in most other countries, networks do not solicit suggestions for content; rather, they focus on portraying what is currently topical in the news. Therefore, rather than trying to \u2018place\u2019 content on an existing TV or radio show, it is better to focus resources on making the sub- ject of adult learning a national or regional topic of conversation. Moreover, while mass commu- nication tools have the potential to reach a wide audience, they are very difficult to measure in terms of impact and follow up action. Therefore, unless they can be used in a very cost-effective way, they should be avoided.

        "Overview of activity Objectives The aim of IntALWinE was to enhance the strategic potential of learning festivals and to develop a more consolidated European framework of cooperation. The IntALWinE network, comprising coordinators from participating countries, supported national learning festivals by increasing the technical skills of national coordinators and facilitating the involvement of adult learners. It also raised the visibility and status of learning festivals in support of advocacy work for life- long learning. The specific objectives of the IntALWinE network were to: (cid:2) Highlight the stories and perspectives of adult learners and to make them actively participate in the IntALWinE\u2019s network activities; (cid:2) Improve the effectiveness of learning festivals both in the network partner countries and beyond; and (cid:2) Maximise the value of learning festivals as mobi- lisation campaigns for lifelong learning and democracy building. Target groups (cid:2) Policy makers and politicians, including national governments, local and regional governing bod- ies, and international agencies; (cid:2) Education and training providers (both national and local); (cid:2) Cultural institutions; (cid:2) General public: specifically adult learners; and (cid:2) Local and national non-governmental bodies such as unions. International Adult Learners\u2019 Week in Europe Europe-wide International Adult Learners\u2019 Week in Europe (IntALWinE) was a Europe-wide network, linking coordina- tors of national learning festivals in 15 European countries, and was supported by the EU programme, Grundtvig. The three-year network project, which ran from 2003-2005, was coordinated by the UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning (UIL) \u2013 formerly UNESCO Institute for Education (UIE), and drew on and built up the strategic potential of learning festivals, with a view to developing a more consolidated European framework of cooperation. It also aimed to enhance the role of adult learners and use their input while developing learning processes. During the IntALWinE programme, there were Adult Learners\u2019 Weeks in the following countries: Austria, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Italy, Hungary, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Romania, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Tools used by the IntALWinE network During the activity (cid:2) Festivals in partner countries; (cid:2) Working meetings and groups; (cid:2) Active participation of adult learners from part- ner countries, including input into the evalu- ation of the network and formulation of policy recommendations; (cid:2) Study visits; and (cid:2) Communication by e-mail. Post activity (cid:2) Website: Contains all the records of the project, and is intended as an ongoing gateway to the learning festivals landscape in Europe. It also remains as a repository of technical support tools, relevant links, useful materials, contacts and learners\u2019 stories; (cid:2) Publications: including \u2018Ten Tips to Professionals for Involving Adult Learners\u2019, and \u2018I did it my way.

The final result was a series of examples and guiding principles. (cid:2) Strategic perspective: This focused on dem- onstrating the potential of learning festivals for lifelong learning and democracy building. The part- ners discussed and developed policy recommen- dations addressed to policy makers, adult learning providers, cultural institutions, and media. 1 st meeting, Hamburg: Established working relations, reviewed planned activities, and struc- tured assignments around concrete tasks in smaller working groups. 2 nd meeting, Helsinki: Included a study visit to Finnish Adult Learners\u2019 Week events. An infor- mation leaflet was finalised and activities of the working group were advanced. 3 rd meeting, Maastricht: Provided an oppor- tunity to disseminate its work during confer- ences, through information stands, posters, and workshops. 4 th meeting, Reykjavik: Advanced assignments related to working groups, and saw a discussion on the publication \u2018I did it my way\u2019. 5 th meeting, Vilnius: Saw partners meet with local Lithuanian festival organisers, as well as disseminate the activities of IntALWinE. 6 th meeting, Rome: Organised in conjunction with the UPTER learning festival. The partners presented their work to adult educators and man- agers, and then wrapped up the activities and tasks of IntALWinE, with a focus on the policy pro- posals. They also observed a learning festival in the South of Europe.

        "Active participation of adult learners from partner countries 1. Adult Learners\u2019 Forum: An adult learner from each country got together and shared experi- ences of being consulted in the design of learn- ing, improved skills, developed recommendations for professions and policy makers, set up future cooperation, and planned actions as a multi- plier to set up a local or national Adult Learners\u2019 Forums in their respective countries. 2. International Adult Learners\u2019 Study Tour: Learners met again and reviewed the outcomes of their first meeting. The Study Tour assessed what the learners had done as follow up, explored possibilities for continuation of Forums, discussed future strategies to improve participa- tion by learners at policy makers\u2019 debates, and participated in activities organised. 3. Collection and publication of learning biog- raphies: The biographies, from partner coun- tries, included the stories of the participants in the Forum and Study Tour. The collection was entitled \u2018I did it my way. Journeys of Learning in Europe\u2019, and was available in English, French and German. Greek, Bulgarian and Hungarian versions were later produced by the respective IntALWinE partners. While learners\u2019 stories had already been documented within several coun- tries, the network\u2019s publication was the first international documentation of its type. 4. Policy recommendations: Adult learners pro- duced policy recommendations, along with propos- als, based on their own perspectives, detailing how to involve adult learner representatives in the devel- opment of adult learning policies and provision. Results of the activity The results of the activities including the develop- ment of the following: 1. Good Practices Based on what was considered to be good and successful practices in partner countries, the good practices aimed to promote and improve learning festivals and adult learners\u2019 weeks. Five categories were identified that constitute key elements of learning festivals: Events and activi- ties, general promotional material, media atten- tion, sponsorships, and awards. 2. Cooperation Models This contained suggestions for the creation and maintenance of cooperation with a range of partners, in order to support current and future organisers of learning festivals. 3. Evaluation Methods This aimed to provide instruments and examples for the evaluation of learning festivals, so that organisers of learning festivals could create a qual- ity control mechanism for their activities and build up evidence to make a case for the benefits of their learning festival vis-\u00e0-vis external partners and supporters. This included general recommendations for evaluations, useful criteria to be applied when evaluating, and additional tips. It also included two addition tools: a model of how to construct an eval- uation scheme, and an evaluation matrix that could be adapted. 4. Guidelines to Reach Out to and Involve Learners in Consultation These guidelines were generated by the interna- tional learner participating in the International Adult Learners\u2019 Forum. It provided the basis to develop \u2018Ten Tips to Professionals for Involving Adult Learners\u2019, which was included as part of the policy recommendations on IntALWinE\u2019s website. 5. Collection and publication of stories of learning This involved adult learners from the partner countries, and contained stories from learners from 14 different European countries. Lessons learnt from the activity (cid:4) Create pan European networks: Pan European networks allow for interaction between coordina- tors and representatives from each country, and facilitate the collection of best practices in order to develop better targeted festivals in the future. It also allows for development of mechanisms that would allow for extensive international data collection and evaluation of campaigns. Moreover, when organising countries are part of a wider network, there is a sense of pressure on them to ensure that their results are on par with the rest of the network. This would therefore facilitate greater efforts invested into making the programme a success. (cid:4) Use festivals: Learning festivals and Adult Learner\u2019s Weeks help to overcome the boundaries E U R O P E A N G U I D E S t r a t e g i e s f o r i m p r o v i n g p a r t i c i p a t i o n i n a n d a w a r e n e s s o f a d u l t l e a r n i n g 30 NC3112514ENC_002.pdf 28 25/07/12 16:14 ",
        "between formal, non-formal and informal learning modes, and thereby contribute to a holistic under- standing of lifelong learning and the development of lifelong learning cultures. These events pro- vide a public arena for debate and dialogue, and offer opportunities to propose, discuss and sift the ground for education policies. They also pro- vide politicians with the floor to issue statements or make appearances in the media. All these fac- tors create broad public visibility for the diversity of learning opportunities and communicate the value of lifelong learning, thereby motivating more adults to take up or return to learning. (cid:4) Involve learners: The IntALWinE network cre- ated specific activities for gauging learners\u2019 opin- ions that put their voices to centre stage and gave a public arena to their learning needs, inter- ests and concerns. By involving learners in the development and delivery of strategies for adult learning festivals, the activities would include their perspectives, which would mean that edu- cation policies and strategies would be based on their needs. (cid:4) Include fieldwork: As part of the IntALWinE network\u2019s activities, participants visited Adult Learner\u2019s Weeks and festivals in countries where conferences were held, on study visits. By visiting these events, organisers and coordinators from other countries could gain best practice exam- ples that could then potentially be implemented in their own countries. (cid:4) Keep tools after the completion of the activ- ity as learning repositories: The result of the IntALWinE network was a series of best prac- tices, documents, and measurement tools that would be invaluable for an organisation develop- ing a learning festival in their respective country. In most cases, once the lifetime of a project closes, so does access to its documentation. However, the IntALWinE network\u2019s website remains live, con- tains all records of the project, and is a repository of support tools, useful materials and links that could help in the development of new festivals. (cid:4) Coordinate research: The IntALWinE project highlight the fact that there is a lack of research at national and international level highlighting the impact of the participation into the learn- ing process. National governments and organ- isations developing learning festivals should therefore ensure that they document the over- all added value that lifelong learning generates for both individuals and the community at large. Also important are surveys that ask the opinions of participants in the festivals, in order to gain more information on which types of people are learning, and where there is lack of attendance, as well as what learners found were the major obstacles to their participation. (cid:4) Provide non financial support: Often, while international cooperation bodies are formed, they face barriers to efficient meeting and coor- dination due to lack of finances in the execution of their activities. National and regional govern- ments could therefore assist them through the provision of free services (in lieu of financial sup- port), such as access to various locations and facilities to hold meetings, availability of govern- mental buildings, and the possibility of reduced transport costs. This case study has been developed based on numerous online sources, including: - The IntALWinE website ( 25 ); - Beating the Drums for Attention: Proceedings and Outcomes of the Socrates/Grundtvig Network ( 26 ); and - European Infonet Adult Education ( 27 ).

        "Overview of activity Objectives The core themes of the Adult Learners\u2019 Week (ALW) have stayed the same since the inception of the pro- gramme. These include giving the adult education sector a chance to celebrate its achievements in the field in the previous year, and to engage more peo- ple and bring them into the field of learning. Over the next two to three years, NIACE will: (cid:2) Highlight that it recognises that people learn in different ways in different places ( 34 ); (cid:2) Use more of past best practice stories to encour- age people to come back into learning; and (cid:2) Ensure that adult education retains its importance on the policy agenda in the face of budget cuts. Format ALW is a multilevel campaign with numerous elements: (cid:2) It is primarily a festival of learning that organi- sations around the country use as a focal point to celebrate past achievements of their learners and to engage new learners; (cid:2) It provides an opportunity to present awards to individual learners ( 35 ) and inspiring learning pro- jects ( 36 ) to reward them for their learning stories and achievements; and (cid:2) It allows key stakeholders in the field to influence policy. NIACE invites different UK ministers and key officials from relevant government depart- ments to see the achievements of learners and use those examples to highlight how government policies impact the end users of the organisations. NIACE intentionally retains very little control over the festival\u2019s elements. This gives regional and local organ- isations the freedom to optimise their engagement activities with target groups in their geographic area. Target groups (cid:2) Existing and potential adult learners; (cid:2) NIACE\u2019s intermediaries ( 37 ); (cid:2) Organisations involved in adult learning; and (cid:2) Policy makers and funders ( 38 ). How was the activity developed? In 1992, the chief executive of NIACE was made aware of a similar festival to what is now the ALW, but on a smaller scale when a colleague visited the US. There was a realisation that in the UK, there was not enough recognition and celebration of achieve- ments in the field of adult education. The ALW was conceived to publicise adult education in the UK, as well as to have a voice in the policy debate. The strength of the ALW campaign is that it has always been a very collaborative campaign. Anybody can be involved and anybody who hosts an event or ceremony can customise it as required. The main steps in the development of the activity each year are as follows: E U R O P E A N G U I D E S t r a t e g i e s f o r i m p r o v i n g p a r t i c i p a t i o n i n a n d a w a r e n e s s o f a d u l t l e a r n i n g 32 (28) Adult Learners\u2019 Week is celebrated in over 55 countries across the world.

(35) http://www.alw.org.uk/ learning-awards/individuals/ how-to-nominate (36) http://www.alw.org.uk/ learning-awards/projects/ how-to-nominate (37) These include literacy tutors (who work in adult education colleges, formal education establishments, and who would be teaching literacy classes for most of their working week), Union learning representatives (who distribute materials to their member\u2019s organisations), voluntary groups and charities (engaged in adult learning as well as other fields, such as old age care, young mothers), and community leaders (in the field of adult learning). (38) This includes encouraging government ministers from key departments and representatives from departments that fund NIACE to attend events in London during the Week. NIACE also encourages members from all political parties to attend, as all ministers have learners in their respective constituencies. Adult Learners\u2019 Week NIACE, United Kingdom 2 Adult Learners' Week is an annual event in the UK ( 28 ) that celebrates learning and learners, and aims to inspire people of all ages and backgrounds to get back into learning. It promotes the benefits of all kinds of learning, both for personal development and professional qualifications. It also recognises achieve- ments of outstanding individuals and inspiring learning projects through national and regional awards. The Adult Learners\u2019 Week was founded and is co-ordinated each year by the UK National Institute of Adult Continuing Education (NIACE) ( 29 ). The event is backed by a myriad of supporters, including the European Social Fund, the UK Department for Business, Innovation and Skills ( 30 ), Next Step ( 31 ), BBC ( 32 ), The Open University and Pearson PLC. ( 33 ) It is the UK's longest running festival of learning. Each year thousands of events take place in workplaces, libraries, cafes, prisons, museums and colleges across the country, motivating adults to take up new activities.

        "1. Evaluation: NIACE evaluates the previous year\u2019s campaign, its events, awards and activities, deter- mines what worked and what did not, and how the following year\u2019s campaign could be improved. 2. Campaign plan: (cid:2) NIACE then develops a campaign plan, with specific goals as to what it wants to achieve \u2013 both in the short term of 12 months, as well as in the longer term of one to three years ( 39 ). (cid:2) It then determines which elements of the campaign would best help achieve the set goals. (cid:2) In addition to specific campaign goals, NIACE develops key themes, around which it plans its Awards Ceremony. NIACE first determines the number of nominations it wishes to achieve for its awards, the number of events to be held, sponsorship opportunities, and what important advocacy agenda items it was faced with in the past 12 months. (cid:2) It aims to diversify the audience, by retain- ing old participants, and engaging new ones. NIACE places great importance on ensuring that the campaign is refreshed every year, given that it has been running for 20 years and runs the risk of tiring its target audience. Moreover, it adapts how it works with partners and media organisations each year, based on changes in the landscape. (cid:2) It also aims to get more organisations involved, by giving them a vehicle for positive publicity, and acts as a showcase of best practice. 3. Funding: NIACE receives funding from the Euro- pean Social Fund ( 40 ) (ESF), and the UK Department for Business, Innovation and Skills ( 41 ) (BIS). 4. Sponsorship: NIACE then solicits sponsorship from key organisations for activities outside the remit of the ESF proposal. These organisations are from areas that NIACE wishes to target. In the first year of interaction with these organi- sations, NIACE engages them in activities. Once these organisations are convinced of the advan- tages of getting involved, they are then solicited for sponsorship. 5. Regional Coordinator: For each targeted gov- ernmental region, NIACE assigns a Regional Coordinator who acts as its \u2018voice\u2019 in the region. Coordinators are contracted to deliver a specific number of activities and to generate nominations from organisations within that region. They are required to interact with and engage as many organisations as possible, keep them involved in the campaign, and deliver to NIACE the targeted number of nominations and events. They then help in the whole selection process of winners. 6. Nominations for Awards Ceremony: Learners and projects are then identified through NIACE\u2019s intermediaries. In addition, organisations can nom- inate their own projects to gain press and publicity. 7. Adult Learner\u2019s Week: The event comprises five days, with specific activities for each day. These include: (cid:2) Events: NIACE coordinates national/regional events, and local organisations run their own events. (cid:2) Awards Ceremony: National and regional awards are given to individuals as well as pro- jects. The winner receives a certificate, and indi- viduals receive prize money that goes towards funding their further education. NIACE also adapts its awards portfolio to reflect what is on the government agenda. For instance, it may ask a minister, with responsibility over a portfo- lio of importance to NIACE, to present an award as a way to engage with this policy maker. (cid:2) Policy conference: A policy conference is held during the Week to discuss how learn- ing can affect and improve communities both socially and economically. (cid:2) Special activities: In 2011, NIACE con- tacted winners from previous years, brought them on stage at the various awards ceremo- nies, interviewed them about their learning journeys, and the progress they have made since they won an award. NIACE also gave an Outstanding Contribution Award to Sir David Attenborough ( 42 ), to highlight educating one- self through watching TV programmes. Promotion (cid:2) Website: ALW\u2019s website. (cid:2) E-mails: Communication with intermediaries. (cid:2) Networking: Regional Coordinators are sent to attend meetings with relevant stakeholders and promote the ALW campaign through exhibition stands and other literature provided by NIACE. (cid:2) Social media ( 43 ) : NIACE uses Twitter to provide announcements about milestones in the cam- paign, and as a way to express its appreciation to participating organisations that have been nom- inated for awards. Once winners of awards are announced, NIACE uses Twitter to provide links to the stories. In addition, NIACE tweets live from its award ceremonies. E U R O P E A N G U I D E S t r a t e g i e s f o r i m p r o v i n g p a r t i c i p a t i o n i n a n d a w a r e n e s s o f a d u l t l e a r n i n g 33 (39) NIACE targets the private sector in an effort to secure sponsorship. In addition, private sector organisations are less likely to be unionised, and therefore, harder to reach through NIACE\u2019s stakeholders. Hence, targeting these organisations for sponsorships also ensures that employees are made aware of the opportunities available for learning. (40) http://ec.europa.eu/esf/ (41) http://www.bis.gov.uk/ (42) http://www.davidattenborough.co.uk/ (43) NIACE also tried to use Facebook in the past; unfortunately due to lack of resources invested, the effort was not successful. NC3112514ENC_002.pdf 31 25/07/12 16:14 ",
        "(cid:2) Media: NIACE ties in the ALW to broadcasters, mainly the BBC, to highlight the need for adult learning. Around the ALW, the BBC broadcasts a series of short films on adult learning. In addi- tion, local TV or radio stations attend events and talk to learners, which generate interest amongst other target groups. Key messages (cid:2) Learning is good for you \u2013 it can improve your health and provide numerous career opportunities; (cid:2) We recognise that learners have complex and busy lives. We therefore promote learning in all kinds of environments, depending on the one which suits you best; and (cid:2) Learning is fundamental for you to achieve what you\u2019ve always wanted. Results of the activity The results of the activity were measured in two ways: (cid:4) Survey: Each year, NIACE executes a survey of everyone who attended an event and filled out a contact sheet. This survey is run two months after the ALW, over the telephone, to see whether or not they enrolled in a course, whether they intend to, and what else the ALW has stimulated them to do; and (cid:4) Internal assessment: NIACE conducts an inter- nal review of the previous year\u2019s ALW, to deter- mine what worked best, and what aspects need improvement. The results were as follows: (cid:4) Nominations: In 2010, there were a record num- ber of nominations for awards (1 600). This is especially significant given the current financial climate, where there is job insecurity for tutors, and cutbacks on adult learning courses offered by organisations. (cid:4) Events: The number of events (5 000) held this year is very comparable to previous years. (cid:4) Representation from government organisa- tions: The national award ceremony in 2010 was attended by two UK government ministers, numer- ous chief executives, and a senior representative from the European Commission, thereby demon- strating its importance to policy makers. (cid:4) Policy Conference: The policy conference organ- ised the same week as the national Award Ceremony saw a lot of interesting contributions from private sector organisations. (cid:4) Parliamentary Reception: Also during this week, a lunch reception saw a strong turnout of Members of Parliament and the House of Lords. (cid:4) Sponsorship: In 2010, NIACE saw a high level of sponsorship (outside of the ESF and the UK Department of Business, Innovation and Skills) with an increase of close to 35 %. Lessons learnt from the activity (cid:4) Learn from other countries: The ALW was conceived after the Chief Executive of NIACE saw a similar activity in the US, and realised that there was not enough recognition and celebra- tion of adult learning achievements in the UK. Similarly, national adult learning associations in other countries should look beyond their geo- graphical borders, and learn from other coun- tries as to what activities are taking place, to see if any could be adapted to their context. (cid:4) Run a centralised campaign with decentral- ised implementation: Though being a national campaign with predefined goals and themes, implementation ideas and proposed projects are the responsibility of local actors. This decentralised approach encourages innovation and creativity whilst still ensuring the consistency of campaign efforts across the country. (cid:4) Update objectives: The ALW campaign\u2019s objec- tives are updated each year, depending on the current financial atmosphere and policy agenda. This ensures that the campaign is always rele- vant to its stakeholders\u2019 needs. (cid:4) Involve policy makers in the process of development: Representatives from national and regional governments are involved in the entire process of the ALW. This helps ensure that they become active stakeholders, rather than passive listeners. Moreover, the organisations involved in the ALW adapt and shape their events and awards to suit the agenda of policy makers. The events allow policy makers to use ALW events to promote themselves to their constituents.

        "(cid:4) Gain sponsorship for activities through dem- onstration of return of investment: NIACE solicits sponsorship from key organisations in areas that it wishes to target specifically. It does this successfully by first engaging them in activ- ities that convince them of the advantages of getting involved, and only after does it solicit them for sponsorship. (cid:4) Engage stakeholders from private sector: At a time of tighter public spending, efforts to engage stakeholders from the private sector are key to ensuring sustainability of funding. These actors also have the potential to better integrate and promote adult learning into their own struc- tures (e.g. by promoting it in the workplace). (cid:4) Identify numerous sources of funding: NIACE identified other organisations with a vested interest in educating adults, and solicited spon- sorship from them. By looking for funding beyond traditional public sources (e.g. national govern- ments and the European Union), NIACE was able to acquire more financing for its activities as well as gain wider promotion. (cid:4) Collaborate with multiple partners: NIACE cooperated with numerous partners at local, regional and national level, which was a factor in its widespread success. Therefore, to ensure wider impact of a campaign and its awareness raising activities, it is key to collaborate with multiple part- ners who understand their geographic markets. (cid:4) Showcase various opportunities available: Adult learning is multifaceted and can take place in different forms. This applies to both course content and structure. The ALW strives to show- case these, and therefore places importance on communicating to potential learners the variety of options available to them. (cid:4) Get well-known and well-respected actors involved: NIACE presented an award to Sir David Attenborough, who is associated with learning in different forms. This increased media coverage of the ALW and provided Sir Attenborough with recog- nition of his achievements. By involving a high pro- file person in the campaign, there is mutual benefit by means of increased profiles of both parties. (cid:4) Celebrate achievements: Part of the ALW\u2019s remit is to celebrate achievements of learn- ers and learning projects. This helps provide incentives to learners to re-enter education, and to highlight to policy makers the progress made in the field of adult education as well as future steps to undertake. (cid:4) Provide publicity for partners: By providing publicity to participating organisations, both in terms of their involvement in the ALW as well as their regular activities, NIACE ensures that partners have incentives to be involved in future campaigns. (cid:4) Demonstrate role models: By using actual learners as role models, the ALW campaign makes learning more accessible and real for potential learners. Moreover, by getting learners from all backgrounds and professions to share their sto- ries, their counterparts who wish to re-enter edu- cation can see themselves mirrored, and be encouraged to follow the path of the role models. (cid:4) Constantly reinvent approaches: NIACE adopts an open approach to the ALW, by constantly seek- ing to engage new actors and identifying inno- vative ways of proposing adult learning to the public. By re-inventing the way it is promoted, the potential pitfall risk of adult learning becom- ing rhetorical and abstract is reduced.

        "Overview of the activity The Adult Learning Campaign Toolkit is a collection of tools, resources, and information for states, pol- icy makers, legislators and education organisations planning to develop campaigns targeting adults, specifically those with no secondary education diploma. The kit comprises of operational tools such as strategy ideas, campaign ads, communication plans\u2019 development and roll-out guidelines, budg- eting information, reports, statistics and research material on the status quo of adult education. Format The toolkit is accessible online on the SREB website and resources are organised per target group (i.e. policy maker, educator or adult learner) in order to better reflect their needs. Target groups (cid:2) Adults 25 years and older who did not previously earn a high school diploma. (cid:2) State policy makers in the education sector and actors impacted by them (e.g. state agencies). (cid:2) Education providers, including teachers. Objectives (cid:2) Increase the number of working adults above the age of 25 with a GED ( 46 ) qualification. (cid:2) Encourage the 16 states to share resources on adult learning promotion whilst reducing costs. (cid:2) Build and/or strengthen capacity in these states to improve the quality of their workforce. (cid:2) Demonstrate the impact of educational attain- ment on local, state and regional economies. (cid:2) Promote social change in adults\u2019 perception of the importance of education. (cid:2) Provide useful campaign strategies that states can utilise to reach adults. (cid:2) Utilise existing educational/training resources, in particular, online and distance learning strategies to reach working adults. Development and Promotion 1. Situational analysis and inception: Since its foundation, SREB has been producing key research and quality reports on educational achievements and effectiveness of provisions to encourage formal learning in its 16 states. Collecting data and sta- tistics on demographics, degree attainment levels, labour market and economic growth at state and regional level has facilitated an understanding of the situation of adult education within those states as well as nationwide. Put in comparative perspec- tive, the figures produced were used to make a case for each state individually. In 2001, SREB kicked- off a campaign targeting state leaders and pol- icy makers to raise awareness of the number of working age adults without high school diplomas or post-secondary education credentials and fol- lowing implications in economic and social terms. Thereafter, a few states implemented a series of campaigns that appeared successful in bringing about structural changes and in raising aware- ness. These initiatives inspired the development of a campaign toolkit, which could serve as guideline and repository of operational tools for policy mak- ers to convince more adults to return to school. 2. Partners and funding: Further to publishing a key report on the educational challenges in the adult learning sector, in 2004 SREB received E U R O P E A N G U I D E S t r a t e g i e s f o r i m p r o v i n g p a r t i c i p a t i o n i n a n d a w a r e n e s s o f a d u l t l e a r n i n g 36 (44) http://www.sreb.org/ (45) These member states are: Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia.

Only individuals who have not earned a high-school diploma may take GED tests.

It is one of four regional education compacts and works with 16 Southern states ( 45 ) to help state policy makers and education leaders improve quality and access to secondary and post-secondary education, including adult learning. SREB developed the Adult Learning Campaign Toolkit in 2004 to provide strategy and campaign tools to policy makers and educators on how to increase adults\u2019 awareness of and participation in formal learning programmes.

        "a grant from the Lumina Foundation ( 47 ) to develop the Adult Learning Campaign Toolkit project. The project was developed in partnership with educational authorities across its 16 states as well as policy makers who endorsed the ini- tiative. SREB also founded the GO ALLIANCE ( 48 ) partnership, which consists of an interstate coop- erative aimed at convincing students of the importance of graduating from high school. 3. Promotion: The toolkit was promoted by leverag- ing existing and well-established internal channels of communication with legislators, policy makers, state agencies and educational authorities. These comprised of networking and meeting opportu- nities with state representatives during govern- ing boards meetings and sessions held by SREB\u2019s internal \u2018subgroups\u2019 ( 49 ) (e.g. the Legislative group and the Educational Technology Cooperative). These occasions were used to promote the toolkit and to present research findings, nature of activi- ties needed at state level, campaign ads ideas, etc. Evaluation (cid:4) Formal evaluation: A formal evaluation was conducted by the grant-providing organisation. (cid:4) Internal evaluation: SREB has been regularly monitoring progress and changes in adult edu- cation participation rates at member state level since the beginning of the activity. This exercise has enabled the formulation of specific recom- mendations to improve performance and meas- ure state achievements against national and other states\u2019 average. It also served to identify emerging best practice. (cid:4) Feedback: Positive changes in education struc- tures and adult learning offerings were seen in various states on the basis of the targeted pol- icy recommendations developed by SREB for each of them. SREB was invited to work directly with several of its members in order to launch awareness-raising and engagement campaigns. Particularly successful was the strategy enacted by state agencies in Louisiana, where the govern- ment established a taskforce for adult education. Lessons learnt from the activity (cid:4) Develop toolkits: SREB identified the need for stakeholders developing programmes and campaigns to access more than just other examples of best practice. Guidance needs to be more struc- tured, specific, and process-oriented in the form of operational tools to develop, implement and evalu- ate campaign programmes. These include commu- nication plan guidelines, research tools, campaign ads, strategy ideas, budgeting tutorials and other operational tools. (cid:4) Pool resources to reduce costs: By pooling a set of common operational tools supporting the activities of the various stakeholders, all parties involved in implementing adult learning cam- paigns benefit from reduced costs and wider access to a shared set of established resources. This is particularly profitable for grassroots and community organisations with limited financial and/or human resource availability and, thus, with no sufficient capacity to develop tools from scratch. The fact that these tools are based on research evidence ensures their suitability to reach out to the target group. (cid:4) Use research: SREB uses its national and regional research both in the creation of educa- tional programmes for each member state, as well as in the development of customised com- munication campaigns. This ensures that its campaigns reflect the strategic directions of the programme, and that the campaign\u2019s objectives are always SMART ( 50 ) and quantifiable. This in turn allows for proper monitoring and evaluation of campaign results. (cid:4) Identify common definitions and data sets: By collecting large amounts of datasets and thoroughly analysing of the status quo of adult learning in each individual state, SREB developed a clearer definition of adult education and meth- ods for data collection. This facilitates the com- parability of information at state, regional and national levels, and allows the establishment of benchmarks. It also helps overcome challenges posed by the lack of a common definition of \u2018adult education\u2019, including its scope and focus. (cid:4) Target a specific group: In order for adult learn- ing initiatives to be successful, it is necessary that activities be targeted towards a specific segment of the audience. Adult learners vary greatly in their attitude, perception and potential access to infor- mation on education opportunities as well as teach- ing itself. Internal differentiations also exist among learners belonging to the same \u2018adult learning\u2019 group (e.g. women at risk of social exclusion), and E U R O P E A N G U I D E S t r a t e g i e s f o r i m p r o v i n g p a r t i c i p a t i o n i n a n d a w a r e n e s s o f a d u l t l e a r n i n g 37 (47) The Lumina Foundation is a private organisation based in Indianapolis committed to enrolling and graduating more students from college.

        "thus research is needed to identify the right target, age group and, on that basis, the most suited tools and messages to engage with them. (cid:4) Include adult education in other policy agenda items: SREB attends board meetings of pol- icy makers and educators in its member states, and identifies areas these boards are interested in developing, that would tie into adult education. By supporting these interests, SREB propagates its adult education agenda, providing policy mak- ers with evidence on how improving structures for adult learning can help them achieve their socio- economic goals. In this manner, by participating in conversations that go beyond the realm of adult education, SREB is able to ensure that its priority areas are also lobbied for by others. (cid:4) Aim to promote social change: SREB\u2019s efforts to promote adult learning go beyond increasing the number of adults enrolled in GED educational programmes. Such efforts also try to positively change the general perception and attitude towards high school education at national level. This means that investments are directed towards tackling challenges posed by low school achieve- ments in society at their roots. Examples such as the GO ALLIANCE partnership demonstrate that a preventative strategy raising awareness on the importance of high school studies among teenag- ers is more desirable than a late-intervention pro- gramme compensating for missed opportunities. (cid:4) Produce evidence on the wider benefits of adult learning: SREB\u2019s intervention aims to strengthen the workforce and quality of life at individual and societal level. In order to do this, it is necessary to encourage debate and produce evi- dence on the benefits of adult learning beyond the educational sector. Such evidence should be more widely disseminated, particularly among policy makers, showing tangibly why and how investing in adult learning can impact other sectors. (cid:4) Leverage internal promotional channels: Using internal networks, contacts and informal channels of communication can prove fruitful in promoting debate or attention on specific issues. SREB\u2019s example shows how an organisation can use its internal and cross-departmental links to reach out to legislators, policy makers and public institutions to promote its agenda. (cid:4) Support external evaluation with internal monitoring: Besides the formal and independent evaluation conducted by the grant-providing organisations, SREB has regularly measured pro- gress and change in policy and participation rates at state level since the beginning of the activ- ity. This allowed identification of emerging best practice as well as targeting specific recommen- dations to state actors. (cid:4) Viewing attainment of the GED as a starting point, not ending point: Too often completion of the GED was seen as the terminating point for adult learners. In fact, it should be seen \u2013 and SREB promoted this point \u2013 as an entry pathway to post-secondary education or advanced train- ing. States are encouraged to make adults aware of the many post-secondary opportunities avail- able to them upon completion of the GED. (cid:4) Addressing the post-secondary adult degree completion challenge: The adult learning activ- ities have expanded to include adults with some college credit but no credentials. There are more than 13 million working age adults in the 16 SREB states who fall into this category (and over 35 mil- lion across the 50 states). Using the tools and tech- niques of the Toolkit, SREB has initiated a new initiative targeting such adults and will launch a new website in autumn 2011 (TheAdultLearner. org) that will provide programmes and resources for adults to aid them in completing associate\u2019s or bachelor\u2019s degrees.

        "Overview of the activity Objectives (cid:2) Promote the benefits of getting online to members of the public who have never used the Internet; (cid:2) Direct the target group to a free advisory tele- phone line that can provide advice and support on suitable local and free computer and Internet courses run by partners across the UK; (cid:2) Support learning through print resources contain- ing simple, accessible and jargon-free guidelines on how to take the first steps with technology and the Internet; (cid:2) Directly engage audiences at partner-led events to get them using computers and the Internet on a range of topics of interest (e.g. holiday plan- ning, photo sharing, gardening); and (cid:2) Build the audience\u2019s confidence with positive TV and radio messages. Format (cid:2) TV and radio trailers ( 55 ) aimed at marketing the initiative and directing the audience to a free- phone number where they can find support and advice on suitable local and free computer/ Internet courses; (cid:2) Print material comprising learning resources and tutorials for beginners and course leaders; and (cid:2) A website, which is a supporting teaching tool ( 56 ) for course leaders, and includes interactive graphic demonstrations of the content described in the print material (e.g. how to use and click a mouse). Target groups (cid:2) Offline adults above the age of 55 without prior computer or Internet knowledge who, although lacking the skills and confidence to use technol- ogy, understand the benefits of it (\u2018active consid- erers\u2019 ( 57 )); and (cid:2) Education providers and course leaders interested in setting up and running a First Click course. Development and Promotion 1. Needs assessment and inception: Further to the publication of the 2009 UK Government White Paper on Digital Britain ( 58 ), BBC First Click was conceived with the goal of reaching out to the estimated 9.2 million (about 21 % of the UK popu- lation) people with no computer or Internet literacy. Research showed that more than half of this group comprised of individuals aged 65+ not in work, for whom using the web is not a daily occurrence. 2. Objectives of research: First Click was spe- cifically developed to target \u2018active considerers\u2019: those who were relatively aware of the bene- fits of computers and the Internet for personal use, but lacked the skills to use the technol- ogy. Programme developers conducted extensive market research, with the key objectives being to determine the following: (cid:2) Number of off-liners in the UK; (cid:2) Reasons for being offline; E U R O P E A N G U I D E S t r a t e g i e s f o r i m p r o v i n g p a r t i c i p a t i o n i n a n d a w a r e n e s s o f a d u l t l e a r n i n g 39 (51) http://www.bbc.co.uk/learning/ (52) Calls are free from most landlines, 08000 150 950.

It primarily targets adult individuals above the age of 55 with no access to the Internet. It encourages them to overcome their fear of technology and lack of skills, by engaging them in non-formal computer and web learning courses available nationally free of charge. Members of the public can ring a free advisory telephone line ( 52 ), which directs them to the most suitable local computer and web literacy course providers. Courses are run by a wide range of partners ( 53 ) including learning centres, adult learning organisations, community associations, libraries, schools and charities. As part of the course, participants receive a BBC First Click beginner\u2019s guide ( 54 ), which is a printed learning resource containing accessible and jargon-free information on how to start using computers and the Internet.

        "(cid:2) Locations with higher concentration; (cid:2) Demographics; (cid:2) Lifestyle; and (cid:2) Key messages needed. It was found that the \u2018active considerers\u2019 were disin- clined to acquire the skills to use technology, because of a lack of confidence, low perceived benefits ver- sus cost, and fears of damaging the equipment. Considerable research efforts were also invested in developing accessible beginners\u2019 guide materials and teaching supporting tools for course leaders. 3. Messaging development: Prior to the launch of promotional TV and radio trails, script ideas and messaging propositions were tested in focus groups held across the country with target group members of different ages and skills. The key messages identified were: (cid:2) Using technology is easier than you think; (cid:2) There are a lot of people who feel the same way as you \u2013 you are not alone; and (cid:2) You are never too old to learn. 4. Partners: First Click was launched in October 2010, and was implemented in cooperation with a wide range of media literacy partners across the UK. Key campaign partners included the UK Government\u2019s Race Online 2012 ( 59 ) campaign, post offices ( 60 ), UK online centres ( 61 ), and librar- ies across the country. Partners also comprise of other organisations sharing an aligned agenda and ambition to reach out to off-line audiences such as Age UK ( 62 ), Digital Unite ( 63 ), community organisations and education providers. The free- phone advisory service is managed on behalf of BBC Learning by Next Step ( 64 ), which re-directs members of the public to the cooperating institu- tions delivering the courses. 5. Promotion: First Click is promoted by both the BBC and campaign partners. Promotional tools and channels include: (cid:2) Marketing TV and radio trailers produced by the BBC ; (cid:2) Press announcements in most tabloids, broad- sheets and magazines; (cid:2) Partner-led events where potential learners can receive one-to-one guidance and peer advice; (cid:2) Partner organisations\u2019 communications activi- ties; and (cid:2) Leaflets and posters. Evaluation A first data sample taken in early 2011 showed that the number of PC or web illiterate people in the UK had dropped by 500 000. UK National Statistics ( 65 ) is expected to publish more conclusive figures by the end of 2011. However, given the number of media lit- eracy campaigns initiated at national level by various stakeholders, it is somewhat difficult to only meas- ure the direct impact of the BBC First Click campaign. Nevertheless, since the campaign was launched in late 2010, it is estimated that about 30 million peo- ple saw the trailers and traffic on the advisory free- phone line increases significantly when trailers air. Indicators used by the BBC to evaluate the impact of First Click include the following: (cid:2) Number of members of the public calling the advice line; (cid:2) Number of individuals who after calling the advice line enrol in a course; and (cid:2) Number of individuals who after enrolling in a course receive the BBC print material package. Lessons learnt from the activity (cid:4) Use research to define objectives: Combining quantitative and qualitative research methods allowed the identification and engagement of a well-defined segment of the target audience. Considerable time and resources were invested in determining the characteristics of the identi- fied group, thus enabling the establishment of objectives, partnerships, messages and tools for engagement reflecting their needs. Further test- ing enabled the refining of the overall approach. (cid:4) Monitor national research: The First Click pro- ject was conceptualised as a result of the UK Government\u2019s White Paper on Digital Britain. By monitoring national research and evidence, pro- gramme developers were able to identify an existing need of the population, and thereby develop an activity directly tapping this need. (cid:4) Align goals with wider agendas: Though First Click was developed as part of the BBC \u2019s inde- pendent media literacy agenda, the campaign leveraged existing structures and networks of partners working towards the same goal. Examples include the UK Government\u2019s Race Online 2012 initiative and the work of other inde- pendent organisations such as Age UK and Digital Unite. This approach provides an opportunity to E U R O P E A N G U I D E S t r a t e g i e s f o r i m p r o v i n g p a r t i c i p a t i o n i n a n d a w a r e n e s s o f a d u l t l e a r n i n g 40 (59) http://raceonline2012.org/ (60) http://www.postoffice.co.uk/ portal/po (61) http://www.ukonlinecentres.com/ centresearch/ (62) http://www.ageuk.org.uk/ (63) http://digitalunite.com/ (64) Next Step is the UK Government free advisory service for adult learners, https://nextstep.direct.gov.uk/ Pages/home.aspx (65) http://www.statistics.gov.uk/ hub/index.html NC3112514ENC_002.pdf 38 25/07/12 16:14 ",
        "disseminate messages more widely and unify aligned efforts, which would otherwise remain isolated and have lower impact. (cid:4) Value adult learners: It is thought that a key success factor of First Click is that it makes older members of the public (i.e. the primary target group) feel cared about. The campaign aims at building the audience\u2019s confidence in their ability to learn, giving them the message that society cares about getting them involved in using mod- ern technologies. (cid:4) Make learning activities relevant to the target group: First Click is not intended to turn learn- ers into proficient users of computer and Internet programmes, nor does it provide them with a for- mal or professional qualification. It simply aims to teach students the basics of how the web works to enable them to use it for their own personal interests and passions (gardening, cooking, etc.) Furthermore, different to other same-scope ini- tiatives, it does not assume any prior knowledge of how to use computers and puts great emphasis on the accessibility aspect of the programme. This promotes inclusiveness and an opportunity to learn without feeling alienated or left out. (cid:4) Work with complementary stakeholders: Each of the stakeholders involved in First Click had their specific role in the programme, from develop- ment to marketing and delivery. This ensured that each organisation\u2019s remit played to its strength. Moreover, there was no overlap of activities, thereby minimising resources wasted. (cid:4) Directly engage the audience through events: Actors implementing promotional activities for adult learners should not limit themselves to phone-line services, websites, press and similar tools. Suitable opportunities to engage with the target group directly should be identified and used to communicate with potential learners. The BBC example leveraged partner-initiated events to pro- mote the campaign. (cid:2) Build the audience confidence: Adult educa- tion is often not just about literacy or job skills, but includes other components such as self-con- fidence, independence and personal achieve- ment. Participation in existing programmes is often hindered by lack of confidence in one\u2019s capability to succeed on the part of learners. Promotional messages and activities should thus aim at building the target audience\u2019s confidence, identifying ways of pushing the target group to overcome fear and other psychological barriers. A key message used by the BBC First Click cam- paign is \u2018you are not alone\u2019. (cid:4) Dedicate time and thorough research to iden- tify the right messages: Combining different research methods with thorough pre-testing exer- cises allowed the team behind First Click to formu- late impactful messaging propositions appealing to the intended target audience. This requires atten- tive study of characteristics inherent to the audi- ence as well as external factors impacting their lives. Pre-testing should involve members of differ- ent socio-economic and demographic backgrounds and constitute a cost-effective tool for refining activities prior to their launch. It also helps imple- menters obtain a preliminary assessment of the outcomes the programme is likely to determine. (cid:4) Provide an immediate call to action: Callers to the freephone number provided were directed to ICT and web literacy course providers across the UK. A trained advisor conducts an initial assess- ment regarding skills and interest of the caller and re-directs him/her to a local education provider. The TV and radio trailers thus work as an immedi- ate call to action with a tangible benefit. (cid:4) Use mass media: Integrating educational initia- tives in mainstream media significantly increases visibility and promotional impact of programmes. Opportunities to use mass media channels to implement, disseminate or promote adult learn- ing should be explored and leveraged. (cid:4) Implement a wide range of promotional activ- ities: Though using a wide-reaching and power- ful tool such as TV and radio trailers to promote the phone line, the First Click campaign ensured impact using a wide range of print and adver- tising materials, including broadsheets and part- nership with post offices. This helped maximise impact and potential to reach out to off-liners through multiple channels. (cid:4) Identify multiple-purpose tools: First Click uses the website as a supporting learning tool for both beginners and teachers who refer to it during the implementation of their courses. The website is thus a cost-effective tool serving dif- ferent purposes when used by different users. (cid:4) Set measurable indicators: Even if it is not pos- sible to measure the direct impact of a campaign, E U R O P E A N G U I D E S t r a t e g i e s f o r i m p r o v i n g p a r t i c i p a t i o n i n a n d a w a r e n e s s o f a d u l t l e a r n i n g 41 NC3112514ENC_002.pdf 39 25/07/12 16:14 ",
        "it is essential to identify and establish all possi- ble indicators that can be monitored and used to assess the programme\u2019s performance. Though it is difficult to isolate the impact of the First Click campaign from other parallel media liter- acy undertakings, the BBC uses a series of tangi- ble quantitative measures to assess performance patterns and impact of the programme. This case study has been developed based on an inter- view with the Project Manager of the BBC\u2019s First Click Programme. The content of the study has not been veri- fied by the BBC post interview.

        "Overview of activity Objectives (cid:2) Make people more aware of their rights and responsibilities; (cid:2) Increase understanding of existing EU laws which protect all citizens from discrimination based on the grounds of sex, racial/ethnic origin, religion/ belief, disability, age or sexual orientation; and (cid:2) Fight against stereotypes and promote the ben- efits of diversity in society. Beyond these objectives, FDAD is also a capacity- building tool: it gathers and works with national partners, NGOs, ministries, equality bodies, trade unions and employer associations active in the fight against discrimination to build an \u2018antidiscrimination community\u2019. Format FDAD is an integrated cross-media campaign including: (cid:2) The campaign\u2019s website; (cid:2) Social media ( 67 ); (cid:2) E-mails ( 68 ) and newsletters ( 69 ); (cid:2) Audiovisual activities (short films/documentaries, images, video clips, Video News Releases); (cid:2) Radio ads; (cid:2) Printed materials; and (cid:2) Events. Target groups (cid:2) Youths aged 16 to 25, who are future actors in society, and who are at risk of facing discrimina- tion (particularly when looking for a job); (cid:2) Employers, including SMEs, which account for 99 % of all companies in the EU; and (cid:2) Media. Key Messages (cid:2) Discrimination is unlawful \u2013 you have rights; (cid:2) The EU is protecting you from discrimination in your daily life; (cid:2) There is a positive counterpart to discrimination \u2013 diversity; and (cid:2) All of us stand to gain from measures that com- bat discrimination and promote diversity. How was the activity developed? (cid:2) Besides the European Commission, the main actors involved in the development and implementation of the campaign are: (cid:2) National authorities across the 27 EU Member States; (cid:2) Pan-European NGOs (e.g. Age Platform Europe ( 70 ), European Disability Forum ( 71 ), ILGA ( 72 ), ENAR ( 73 )); (cid:2) National level civil society actors; (cid:2) Trade unions; (cid:2) Equality bodies; and (cid:2) European Commission national representations and their networks ( 74 ). The main steps in the development of the activity are: 1. Historic activities: Further to the Amsterdam Treaty ( 75 ), the EU adopted new laws against dis- crimination in the workplace, education, social E U R O P E A N G U I D E S t r a t e g i e s f o r i m p r o v i n g p a r t i c i p a t i o n i n a n d a w a r e n e s s o f a d u l t l e a r n i n g 43 (66) http://ec.europa.eu/justice/ discrimination/index_en.htm (67) Social media tools were used to keep journalists and citizens informed on upcoming events and ongoing activities (e.g. Diversity Days).

Against Discrimination.\u2019 (FDAD) is a pan-European information campaign run by the European Commission\u2019s Directorate-General for Justice ( 66 ). The aim of the campaign is to raise aware- ness of discrimination, and generate debate on the themes of diversity and discrimination and how peo- ple in Europe stand to gain from greater equality. Through its activities, the campaign works to convey to as many people as possible that a diverse Europe is something to be valued, and that a life free from discrimination is a fundamental EU right. It also aims to inform and empower people to combat discrimination in all aspects of their lives.

This was a six-year funding pro- gramme aimed at increasing awareness of exist- ing laws, supporting organisations working in the field, and carrying out research to increase public understanding of discrimination. The Commission is pursuing further its efforts in this direc- tion (including the antidiscrimination campaign) through the PROGRESS programme (2007-2013). 2. Launch and implementation of programme: A part of the Community Action Programme to Combat Discrimination was FDAD, which was launched in June 2003. In each EU Member State, the activities were implemented in close cooperation with national partners, NGOs, min- istries, trade unions, employer associations and equality bodies. The national partners used their contacts and networks to spread awareness of events and activities taking place. 3. EU Advisory Group: An advisory group, chaired y the European Commission, was set up, which included pan-European umbrella organisations, such as the Platform of European Social NGOs ( 78 ), the European Trade Union Confederation ( 79 ) (ETUC), Business Europe ( 80 ), and the European Fundamental Rights Agency ( 81 ). Its role was to act as a consultative body, to evaluate the cam- paign on a regular basis and help designing the future development and strategy. It was the EU level of the national working groups. 4. Establishment of steering committees: Steering committees or National Working Groups were established in each Member State to custom- ise the campaign\u2019s activities for their audiences. These committees brought together more than 500 member organisations to discuss how best to conduct the campaign. This included seeing how various organisations could be involved in campaign activities, and how they could use the campaign to help promote their own work. 5. Campaign measures: All campaign elements were developed in close cooperation with part- ners on a national and European level. The cam- paign design consisted of a slogan and logo, which could be adapted to all EU languages in all Member States. The national groups from each Member State agreed on a same phrase which summed up the main objectives of the cam- paign, while respecting the cultural and linguistic context of each country. They were tested and discussed in focus groups and then reworked accordingly. Promotion and activities The FDAD campaign was promoted through numer- ous ways, including traditional and electronic media. Activities were designed for EU and national level and include: (cid:2) Diversity days (2009-2010): Entertaining and educational events organised to raise awareness about discrimination, the EU and national laws and the activities of EU and national stakeholders. (cid:2) Campaign Truck (2004-2008): This truck trav- elled from city to city, with the message of equal- ity and diversity. (cid:2) Athletes for diversity (2004-2006): Runners and people in wheelchairs were invited to wear a running shirt carrying the campaign\u2019s slogan \u2018run for diversity\u2019 during numerous sports events. (cid:2) Debates: European and national conferences were organised to foster dialogue on anti-discrim- ination. These facilitated communication among businesses, NGOs, policy makers and the public. (cid:2) Competitions: Through various media, such as photography, posters, television (such as MTV) etc., young people were encouraged to express their feel- ings about discrimination, and were awarded prizes. (cid:2) Diversity ambassadors: During the European Year of Equal Opportunities (EYEO) 2007, well- known faces, from sport, TV and business were committed to gain the interest of the media and of the public on the goals of the campaign. (cid:2) Journalist awards: Since 2004, the EU Journalist Award recognised the talents of print and online journalists who through their work are raising awareness about discrimination and diversity. (cid:2) Journalist seminars on diversity: To reach out to the media, a series of journalist seminars were organised in cooperation with the national unions of journalists, especially in countries where there was less of an interest by national media in cov- ering the issues of discrimination and diversity. Journalists were informed about EU anti-dis- crimination policy, presented with case studies, and given the opportunity to learn about national anti-discrimination legislation. (cid:2) National events: The National Working Groups of the campaign in each of the Member States decided every year on events where campaign messages could be conveyed. Some events were specifically focussed on younger people and used sports or music to grab their attention. (cid:2) Campaign website: The website catered to vis- itors in 22 languages and underwent several E U R O P E A N G U I D E S t r a t e g i e s f o r i m p r o v i n g p a r t i c i p a t i o n i n a n d a w a r e n e s s o f a d u l t l e a r n i n g 44 (76) http://ec.europa.eu/justice/ discrimination/rights/ index_en.htm (77) http://europa.eu/ legislation_summaries/ employment_and_social_ policy/antidiscrimination_ relations_with_civil_society/ l33113_en.htm (78) http://www.socialplatform.org/ (79) http://www.etuc.org/ (80) http://www.businesseurope.eu/ Content/Default.asp (81) http://fra.europa.eu/fraWebsite/ home/home_en.htm NC3112514ENC_002.pdf 42 25/07/12 16:14 ",
        "changes in layout and structure since the begin- ning of the campaign with the goal of keeping it attractive (including new media elements), up-to- date with the European policies and making it as accessible as possible. The website is the main communication platform used to inform the pub- lic about the activities of the campaign. (cid:2) Print publications: To reach the various target groups, a range of different information and pro- motional materials were produced. These included brochures, postcards, leaflets and toolboxes. Funding The campaign is funded through the EU programme PROGRESS ( 82 ), from which it has received EUR 3 mil- lion on average each year since 2007. Results of the activity (cid:2) The activity was assessed based on feedback from national stakeholders, journalists and cit- izens on activities such as the Truck Tour, the Journalist Award, Diversity Days, and events. This feedback is collected through questionnaires. (cid:2) Three ( 83 ) Eurobarometer surveys ( 84 ) on the pub- lic perception of discrimination have been con- ducted so far. The next one is expected in 2012. (cid:2) A survey taken amongst the general public by the National Working Groups in 2007 showed that 80 % of respondents believed that the cam- paign was successful in helping to raise aware- ness of anti-discrimination issues. More than 80 % of partners surveyed regularly participated in national meetings and distributed campaign information and promotional material at their events as well as to members of their network. (cid:2) An external evaluation is currently underway in the framework of PROGRESS, focusing on key activities such as the Journalist Award, Diversity Days, the website and audiovisual products. The results of this evaluation will be available at the end of 2011. Lessons learnt from the activity (cid:4) Set clear objectives: Establishing clear and well defined objectives for the campaign is key to ensuring that all parties involved understand and work towards the same goal. Objectives need to be achievable, measured against the budget, and clearly defined in their scope. (cid:4) Renew and update your activities: This EU campaign has been running for a considerable length of time. Significant resources were invested in renewing the proposed activities and ensuring they reflected needs and continue to be engaging for target groups. This has partic- ular relevance for long-term recurring events or programmes. Message propositions, tools and engagement activities should contribute to promoting the key themes of the campaign in creative ways and taking into account new tech- nologies (e.g. social media). (cid:4) Aim to build capacity at local or national level: Campaigns bringing together numerous actors operating in different capacities at policy or civil society level represent opportunities for capacity building. FDAD aims to build an \u2018anti- discrimination community\u2019 at national and sub- national level by empowering actors to establish integrated operational structures. (cid:4) Establish suitable campaign duration: Cam- paigns aimed at building capacity amongst vari- ous stakeholders require sufficient time to foster ownership by implementing actors (in this case national level institutions). Independent of geo- graphic scope, this applies to campaigns initiated at central level (in this case EU level) whereby activities are expected to be executed, promoted and more widely disseminated at local level (in this case Member States\u2019 national and sub- national actors). (cid:4) Integrate your campaign within broader ini- tiatives: A further success factor of this cam- paign is that it was not a stand-alone initiative. FDAD was conceived and implemented within the framework of the antidiscrimination EU policy including various other undertakings initiated at EU or national level. This comprised of other par- allel awareness-raising activities or legal meas- ures being introduced. (cid:4) Have the right team in place: A motivated and committed team of implementing actors is nec- essary to achieve wanted outcomes. In this case the campaign has sufficiently mobilised national administrations and civil society organisations to create efficient working structures. (cid:4) Create activities to support national level stakeholders: The focus of the European Commission during the execution of this cam- paign was not to directly reach the general pub- lic, but to create national activities and empower national stakeholders to do so. As a result, most E U R O P E A N G U I D E S t r a t e g i e s f o r i m p r o v i n g p a r t i c i p a t i o n i n a n d a w a r e n e s s o f a d u l t l e a r n i n g 45 (82) http://ec.europa.eu/social/ main.jsp?catId=327 (83) These were conducted in 2006. http://ec.europa.eu/ public_opinion/archives/ eb_special_280_260_en.htm 2008 http://ec.europa.eu/ public_opinion/archives/ eb_special_300_280_en.htm 2009 http://ec.europa.eu/ public_opinion/archives/ eb_special_320_300_en.htm (84) Eurobarometer consists of a series of surveys on public opinions performed on behalf of the European Commission since 1973.

        "of the FDAD activities were implemented at national level, and the responsibility for the organisation and management of some events were transferred to national stakeholders. It was multileveled, using national partners and their networks for the delivery and adaptation in their regions. Implementation was done through steer- ing groups, which ensured tailor made activities in each country. (cid:4) Build evidence-based activities: The cam- paign was built based on research, especially in the development of specific activities, such as collaboration with journalists in countries where there was little press coverage on discrimination and rights. This allowed customising activities depending on the needs of each country. (cid:4) Empower individuals to be direct advocates: The campaign sought to raise EU citizens\u2019 aware- ness of their legal rights to protect themselves against discrimination in all its manifestations. It thus made members of the public knowledgea- ble in terms of their basic rights and different points of access and legal support in the case of discrimination. This means that the campaign empowered actors to be direct advocates for diversity against discrimination. (cid:4) Include the media as a target group: Making wide-reaching and mass-scale disseminators as the media (e.g. print or TV) one of the cam- paign\u2019s target groups will significantly increase the potential of engaging media actors as active promoters. This implies developing specifically targeted activities (e.g. the EU Journalist Award). (cid:4) Establish an Advisory Group: An advisory group should include representatives from each of the stakeholders and target groups involved in the cam- paign programme. It should function as an expert panel primarily involved in providing advice on per- formance and inputs on the design of the strategy. (cid:4) Set-up national working groups: This helps in coordinating EU-wide efforts efficiently and ensures same-level commitment from all national parties to develop and roll out the activities. By the same token, this pushes national actors to mobilise their own networks to spread awareness of events and activities taking place as part of the campaign. (cid:4) Involve pan-EU organisations: These organi- sations are better positioned to reach out to sub- national and sub-regional civil society actors and shape or steer their debate towards com- mon European goals. This helps feeding EU policy and promotional discourse within national level debates, thus increasing the potential of impact of activities at EU level. (cid:4) Build a common identity across geographic borders: This is achieved by developing same campaign themes, messaging and visual tools (e.g. choice of colours, logos). This allows easy recognition of the campaign on the part of the target group in spite of translations and adaption to local contexts. (cid:4) Develop different activities for different target groups: Given that each target group is likely to present different needs, engaging with them successfully will require the development of different activities for each, possibly re-adapt- ing messaging propositions and tools for dissem- ination. FDAD implemented specific actions for youth, journalists in the newer Member States and the media in general, devising each accord- ing to their characteristics and interests.

Learners also enjoy access to a range of additional vocational training, language courses, etc. Format (cid:2) Radio and online classes; (cid:2) Printed and online teaching materials; and (cid:2) Web forum for interaction between learners and educators. Target groups (cid:2) Adults above 18 years old who have not com- pleted their secondary education. Objectives (cid:2) Foster social and human development in the region; (cid:2) Increase the quality of the workforce and empower adults to advance in life; and (cid:2) Address the national and regional challenge of low education attainment levels. Development and Promotion 1. Organisation and delivery: The course is divided in small online learning packages called modules and, at the end of each, attendants receive credits towards gaining the final quali- fication. This gives adults enough flexibility to arrange and manage their own time and ensures that all efforts invested in studying are formally recognised. If due to personal circumstances learners need to interrupt their course, they do not have to re-start from the beginning or pay twice. Before enrolling, students are assessed on the basis of their background, previously acquired experience and educational goals. This allows for the development of individualised learning plans. 2. Partners and funding: The programme is man- aged in cooperation with: (cid:2) The Canary Islands Government; (cid:2) 432 educational information centres; and (cid:2) An educational team of teaching professionals. Teachers develop and organise educational packages in agreement with the government to ensure that the curriculum complies with official requirements. The government subsidises sec- ondary education courses for adults in the region and, depending on its set policy priorities, it may also fund skills (e.g. ICT), vocational training or language courses. 3. Communication and promotion: The pro- gramme is promoted using a wide range of inter- nal and external communication channels.

Its mission is to promote human, cultural and social development of the adult population. It does so in cooperation with government departments and education providers. Radio Ecca makes use of radio and distance-learning tools to deliver courses in Spain and various African partner countries. Its current edu- cational offer comprises of approximately 340 targeted programmes at regional, national and interna- tional level. One of these programmes, Graduado en Educaci\u00f3n Secundaria ( 85 ), is an initiative to increase the number of Spanish adults with a secondary education qualification ( 86 ).

(cid:2) Ads on Radio Ecca ; (cid:2) Local and national radio channels (e.g. \u2018radio municipal\u2019 and \u2018radio insular\u2019); (cid:2) Community campaigns; (cid:2) Ambassadors; (cid:2) Testimonials; (cid:2) Print media; and (cid:2) TV. 4. Community campaigns: Targeted dissemination activities implemented off-campus by teaching staff members. The regional territory is divided in zones and each is assigned to a teacher who acts as an ambassador for the campaign, promoting the course in schools, parents\u2019 associations, com- munity organisations, cultural institutes and local libraries. This ensures that there is sufficient com- munication impact across the whole region. 5. Internal \u2018campaign committee\u2019: Establishes a new campaign theme for promotional activ- ities each year, including a slogan and images. All activities are thus aligned towards the same message. Normally this takes place before September/October, which is when cam- paign efforts are intensified at the start of the course year. Last year\u2019s slogan was \u2018Formaci\u00f3n a su medida\u2019 ( 87 ), which brings together the con- cepts of flexibility, individualised plans, and self-management. 6. Testimonials: These consist of success sto- ries from previous learners, including prominent political, legal and scientific figures at regional level who attended Radio Ecca\u2019s courses. Evaluation (cid:4) Assessment: The course averages about 100 000 students each year across Spain. In 2010, 1 062 adults achieved this secondary edu- cation certificate. It is estimated that since the beginning of its activities, around two million individuals have attended Radio Ecca\u2019s courses. Lessons learnt from the activity (cid:4) Develop a campaign plan: Independently of geo- graphic scope, every campaign initiative should have a clear plan with clearly pre-defined SMART ( 88 ) objectives. Such a plan should be used to build a specific identity for the promoted pro- gramme (e.g. using a slogan or logo) and thus ensure consistency of dissemination activities and easy recognition on the part of the target group. (cid:4) Consider the management and sustainability of education: Adult learners should be con- vinced that whatever investment they put into learning, it should not be seen as a lost effort. Engagement programmes should empower learners to keep control over when and how to manage their education. Offering them the opportunity to learn at their own pace through modular packages and personalised plans will place them in a better position to measure their own progress. Furthermore, providing recognition and accreditation at each step of formal educa- tion undertaken by an adult learner will enable the student to capitalise and build on his previous achievements, should there be a need to inter- rupt the educational course/programme. This would also give learners an incentive to return to education, eliminating the psychological, finan- cial and time burden of having to re-start from zero. Radio Ecca\u2019s course structure is an example of a delivery model designed to take into account the fact that adult learners face challenges quite different from those of average students (e.g. family duties or restrictive working conditions). It is thus important that learners be given the freedom to enter and exit from the system at their own rhythm without missing out on learn- ing/investment efforts previously undertaken. (cid:4) Highlight the variety of adult education: Awareness should be raised on the fact that adult education opportunities are available in different formats and options, depending on life- style and time. It is essential to communicate how this is reflected in terms of both teaching method (e.g. distance learning) and accessibility (e.g. time/setting). (cid:4) Develop a centralised campaign: Independent of geographic location, a campaign should have a clear identity, allowing the target group to recog- nise it immediately. Although promotional activi- ties are the remit of local and decentralised actors, Radio Ecca\u2019s campaign committee ensures visual and messaging consistency by means of common slogans, themes and images for dissemination. (cid:4) Exploit mass media channels to educate: Wide-reaching communication channels such as radio constitute powerful means to reach out E U R O P E A N G U I D E S t r a t e g i e s f o r i m p r o v i n g p a r t i c i p a t i o n i n a n d a w a r e n e s s o f a d u l t l e a r n i n g 48 (87) Training tailored to your needs.

        "to larger portions of the population, across dif- ferent socio-economic and demographic back- grounds. These tools can be directly used to educate the public (e.g. through classes as in the case of Radio Ecca , or documentaries and simi- lar) beyond mere promotion. (cid:4) Use intermediaries: Local level communica- tion campaigns should leverage the potential influence played by teachers in promoting learn- ing opportunities. Community campaigns imple- mented by Radio Ecca constitute a valid example of how to use teachers beyond their role as edu- cators. Empowering them to directly reach out to learners and act as ambassadors in community organisations, libraries and cultural centres gives credibility to learning programmes and offers a first-hand opportunity for them to understand how the educational offer should be tailored to the real needs of learners. (cid:4) Value the positioning of community part- ners: Radio Ecca relies on numerous education information centres and community organisa- tions (including cultural associations and librar- ies) to promote and execute its activities. Community partners can thus be used not only for promotion but also delivery of programmes partially or in a supporting function. (cid:4) Customise the educational offer for dif- ferent geographic areas: Radio Ecca delivers different types of adult learning programmes at regional, national and international level. Offerings reflect different geographic needs and objectives, funding availability and target group interests (e.g. courses to promote secondary education are only accessible and funded for the local population). Initiatives of similar geographic scope can consider a comparable approach, delivering services according to different levels and type of demand. (cid:4) Allow face-to-face interaction: It is impor- tant that even when flexible and distance learning options are made available, a component of face- to-face interaction between education provid- ers and adult learners is included. This will give learners the feeling that learning is personalised, and provide them with the opportunity to access guidance when needed. (cid:4) Engage teachers in developing curricula: As a result of closer interaction and experience of adult learner needs, teachers are best positioned to develop educational programmes and related modules, including delivery methodologies. (cid:4) Personalise education: Education courses, par- ticularly those aimed at gaining a formal qualifi- cations should be personalised to learners\u2019 needs. By assessing and recognising students\u2019 previous knowledge and qualifications, education provid- ers will improve learning outcomes and learners\u2019 satisfaction. (cid:4) Collect testimonials appealing to the target group: Using highly regarded and well-known people within the local community helps estab- lishing relevant role-models that could poten- tially inspire adult learners.

        "Overview of activity Objectives (cid:2) Offer teaching staff and learners comprehensive information about media literacy; (cid:2) Place qualified staff in schools and adult learn- ing institutions offering free courses ( 92 ) on media literacy; (cid:2) Counteract the existing fear of adults to embrace new technologies; (cid:2) Promote better understanding of the benefits of being media literate; and (cid:2) Integrate the issue of media literacy into adult education in Lower Saxony. Format Adult education institutions can access the following training and networking tools: (cid:2) Qualification courses for adult educators and staff; (cid:2) Catalogues of media education information and counselling services that can be used on site for free; (cid:2) Advice on individual issues ( 93 ) and with regards to the implementation of media education meas- ures; and (cid:2) Traditional communications tools and materials such as flyers and information packs. Target Groups (cid:2) Institutions of adult and continuing education, community colleges; (cid:2) Adult Educators and relevant practitioners who could benefit from the initiative; and (cid:2) Secondary target: citizens (including parents) who would then benefit from a media literacy course. How was the activity developed? The main institutions involved in development and promotion were as follows: (cid:2) Blickwechsel e.V. ( 94 ) \u2013 Media education provider (NGO). (cid:2) B\u0171rgerrundfunk in Niedersachsen ( 95 ) \u2013 State Association for Citizen Radio.

Media literacy education provides tools to help people critically analyse messages, offers opportunities for learners to broaden their experience of media, and helps them develop creative skills in making their own media messages. Media literacy education is sometimes conceptualised as a way to address the negative dimensions of mass media, popular culture and digital media, including media violence, gender and racial stereotypes, the sexualisation of children, and concerns about loss of privacy, cyber bullying and Internet predators. (92) The minimum group size for this on site teaching courses is set at 10. (93) Individual issues differ from institution to institution and can range from giving advice on promoting the qualification courses, engaging with target audience, choosing relevant course themes and material etc. (94) http://www.blickwechsel.org/ (95) http://www.lbm- niedersachsen.de/ (96) http://www.jugendschutz- niedersachsen.de/ (97) http://www.multimediamobile.de/ (98) http://www.smiley-ev.de Kampagne M (Campaign M) AEWB and NLM, Germany 7 Kampagne M was developed in 2007 by the Agentur f\u00fcr Erwachsenen- und Weiterbildung ( 89 ) (Agency for Adult and Continuing Education of Lower Saxony \u2013 AEWB) and the Nieders\u00e4chsische Landesmedienanstalt ( 90 ) (Media Authority of Lower Saxony\u2013 NLM). The programme aims to educate trainers and adult education professionals working in adult and lifelong learning institutions, on the subject of media literacy ( 91 ). Many adult educators and course instructors involved in adult education and lifelong learning pro- grammes still struggle to view media literacy as a useful pedagogical topic. Additionally, since media lit- eracy is considered a cross-cutting theme, most institutions do not know how they exactly should teach the subject. Kampagne M therefore aims to provide training opportunities for suitable staff in media lit- eracy based on ready made projects which can be adopted by the lifelong learning institutions. Training courses help instructors to teach media literacy not only their students but also other teachers.

        "The main steps in the programme development involved: 1. Develop training courses: Due to the apparent lack of qualified staff in the area of media liter- acy, the first step was to develop training courses on a variety of subjects. For the staff of adult and lifelong learning institutions, the development was financed by the state of Lower Saxony and developed by AEWB and NLM. Courses were first presented to experts in the field, before being promoted to adult learning institutions. 2. Provide training: Adult education institutions were asked to provide competent staff (multiplit- ers) able to provide training in other institutions. Trainers and practitioners were then trained, both to be able to educate students, as well as other teachers. A total of 40 persons were trained in media literacy. 3. Evaluation meeting: An evaluation meet- ing was carried out after the completion of the first cycle of course delivery. Though the general feedback from participants was positive, some issues were raised: (cid:2) Implementing the courses proved challenging due to technical issues including lack of Internet access, PCs and other equipment; lack of availa- ble and competent staff able to teach media lit- eracy; and lack of interested course participants. (cid:2) Subjects in the area of youth protection were no longer popular. (cid:2) Participating institutions preferred to have ready made projects \u2013 these institutions did not want theoretical solutions; rather, they asked for practical tips and ready made course books. (cid:2) The lack of knowledge exchange amongst institutions was criticised. (cid:2) The fact that the training was for free was also criticised. It was thought that this would not evoke the desired discipline in teachers and staff to participate in and follow through with the training. 4. Implementation of changes: A consultation was carried out amongst the participating institu- tions and partners to determine relevant subjects. A course fee was also introduced to encourage regular attendance and general demand for avail- able places. The lack of ready-made courses and activities to be offered to adult education institu- tions was also addressed, and practical courses teaching the participants every step of an activity were developed and made available. Additionally, adult education institutions have the option of using mobile media literacy experts, who support the implementation of individual activities locally through their expertise and knowledge. These experts are provided by \u2018Multimediamobile\u2019 ( 99 ) of the NLM, partners of Kampagne M. In addi- tion, the exchange of information and best prac- tice amongst the institutions in Lower Saxony is addressed in the form of a catalogue, which is also aimed at increasing networking possibilities. 5. Development of a PR strategy: To confront the problem that nobody was subscribing to the offered courses and activities, a series of communications tools were developed. These included: (cid:2) A new logo; (cid:2) Internal mailings to relevant institutions to pro- vide information and create a strong network; (cid:2) Flyers with information on the campaign to be distributed at trade fairs and networking events; (cid:2) Partner\u2019s websites, providing information about the campaign; and (cid:2) Info packs for potential members of the network. In addition, promotion via social platforms is envis- aged for new topics relating to teaching media lit- eracy to young people at lifelong learning centres. 6. Funding: The campaign receives funding from the Lower Saxon State Department for Education ( 100 ) and is a joint project between the AEWB and NLM. Results of the activity (cid:2) Some 40 teachers have participated and made use of the training programme to become experts in media literacy and are thus able to teach the topic to staff at other institutions. The initial tar- get was 20. (cid:2) The start-up training programme has been increased to three different courses. (cid:2) A stable network of adult and life-long learning institutions has been established in the region to exchange best practice and teach additional staff. (cid:2) Over 30 institutions have fully committed them- selves to Kampagne M. (cid:2) Better access from Kampagne M to the individual institutions has been achieved, and strong con- tacts have been developed to facilitate further awareness raising. (cid:2) Kampagne M has established itself as a brand and the main contact point at regional and national level in relation to media literacy.

        "(cid:2) The innovative approach of bringing together the Agency for Adult Education and the state media authority has allowed the subject of media liter- acy to be debated for the first time in Germany. Additionally, this level of cooperation amongst an adult learning agency (AEWB) and a regional media authority (NML) did not exist before. Lessons learnt from the activity (cid:4) Tailor content to meet demand: NLM specifi- cally tailors the course content to match demand and needs of teachers and professionals. The key was to make courses adaptable, depend- ing on what each adult education institution wanted to offer its participants. Consequently, training courses were customised so that teach- ers at each faculty could learn exactly what their organisation wanted to offer. The provision of different courses to match different needs there- fore ensured higher uptake of courses. (cid:4) Evaluate activities annually: Each year, the NLM holds an annual evaluation conference to review the progress and results of the preceding year\u2019s activities. As part of the conference, it col- lects best practice examples as well as individ- ual project evaluations. Based on the evaluation, it develops new content for future years. This means that the new content is evidence based. (cid:4) Connect content with concrete activities: NLM places emphasis on providing tangible pro- jects, by connecting content to concrete activities that teachers can \u2018take home and implement\u2019. This practicality ensures that the tools would be easier to use, thereby making stakeholders more likely to use them. (cid:4) Identify means to pre-test your activity: The example of Kampagne M shows that pre-testing can significantly help in identifying potential bar- riers to access or participation rates of a specific activity. By involving field experts, courses can be reviewed and refined before going to wider pro- motion for adult learning institutions. This is a cost-effective tool to pre-assess the potential impact. (cid:4) Give an incentive to participate: Participation always requires time, money, and other resources on the part of the target group. It is important to provide participants with an incentive to take part and using means relevant to their needs. Kampagne M was successful in curbing drop-out rates from courses introducing a reduced training fee. (cid:4) Identify relevant subjects: Kampagne M teaches the subject of media literacy, including youth pro- tection. These subjects are pertinent to teachers and to target groups in contact with young people, which include parents who want to teach their chil- dren how to be safe while using media. By identi- fying subjects that are relevant to target groups, there is an ensured uptake of courses. (cid:4) Pilot programmes: In addition to basing activ- ities on needs of target groups, it is important to test the progress of the campaign and adapt it according to feedback. Consultations with rel- evant stakeholders ensure that divergences in expectations are minimised, and the programme meets the requirement of target groups. (cid:4) Set up mobile networks of experts: Kampagne M enabled a group of experts to support the imple- mentation of activities locally. By providing this network of experts, Kampagne M ensures that activities are implemented thoroughly in each region of Lower Saxony, and that any best practices learnt in one area can be applied to other areas.

        "Overview of activity Objectives The aims of the Kha Ri Gude Mass Literacy Campaign are to: (cid:2) enable 4.7 million illiterate and functionally illit- erate adults to become literate and numerate in one of the 11 official languages of South Africa by 2012; (cid:2) reduce the national rate of illiteracy by 50 % by 2015, thereby fulfilling its UNESCO Dakar 2000 commitment ( 105 ); and (cid:2) alleviate poverty by providing Kha Ri Gude vol- unteers in the poorest communities with a small income. The campaign enables adult learners to read, write and calculate in their mother tongue in line with the Unit Standards for ABET level one, and also to become familiar with spoken English. Format (cid:2) Free education classes held in communities, at convenient times for the learners; these take place in homes, churches, community centres, prisons, etc. Learners are required to commit to attending classes for 240 hours over six months. Once learners are competent in their mother tongue to read and write, they are given English lessons for two hours a week. (cid:2) Free workbooks in the 11 languages of South Africa that help educators teach reading, writ- ing, numeracy, and practical English, integrating themes and life skills such as health, gender, the environment and civic education. The workbooks have also been adapted for use in Braille ( 106 ) in the 11 languages. Target group (cid:2) 4.7 million functionally illiterate ( 107 ) adults who have had little or no schooling. How was the activity developed? (cid:2) The main actors involved in development of the Kha Ri Gude Mass Literacy Campaign were: (cid:2) Government Department of Basic Education; (cid:2) Writers of workbooks; and (cid:2) Provincial coordinators, who oversee the activi- ties at provincial level. The main steps in the development and promotion of the activity were as follows: 1. Conception: In 2000, the Department of Education launched the South African National Literacy Initiative ( 108 ) (SANLI), which oversaw the establish- ment of a voluntary service to reach the estimated 3.3 million illiterate adults at the time. In 2006, a ministerial committee was established to assess literacy in the country, which found that 9.6 million adults (24 % of which were adults aged 50+), were functionally illiterate. Thus, the Kha Ri Gude Mass Literacy Campaign was formed in 2008. 2.

Its aim is to enable 4.7 million adults above the age of 15 to become literate and numerate in one of the 11 official lan- guages ( 102 ) of South Africa. The campaign was initiated and managed by the Department of Education ( 103 ). It enables adult learners to read, write and calculate in their mother tongue in line with the Unit Standards for ABET level one ( 104 ), and also to become proficient in spoken English.

        "languages were identified and asked to develop the workbooks. These writers were experi- enced teachers and facilitators who worked in the field and knew the needs of learners. They were identified by subject matter experts, and because of the work they did in the community. A public tender was issued for the printing of the workbooks. 3. Designation of Provincial Coordinators, Super- visors and Educators: Twenty provincial coordi- nators per province were identified through the Director of the Kha Ri Gude Programme, and comprised mainly of teachers from the adult basic education and training faculty at the Uni- versity of South Africa ( 109 ). Their primary role is to ensure that the programme is implemented in each province. This includes marketing the pro- gramme in each province, and recruiting and training supervisors and educators. They also visit classrooms once every month, and monitor and evaluate the teaching process. The coordi- nators then identified provincial supervisors, who generally worked in the Department of Education on ad hoc basis. The supervisors recruited edu- cators, who were trained to spend 10 hours per week on the programme. 4. Recruitment of learners and creation of portfolio of assessment: Learners are recruited through public announcements in churches and schools, advertisements in local newspapers, and NGOs and community-based organisa- tions. Learners have to complete the workbook, which is their \u2018portfolio of assessment\u2019 ( 110 ); this is used to assess their competence, and deter- mine whether they can move on to another level of education. If their portfolio of evidence is com- pleted, they get a certificate of accreditation for ABET level one. Some provinces have implemented innovative ways of using the programme. In the Western Cape Province, supervisors train prison inmates to teach other inmates. The programme is scheduled to continue until at least 2015. Funding The Department of Basic Education allocated ZAR 6 billion ( 111 ) to the programme. In the last year, the programme has been supported by the Department of Public Works ( 112 ), as it is connected to job creation. Evaluation of the activity The activity is evaluated in various ways: (cid:4) Participation: By the end of 2010, 1.2 million learners had participated in the programme. In addition, each year, there is an increase in the number of participants. (cid:4) External audit of portfolio of assessment: All of the portfolios are collected and returned to the campaign head office where the site-based marking is verified. In 2008, Kha Ri Gude had an 80 % return rate of portfolios. South Africa Quality Assurance ( 113 ) verified the marking of the portfolios, and the results were uploaded on National Learners\u2019 Records Database ( 114 ). Lessons learnt from the activity (cid:4) Develop an evidence-based strategy: The Kha Ri Gude programme was based on the findings of a ministerial committee established to assess literacy in the country. Since the programme was based on research, it was possible to set SMART ( 115 ) objectives for the campaign, as well as take benchmark measurements along its course. (cid:4) Customise materials for each region: South Africa has nine provinces and 11 languages, with each province home to very diverse ethnic groups. As a result, it has been necessary to cus- tomise Kha Ri Gude materials to local needs. This was done through the assignation of a regional coordinator, as well as finding native speakers in each province to develop materials, versus trans- lating from English. This ensures that materials are suited to local culture and learners\u2019 needs. (cid:4) Make activities relatable: The Kha Ri Gude campaign\u2019s materials were built around themes and life skills such as health, gender, the environ- ment and civic education. The relevance of the materials encouraged learners to stick with the programme, and attracted new learners. (cid:4) Allow sufficient time to create impact: The Kha Ri Gude programme is a seven year-long programme, and is scheduled to run until 2015. By making the programme long term, it is possi- ble to support learners through their education advancement, chart their progress, and ensure that the programme can be customised to sup- port their learning path.

        "(cid:4) Require commitment to the programme: The Kha Ri Gude campaign requires learners to com- mit to attending classes for 240 hours over six months, as well as complete their portfolio of assessment. This significant time commitment ensures that campaign efforts bring about the expected learning outcomes, preparing the adult population to have solid basic literacy skills in their mother tongue and English. (cid:4) Encourage peer-to-peer learning: The use of innovative techniques such as training prisoners to teach other prisoners had a two-fold benefit: (i) it allowed existing prisoners to gain a \u2018second chance\u2019 and to improve their record, and (ii) it provided learners with motivation to complete the course and continue their learning path while incarcerated. (cid:4) First solidify the basics: It was important that learners were comfortable in basic English; how- ever, this could only be achieved once learners were able to read, write, and do basic mathemat- ics in their own native tongues. They had to dem- onstrate a thorough grasp of their local language before English was introduced into the curriculum. (cid:4) Favour wider societal benefits: The Kha Ri Gude campaign\u2019s activities provide support in the form of monetary compensation to volunteers. By doing this, it helps in the alleviation of poverty in the poor- est communities. By creating activities that help the community beyond the provision of adult learning, it allows for increased social cohesion, something that adult learning is designed to achieve.

They mostly work in the field of non-formal adult education. More information is available at http://www.studieframjandet.se/ (120) Folk High Schools operate in the field of voluntary and general adult education. The main goal is to offer general education to both young and adults and their courses cover a wide spectrum of subjects. In some cases, they also provide vocational education, http://www.folkhogskola.nu/ (121) This platform functions as a meeting place, information site, conference hall and study centre for study associations, folk high schools and adult learners. More information is available at http://www.folkbildning.net/ (122) Liberal and non-formal adult education is based on the idea that learning should provide a comprehensive and broad pedagogical approach as well as stimulate curiosity and critical thinking without necessarily implying attendance of formal education courses, such as for the pursuit of a degree. L\u00e5tarna som f\u00f6r\u00e4ndrade musiken (Songs that changed music) Swedish Educational Broadcasting Company , Sweden 9 The Swedish Educational Broadcasting Company (UR ( 116 )) is part of the Swedish national public TV and radio service. It produces education programmes targeting adult learners, in consultation with the Swedish Council for Adult Education (Folkbildningsr\u00e5det ( 117 )), which operates under mandate of the Swedish Government and the Riskdag ( 118 ) (Swedish Parliament). UR\u2019s TV and radio programmes are accessible to the general public during its broadcasting time. Moreover, adult learners enrolled in an educational programme provided by one of the 10 Study Associations (Studiefr\u00e4mjandet ( 119 )) or one of the 150 Folk High Schools (Folkh\u00f6gskolorna ( 120 )) enjoy unlimited access to the programmes on the Folkbildningsn\u00e4tet\u2019s ( 121 ) web network, an e-Platform containing fur- ther learning tools and pedagogical resources for Swedish liberal adult education. One of the latest programmes is L\u00e5tarna som f\u00f6r\u00e4ndrade musiken.

        "Development and Promotion 1. Needs assessment: UR produced the programme with input from one of the 10 Study Associations, which mostly contributed in terms of content development. Music constitutes an important aspect of this Study Association\u2019s activities, which it uses to attract and engage adult learners. By cooperating with UR , the Study Association iden- tified the possibility to create an inspirational pro- gramme aimed at pushing adults to develop their talent and interests. The programme also sought to meet the Study Association\u2019s education goals, reflecting its pedagogical approach. 2. Selection of songs: TV producers and educa- tion professionals from the Study Association jointly selected popular pop/rock tracks, meant to be inspiring for learners. Artists and studio pro- ducers are then invited to provide insight on their songs, share their experiences and offer lessons learnt to aspiring musicians. 3. Promotion: The programme is promoted using: (cid:2) Press releases; (cid:2) TV trailers; (cid:2) Events organised with Study Associations; (cid:2) Fair exhibitions organised by companies producing educational material; (cid:2) Websites: UR , Studiefr\u00e4mjandet and Folkbildningsr\u00e5det; and (cid:2) Social media to attract younger adults. Additional print material is produced by the Study Association and widely distributed to both learners and educators, including those enrolled or working in other Study Associations. Evaluation The evaluation of the programme is done in the fol- lowing ways: (cid:4) Quantitative assessment: Based on the number of web clicks and/or downloads per programme and of additional features/resources/tools made available on the Folkbildningsn\u00e4tet network. (cid:4) Qualitative assessment: Based on face-to-face dialogue with adult learners in Folk High Schools through visits to the schools and Studiefr\u00e4mjandet campuses, interviews with teachers, attendance of seminars, workshops and lectures. Plans are underway to develop an online platform where users of the programmes can share ideas and opinions as well as provide feedback. (cid:4) Feedback: Teachers are encouraged to use the channel and its TV shows in several innovative ways, integrate them into their educational pro- grammes, and communicate with learners. Lessons learnt from the activity (cid:4) Ensure stakeholder consultation and engage- ment: As a result of its close cooperation with the Swedish National Council of Adult Education, UR maintains constant dialogue and communication with teachers, digital education experts and adult learners from the Folk High Schools and Study Associations across Sweden. This demonstrates that project ideas reflecting the needs of both learners and educators highly impact on three main levels: i) Approach to research: UR \u2019s project devel- opers and media education specialists pro- actively attend seminars and workshops on non-formal adult education, follow the debate in the media, and use key available research or reports on the status quo of adult educa- tion in order to develop their programmes. Learners\u2019 needs are thus never taken for granted and programmes reflect an effort to mirror and address the challenges of the adult learning sector at national level. ii) Development and planning: Besides having the opportunity to propose projects to UR , educators are also involved in the devel- opment of programmes, thereby ensuring that the final product serves as a useful pedagogi- cal tool for their teaching goals. iii) Dissemination and promotion: TV and radio programmes are promoted through joint and coordinated communication activi- ties implemented by UR , the Swedish National Council of Adult Education, Folk High Schools, and the Study Associations. These organisa- tions act as multipliers, thereby maximising impact and allowing campaign messages to resonate more widely. (cid:4) Include interactive interim evaluation: Pro- gramme developers and media education spe- cialists from UR interact with learners through face-to-face meetings and peer sessions with teachers on a regular basis. This open dialogue helps understand how the programme is being used by both learners and educators and how E U R O P E A N G U I D E S t r a t e g i e s f o r i m p r o v i n g p a r t i c i p a t i o n i n a n d a w a r e n e s s o f a d u l t l e a r n i n g 57 NC3112514ENC_002.pdf 55 25/07/12 16:14 ",
        "it could be best reviewed or further enriched with pedagogical tools on the e-Platform. The approach to evaluation is thus not entirely detached from the execution of the project, which allows constant monitoring of the programme\u2019s performance from a qualitative perspective. This, in turn, helps developers provide teachers with ideas on how to use and integrate the pro- gramme tools into their classes. (cid:4) Push to action using mass communication channels: The UR programme demonstrates how mass media channels could be used to pro- vide \u2018samplers\u2019. This would entice the target group to investigate an activity or a programme further, and sign-up for the \u2018bigger\u2019 offer (in this case, an educational programme at one of the study associations). (cid:4) Integrate the activity within broader educa- tional curricula: This activity features producers and media education experts engaging teachers in study associations, to help them integrate the programme\u2019s educational tools within their teach- ing curricula. In this way, producers can better understand how executing actors, such as educa- tion professionals, use the programme. They can consequently encourage the executing actors to consider alternative approaches or exchange prac- tices with peer colleagues. (cid:4) Tie adult learning to accessible activities: Music represents an accessible activity that consti- tutes a big part of many people\u2019s lives. Exploiting its potential to engage the public in adult learning activities makes it enjoyable and non-formal for the hardest-to-reach target groups. Adult learning can thus be promoted using everyday life concepts or activities which are normally not perceived as connected to education; examples could be danc- ing, cooking, gardening, etc. (cid:4) Promote soft-skills: This initiative teaches music skills, and uses it to promote teamwork, brainstorming, listening, and sharing of experi- ences. Both formal and non-formal adult edu- cation programmes should emphasise hard and soft skills that can be acquired through learning.

        "Overview of activity Lire et Ecrire Communaut\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise is focused on training adults with low or no literacy levels in French (both Belgians and migrants/immigrants), and training other trainers for such instruction. Some studies indicate as much of 10 % of the adult population cannot read or write to a sufficient level, that of primary school. Every year, Lire et Ecrire Communaut\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise welcomes between 5 000 and 6 000 learners (whom the organisation refers to as \u2018stagiaires\u2019or \u2018learners\u2019) to its programme, but has to exclude some 3 000 others due to lack of space. The problem is particularly acute in Brussels ( 128 ). Lire et Ecrire Communaut\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise is one of the largest of the more than 100 civil society organisa- tions involved in adult literacy, active in the French speaking part of Belgium. Lire et Ecrire Communaut\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise is not just focused on literacy as means towards employment, but sees it as a right of all cit- izens, even those who due to circumstances, can- not join the labour force. The organisation is also involved in research in the area of adult literacy. Included in the Lire et Ecrire Communaut\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise programme was an Internet portal called Alpha ( 129 ) to help in the exchange of best practice and other information, which pursued the goal of making adults literate. The portal provides addresses in Brussels and Wallonia where such training takes place, as well as dates for upcoming events, train- ings publications and other practical information pertinent to this sector. Every year since 2006, Lire et Ecrire gets involved in a campaign to raise awareness among the mass audience and public authorities on the value of those with low or no literacy skills. The objective is to pro- mote a more positive image for such individuals. The organisation\u2019s mandate is to provide quality, tai- lor-made, close-to-home literacy training across the French-speaking community in Belgium. Its specific objectives are to: (cid:2) draw public and government attention to the problem of adult illiteracy, analyse the causes and find solutions; (cid:2) expand the availability of training slots for adults with little or no literacy skills and provide them support in their individual projects; and (cid:2) seek ways and create structures that are most likely to help develop quality literacy in the French-speaking Community of Belgium. Format Lire et Ecrire\u2019s asked its \u2018stagiaires\u2019 what they thought would be useful and to brainstorm a campaign theme. Many of them volunteered to provide their personal story to illustrate how the training programme had helped them validate their role in society.

It is funded by the Minist\u00e8re de la Communaut\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise ( 123 ), the European Integration Fund ( 124 ), the European Social Fund ( 125 ) and the Grundtvig programme. It is legally recognised as a \u2018mouvement d'\u00e9ducation permanente\u2019 ( 126 ), which means its mandate is to provide popular education on an ongoing basis. It focuses almost exclusively on teaching reading, writing and numeracy skills in French to those individuals who are harder to reach \u2013 those who are \u2018farthest away\u2019 from the workforce, be they Belgian citizens or immigrants. Every year, it organises a campaign to coincide with La Journ\u00e9e internationale de l\u2019alphab\u00e9tisation (International Literacy Day ( 127 ) on 8 September), focused on highlighting to the public the value of peo- ple with difficulty reading and writing.

        "Lire et Ecrire Communaut\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise decided to pro- duce two simple tools: (cid:2) 90 000 placemats with the photo and story of those with literacy issues. The placemats were used primarily in the canteens of companies and government departments. (cid:2) 30 000 sets of six small booklets with personal stories from these same people. These sets were distributed across the target groups, but espe- cially with the FNAC ( 130 ) (a large music and book chain) and other large bookshops. Lire et Ecrire Communaut\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise then put together a very comprehensive list of intermediary bodies (please see section on Target group, below). The campaign is kicked off with a press conference and then a media tour \u2013 visiting the major French- speaking television and radio stations to publicise the campaign. The campaign also includes political outreach (lobbying) by publicising issues affecting adult literacy with government officials and bureau- crats. Backed up by research, it publicises its concerns directly with officials and via the media. Furthermore, Lire et Ecrire Communaut\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise seeks a place at the table of interministerial groupings dealing with adult learning to ensure its issues remain a prior- ity. Finally, Lire et Ecrire Communaut\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise has an \u2018ambassadors programme\u2019 which brings together some 150 stagiaires who volunteer to visit schools to reinforce the notion that education which is a key issue for social, professional, cultural inclusion. Target groups Lire et Ecrire Communaut\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise targets the French speaking community in Wallonia and the bilingual Region of Brussels-Capital ( 131 ). The cam- paign sought to target a mass audience. Lire et Ecrire Communaut\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise compiled a list of pos- sible organisations which could be viewed as natu- ral allies and which could act as multipliers to their membership or employees. The list comprised oper- ators from the economic, political, social and cultural areas, including: (cid:2) European Parliament; (cid:2) Forem (public employment service in Wallonia); (cid:2) RTBF (state French-speaking broadcaster); (cid:2) Roularta (major Belgian publisher); (cid:2) ONE \u2013 Office National de l\u2019enfance (child protection government authority); (cid:2) Large companies with many workers (e.g. Caterpillar, etc.); (cid:2) Organisations with a cultural remit (e.g. FNAC); (cid:2) Public hospitals; and (cid:2) CPAS (local welfare offices). Key messages Messaging is developed (and tested) in close collab- oration with its stagiaires. For the campaign in 2011, the message was \u2018Nous avons autant de talent que vous\u2019 (We have as much talent as you). As part of its mandate, Lire et Ecrire is responsi- ble for sensitising the public-at-large to the issues facing adults with low literacy, namely that they deserve our respect and understanding, and how they can be integrated into society. The campaign seeks to address the taboos related to illiteracy, and highlights that those with difficulties in read- ing or writing still have competences. Lire et Ecrire Communaut\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise is particularly focused on getting rid of the stigma associated with low or no reading/writing skills. How was the activity developed? The campaign was largely developed in-house due to scarce resources. The main actors were Lire et Ecrire Communaut\u00e9\u2019s communications department and volunteers from among the stagiaires. Lire et Ecrire Communaut\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise also expended con- siderable effort getting outside suppliers to provide services/products as a \u2018prudent administrator\u2019. The main steps in the development of the activity were: 1. Consultations with stagiaires on campaign themes, messaging, tools to be produced; 2. Stakeholder targeting; 3. development of editorial content, including press releases; 4. Development of campaign tools (placemats, brochures); 5. Distribution of campaign tools; 6. Press conference and direct outreach to govern- ment; and 7. Monitoring and evaluation. Promotion The tools developed for this campaign were pro- moted to the key target audiences, who were then provided with the printed collateral material. Press outreach was equally significant. Results of the activity The campaign can be deemed to have been a huge success \u2013 in terms of publicity value. Highlights include the following: E U R O P E A N G U I D E S t r a t e g i e s f o r i m p r o v i n g p a r t i c i p a t i o n i n a n d a w a r e n e s s o f a d u l t l e a r n i n g 60 (130) http://www.fnac.be/ (131) http://www.brussels.irisnet.be/ NC3112514ENC_002.pdf 58 25/07/12 16:14 ",
        "(cid:4) Close to 3 500 hits on the Lire et Ecrire Commu- naut\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise website (in a three-week period of time); (cid:4) Wide distribution of the placemats and booklets across Belgium, at locations such as NGOs, uni- versities, schools, restaurants, community organ- isations, etc.; and (cid:4) Testimonials from major public and private compa- nies including Forem ( 132 ), the RTBF ( 133 ), Sodexo ( 134 ), Caterpillar Belgium ( 135 ) and Ethias ( 136 ). Lessons learnt from the activity (cid:4) Run cost effective campaigns: As seen in the case of Lire et Ecrire, large scale impactful cam- paigns can be run cost effectively on a \u2018shoe- string\u2019. This campaign cost around EUR 6 000, which was used primarily for the development of the two tools, and still had wide impact. This impact was achieved through its targeted approach to finding stakeholders, and linking its campaign to larger initiatives such as the International Day of Literacy. (cid:4) Involve learners: The participants and learners in the Lire et Ecrire Communaut\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise pro- gramme were involved in the project from the planning phase of the campaign to the execution. This meant that the campaign was tailor-made to suit their needs, and they were happily impli- cated in the project. (cid:4) Research target groups: Lire et Ecrire Com- munaut\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise put significant effort into researching their list of target groups and organi- sations. These organisations were viewed as Lire et Ecrire\u2019s allies, who would act as multipliers within their organisations, and could distribute the infor- mation to their employees, clients, customers, etc. (cid:4) Develop simple but compelling messages: The primary messages that Lire et Ecrire Communaut\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise develop pertain to removing the stigma associated with illiteracy and those who cannot read or write. This message was successful as it was primarily a simple message that could reso- nate widely, that could be understood by all target groups, and that appealed to peoples\u2019 emotions.

        "Overview of the activity NOSTE was implemented by the Finnish Ministry of Education and Culture from 2003 to 2009. The programme consisted of 59 regional and provincial projects ( 137 ), organised in the form of networks of various providers of adult education and their part- ners ( 138 ). It also included a national outreach project coordinated by the Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions ( 139 ) (SAK). Objectives (cid:2) Encourage 10 % ( 140 ) of working adults aged 30-59 to obtain one or more of the following: vocational upper secondary qualifications; specialist voca- tional qualifications; computer driving licences ( 141 ); and/or comprehensive or upper secondary school education (if not already completed). (cid:2) Increase the number of study places available in vocational education and IT training programmes. (cid:2) Improve career development prospects for adults with basic education and low employment rates. (cid:2) Tackle labour shortage issues resulting from the retirement of the post-war generation. (cid:2) Strengthen cooperation and partnership between educational institutions, social partners and learners. (cid:2) Develop the adult education sector at national level. Format Dissemination and outreach activities consisted of seminars, workshops, peer study counselling and face-to-face meetings in workplaces between adult educators ( 142 ) and employees/employers. Target group (cid:2) Adults aged between 30 and 59 in the labour market, without secondary school education. Development and Promotion 1. Needs assessment: Prior to the launch of NOSTE, several national education policy initiatives ( 143 ) pointed to the challenges posed by the low num- ber of adults with basic education in Finland. Studies showed that the situation of the least educated social groups was deteriorating on the labour market. People with higher educational background were more likely to engage in voca- tional training, whereas less-privileged groups needed incentives to do so. Independent research ( 144 ) also showed that indi- viduals with a lower educational background have ambivalent attitudes towards learning: although learning per se might be perceived as positive, the formal schooling environment is associated with negative experiences. NOSTE was thus developed and proposed to the government by the Finnish Parliamentary Adult Education and Training Committee ( 145 ). The goal was to change these ambivalent atti- tudes towards education by linking the concept of learning to an environment closer to the tar- get group\u2019s identity, i.e. the workplace. 2. Partners and funding: NOSTE included a high number of cooperating partners, ranging from adult education organisations to education provid- ers (including training centres), national, regional and local policy makers, trade unions, business and employers\u2019 associations, and public employ- ment offices. The total budget allocated by the government was EUR 124.5 millions, 10 % of which was spent in outreach activities and face- to-face meetings with employees and employers.

(138) Such networks included organisations such as vocational adult education centres, folk high schools, upper secondary schools, apprenticeship training centres, business associations and job centres. (139) This is the oldest employee confederation in Finland with over one million members in 21 affiliated trade unions. It is also the largest lobbying organisation in Finland.

        "3. Promotion and tools: NOSTE was centrally pro- moted through a national communication strat- egy which helped establish a common visual identity for the programme, using one logo and a defined set of colours per target group. Slogans, brochures and posters were regularly distributed and a \u2018Nostetta\u2019 magazine was produced to disseminate information on best practices. The NOSTE website ( 146 ) was used to promote visibil- ity among all target groups, and the media on the website was updated annually. Further pro- motional tools comprised of: (cid:2) Adverts / articles in regional and provincial newspapers; (cid:2) Accounts written by students; (cid:2) TV and radio; (cid:2) 2006 Noste road show ( 147 ); (cid:2) The Pulpettikammo ( \u2018goodbye school phobia\u2019) campaign ( 148 ); and (cid:2) Exhibitions, seminars, and fairs. A series of tools was also produced to train and assist outreach workers in their face-to-face meet- ings, such as guidebooks describing examples of best practice, follow-up research, and recommenda- tions prepared by the Ministry of Education and the programme steering group. Results of the activity (cid:4) Annual evaluation: Annual follow-up studies were carried out during the entire implementation period between 2003 and 2009. These studies were con- ducted independently by the University of Eastern Finland ( 149 ) and the University of Tampere ( 150 ) at national level, and education partners and regional authorities at local level. Statistics Finland ( 151 ) col- lected data at national level. (cid:4) Final evaluation: The overall evaluation of NOSTE showed that the total number of participants in the programme by 2009 was 25 680, about 73 % of the initial target group. Additionally, a total of 19 540 qualifications and partial qualifications, including computer driving licences, were completed. (cid:4) Long-term impact: One of the key implica- tions of the programme is that education pro- viders, employers and trade unions were pushed to create new operating and outreach structures for adult learning. The project made improving access to vocational adult learning programmes a nation-wide challenge for all stakeholders involved, thus raising overall levels of awareness regarding adult education needs. Teachers became more aware of the need to personal- ise education programmes, and partnerships between workplaces, state agencies and course providers were significantly strengthened beyond the scope of the programme. (cid:4) Secondary target group: It was found that adults between 25 and 30 years old and unem- ployed adults who did not complete their compre- hensive school education also became engaged with the programme. Lessons learnt from the activity (cid:4) Encourage stakeholder engagement: The NOSTE programme had two key overarching goals; first, to increase participation in voca- tional adult learning and, secondly, to develop the adult education sector at national level. In order to achieve this in the short and long term, the strategy aimed at building established net- works and communication channels among all the main stakeholders with the potential of inte- grating vocational adult learning into their work- ing structures. These comprised of: (cid:2) Actors capable of implementing structural changes (national, regional, local government); (cid:2) Actors best positioned to promote adult learn- ing (print media, TV, radio, NGOs, ambassadors); (cid:2) Actors delivering adult education programmes (teachers, study counsellors, etc.); and (cid:2) Actors well positioned to direct and gear adults towards continuing education (particu- larly employers, trade unions, job centres). All parties were actively engaged and mobilised as part of the strategy in order to implement or facilitate delivery of campaigns and targeted activities at local level (e.g. in the workplace). This comprehensive approach allowed unifying isolated efforts through a structured network of partners working together, with incentives from the government to identify common solutions to build the adult education sector at national level. (cid:4) Build an evidence-based strategy: Research efforts by the government prior to the proposal of NOSTE concerning attitudes and predisposi- tion of low skilled adults clearly highlighted that if adult education was to be promoted success- fully, there was a need to identify strategies to make it more relevant and appealing to the tar- get group. Adult education could not be promoted as a concept and a broad sense. It needed to be in E U R O P E A N G U I D E S t r a t e g i e s f o r i m p r o v i n g p a r t i c i p a t i o n i n a n d a w a r e n e s s o f a d u l t l e a r n i n g 63 (144) This study was conducted by the University of Joensuu, http://www.joensuu.fi/ tutkimustuki/koovee2/sisallot/ the_university_of_joensuu.htm (145) http://www.minedu.fi/ OPM/Julkaisut/2002/ parlamentaarisen_ aikuiskoulutustyoryhman_ mietinto?lang=fi&extra_ locale=en (146) http://www.noste-ohjelma.fi (147) This took place between September and October 2006 and toured around Finland visiting 28 Noste programme areas and 44 localities.

        "a format and context that reflected the social and psychological needs of the target audience. This research also enabled establishing SMART ( 152 ) objectives before the campaign\u2019s inception. (cid:4) Centralise strategy and decentralise deliv- ery: Despite being a single large-scale national campaign with a single visual identity and central- ised plan for the rollout, responsibility for imple- mentation was left at regional/local level according to a decentralised structure. Independent of geo- graphic scope and reach of a campaign, using such an approach allowed enough flexibility to address local level challenges and adapt the deliv- ery of promotional tools to each specific context, whilst ensuring consistency. (cid:4) Support the campaign with structural changes: In its aims to build the adult learning sector at national level, the NOSTE campaign was supported by key operational changes in adult learning policy structures. One example is the increase of fund- ing and of vocational training study places in the providing institutions. This means that public policy changes are necessary to accrue the potential ben- efits deriving from a nationwide campaign. (cid:4) Use multiple communication tools: The cam- paign made use of a wide range of internal/ external and on- and off-line communication tools to strengthen cooperation amongst stake- holders and raise the target group\u2019s awareness. Each tool should have a defined objective and be pre-tested in terms of its accessibility and rele- vance to the target groups. (cid:4) Push stakeholders to take up leadership roles: NOSTE succeeded in empowering cooperating part- ners and stakeholders, by providing them with a ense of ownership of their projects. Stakeholders should thus not simply be engaged as execut- ing actors of a campaign, but should be directly empowered to act as active advocates of the cause. This helps them drive their target groups independent of the campaign, thereby favouring greater sustainability of efforts undertaken. (cid:4) Move away from generic messages to pro- mote adult learning: Using research and pre- testing is key to identifying the right messaging. There is a need to move away from the classical arguments promoting the broad benefits of adult learning and communicate specifically what is appealing for the campaign\u2019s target groups. (cid:4) Personalise programmes: One of the key suc- cess factors for NOSTE was that potential learners were given the opportunity to meet teachers and peer study counsellors face-to-face. This allowed for the tailoring of the teaching offer to learners\u2019 needs, personalising plans, and re-directing target groups towards the appropriate vocational train- ing centres or employment offices. It was acknowl- edged that a \u2018one-size\u2019 fits all strategy would not sufficiently engage learners to assess their own skills gaps and educational interests. (cid:4) Conduct regular annual evaluations: This activ- ity is of particular importance for campaigns exe- cuted over an extended time-span. Conducting regular follow-ups will enable the establishment of benchmarks as the programme progresses, which will in turn help in the review or adaptation of the strategy.

        "Overview of activity Objectives (cid:2) Engage schoolchildren by reaching out to schools; consequently, engage families of school children. (cid:2) Expand diversity of adult visitor profiles to Kens- ington Palace. (cid:2) Increase scope and frequency of visits. (cid:2) Increase knowledge and understanding of spe- cific palaces, and British history and culture in general. (cid:2) Encourage learning in both children and adults through intergenerational interaction. (cid:2) Assist schools with development of relationships with parents. Target group (cid:2) Students and their families from less privileged backgrounds, living in the vicinity of Kensington Palace ( 159 ). How did the activity work? Stage I: HRP selected primary schools from less prosperous areas and primarily immigrant areas of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea ( 160 ) in London to participate in the programme. The goal was to deepen their engagement and understanding of the palace. Schoolchildren from these selected schools were provided a DVD from a \u2018bookkeeper\u2019 at Kensington Palace, asking them to help him find the \u2018lost stories of the palace\u2019. They were taken to the palace on two visits, and in their role of \u2018explorers\u2019, were encouraged to \u2018find\u2019 these old stories by scour- ing the palace, listening and sharing ideas. Back in the classroom, the students were encouraged to create characters and develop their own storytelling skills, pertaining to the palace. Stage II: Parents and families of the schoolchil- dren were then invited to the school to partici- pate in the creative process alongside their children in the classrooms, and to learn about the pal- ace, British history, and cultural identity. In addi- tion, since Kensington Palace houses the Royal Ceremonial Dress Collection ( 161 ), fashion was a pri- mary topic of learning. Parents along with their chil- dren were encouraged to explore their own cultural identity, and design clothes that reflected the stories of the palaces, using materials from their own cul- tural backgrounds \u2013 this was known as the \u2018Fabric of Cultures\u2019 and was the basis of a Fashion Show later showcased to the public. Stage III: After each seven-week project, children and their families were invited to the palace for a celebration, where the children were finally declared \u2018palace explorers\u2019. They told their stories in front of families and friends as well as passing members of the public, and were rewarded with certificates. Format (cid:2) Face to face interaction: including visits to the palace, workshops, and art activities. This included a Community Display session, where parents and children showcased the results of their activities ( 162 ). (cid:2) Digital media: to provide learning resources both for this project and for wider web audiences. (cid:2) Blog: to encourage communication among teach- ers from different schools ( 163 ).

Palace Explorers Historic Royal Palaces, United Kingdom 12 Historic Royal Palaces ( 153 ) (HRP) is an independent charity that looks after the Tower of London ( 154 ), Hampton Court Palace ( 155 ), the Banqueting House ( 156 ), Kensington Palace ( 157 ) and Kew Palace ( 158 ). It is not publically funded, and depends on the support of its visitors, members, donors, volunteers and sponsors. HRP developed the Palace Explorers programme, which uses intergenerational interaction to encourage students and their families from varied backgrounds to visit palaces in the UK, and increase their knowledge and understanding of British history.

        "DVD: capturing the whole process of the programme, to be also posted on the website. Key Messages (cid:2) Kensington Palace is accessible for everyone; (cid:2) Heritage is for everyone, irrespective of back- ground; and (cid:2) Cultural identity is very important. How was the activity developed? 1. Knowledge gathering: Visitor surveys and gen- eral outreach revealed that the types of pal- ace visitors were from a narrow socio-economic group: older, well educated, and who visited numerous heritage sites. There was recognition that other types of visitors needed to be encour- aged to visit the palace. 2. Selection of schools: Demographically, each palace had a very different constituency, and attention was on schools that had not specifi- cally organised trips to the palace previously. 3. Focus groups with parents: HRP conducted focus groups with parents from the selected schools to determine their experience of British culture and heritage. 4. Funding: The programme was funded mainly by the Historic Royal Palaces. Because of the nature of the outreach, Historic Royal Palaces also received funding from the local authority. 5. Partners: The final programme was developed in consultation with local community partners, participating schools, the extended schools coor- dinator, a local study support centre and profes- sional storytellers and artists. 6. Promotion: The programme was promoted through flyers which were distributed at schools. E-mails were also sent to interested parents. The programme started in November 2010 and the school element finished in May 2011. Interaction with parents is ongoing. Results of the activity The original Palace Explorers programme ran at Kensington Palace from September 2010 until July 2011. The activity\u2019s results are as follows: (cid:4) Participation: 180 children, 153 family and friends attended the Community Display, 38 took part in the family learning session. (cid:4) External evaluation: External evaluators, who attended family sessions and conducted face to face interviews with teachers, children, and parents, provided positive feedback. There was a marked increase in learning and skills amongst participants, an increase in knowledge about the Palace specifi- cally, and about British history more generally. (cid:4) Feedback: Parents have continued projects that were begun during the programme, have expressed interest in visiting other heritage sites, and have purchased memberships to other palaces. They have also joined together to create a \u2018Family Forum\u2019, acting as a valuable sounding board for the school and the programme. Three parents have become HRP volunteers and are developing pro- grammes of activities related to the Palace in local languages for their families and friends. Lessons learnt from the activity (cid:4) Build an evidence-based strategy: The HRP based the programme and the ensuing campaign on research and data gathered from visitor sur- veys and past observations of visitors to the pal- aces. This provided an overview of socio-economic and demographic backgrounds of the general vis- itor profile, and highlighted the groups that were not visiting the palaces (which included people from less privileged backgrounds and immigrants). This initial research made it possible to develop a programme specifically targeted to these groups and customised according to their needs. (cid:4) Form partnerships: In addition to the research gathered, the HRP found that coordinating with local organisations and community leaders who had links to the targeted community provided them a comprehensive picture as to the best type of programme to develop. These partnerships also helped increase participation and ensured that the learnings of the programme lived beyond the lifespan of the programme, through reinforcement of local leaders. Dissemination of information was also made easier through use of local partners. (cid:4) Engage learners by using situations that they are in: The HRP reached adult learners in the relevant community through their chil- dren\u2019s schools and schools communications.

        "This not only encouraged parents to participate first hand in the teaching of their children, but also drew parents into the learning environment, and increased communication with their child\u2019s school. It also highlighted how adult education need not be an individual formal experience, but could also take place through the educational experience of others in an informal setting. (cid:4) Leverage intergenerational learning: The HRP promoted the Palace Explorers programme in a manner that appealed to students, but also engaged their parents. They found that parents were very likely to be engaged when they were helping their children to learn in two ways: (i) in terms of imparting information to their children, and (ii) parents were more comfortable with their children being their spokespersons, especially if there were language barriers. They communicate with their children who are the \u2018primary learners\u2019, but nonetheless are involved themselves in the learning process. (cid:4) Develop activities specifically for margin- alised groups: The education needs of groups who are at the risk of social exclusion have to be addressed in a different manner than others. An adult learning strategy targeted towards them should focus on bringing them into the fold of main- stream society, before involving them in further education. The Palace Explorers\u2019 strategy there- fore first helped participants feel more connected to their community, by developing activities that linked their cultures with British culture. It then encour- aged participants to learn more about British history by making it easier for them to visit other palaces. (cid:4) Reach out to immigrants through cultural activities: Education targeted towards adults needs to be linked to each person\u2019s individual identity, especially when the subject is culture. The Palace Explorers programme taught learn- ers a new culture through linking in participants\u2019 own cultures. Personalisation and finding differ- ent ways of entry to their social situation (in this case, encouraging them to express their cultural background by linking it to British history) was therefore very successful. (cid:4) Create benefits beyond learning: An addi- tional benefit that the Palace Explorers pro- gramme offered (beyond that of getting adults to learn) was strengthening relationships between parents and schools. By encouraging parents to participate in school activities with their children, the programme allowed schools to engage par- ents with the teaching of their children, as well as establishing a system of feedback. (cid:4) Create social ambassadors: The presence of a social issue such as cultural identity, and the parental engagement in this programme helped in the creation of parent ambassadors and volun- teers, thereby connecting to the local community. The HRP found that this was possible because of the longer time they invested, as parents need reason and motivation to get involved, which was then cemented over time.

        "Overview of the activity Objectives (cid:2) Increase access amongst target groups to local libraries, books, and professional football clubs; (cid:2) Improve attitudes towards all aspects of literacy; (cid:2) Raise confidence to read well, enjoy reading and to mix with others socially; (cid:2) Provide motivation towards reading more and to improve one\u2019s reading ability; and (cid:2) Change perceptions towards reading and the ste- reotypically negative view of readers. Format The project involved a small group of pupils (10 pupils) from over 70 different schools from different regions, each local to one of the 20 Premier League football teams. These pupils took part in reading group activi- ties in cooperation with their local library. The groups also invited families to attend with their children. The project culminated in celebration activities and certif- icate presentations that were attended by a Premier league football player from the local club. Target groups (cid:2) The project targeted both boys and girls aged 7-11 who were not achieving their expected levels in literacy, but had a passion for foot- ball. A higher number of boys than girls strug- gle with or are uninterested in reading. Although the selection procedure did not specifically target boys, the project was designed to appeal to boys so as to address this disparity. (cid:2) Parents and care-givers were a secondary target group of the project. Although no specific targeting measures were used for this group, the project was particularly concerned with engaging fathers as research shows that fathers were generally less active in helping their children with reading. (cid:2) The project targeted children in particular from low social income groups C2DE groups ( 165 ). (cid:2) Libraries were the contact point for the project, which then subsequently recruited the children/ families by coordinating with local schools. How was the activity developed? The main steps in the development of the activity included: 1. Background: The idea for the project was cre- ated in response to a number of factors: (cid:2) The National Literacy Trust had previously initiated football related activities includ- ing a poster campaign in 1996 that exhibited national football players reading their favour- ite books. This project received positive feed- back, notably from teachers, which motivated the Trust to consider other ways in which it would advocate for literacy through football. (cid:2) There has been a growing realisation of a gender E U R O P E A N G U I D E S t r a t e g i e s f o r i m p r o v i n g p a r t i c i p a t i o n i n a n d a w a r e n e s s o f a d u l t l e a r n i n g 68 (164) http://www.premierleague.com (165) C2DE indicates \u2018working class\u2019 groups as classified by the NRS social grading system used in the United Kingdom http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ NRS_social_grade Premier League Reading Stars National Literacy Trust, United Kingdom 13 The National Literacy Trust is an independent UK charity that works to transform lives through literacy, by supporting those who struggle with literacy and the people who work with them. It conducts research on issues relating to literacy, and it works with teachers, literacy professionals and librarians, providing literacy news and teaching resources to the 48 000 visitors to its website every month. The National Literacy Trust developed the Premier League Reading Stars programme, which is a reading motivation project, harnessing the power of football to encourage people to enjoy reading. It targets hard- to-reach groups in society who may not have shown an interest in reading, but who do have a passion for football. Although primarily aimed at school age children, this project also engages with, and brings ben- efits to, parents. The project was implemented through a partnership with the UK Premier League ( 164 ) and the participation of local libraries that organised a series of football and reading activity based meetings for local children and their families.

        "gap in reading capabilities as well as a gap between income groups. This has been backed up by research ( 166 ). (cid:2) The National Literacy Trust wanted to come up with a new way of engaging children and their families in reading \u2013 particularly boys and fathers \u2013 that was fun and did not appear overtly focused on reading \u2013 i.e. introducing literature \u2018by stealth\u2019. (cid:2) Finally, the National Literacy Trust was confi- dent in the power of role models in encourag- ing reading. Research on this topic has since demonstrated that the most important role models for children are family members and sports persons. This latter group is particularly important for C2DE groups. 2. Concept: The National Literacy Trust brought these different ideas together and came up with the concept of footballer \u2018reading champions\u2019 who would engage with readers that strug- gle with reading but have a passion for football. Participants would be involved in football-related reading activities, which would culminate in a final celebration and certificate ceremony that would typically be attended by a footballer from the local club. Parents and care-givers would also be encouraged to attend and to partake in the activities. The project ran annually between 2003 and 2010. 3. Partners and funding: The project idea was taken up by the Premier League ( 167 ) which pro- vides on-going funding for the project and recruits footballers to participate. The Arts Council of England ( 168 ) has also supported the project with funding from its inception, and the Football Foundation ( 169 ) provided both funding and support for the project. Sport Relief ( 170 ) has come on board in 2011 as a new partner to pro- vide joint promotion. 4. Promotion: The project was implemented through support from local football clubs that were recruited through the Premier League. The clubs were then encouraged to reach out to a selected local library, which would in turn consult with local schools so as to recruit relevant children to par- ticipate. This system of coordination was highly efficient and the National Literacy Trust discov- ered that promotional activity was not required to recruit participants. However, the activities attracted significant media attention. Results of the activity (cid:4) Formal evaluation: An external evaluation was carried out on the project to determine the out- comes of the activities. The study used focus groups to determine attitudes towards the project, how the successes could be built upon and how the activities could be up-scaled in the future. (cid:4) Internal evaluation and feedback: The National Literacy Trust carried out an ongoing monitoring process by asking all children, parents and care- givers to complete an online evaluation, pre and post project questionnaires. This revealed over- whelmingly positive feedback for the project \u2013 e.g. 71 % of children reported that they would be more likely to read having learnt that footballers were also keen readers. Lessons learnt from the activity (cid:4) Leverage intergenerational learning: Premier League Reading Stars designed its programme to appeal to young children, but it also engaged their parents. It found that parents were more willing to participate if they were involved in helping their children to learn. In this particular case, fathers constituted a key target as they appeared to be less engaged with their children\u2019s reading or learn- ing skills. (cid:4) Developing innovative methodology: Hooking a project to a popular activity with strong inter- est of the target group combined with a learning activity is a strong recipe for a successful pro- ject. By introducing the literacy element to the project \u2018by stealth\u2019, the National Literacy Trust found that children and parents/care-givers alike were more likely to engage with and enjoy the project, whilst still demonstrating strong literacy based outcomes. Similarly, the use of recognised \u2018champions\u2019 as endorsers of the project attracted nation-wide attention, whilst also allowing for the scale-up of activities. (cid:4) Base activities on research: The Premier League Reading Stars programme was based on a grow- ing realisation based on research of a gender gap in reading capabilities as well as a gap between income groups. This research made it possible to identify specific target groups and to design a suitable programme idea.

        "(cid:4) Develop strategic partnerships: Founding the project on a strong collaboration with a high- capacity partner was vital to its success. It pro- vided access to a network of contact points and valuable endorsers of the activity. It demonstrates that learning, especially amongst disadvantaged groups, is an area that has the potential to moti- vate individuals and partner organisations to get involved and support a project. Premier League Reading Stars first partnered with the Premier League, which implemented the programme through support from local football clubs. The clubs were then encouraged to reach out to their local libraries. By using a high profile organisation like the Premier League, Premier League Reading Stars ensured that the programme would be high profile, gather media attention, and facilitate part- nerships with local organisations. (cid:4) Identify appropriate supporters : By using appropriate partners such as libraries, whose remit was already to encourage people to read, Premier League Reading Stars ensured that its programme could reach its specific target groups. Identifying and engaging the right partners is likely to impact positively on two levels: first, favour ownership in the long-term; second, increase chances of sus- tainability after the programme. (cid:4) Use relevant role models: In the publicity of adult education, it is important to use role mod- els who are appealing to learners. By picking football players and students and their families who have a passion for football, Premier League Reading Stars makes the programme pertinent and aspirational for the learners. (cid:4) Build on past successes: Premier League Reading Stars was based on a recognition that working with role-models (in this case football- ers) to promote an activity (in this case reading) could be successful. The project then aimed to scale-up the initial activities that had demon- strated this fact (i.e. the poster campaign). (cid:4) Expand existing activities: The Premier League Reading Stars project also demonstrates how activ- ities can be taken even further by transforming the project online so as to include many more partic- ipants. The methodology used by the libraries will now be made available as a pack for many more schools and libraries. Online literacy challenges will also be delivered by the next wave of football Reading Champions. Although the results of this new phase are yet to be established, the process demonstrates how a practical project that receives significant attention from the target group (includ- ing in this case many other schools that were not able to participate) can be scaled-up online. Any organisations wishing to roll out this programme or develop a similar project should contact the National Literacy Trust regarding licensing. See http://www.literacytrust.org.uk for more.

        "Overview of activity Objectives The aim of the Quick Reads series is to improve the literacy rate and overall reading skills, reintroduce people to literature, and to open up a new market for booksellers. For NIACE, which manages the outreach and engagement of Quick Reads, the first year\u2019s objectives were to: (cid:2) Raise awareness of the books; and (cid:2) Distribute five million book tokens that were to be used in bookstores to get a discount on books. In the long term, NIACE\u2019s objectives are to: (cid:2) Ensure that the Quick Reads series are viewed as books that people could trust. (cid:2) Provide intermediaries (including literacy tutors) with a tool that could be used to promote literacy and support literacy teaching to adults at Entry Level 3/Level 1. (cid:2) Encourage learners to develop a reading habit ( 176 ). Format (cid:2) Books: Available directly through publish- ers, booksellers and supermarkets (online and offline). (cid:2) Website: Has the first chapters of books availa- ble as samples (the chapter samplers have been made available through the BBC site in recent years and linked to from the Quick Reads site: http://www.quickreads.org.uk). Target groups NIACE manages the outreach and engagement aspects of Quick Reads using its intermediaries ( 177 ), who enjoy learners\u2019 trust as they interact with each other on a regular basis. Intermediaries include: (cid:2) Literacy tutors working in adult education col- leges and formal education establishments, who would be teaching literacy classes for most of their working week. (cid:2) Unionlearn ( 178 ) representatives who distribute ma- terials to their member\u2019s organisations. (cid:2) Voluntary groups and charities engaged in adult learning as well as other fields, such as old age care, working with young mothers, etc. (cid:2) Community leaders in the field of adult learning. Groups that were not targeted, but were found to be reading the books included: (cid:2) Readers for whom English is a second language; and (cid:2) Young adults and school children. How was the activity developed? The main actors involved in development and dis- semination of Quick Reads were as follows: (cid:2) Major UK publishers; (cid:2) NIACE and its intermediaries (cid:2) Libraries; and (cid:2) Representatives of workplaces through Unionlearn.

(174) http://www.niace.org.uk/ (175) http://www.bis.gov.uk/ (176) NIACE intends Quick Reads to be a starting point to come back into reading, but not the only material people should read. It tries to encourage learners to move past Quick Reads, look at other titles by the authors, read books they have not read before, and start developing reading habits. (177) This includes a database of approximately 70 000 contacts. (178) Unionlearn aims to help unions to become learning organisations, with programmes for union reps and regional officers and strategic support for national officers. http://www.unionlearn.org.uk/ Quick Reads NIACE, United Kingdom 14 In 2003, a governmental study was commissioned in the UK that examined the population\u2019s skills sets, and literacy was identified as an important area for development. Based on the results, the Chief Executive of Random House ( 171 ) conceived of a set of books that would be accessible for readers at Entry Level 3/Level 1 literacy levels ( 172 ). A partnership of publishers was then formed ( 173 ) to develop Quick Reads, a series of short books by bestselling authors and celebrities. The National Institute of Adult Continuing Education (NIACE) ( 174 ) was funded by the Department for Education and Skills (DfES, subsequently the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills ( 175 ), BIS) to manage the engagement and outreach of the Quick Reads series with relevant stakeholders, in order to ensure highest uptake of the books.

        "The main steps in the development of the activity were as follows: 1. Conception: Quick Reads was conceptualised by the Chief Executive of Random House, based on a study conducted in 2003, which demonstrated that literacy should be a priority area for develop- ment in England. The World Book Day ( 179 ) charity consisting of the major UK publishers then set up Quick Reads, which would help improve the liter- acy rate, develop a reading habit and enjoyment of reading for people that didn\u2019t read regularly as well as open up new markets for book publishers in the longer term. 2. Partnership with publishers: A partnership of publishers was then formed as part of the World Book Day charity and they agreed on the num- ber of books to be published as well as a frame- work for the authors, i.e. the criteria for writing the book, how the process should be managed, and the type of audience the books were aimed at. Each publisher was responsible for lining up its authors ( 180 ), developing titles for the series, and the publication of the books. The partnership included the major publishing houses in the UK. 3. Involvement of NIACE: NIACE was asked to manage the national outreach and awareness campaign of Quick Reads by the DfES, sub- sequently BIS. Its job since 2005 has been to engage as many people as possible, and make them aware of Quick Reads. Since its organisa- tion has a remit to raise awareness and stimulate demand for learning, it wanted to be involved. (cid:2) It received funding from the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills ( 181, 182 ). (cid:2) It aimed to engage as many organisations as possible, make them aware of new titles, sup- port literacy tutors and other intermediaries who had access to learners who would benefit from improving their literacy skills, and provide materials that would help intermediaries. This included provision of posters, bookmarks, and teaching resources to help publicise books. Promotion (cid:2) Direct mail: sent out to intermediaries and to all representatives who were in mailing list for Unionlearn (22 000 on list at the time). (cid:2) E-mail: sent to intermediaries and partner organi- sations who distributed it through their contacts. (cid:2) Attendance at events: such as at sector spe- cific conferences, e.g. Unionlearn and tutor con- ferences. At these conferences, authors were asked to be on the main stage to present their books and raise their profiles. In addition, NIACE also participated in other relevant events in the community or workplaces, in cooperation with partners. As an example, Rolls-Royce held a Family Fun Day in some workplaces, which included profiling of the Quick Reads books. (cid:2) Press coverage: the responsibility for which was split between NIACE\u2019s press office, and the PR agency that worked with the World Book Day Event. NIACE focused on getting press in the educational publications, including the Guardian, the Independent and the BBC . The PR agency was responsible for other press, includ- ing the organisation of a launch event in London with Tony Blair. (cid:2) Linked to other partner activities: including cooperation with BBC on their Read and Write (RaW) project ( 183 ). (cid:2) Vouchers: in the first year, five million GBP 1 book vouchers meant to reduce the costs of the books were made available from GBP 2.99 to GBP 1.99. The books have subsequently been priced at GBP 1.99. (cid:2) Sector specific adverts or articles: NIACE advertised in sector specific publications that worked with groups of organisations that it wanted to be involved in. (cid:2) Social media: Authors as well as campaign partners with Twitter accounts were encour- aged to publicise the books. The advantage was that these messages did not have to be \u2018vetted\u2019 through a formal process, as was the case with other print publications. In addition, the tweets reached a variety of different audiences not nec- essarily targeted by the campaign, including readers of the authors other books. (cid:2) Galaxy Mars ( 184 ) sponsorship: Galaxy Mars was involved in the development of Quick Reads from Autumn 2010 and used consumer advertis- ing to highlight their involvement (as part of the company\u2019s Corporate Social Responsibility pro- gramme). It is hoped that the relationship with Galaxy will continue in the longer term with con- tinued financial support and closer working rela- tionships. NIACE is currently exploring how Galaxy Mars staff can act as reading volunteers in their local area and to develop reading initiatives with Galaxy Mars staff.

        "Results of the activity The results of the activity were measured in numer- ous ways: (cid:4) Information was collected from people reading books on the review section on the website. (cid:4) Impact evaluation through questionnaires with intermediaries, focus groups led by intermedi- aries, discussion groups, and interviews with groups of learners. Since the beginning of Quick Reads, the results are as follows: (cid:4) Sales: The year-on-year sales of books are increasing. Three million books were distributed through book sales or union representatives buy- ing and distributing through their networks. (cid:4) Loans: One and a half million books were loaned out through libraries. (cid:4) Engagement: NIACE engages with between 10 000 and 15 000 intermediaries per year. (cid:4) Development of literacy abilities: Those who did use the books showed significant positive changes in terms of literary abilities, when marked against the curriculum. (cid:4) Soft skills: There has been a marked increase in confidence and engagement in the workplace ( 185 ). (cid:4) Tokens: 4.9 million tokens were distributed in the first year of Quick Reads, just shy of the stated goal of 5 million. Lessons learnt from the activity (cid:4) Monitor national research: The Quick Reads project was conceptualised based on a govern- mental study commissioned in the UK. By mon- itoring existing research, the CEO of Random House was able to identify an existing need of the population, and thereby develop Quick Reads to address the need. (cid:4) Develop objectives for different stages of the campaign: The Quick Reads campaign had both short-term and long-term objectives. This ensures that there was an initial realistic goal established, such as distribution of specific num- ber of tokens, as well as an understanding of where the campaign needed to get to in a few years. Therefore, each promotional activity was developed in a paced manner that worked towards the achievement of the objectives. (cid:4) Use intermediaries: Although the Quick Reads campaign was a national campaign, NIACE reached adult learners almost exclusively through its intermediaries. As a result of their continuing relationship, NIACE is able to leave the major- ity of the decision making and tactical execution to the intermediaries. NIACE has found that the use of intermediaries, whom learners are more inclined to trust and interact with, allows dissem- ination of materials with greater ease. (cid:4) Define the role of each partner clearly: By establishing upfront the remit of each partner in a partnership, it was ensured that each organi- sation had their own set of activities and con- sequently limited any waste of resources. This is especially valid when partnering with other organisations that have similar remits (such as NIACE with BBC RaW): while the reach of the activity is widened, it must be ensured that there is no overlap in activities. (cid:4) Present materials innovatively: The Quick Reads book series are designed to be accessi- ble at all levels of literacy. They are not written in a manner that could be seen as condescend- ing. The marketing and presentation of the books at bookstores follows the same retail principle; the books are not promoted as a tool that would improve literacy, but just as another one of the author\u2019s titles, and are consequently placed on the same shelf as the author\u2019s other titles after the ini- tial launch where prominent floor space is secured in a range of stores across the country. This strategy is intended to make Quick Reads\u2019 readers feel confi- dent in their ability to read the author\u2019s other titles. (cid:4) Select participants who want to be involved: The publishing houses responsible for the Quick Reads series selected some authors who were already involved in literacy issues. This ensured that the promotion made by these authors would take into account the types of readers and their needs. (cid:4) Involve other target groups: It was important to NIACE to include other socio-economic and demographic sectors in their promotional activ- ities, apart from traditional adult learners. This included young mothers, as research has found that parents\u2019 reading habits have an impact on E U R O P E A N G U I D E S t r a t e g i e s f o r i m p r o v i n g p a r t i c i p a t i o n i n a n d a w a r e n e s s o f a d u l t l e a r n i n g 73 (185) 89 % of learning providers reported an increase in their learners\u2019 communications skills and 78 % of tutors also reported that their learners had better written skills after using Quick Reads. Some 50 % of learning providers also felt that using Quick Reads had increased their learners\u2019 job prospects. NC3112514ENC_002.pdf 71 25/07/12 16:14 ",
        "whether the child would develop a reading habit. This would not only introduce books to new potential learners, but also opened up new mar- kets for Quick Reads. In addition, although young adults and those who spoke English as a sec- ond language were not primary target groups, NIACE\u2019s awareness raising activities still reached them. By making the books accessible for anyone who wanted to buy them, NIACE ensured wider uptake and increased dissemination. (cid:4) Use a variety of promotional tools: The Quick Reads campaign uses the BBC and its own web- site to promote the books. This ensures that potential readers can easily find the books going about their daily activities such as visiting the BBC news site. In addition, potential readers can \u2018sample\u2019 books through these tools before decid- ing whether they wish to purchase them. (cid:4) Integrate activities with that of estab- lished actors in the field: Literacy tutors and Unionlearn\u2019s representatives\u2019 activities are mainly focused on promoting adult education and get- ting learners to read. NIACE therefore encouraged them to distribute the Quick Reads books to their students and members. By leveraging existing networks, NIACE is able to ensure wider distribu- tion of books. (cid:4) Leverage the CSR arm of larger organisa- tions: NIACE and Quick Reads partnered with Galaxy Mars as part of the promotional cam- paign. This ensured higher level of sponsorship and wider publicity for the books. This demon- strates an opportunity to cooperate with large organisations with CSR activities to help cham- pion the cause of adult learning.

        "Overview of activity Objectives (cid:2) Ensure that everyone is aware of illiteracy, its definition and impact on society; (cid:2) Ensure that actors operating at different levels of the society (e.g. policy making, national admin- istrations, employment offices) are aware of methods to combat illiteracy and integrate them into their work policies; (cid:2) Engage leading national and local level actors in the fight against illiteracy; (cid:2) Collect best practice examples and optimise stakeholders\u2019 existing resources; and (cid:2) Identify synergies between public authorities\u2019 ini- tiatives and other actors counteracting illiteracy to improve effectiveness and impact of outputs. Format (cid:2) Website; (cid:2) The ANLCI Infos newsletter ( 188 ); (cid:2) Reference scales for basic skills evaluation in a professional context; (cid:2) A national guideline handbook which acts as a structuring tool designed to provide policy mak- ers and key actors with a comprehensive view of essential components of the fight against illiteracy; (cid:2) A charter, developed under the patronage of the French Minister for Vocational Training, in part- ners commit to the ANLCI principles for profes- sional training; and (cid:2) An action plan that combines the efforts of all stakeholders. Target groups (cid:2) Policy makers; (cid:2) Social partners; (cid:2) Civil society actors (e.g. family and parents organi- sations); and (cid:2) Any stakeholder taking part into the prevention and the fight against illiteracy. Development and promotion Given the number of actors in the field, including public authorities and civil society organisations, it was necessary to structure and to develop a more cooperative and coherent intervention strategy. The approach devised by ANLCI was based on a report made by the Director for the Ministry for Work, Employment and Vocational Training in 1999. 1. Situational analysis: ANLCI worked with the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies ( 189 ) (INSEE) to measure illiteracy in France. It was able to produce the very first fig- ures about \u2018illettrisme\u2019 in the French popula- tion between the ages of 16 and 65, based on tests created by the ANLCI ( 190 ). These tests com- prised of evaluative tools specially designed to evaluate reading and writing difficulties. Based on this model, ANLCI develops compatible and comparable tools to the IVQ to be used in other assessment contexts ( 191 ), including Evado ( 192 ), a programme testing people\u2019s (basic) skills in lit- eracy and numeracy, which could be installed and run locally or over the Internet. With these tools, E U R O P E A N G U I D E S t r a t e g i e s f o r i m p r o v i n g p a r t i c i p a t i o n i n a n d a w a r e n e s s o f a d u l t l e a r n i n g 75 (186) National Agency to Fight Illiteracy.

IVQs measure learners' underpinning knowledge and practical competence to ensure that they are ready to enter the world of work or progress in their careers by the time they graduate. (192) http://www.evadoo.fr/ R\u00e9unir Pour Mieux Agir (Together to Act Better) ANLCI, France 15 The Agence Nationale de Lutte Contre l'Illettrisme ( 186 ) (ANLCI) was founded in 2000. It aims at unifying resources of important stakeholders in the field of adult education in France, to streamline the effective- ness of their commitment to counteract illiteracy, and to increase stakeholder visibility. The organisation is based on the fundamental principle \u2018R\u00e9unir Pour Mieux Agir\u2019 ( 187 ), thereby demon- strating participatory and interactive working methods with all stakeholders involved. This ensures that the guiding principles on how to address illiteracy are commonly known and reflected in stakeholder policies and practices.

        "ANLCI was then able to produce more detailed statistics on who the illiterate people were, to build comparable indicators which allowed all the organisations involved in the fight against illit- eracy to coordinate their actions with the same statistical reference and to define and develop a shared targeted strategy. 2. Cooperation with stakeholders: ANLCI brought together their members to draft and establish national guidelines on the definition of illiteracy and how to combat it. Guidelines were written by all partners ( 193 ) during workshops, whereby par- ticipants were provided with draft proposals and were then given the opportunity to amend the text and agree on a common version. 3. Definition of \u2018illettrisme\u2019: The main actors developed the following commonly approved definition of illettrisme as follows: \u2018The term illettrisme describes the situation of people over 16 years old who, although they have attended school (in France), cannot read and understand a text related to situations in their daily life, and/or are unable to write in order to communicate sim- ple information.\u2019 This definition is different from the definition of illiteracy because if the deter- mination of difficulties facing reading and writ- ing tasks is the same, the target population (in the case of \u2018illettrisme\u2019) is narrowed to people over ageing 16 and who have been at school in France for at least 5 years. Those persons could be French or foreign citizens. The population targeted by this definition different from the population of peo- ple learning French as a foreign language because they can speak French but they failed at school to get an enough high level reading and writing com- petences allowing them to manage the everyday tasks involving writing documents. Generally those people have a bad reminding of school and refuse training out of hand. In France, two third of illiter- ate people are \u2018illettr\u00e9s\u2019. 4. Production of a national guideline hand- book: This was provided to stakeholders with a comprehensive overview of what they should do to combat illiteracy. 5. Regional action plans: All partners of ANLCI then signed an action plan that committed them to prevent and fight against illiteracy in their region. The ANLCI will carry on its activities at least until October 2015. Engagement activities (cid:2) Establishing common definitions such as illiter- acy, and developing common goals; (cid:2) Signing agreements with social partners and local associations to define each other\u2019s role; with the national government, including the Ministries of Education, Employment, and Vocational Training to establish a long-term structured partnership; and (cid:2) Developing regional actions plans ( 194 ) and encour- aging signees to work together. Promotion (cid:2) Lobbying policy makers and other decision makers. (cid:2) Ensuring consistency across all stakeholders\u2019 communication tools, e.g. leaflets, booklets, guidelines, print materials \u2013 which contain clear definitions, data, and examples, to ensure com- mon and same understanding of the issues. (cid:2) Enabling regional project leaders to act as contact points of ANLCI at regional level. They thus pro- mote ANLCI\u2019s initiatives undertaken at national level at the local level to ensure consistency. (cid:2) Establishing networks for dialogue with organi- sations wishing to support actions in the field of illiteracy. (cid:2) Dissemination using members of the various committees as intermediaries. They leverage their own internal channels to communicate with members of the same stakeholder group. (cid:2) Launch of the Forum of good practices (Forum permanent des pratiques ( 195 )) in 2004, which comprises a repository of good practices, as well as workshops/seminars whereby participants fol- low three stages: (i) Present their case studies; (ii) Identify elements of success as well as actions to be avoided; and (iii) Produce guidelines for trans- lation in other contexts. (cid:2) Taking part in various events, such as a national meeting of actors favouring school success at the European University of AFEV ( 196 ); a national meeting for local educative projects; a national meeting on long life learning organised by the Minister to Vocational Training. Funding The funding for the ANLCI comes from its Board of Directors. Its budget is EUR 600 000 per year, and is doubled by the European Social Funds to EUR 1 200 000. Evaluation and results Each year, the ANLCI presents its yearly activity to the Board of Directors, which evaluates the actions E U R O P E A N G U I D E S t r a t e g i e s f o r i m p r o v i n g p a r t i c i p a t i o n i n a n d a w a r e n e s s o f a d u l t l e a r n i n g 76 (193) These consisted of the Board of Directors; the Advisory Committee; the Scientific and Assessment Committee; 26 regional project leaders; and 50 illiteracy resource centres.

        "and provides future orientations. In 2010, the con- stitution of the Agency was renewed for a further five years. The ANLCI has received positive feedback on its working method from the following actors: (cid:2) The European Commission; (cid:2) The media, which considers ANLCI a reference body, and contacts it for reports and articles; (cid:2) Other foundations in the field refer to the ANLCI for their actions to promote literacy; and (cid:2) The ANLCI\u2019s Director was invited to a session on illiteracy during the G8 for Heads of State spouses ( 197 ). The evaluation also shows: (cid:2) Businesses are increasingly considering basic and vocational skills training opportunities; (cid:2) The subject of adult illiteracy is becoming a main- stream issue, and is less marginalised; (cid:2) Improved involvement between partners and increased awareness of their initiatives was seen (e.g. with respect to regional action plans, con- ventions, national and international events, etc.); and (cid:2) 159 000 hits on Google for the term \u2018ANLCI\u2019. A new evaluation phase is expected to commence in 2011, with results to be published in 2012. It will be run by INSEE and ANLCI and will measure current national progress and outcomes. Lessons learnt from the activity (cid:4) Build an evidence-based strategy: ANLCI used existing and new research to analyse demograph- ics and illiteracy, thereby ensuring that the strategy that they devised had an accurate initial bench- mark. Further research at interim and end stages of the programme cycle allowed for a proper chart- ing of the progression made towards objectives. (cid:4) Pool resources: ANLCI\u2019s strategy was based on joining up its stakeholder resources. This pool- ing optimised outcomes not only in terms of pro- motion and awareness raising, but also reduced costs, avoided the repetition of efforts, and diminished the proliferation of disjointed initia- tives with limited potential of impact. (cid:4) Build a common understanding: ANLCI devel- oped an action plan which tackled the problem at its most basic level, beginning with the lack of a systematised and commonly agreed upon understanding of basic definitions concerning illiteracy and adult learning. By ensuring there was an agreement on these basic definitions and principles, stakeholders were able to frame pol- icy and engage in debate according to set goals, promoting a trickle down effect at all levels of action (national, regional, local and individual actor level, e.g. businesses). (cid:4) Require commitment from stakeholders: ANLCI required its stakeholders to sign regional action plans, which committed them to fight against illiteracy. This ensured that stakeholders had to adhere to agreed upon actions and interventions, and their non participation would be frowned upon by co-signees.

        "Overview of activity Objectives The objective of NALA\u2019s Distance Learning Service (DLS) is to provide distance learning opportunities free of cost, targeted at improving literacy for all social, economic and cultural backgrounds. The spe- cific objectives of Written Off? were to: (cid:2) Ensure that learners featured on the show were able to get the required educational accredita- tion, and continued with further learning. (cid:2) Raise awareness about literacy issues and the Distance Learning Service ( 201 ). (cid:2) Show potential learners the advantages of returning to education and its long term benefits, in terms of how quickly progress can be made in improving knowledge and skills. (cid:2) Demonstrate to policy makers that intensive edu- cation worked better than a slower format ( 202 ), and gain increased funding for the intensive for- mat of education. Format Written Off? is an unscripted TV series that fol- lows 11 adults in an eight-week, specially designed 104 hour intensive learning course. The course was held in a classroom, and included specific learning content related to real-life situations ( 203 ). It was designed to be a motivational call to action for pro- spective learners, where educational participation and progression would be presented in an interest- ing and entertaining but factual and ethical manner. It was supported by a free telephone number and a free text message number, which people could use to get more information on literacy opportunities. The show was developed in 2007, the first season was broadcast in 2008, and the second in 2009. It was broadcast on the most popular and most watched television channel in Ireland, RT\u00c9 One ( 204 ) and attracted weekly audiences of 200 000 viewers. The show cost EUR 631 000 to create and produce. Target group (cid:2) People with literacy difficulties amongst the general public; and (cid:2) Policy makers. How was the activity developed? The main actors involved in the development of Written Off? were as follows: (cid:2) Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, which provided funding for the programme ( 205 ). (cid:2) Animo ( 206 ) the TV Production company that made the programme, managed the logistics, and made it appropriate for the medium. (cid:2) RT\u00c9, which broadcast the programme. (cid:2) NALA, which was in charge of content develop- ment, to ensure there was a balance between the requirements of a TV programme and the learning aspects of the show. It was important that the delivery of the course adhered to NALA's Guidelines for Good Adult Literacy Work ( 207 ). The main steps in the development of the activity were: 1. Become an accredited provider of educa- tion: NALA wanted to develop a series around accreditation from the National Framework of Qualification ( 208 ) in Ireland. They therefore reg- istered with the Further Education Training Awards Council ( 209 ), who validated the course E U R O P E A N G U I D E S t r a t e g i e s f o r i m p r o v i n g p a r t i c i p a t i o n i n a n d a w a r e n e s s o f a d u l t l e a r n i n g 78 (198) http://www.nala.ie/ NALA is a non profit registered charity funded by the Department of Education and Skills. (199) http://www.nala.ie/tv-programmes (200) http://www.nala.ie/ distance-learning-service (201) This included getting more people to call the DLS about local providers in their area, or the opportunities provided by the DLS. (202) \u2018Two hours a week with a volunteering tutor\u2019. (203) Previous DLS\u2019 flagship TV series \u2018Read Write Now\u2019 (5 series) and The Really Useful Guide to Words and Numbers (two series) were pedantic in content, and had been broadcast in prime time on RT\u00c9 One, the most popular state funded national TV channel. However, when RT\u00c9, which is funded through taxes, came under commercial pressure, the format of television programming needed to change. The show was moved onto a secondary channel, which led to a drop in audience share and a poor timeslot. Viewership dropped from 200 000 to 10 000, and there was a sharp reduction in the number of people who were calling the DLS for information. Hence, the DLS discussed with the broadcaster how to get back onto primetime. The realisation was there was a need for a different format that was more exciting than observational document series that was not didactic and pedantic in content. The Written Off? series related to real- life situations (budgeting for a meal, etc.). (204) http://www.rte.ie/tv/rteone.html (205) The BAID are funded by 7 % of licensing fees in Ireland. NALA has a commitment from them that 10 % of that would be accessible by NALA. This funding will be available to NALA for activities promoting Adult Learning until 2016 at least. (206) http://www.animo.ie/ (207) http://www.nala.ie/publications/ guidelines-good-adult-literacy-work It committed NALA to maintaining a learner-centred approach and designing content around individual learner needs. Written Off? National Adult Literacy Agency, Ireland 16 Since 2000, the National Adult Literacy Agency ( 198 ) in Ireland (NALA) has been using television ( 199 ) to highlight literacy issues, outline supports that are available, motivate people to return to education, and provide opportunities for learning in the privacy of the learners\u2019 homes through the Distance Learning Service ( 200 ). One such TV programme was \u2018Written off?\u2019, an eight-part series that followed 11 adults who returned to learning, and showed the benefits it has had on their lives.

        "and provided the option of accreditation for interested learners. Provision of literacy tuition in Ireland is mainly carried out by the 33 Vocational Education Committees (VECs). NALA\u2019s only role in provision is around its Distance Learning Service, so it was unusual for NALA to be delivering face- to-face tuition in this instance. 2. Find participants: NALA conducted a series of interviews with local literacy providers around the country to identify 25 potential participants from different socio-economic backgrounds and age groups who wanted to acquire education accreditation at Level 2 standards in the National Qualifications Framework for Ireland ( 210 ). 3. Partner with a TV production company: NALA partnered with Animo, a leading production com- pany, and set up interviews for them to meet the different literary centres, present what they wanted to do, and interview interested learners. 4. Select an experienced literacy practitioner: NALA selected a practitioner who assessed the learning needs of the potential participants, and produced a list of people who were at the right literacy level. 5. Select a tutoring team: NALA and Animo jointly selected two experienced VEC-based tutors, who did the tutoring on the programme. They also selected an organiser who supported the tutors and learners. 6. Finalise participations: NALA selected 11 par- ticipants in conjunction with Animo. All 11 learn- ers opted to work towards an accredited award. 7. Test programme: A Media Advisory Group, com- prised of representatives from RT\u00c9, the TV pro- duction company, the Department of Education and Skills, and NALA, as well as students and learners, was set up to meet three or four times during the broadcast period of the show. The group saw the programme before it was broad- cast, and provided feedback which was then taken on board. 8. Support during broadcast: During the broad- cast, a free telephone number and website ( 211 ) were provided. Callers to the number were either directed to local literacy services or allocated to a Distance Education Tutor ( 212 ). In addition, the website allowed people to watch each pro- gramme whenever it suited them ( 213 ). Promotion (cid:2) Cooperation with An Post ( 214 ) : NALA coordinated with An Post for promotional activities. An Post is Ireland\u2019s national postal provider and a major com- mercial organisation providing a wide range of ser- vices which encompass postal, communication, retail and financial services. An Post researched, developed and funded an advertising campaign to encourage those with literacy and numeracy difficulties to contact NALA\u2019s freephone support line ( 215 ). Whenever NALA had a TV series that was to be broadcast, An Post bought advertising space around the programme\u2019s slot and aired their adver- tisements at that time, as well as bought sponsor- ship opportunities with the programmes. (cid:2) Radio: NALA took part in interviews with local and national radio stations. (cid:2) TV: NALA participated in afternoon TV talk shows on national stations, sometimes alongside adult learners who had appeared on the show. (cid:2) Promotion by Written Off? participants: NALA organised interviews on TV, radio and in print with the learners from Written Off? (cid:2) Other: NALA also used its website, sent e-mails to local literacy authorities and mailed flyers to libraries and local employment services. Social media was not used at the time of Written Off? because it was not as prevalent at the time, but is now being used for a new Adult Learning TV series. Key messages (cid:2) There is free educational support available in your community. (cid:2) Education can be in a non-formal enjoyable envi- ronment: it does not have to be in a school. (cid:2) Educational accreditation is available for learners at Level 2. (cid:2) Literacy problems should not always be associ- ated with negative aspects: the role models on Written Off? have been very successful in other fields of life, such as in their marriages, the work- place, etc. Results of the activity (cid:4) All 11 learners on the programme achieved a Level 2 Certificate in General Learning. (cid:4) The course tutors and NALA supported the learn- ers individually for the continuation of their learning. Nine of the eleven learners enrolled in additional adult learning courses within a short time of finishing filming of Written Off? ( 216 ).

The ads focus on the benefits of returning to further education, as well as demonstrating that this issue is not confined to any particular demographic segment. An Post later developed a series of radio advertisements \u2018words and numbers\u2019 to accompany the campaign. (216) In addition, two of the students set up their own businesses: a flower shop and a pizzeria. Another two became taxi drivers following successful completion of the appropriate written tests, something they would have been unable to do previously. NC3112514ENC_002.pdf 77 25/07/12 16:14 ",
        "(cid:4) All learners demonstrated significant improve- ment in their reading, writing, numeracy and technology skills. They also showed progress in terms of setting goals, making decisions and self confidence. (cid:4) The programme was featured as 'Pick of the Week' in the TV section of five major Irish newspapers. (cid:4) Written Off? was featured on The Late Late Show \u2013 the first time that adult literacy and learning had received such high-profile coverage. (cid:4) There was an increase in the number of calls for information to the DLS from May to July 2008. (cid:4) Written Off? was run on a prime time slot in May/ June 2008, and attracted an average of 210 000 viewers a week, which was 14 % of the view- ing public. The largest numbers of viewers came from the farming community and people over the age of 55, both traditionally hard-to-reach groups. (cid:4) The viewership of Written Off? increased from week to week. (cid:4) The show has provided an incentive to NALA to explore other means of interacting with TV view- ers. This includes collaborating with TV networks to see whether digital broadcasting services could be used to include web content in the pro- gramme, such as having viewers press a button to send an e-mail for more information. Lessons learnt from the activity (cid:4) Reinforce positive messages: It was very important for NALA to highlight that adult learn- ing should not be stereotyped or associated with baseless negative perceptions. Participants selected for Written Off? were successful in other fields of their life, be it in their personal life, workplace, community (as leaders), etc. Improving their literacy (reading, writing, spell- ing) and numeracy skills, was thus promoted as a way of complementing their personal develop- ment and life achievements. (cid:4) Use mass media: If budgetary constraints per- mit, mass media such as radio and television should be used. Written Off? enjoyed an audi- ence of 200 000 visitors each week; similarly, if properly implemented, mass media has the abil- ity to reach people across different socio-eco- nomic and demographic backgrounds. (cid:4) Use innovative methods/partners to increase visibility: Initially, NALA approached An Post to see whether they could provide free postage for any information packages to be sent to prospec- tive learners. An Post could not do so; however, it proposed extensive promotional opportunities for Written Off? NALA found that its cooperation with An Post was as profitable as it led to an increased profile of both Written Off? and An Post. (cid:4) Show real learning situations: Written Off? shows a group of adults who have returned to learning, and participate in a course, which was held in a classroom. By using actual learning sit- uations in class, potential learners can under- stand what it would be like should they choose to return to education. (cid:4) Make content accessible: The learners for Written Off? were selected from a cross section of the population with regard to age, location, school experiences, and socio-economic back- ground. The series content also related to real- life situations, such as budgeting for a meal. This meant that viewers of different backgrounds could watch the show and identify with the learn- ers, and consequently be inspired by them and take up a learning option (cid:4) Account for adult learners\u2019 needs: Whilst Written Off? was developed in an entertain- ing way that would engage with viewers as well as entice potential learners to enter education, it was always important to adhere to the basic principles of respecting adult learners, as well as design content around individual learners needs. This ensures that in no situation could learners or their journeys be ridiculed. (cid:4) Become a provider of education: NALA became an accredited provider of education in order to be able to provide the training. It demonstrated that education did not have to be limited to formal pro- viders such as schools and universities; any organ- isations with the ability to deliver education and gain accreditation can become an adult educa- tion provider. Since Written Off?, NALA has also received funding for and delivered a very suc- cessful learning programme directly targeting the labour market, particularly learners who have been unemployed for three months or longer.

        "(cid:4) Provide support during and after activ- ity: During the broadcast of the show, call- ers to the freephone number provided were either directed to local literacy services, or allo- cated to a Distance Education Tutor. The tutor, who was a trained adult literacy practitioner, called the person back at a convenient time, con- ducted an initial assessment, and for as long as was required, using print, web content and other materials. This allowed the show to work as an immediate call to action with a tangible benefit. (cid:4) Establish an advisory group: By establishing a committee to monitor and evaluate the pro- gress and results of the activity, it can be ensured that the activity can be adapted at each step. For this to be effective, the advisory group would have to comprise of representatives from each stake- holder group involved in the process of develop- ment and implementation of the programme. (cid:4) Involve learners in promotional activities: By involving learners themselves in promotional activities, they can share firsthand what their learning experience was. Potential learners can therefore get an idea directly from existing learn- ers as to what their return to learning experience would be. (cid:4) Measure soft skills: As a result of participation in Written Off?, it was reported that the learners\u2019 confidence levels rose. It is therefore important to develop measurements that would chart the progress of learners\u2019 soft skills. This would also help in the development of future programmes, allowing for all-round learning.

Objectives: Touring across major European cities, the bus would operate in venues with high potential of attraction and provide information on available formal and non-formal learning opportunities. Interested learners could be given information on where to access funding or find mentoring on learning options. Development and promotion: The bus would be fitted with PC stations and Internet connection to facilitate access to resourc- es and interactive learning tools, such as games. Visits should be planned in coordination with local authorities to ease access to facilities, promotion at local level and support from relevant providers. Expected outcome: Attract EU, national and local media coverage; increase public attention on adult learning and promote it in an innovative way; create debate. Title One step up, Mothers! Target groups Adult learners: mothers with childcare age children Executing actor National governments Reference UK Edenred Childcare Vouchers Scheme Description One step up, Mothers! is a government initiative intended to give working mothers and their employers an incentive to use childcare vouchers for training purposes, e.g. vocational courses and professional qualifications. Objectives: Working mothers would benefit from skills upgrading opportunities a(cid:6)er a period of time off work; employers retain and attract workforce by improving quality and training in the workplace. It would help raise awareness on the socio-economic value of vocational training and provide an incentive to invest in it. It would activate learners, providers, public offices and employers to work towards a common goal. Development and promotion: This activity requires concerted effort from public and private sector and thus demands positive changes in structural policies for childcare support and mothers\u2019 re-integration in the labour market. Childcare vouchers would be changed to provide offers and discounts on training courses on top of current offers on everyday shopping, life-style and other products. Promotion from government and voucher providers towards families and employers. Expected outcome: Integrate lifelong learning into practical aspects of adult life.

It would create a bridge between their existing education pursuits and future opportunities, so that the transition would not challenging or off-putting. Development and promotion: Organisers would coordinate with local education providers to determine the enrolment of adult learners, types of courses being pursued, and potential future courses. They would provide this information to adult learners through targeted activities (including fairs, info days, peer-to-peer counselling, networking opportunities). They would also create incentives and deliver information on prospective opportunities upon completion of courses. Expected outcome: Adult education would become a journey for learners instead of a one-off experience. Title Language for Incomers Target groups Adult learners Executing actor National, regional or local governments Reference European Conference on Migrants' Language Skills Description This would be a country or region-wide programme to help newcomers, ranging from asylum- seekers to foreign workers, acquire national language skills through publicly provided and funded language courses. The primary target group would be groups at risk of illiteracy or social exclu- sion. The programme would be available regionally and would be implemented by regional and local authorities, directing learners towards the affiliated education providers. Objectives: The goal of the activity would be to equip incomers with national language skills to facilitate assimilation and employment. Development and promotion: Organisers would conduct a needs assessment at national level to determine the areas where language courses for incomers are most needed. They would conduct research on incomers and establish criteria which define and classify the different groups at risk. The next step would be to source education providers that have the capacity to run language courses for foreigners on an ongoing basis. National and regional governments would also have to make public funding available. They would need to promote language courses and their benefits at institutions that incomers are most likely to turn to (e.g. migration offices, employment agencies, etc.). Expected outcome: Incomers would have acquired necessary language skills which could prevent them from social exclusion and enable them to actively engage in the employment market.

It would see adults creating Individual Development Accounts (IDAs). For every euro that they would deposit in their IDA, the Save and Learn programme would match with the same or higher amount. The funds would then be used by participants for activities in the field of adult education and training, including computer literacy courses, business school, and in the acquisition of trade skills. The organising parties would also provide support in the form of financial advice and management. Objectives: The activity would encourage the uptake of education courses by low income adults by making access to funds easier. Development and promotion: The national ministries in each country would partner with interested agencies to develop the programme and source funding. They would also have to identify local financial institutions that would be willing to offer an IDA account. The programme would first require a rollout phase with a small portion of the target audience, in order to test the effectiveness and economic viability of the programme. Expected outcome: Encourage adult learning amongst participants by making funding available through matched savings. Title Learning through subtitling Target groups Adult learners Executing actor TV Networks funded through national governments Reference PlanetRead Description The activity would take popular songs, stories and soap operas and subtitle them. This would help people learn to identify words and therefore read. The songs and stories are first recounted out loud along with the captioning, and then it is presented without the reading voice, so that people may read the words themselves. The songs and stories are filmed using real world foot- age of people and animals acting out the individual scenes that incorporate the words envisioned to be learned. The words are presented in a manner to help people derive the meaning. For example, the word \u2018stripes\u2019 is written in stripes, and the word \u2018big\u2019 is bigger than the other words in the captioning. The stories and songs also contain rhyming and repetition, which also help people master reading. Objectives: The activity would help learners to improve their reading skills and broaden their overall vocabulary. Development and promotion: National governments would identify and approach publicly funded national TV networks. They would conduct research on national level to determine appropriate songs, stories and possible soap operas to be adapted to subtitling. They would develop audiovisual material that helps learners to understand the new words. The activity would be promoted through the official TV network channels. Expected outcome: Learners including immigrants would broaden their vocabulary and improve their reading skills. Social exclusion would be mitigated and employment skills enhanced.

Objectives: The activity would encourage providers of adult education to reach targets set by national govern- ments. It would close the gap between provision of courses addressing national needs or challenges and the demand for them. Development and promotion: Organisers would publish public reports based on research, specifically addressing the skills and labour shortages and national priority areas of development. Reports could be issued by theme or learning field, e.g. level of digital learning, numeracy skills, vocational training, education for marginalised groups, etc. Reports should be developed keeping in mind information that is perti- nent for NGOs and education providers. Promotion would be supported by national governments and sectoral organisations/employers, which have a vested interest in the uptake of the courses. Expected outcome: Development of educational programmes and courses that address national labour and skills shortages. Title The Adult Education Funding Network Target groups NGOs, regional/local policy makers, education providers Executing actor National governments Reference A Funding guide for Adult Learning Description This would be an official platform established by national governments to keep stakeholders with- in the adult learning community up-to-date with national project-based funding opportunities. Objectives: The activity would create one central storage location managed at a national lever, where infor- mation on all nationally available funding opportunities would be stored, easily accessible for stakeholders involved in the development of programmes to either deliver or raise awareness of adult learning. Development and promotion: Funding may be issued by governments or foundations interested in advertising their grants. The idea would be that organisations seeking to develop engagement activities/campaigns for learn- ers could directly access a single platform where funding opportunities are compiled together. Expected outcome: Improve access and ensure that available funds are used. NC3112514ENC_002.pdf 89 25/07/12 16:14 ",

These would serve as learning or advice/counselling centres on suitable formal or non-formal educational opportunities avail- able locally. Trainers and advisors would receive ad-hoc training and the promotion would be run locally through events and face-to-face meeting opportunities. The activity would be conducted in connection with women\u2019s centres, faith groups, and civil society organisations working in the field. Objectives: The aim of the activity would be to minimise women from being excluded socially and increase their competitiveness on the employment market by providing them with information on and opportunities for non-formal learning in their area. Development and promotion: Organisers would conduct research on a local level with social workers, education providers, civil society organisations, established women\u2019s centres and local employment agencies to identify suitable formal and non-formal learning opportunities that also meet local skills demand. They would create incentives and supply information on opportunities upon receiving further educa- tion. They would also set up advisory training for people envisaged to work in these centres in conjunction with organisations already working in the field. They would then promote the existence of the women empowerment centres at local events, through face-to-face counselling sessions and through a local poster campaign. Expected outcome: Women faced by social exclusion would receive advice and information on local learning opportunities that would provide them with the skills necessary to increase their individual employment chances. Title Adult Learning Partner Provider Target groups NGOs, education providers, social partners Executing actor National governments Reference N/A Description This is intended to be a social network or integrated section of an existing website with a search function to identify potential partners interested in cooperating in adult learning projects at national level. The platform will mainly target organisations developing or executing programmes and will serve them to quickly screen and identify appropriate partners for independently initiated activities or to respond to publicly funded (EU or national) calls. The target would thus comprise of stakeholders from different categories and it be open for registration to all those with an inter- est and capacity to contribute to the adult education sector (provider, private enterprise, media organisation, etc.). Objectives: The activity will assist organisations wishing to run adult learning programmes to find suitable partners based on geographic regions, areas of specialisations. Development and promotion: National administrations would develop an online platform or social media forum, open to stake- holders working in the field of adult education. Organisations and individuals wishing to use the platform would need to register, providing information such as their geographical location, their specific business areas and expertise, and examples of programmes or campaigns they have run in the past. Stakeholders interested in developing a new programme or campaign could visit the platform, and through the use of a search function, locate contact information for suitable partners in their region. The platform would be promoted on the adult learning pages of national administration and ministries websites. Expected outcome: Finding partners to develop adult education programmes or campaigns would be facilitated. A second potential outcome (especially if the platform involves a forum aspect) is for there to be a community of best practices. NC3112514ENC_002.pdf 90 25/07/12 16:14 ",

It is based on a Triad Model encompassing three key points of information access for such groups and aims at developing working and cooperation structures among such points, which consist of: (i) Social services; (ii) Employment offices; and (iii) local councils / authorities. Objectives: This would make funding accessible to the access points working with marginalised groups, to identify innovative ways to make education available. Development and promotion: National administrations from countries with substantially large groups of marginalised groups would develop and implement the funding programme. They would issue a call for proposals to each of the three access points, which would have to demonstrate implementable ideas for the exploration of adult education targeted to marginalised groups. Upon grant of funding, the programme would be implemented. Expected outcome: Increased development of innovative ideas for the implementation of adult education amongst marginalised groups. Title Addressing skill gaps in the workplace Target groups Employers, SMEs, business associations Executing actor National, regional or local governments Reference Workplace Guidance Description This would be a government-initiated programme targeting employers, to understand the em- ployers\u2019 key needs in the workplace, major educational gaps of (potential) employees, skills short- ages etc., and to help employers address these needs. Objectives: The activity would encourage employers to promote education in the workplace to their employees. It would help employees improve their skills and education in order to make the workplace more efficient. Development and promotion: Organisers must work with employer and employee associations, using of teams of ambassa- dors, counsellors and education experts that would engage employers in face-to-face meetings. The information collected would then be used to direct employers towards the most appropriate/ suited vocational centres where employees could be sent. Expected outcome: Employers would be more involved in the education of their employees, thereby improving com- pany productivity. NC3112514ENC_002.pdf 91 25/07/12 16:14 ",

The needs assessment would be used to discuss how vocational training offers should be changed/reformed to better suit market place needs. Objectives: The activity would solicit employer and trade union input to better customise vocational training offers. Development and promotion: Regional and local governments, through funding provided at national level, would interact with employers in the region and solicit their opinions on existing skills gaps and what types of train- ing courses are required to help the workforce skill up. This would be the basis of a conversation with education providers, to help them develop relevant courses that are likely to have a higher rate of uptake. Expected outcome: Development and participation in relevant vocational training courses that are matched to mar- ket requirements. Title Investor in Workplace Education Award Target groups Employers Executing actor National and regional governments Reference N/A Description This activity would aim to recognise the outstanding investments of employers in training their staff, by providing funding for continuing education or on-the-job training opportunities. It could specifically target small and medium-sized enterprises, giving them a tangible award, which would reward and incentivise them to make a sustainable investment in their people by using innovative training solutions available on the market. It would be promoted using print and online media, central and local government business networks, chambers of commerce, etc. Objectives: The key goal would be to incentivise employers operating SMEs to commence or continue provid- ing adult education opportunities or on-the-job training, and to engage themselves in sustainable investment in people. Development and promotion: The award scheme would be developed by national or regional governments. These would set ap- propriate selection criteria, participation incentives (financial or recognition based), and rewards. Information on the award scheme would be distributed through central and local government business networks, trade unions, and chambers of commerce via newsletters, website banners or online forums, as well as through the online and print media. Expected outcome: Employers are encouraged to proactively invest in continuing learning opportunities for employ- ees thereby increasing the competitiveness of SMEs through qualified, skilled and productive staff capable of meeting fast changing customer and market requirements.

Employers can use these tools as a guide to advocate for programmes that better meet workforce needs. Objectives: The aim of this activity is to supply employers with: an overview of existing courses at local level; access to training resources and best practice examples of employer input with regards to adult education programme content; and secure employer commitment to invest in adult learning and in the development of training programmes tailored to current needs. Development and promotion: Policy makers would need to conduct a needs assessment at national level with chambers of commerce as well as industry and education providers to identify skills gaps, suitable self- assessment tools and best practice examples of employer involvement in developing effective adult education programme content. Chambers of commerce and other stakeholders who are in regular contact with employers would promote the handbook at targeted events such as fairs, info days, networking opportunities and through announcements on websites of trade unions and chambers of commerce. Expected outcome: Employers would continue to depend on adult learning as a tool for ensuring a highly skilled and knowledgeable workforce. Individuals would engage in programmes as a means for upward career mobility, job enhancements and enriched quality of life. Title Gain at Work Target groups Employers and adult learners (employees) Executing actor National governments Reference National Learning at Work Day Description This campaign aims at encouraging older workers to stay longer in the labour market instead of retiring early. It targets employers as it aims to give them financial and operational incentives to retain older workers, offering them more flexible arrangements, including part-time work, with the rest of their time being used to train new workers on the job in order to ensure knowledge transfer and more efficient learning. Objectives: The activity aims to allow employers to keep their existing employees on staff, and pass on their knowledge to new workers. Development and promotion: This project would require extensive changes in structural policies and review incentive systems to keep people longer in the workplace.

Title Cooperation with Secondary Schools Target groups Adult learners: young adults in secondary schools Executing actor Local governments, NGOs Reference N/A Description This activity would see national institutes of adult learning, in cooperation with local govern- ments, working with secondary schools in areas with low education rates to provide personalised support to avoid existing young adults entering the vicious circle of low participation in adult learning. Objectives: The activity would target disadvantaged groups of young adults to help them continue learning through their lives. Development and promotion: Local governments would support NGOs in the identification of secondary schools in areas that have lower education rates. They would cooperate with these schools to identify disadvantaged groups of adults at an early stage of their development. These groups face the risk of leaving education at an early age, as well as not participating in adult education in their future. They would therefore be provided with personal support to impress upon them the value of educa- tion, both currently and as adults. This support would be in the form of workshops, seminars and similar activities to be held at the secondary schools. Expected outcome: Students in secondary school would be more likely to stay in secondary school and join adult education in the future. NC3112514ENC_002.pdf 95 25/07/12 16:14 ",

Public health profes- sionals, nurses and educators from cross-cutting disciplines would need to be engaged to train individuals affected by chronic diseases on how to self-manage their condition, preventative action, and healthy life-style. Objectives: The key goal of the activity would be to enable the elderly and chronically ill to read, understand and use healthcare information to help them make decisions and follow instructions regarding their individual treatments. Development and promotion: This activity requires concerted effort from public health professionals, nurses, and public and private education providers to give and receive training on how to teach health literacy to the elderly and chronically ill. Training course content would need to be developed by education pro- viders in close cooperation with health professionals and nurses based on a needs assessment. Additionally, suitable participants that have experience in training others need to be sourced. Training can be delivered at local practices and or hospitals. Promotion would need to come from national health ministries including regional and or local governments. Expected outcome: Increased health literacy amongst the elderly and chronically ill to reduce health disparities, increased quality of life of the target group, and reduced economic burden on national health care systems. Title Education in Prisons Target groups Adult learners: offenders Executing actor Policy makers, adult learners, ex-offender associations Reference Kha Ri Gude Mass Literacy Campaign case study Description The programme would target offenders under probation and parole supervision. It consists of skilled offenders teaching other offenders through a liberal non-formal approach. Objectives: The activity would cultivate offenders\u2019 interest in education implementing a bottom-up approach; stimulate intellectual skills, peer-to-peer knowledge transfer and teamwork; and facilitate re- integration in society in the long-term. Development and promotion: Organisers need to conduct an ex-ante needs assessment and evaluate potential for develop- ing an adult-to-adult learning programme. They should establish a structure/space for learning and information access point for coordination. They also have to host orientation workshops and provide further practical information for leavers on where and how initiated informal learning activities could be pursued out of prison. Expected outcome: Convey to offenders the advantages of education, and improve their ability to re-integrate into society in the long-term. NC3112514ENC_002.pdf 96 25/07/12 16:14 ",

Objectives: Encourage adults to enter learning, by following examples of well known celebrities, who endorse learning, and have participated in the learning process themselves. Development and promotion: NGOs would identify local organisations such as publishers, sports leagues, arts councils etc., which would be willing to participate in a programme, whereby one or more celebrities from their organisation would be appointed an Ambassador for Adult Learning. This ambassador would also be adult learners, who entered learning at a later age in life, either to improve their literacy, or to skill-up. The programme would be funded by DG EAC. The programme would comprise of group learning sessions at locations such as the local library. It could be promoted through a public relations campaign targeting local newspapers, encouraging them to cover the \u2018events\u2019 in order to increase participation in future sessions. Ambassadors would be encouraged to tell their stories of success to local magazines and newspapers, and learners would also be encouraged to share their experiences.

Objectives: The activity would identify perceptions and attitudes towards current educational offers and adult education in general. It would involve potential learners in defining obstacles to access and chan- nels to improve participation rates. Development and promotion: The forum would bring together potential learners, senior students and community learners to discuss how to promote learning more successfully and what structural changes/incentives are needed to overcome existing barriers. It would be organised according to pre-defined socio- demographic groups and include focus group sessions to stimulate open but structured debate. Promote using internal community and education providers\u2019 channels. Expected outcome: Use communication research techniques to support structural reforms in the way education is proposed to adults, and create an evidence base for its development. Title All You Need to Know About Volunteering Target groups Adult learners: older Executing actor NGOs Reference N/A Description It is important to ensure that the elderly section of the population remains active, and is still part of mainstream society, in order for them to be both mentally and physically healthy. Encouraging them to volunteer will achieve this, and provide them with a feeling of self-worth as they con- tinue the acquisition of skills and share their knowledge with their local community. Example: The Red Cross in Belgium organises volunteering for interested participants in locations such as hospitals. Objectives: The aim of the activity is to keep the aging population active, and encourage them to share their knowledge and skills with their communities. Development and promotion: Local NGOs and civil society organisations would cooperate to develop a handbook targeted towards older adults, with information on local volunteering opportunities available to them, as well as its benefits. In liaison with local government offices and town halls, a list of seniors in each community would be identified, and the handbook would specifically be sent to them. There would be an information line available for anyone who wanted to call for more information. Expected outcome: Older citizens would be more informed on volunteering opportunities available in their local com- munities, and encouraged to take up these activities.

Parents therefore need to be educated about the various types of media available, the advantages and disadvantages of each, and what they need to teach their children. This activity would therefore see the development and distribution of a \"Parents\u2019 Toolbox\" containing informa- tion and advice about positive and safe media use. Objectives: The aim of the activity is to help parents learn about media literacy, and provide them with information that would let them educate their children on how to keep safe while interacting with the media. Development and promotion: National NGOs would cooperate with national governments and businesses in the field of media, and develop an information package for parents on (1) types of media; (2) what each media type consists of, and main tools of each; (3) advantages and disadvantages of using each type of media; (4) risks these media pose to their children; and (5) steps that parents can take to mitigate the risk. The information would be made available online on NGOs and national govern- ment\u2019s websites. Expected outcome: Parents would be better informed on media literacy, and could keep their children safer both online and offline. Title Digital literacy week Target groups Adult learners Executing actor NGOs, national governments Reference IT: 5th Digital Literacy Week in Italy Description Digital literacy can help adults improve their skills for the workplace and make them more em- ployable. It also integrates them into day to day society, given the emphasis now placed on online media. This activity would therefore encourage adults to go to their neighbourhood community organisations, and acquire basic computer skills, learn how to send emails, and browse the web. Objectives: The aim of the activity is to enable adults to improve their knowledge about media literacy, and increase their skills in the use of digital tools. Development and promotion: NGOs cooperating with national governments would organise and develop a national Digital Literacy Week to be held in conjunction with local libraries, schools, cultural centres. The facilities would include opportunities for training and provision of mini computer courses, which would make participants familiar with the basics of digital literacy. The programme would be promoted through flyers, posters and radio spots, specifically targeting areas where populations have lower digital literacy levels, which would be identified in conjunction with national ministries of labour. Expected outcome: Adults enabled to use computers with more ease than previously, and would encourage them to enrol in classes that would further improve their digital literacy. This would further allow them to improve their workplace skills. NC3112514ENC_002.pdf 100 25/07/12 16:14 ",

The idea is based on job information days which are frequently held in schools to educate pupils about future career possibilities. Objectives: The activity would provide information on skills necessary for developing a new career or improve already existing skills to further individual development. Promotion and development: Community organisations would resource community members able and willing to share their experience and knowledge. This would be promoted through flyers and on notice boards in local supermarkets. Information about local adult learning opportunities would be provided on the day. Expected outcomes: Community members would receive information on required skills and potentially enrol in local adult learning courses to learn new skills. Additionally, the sense of community life would be reinforced, improving the overall quality of life for everybody. Title Partner with public service providers Target groups Adult learners Executing actor National adult learning institutes, public and online service providers Reference N/A Description The idea of this activity is to reach new adult learners through new incentives. By partnering for example with public transport providers, adult learners could potentially pay a reduced fee for their public transport pass if they are enrolled in an adult learning institution. Partnerships would also be sought with online service providers such as online news (press) or entertainment (music, movies) to promote adult learning in the form of a catchy and entertaining video clip or similar. Objectives: The aim of the activity would be to create partnerships with public and online service providers to create new incentives and raise awareness of adult learning. Development: National institutes would develop partnerships with public service providers to determine incen- tives that are interesting to them and have a big impact on the general public. They would secure public funding and or sponsors for developing audiovisual awareness raising material and for renting public advertisement space. If the audiovisual material is particularly captivating, the promotion would be supported through a viral Internet campaign. Expected outcome: More people would become aware of the added benefits of adult learning and possibly sign up to relevant courses. An impactful video could go viral and captivate the entire nation and even spread across boarders. NC3112514ENC_002.pdf 101 25/07/12 16:14 ",

For example: At a food festival, local cooking classes or related print material such as cooking books would be promoted; at a music festival adult learning courses that relate to learning an instrument or learning the skills to become a sound technician or a stage designer would be promoted, etc. Objectives: The aim of the activity is to raise awareness about local and regional adult learning opportunities and their added benefit. Development and promotion: National institutes would source upcoming festivals, and recruit a small number of educational providers relevant to the topic of the festival. Promotion could be made through partly sponsoring the relevant festivals and through advertisement space in local papers and on the radio. Expected outcome: Festival goers will become aware of adult learning opportunities where they can improve their knowledge and develop new skills. Title Take a Walk Through History Target groups Adult learners: low income Executing actor NGOs, local governments, museums and cultural organisations Reference Palace Explorers case study Description This activity would try to increase foot traffic in museums, by encouraging adults to visit their local museums through offering reductions and incentives. Increased knowledge and awareness about one\u2019s history and culture can make a person feel more integrated in their society and could lead to improved social cohesion. Objectives: The activity would encourage adult learners from low income households to visit their local mus- eum with their families, and improve their knowledge and interest in history. Development and promotion: Local governments would coordinate with NGOs and community organisations to identify low income households, who would form the primary target groups. They would then coordinate with museums and other cultural organisations to develop an incentive programme to encourage visits, such as reduced ticket prices, family package deals, etc. Information on these offers would be disseminated by community organisations, as well as by the museums through their websites and other promotional materials. This offer would also be made available to the general public, but its primary target group would be adults in low income areas. Expected outcome: Increased knowledge about history and culture in low income areas. Creation of a habit/culture of visiting museums and other historical and cultural places of interest. Feeling of a sense of belonging to society. NC3112514ENC_002.pdf 102 25/07/12 16:14 ",

Objectives: The activity would supply education providers with an overview of what adult learners think of existing courses in each subject area. It would overview what learners feel is missing from the education offer, and offer recommendations on the types of courses that providers could consider delivering. Development and promotion: Organisers would conduct research at local level with learners who have participated in courses at their educational institutions. They would also survey the general public to identify potential learners who express an interest in pursuing education. Organisers would gauge their opinions on existing education offers, and what they would ideally be looking for from education providers. This research should be provided free of charge to education providers, alongside information on available funding for the development of new courses. Expected outcome: Raised awareness amongst education providers\u2019 of learners\u2019 need and how their offer could bet- ter match demand. Title Building Capacity for Adult Learning Target groups NGOs, community organisations Executing actor National Institutes for Adult Learning Reference R\u00e9unir pour mieux agir case study Description This would be a training initiative implemented by organisations with experience in develop- ing campaigns to promote adult education. It would target institutions that need to strengthen communications and skills to roll-out campaigns, focusing on those with high potential of local engagement but low resources. It could also include regional and local level policy makers wish- ing to refine their skills. Objectives: The activity would teach NGOs and other organisations communications skills for the promo- tion and dissemination of programmes that raise awareness of adult education. It could create a community of NGOs that share best practices beyond the life of the training programme. Development and promotion: Training programmes should be developed by national institutes that have access to communi- cations experts, and prior experience executing nation wide campaigns, and involve elements of best practice. The activity could be organised in seminar or workshop packages. It would be pro- moted during the course of regular interaction with NGOs and other community organisations. Expected outcome: Empowerment of NGOs, community organisations to successfully promote their programmes, and reach a wider range of potential learners or policy makers.

With funding from national governments, they would be able to develop communications toolkits for smaller organisations that would include operational tools, strategy ideas, potential messages, tips on developing networks and selecting partners, and information on financing and budgeting. Objectives: The activity would provide smaller organisations with the basic information and tools needed to run successful communications campaigns. Development and promotion: National governments would coordinate with national institutes of adult learning, and fund the development of toolkits targeted to local organisations that wish to execute communications campaigns. The toolkit would be made available online, but organisations wishing to access it would need to register first. This would also provide national institutes and governments with a database of actors in the field. The toolkit would be promoted on the websites of national insti- tutes and local governments. National governments would also make the research results about target groups available to the participating organisations. Expected outcome: Smaller organisations are empowered to run their own communications campaigns. Campaigns would be more targeted and efficient. Title Lobbying/Writing to MPs and MEPs Target groups MEPs Executing actor General public, national adult learning institutes Reference N/A Description Writing to MPs and MEPs would aim to increase the exposure of adult learning, and encourage further public funding from them. It is generally be more effective to contact Parliamentarians by email or postal letter. Many MEPs still measure public opinion on an issue by the number of letters they get about it. Objective: The goal is to raise awareness amongst MPs/MEPs about the added benefits of adult learning to secure greater public exposure. Development and promotion: National adult learning institutes would conduct research on relevant MPs/MEP\u2019s who can act as impactful facilitators. They would carry out local needs assessment to determine the issues that the general public would like to voice to these Parliamentarians. They would then determine local people and relevant national adult learning institutions that are willing and are capable of writ- ing to them. The activity would be promoted during local festivals and job fairs, where it is also possible to promote adult learning and the opportunities that are already in place and those that require additional support and funding. Expected outcome: Public exposure of adult learning, its added benefits and available opportunities would be height- ened. More people would become aware of adult learning opportunities and subscribe to courses or help develop tailored ones to local needs. Additional public funding would be secured.

This activity encourages youth to teach elders how to surf the web. Objective: The key goal would be to activate older generations, bringing them closer to ICT and the Internet. It targets elders with basic IT skills but no experience in using the web and seeks to make them more capable of leading an autonomous life. Development and promotion: Teams of volunteer youth would be responsible for teaching elders key web skills, showing them the functionality and positive impact it could have on their daily life (e.g. scheduling appoint- ments, finding stores, planning trips). Schools could be used as delivery centres for the courses using existing infrastructures. Youth could be engaged in the activity as part of extracurricular assignments and promotion would be done using links between school students and families. Expected outcome: Promote learning of ICT in an informal, cost-effective and interactive way; foster dialogue, exchange and solidarity between generations. Title Adult Learning Abroad Target groups Adult learners Executing actor Education providers Reference Leonardo da Vinci Programme Description This consists of a programme encouraging adult learners enrolled in a formal or non-formal course (e.g. mature students or adults taking part in vocational courses) to move abroad in a partner learning institution for a few months. It could be implemented as part of the Grundtvig programme and be administered by each education provider locally. The education provider would also be in charge of advertising and promoting these options to enrolled learners. The pro- gramme is expected to create a strong network of learners/individuals with positive and strong learning abroad experience, potentially including foreign languages skills. Objective: The activity aims to provide adult learners with language skills and helps them to gain new knowledge and qualifications in order to boost their overall competitiveness on the European labour market. Development and promotion: Local education providers should seek suitable partners abroad and establish exchange pro- grammes. Simultaneously, local host families would need to be sourced to provide boarding. Learning institutions need to create incentives and deliver information directly to learners (e.g. via institution website and programme catalogues) and through targeted activities such as info days. The activity would be promoted locally where recruitment is taking place. In addition, providers could link with services such as EURES, highlighting the possibility of skills gained abroad. EURES and similar partner organisations could publicise this initiative on their respective platforms. Expected outcome: (1) Course participants would have learned the basics of a foreign language and broadened their individual skills (e.g. flexibility, social interaction, etc.). (2) A variety of success stories from adult learners having mastered a foreign language and adapted to cultural differences would be collected that could be at targeted events to promote life-long learning to adults as part of a PR campaigns.

This activity would engage both education providers (encouraging them to hold online classes) and adult learners, specifically men (encouraging them to participate). Objectives: Education providers and NGOs would develop compelling, cost-effective virtual education solu- tions (online classes) to amplify an existing curriculum, vocational training or to create new models for engaged, collaborative learning that will equip adult learners with new skills thereby improving learners\u2019 quality of life and counteracting social exclusion. Development and promotion: Developers of the activity would conduct research at local level with education providers and learners who have previously participated in online courses or are thinking about subscribing to one in the future to determine learners\u2019 needs and how these can be matched. The research should focus on learning activities that would specifically interest men, as they would be more comfortable in an information personalised learning situation. The activity would be promoted on the virtual campus using the education provider and civil society organisations\u2019 channels. Expected outcome: Online courses would become an accessible activity for adult men who engage in social media platforms. Title Language courses in new Member States Target groups Adult learners, education providers Executing actor Education providers, NGOs Reference N/A Description Language courses in new Member States would provide adult learners with the opportunity to become proficient in official EU languages, which would increase their overall employability and facilitate assimilation and integration of migrant workers and EU citizens wishing to live and work in other EU Member States. Example: Teach English in Poland, because Polish people are interested in going to the UK, and therefore have motivation to go to classes. Objectives: The activity would aim to equip adult learners in new EU Member States with language skills to increase their competitiveness on the European employment market. Development and promotion: Local education providers would present their language programmes at targeted events including job fairs, info days and through their internal communication channels and networks. Additionally, available courses will be promoted using the web, free advertisement space in newspapers and public transport, social media and key multipliers such as trade unions. Expected outcome: Raised awareness and increased participation in local language courses to develop vital language skills necessary for living and employment in other EU Member States.

The aim of this activity is to provide cooking classes and recipes for kids and adults that will teach them about their cultural heritage. The cooking classes will not only recreate traditional recipes but will also explain the cultural roots, developments, influences and changes those dishes have undergone in time. Objectives: Cultural heritage would be introduced to adult learners and kids through cooking classes using traditional recipes and cooking methods. Learners would acquire new skills, become familiar with history and broaden their knowledge through intergenerational classes. Development and promotion: Education providers would resource adults familiar with traditional recipes and cooking methods, willing to be trained to become teachers of \u201chome economics\u201d. These learners would be will- ing to participate in intergenerational cooking classes. They would promote the cooking course through the education provider channels and at local festivals. Expected outcome: Adults would broaden their basic knowledge, acquire new competences and improve their social and communication skills. Title Alternative Learning Experience Target groups Adult learners Executing actor Education providers, national governments Reference BBC First Click, Radio Ecca Description A concept that has recently emerged is the provision of education online, through the use of audi- ovisual tools. The Khan Academy is an example of this new use for technology. It is a website that hosts more than 2,600 micro lectures available for free via video tutorials stored on YouTube, on subjects including mathematics, history, finance, physics, chemistry, biology, astronomy, econom- ics and computer science. Similarly, Stanford University recently began offering a free course on Artificial Intelligence online. The same course is also taught at Stanford University. The online course offers identical materials, assignments and exams, as well as uniform grading systems for online students. Instructors are also made available online. Similarly, through financial support from national governments, universities could begin offering their courses online as well. Objectives: The activity would provide those who are digitally literate with the opportunity to follow courses specifically targeted to adult learners from their own homes. Development and promotion: National governments would identify education institutions that already provide access to cours- es online. Through the provision of national funding, education providers would create teaching materials such as videotapes of lectures, and converting texts into electronic format, making them available online for free to prospective learners, in the form of a structured course of the same quality as the in-class course. They would also develop homework exercises for online learners to complete. Grading could be done through the support of teaching assistants. Online students would receive a letter of completion, as well as a final grade. Promotion of the course would be done through the education provider, and through national institutes of adult learning. Expected outcome: Learners would have access to courses that would otherwise be difficult for them to take, given geographic or financial constraints. NC3112514ENC_002.pdf 107 25/07/12 16:14 ",

Objectives: It aims to encourage continuous personal/educational development throughout life and enhance teaching capacity. It would promote adult learning under a different heading than literacy for low-skilled adults; rather, as a chance for everyone. Development and promotion: Organisers would conduct internal needs assessments through consultations on learning inter- ests, skills gaps and teacher improvement necessities. They would leverage education providers and trade unions\u2019 internal channels to raise teacher awareness of relevant educational opportu- nities, e.g. internal newsletter circulation, subscription to providers\u2019 news. The effort would be to identify and present easy-to-access comprehensive material on courses relevant to the target. This would avoid a mere \u2018information distribution\u2019 exercise whereby relevant opportunities may be lost due to insufficient communication effort. Expected outcome: Raise participation rates in continuing professional education programmes. Title Proficiency in adult education Target groups Adult education professionals Executing actor Education providers Reference N/A Description This programmes aims at considering adult learning as a separate discipline within teachers\u2019 educational curricula and degrees such as education management or other specific courses for education professionals. The goal is to improve quality and skills in the delivery of adult learning programmes and, as it will be attended also by educators not necessarily involved in adult educa- tion, encourage awareness and integration of continuing education into their work. Objectives: This activity aims to improve delivery of adult education programmes and raise awareness amongst educators of adult learning in general. Development and promotion: Education providers would develop specific training and educational courses that enhance a teacher\u2019s ability to deliver courses aimed at adult learners. The a(cid:6)ermath of the course would also see the teachers be recognised as being fully trained in adult education. These teachers would develop specific courses in conjunction with national institutes of adult education and national agencies. There should also be cross-EU (and other member countries of the Grundtvig programme) recognition of the degree, making it easy for those trained in adult education deliv- ery to be geographically mobile. Expected outcome: The training of adult education professionals would be formally recognised through means of a diploma which would be recognised across countries participating in Grundtvig.

Objectives: Provide potential learners in the workplace with easy to access information on professional edu- cation opportunities available to them. Development and promotion: Education providers would reach out to the bigger employers in their region. They would provide information specifically designed for each organisation\u2019s employees, in terms of sectoral skills as well as general education degrees. This could be done through events and information sessions on, for instance, Learning At Work day, which is a recurring national campaign in the UK. Expected outcome: Direct link between employers and education providers. Social partners (e.g. trade unions, employers) Title Skills for Work Target groups Employers Executing actor Trade unions Reference N/A Description This activity envisions trade unions targeting workplaces by sector. It consists of dissemination of print or electronic information on access points for workplace training relevant to the employers\u2019 business sector. The initiative could be complemented with an advisory service on how to fund and implement training in the workplace and could involve face-to-face meetings. Objectives: It aims to make information on sectoral training easy to access for employers. Development and promotion: Sectoral trade unions are in an ideal position to coordinate training and funding opportunities with employers in sectors that require their employees to skill up. They could therefore develop information kits on availability and costs of training for their region. These unions also have lever- age over employers and could lobby for training to be made available as part of work contracts. Expected outcome: Encourage / require employers to provide sector specific training to employees. NC3112514ENC_002.pdf 109 25/07/12 16:14 ",

Ideally, it would be coordinated by the EU-wide association for trade unions (ETUC). It should be structured in a series of subsequent conferences and workshops where staff members from different countries can work together. Objectives: The activity aims to facilitate interaction among trade unions from different countries so as to share ideas on how to reach employers and their employees and involve them in adult learn- ing. It would seek to raise the profile of adult education through a targeted approach for each employment sector. Development and promotion: ETUC would create sectoral based workshops comprising of interested participants, who would meet on an annual or biennial basis, to exchange best practice ideas on what worked in terms of targeting employers and employees to get them involved in adult education in their country. The discussion would circle on identifying replicable actions that could be implemented in countries where awareness raising is less successful. Learnings would come from the exchange of ideas on what worked with trade unions within the same sector, as well as cross sectors. A rapporteur would be appointed to ensure ideas generated at these meetings would be actionable. Expected outcome: Improve the ability of trade unions to reach out to employer associations and its employees, to convince them of the benefits of adult education. Title Unions for Learning Target groups Trade unions Executing actor European Trade Union College (ETUCO) and European Trade Union Institute (ETUI) Reference N/A Description This initiative is intended to favour good practice exchange among trade unions in Europe on how to set-up and run trade union learning centres. Objectives: The aim of the activity is to increase the number of trade union learning centres in Europe. Development and promotion: The activity would be centrally run and implemented by the European Trade Union Institute and its affiliated College. The Institute would invite well-known trade union centres in Europe running learning centres (e.g. SAK in Finland, CISL in Italy) to explain and share their experiences. Expected outcome: Trade unions could establish learning centres and train their union representatives, as well as promote the exchange of best practice. NC3112514ENC_002.pdf 110 25/07/12 16:14 ",

Example: Lire et Ecrire publishes a recipe book, where, in addition to recipes, they provide background information on ingredients. This means that working knowledge is integrated into daily activities. Objectives: The activity aims to encourage adult learners to acquire knowledge, broaden their skills and increase their ability to communicate better through topical literature and books that are used to carry out daily activities. It would also help learners see books as \u2018tools\u2019 which provide practical knowledge and support in daily activities. Development and promotion: National governments would create partnerships with publishers that are publicly funded. They would need to conduct research on themes applicable to daily activities and then coordinate with local authorities to determine optimal storage, distribution and maintenance of books. Finally, they would need to promote them through the channels and networks of local education provid- ers as well as at targeted events such as fairs and info days. Expected outcome: Learners equipped with working knowledge and broaden their skills as well as communication abilities, thereby counteracting social exclusion. Title Reforming Vocational Training Target groups National governments and education providers Executing actor Chambers of Commerce and Business Associations Reference N/A Description Chambers of Commerce and business actors would come together to assess and produce key reports on required national and regional level efforts to align the provision of adult and vocatio- nal education to workforce and skill gaps needs. The project would thus involve a number of busi- ness organisations across different sectors, which would be asked to supply information about the main skill gaps they face. The information would be used to raise awareness through print publications on reform needs and will thus target policy makers and education providers. This initiative, to be managed at national level, would reflect major EU-level undertakings such as the New Skills for New Jobs Agenda, facilitating job offer-labour supply matching. Objectives: Vocational training would be improved by matching training opportunities to skills demand there- by enhancing the employability of adult learners and the competitiveness of businesses. Development and promotion: This activity would require a concerted effort from Chambers of Commerce and key business actors, and demand changes in structural policies for vocational training. They would conduct research on the skills gap with key business organisations and Chambers of Commerce across various sectors. They would also assess feasible reforms and promote them to national policy makers and education providers through media outreach. Expected outcome: Vocational education would be reformed to meet and adapt to the current workforce and skills gaps thereby increasing employability. NC3112514ENC_002.pdf 111 25/07/12 16:14 ",

        "Overview This online stakeholder consultation was in field from 29 March to 26 April 2011. The survey, disseminated to more than 1 500 stakeholders was made availa- ble in six languages: English, French, German, Italian, Polish and Spanish throughout the EU-27, EEA coun- tries, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Turkey. Some 1 808 respondents accessed the survey link. The survey was intended to build upon the findings of previous research activities by further exploring the perspectives of stakeholders with respect to: (cid:99) how adult learning should be promoted; (cid:99) examples of activities that could be cited as best practice in the field of awareness raising of adult learning; (cid:99) specific messages to disseminate when communi- cating on adult learning; (cid:99) identification of which category stakeholders fit in; (cid:99) DG EAC\u2019s existing communications on adult learn- ing; and (cid:99) specific target groups which are key players or actors in the field of adult education. The survey was disseminated to stakeholders in two ways: (cid:99) Direct e-mail to DG EAC\u2019s stakeholder database; and (cid:99) European Lifelong Learning Programme\u2019s National Agencies. Summary of key findings Information and promotion of adult learning at national level: Information on adult education directly supplied to potential learners is made available by a large majority of the organisations participating in the survey (about 83 %); newer Member States in partic- ular (especially Estonia, Latvia and Slovakia) scored very high in this regard. However, when asked about the extent of promotional activities carried out (versus solely the provision of information), it was seen that education providers, trade unions, and social partners were less active. Given the important role these stakeholders can play in reaching out to target groups, the findings suggest that there is potential for increasing their engage- ment in actively communicating on adult learning. Such organisations could for example be given guid- ance on best ways to promote adult learning, reach out to their target groups and measure outcomes, or be provided with \u2018ready made\u2019 tools for promotion. Non profit organisations appear to be the most active in both the provision of information and active pro- motion of adult education. Furthermore, LLP Agencies were considered by most respondents as key actors disseminating information on adult learning through the implementation of Grundtvig-related activities. Target groups: Besides adult learners, respondents consider that the primary target groups should be policy-makers, who were rated higher than funders/grant providers (e.g. appointed bodies, businesses, SMEs or research institutes). This may be due to a shared feeling that a key obstacle to promoting adult learning is insuffi- cient commitment from national policy makers. Tools: The majority of surveyed organisations stated that TV-based dissemination activities (independently of whether in the form of advertisements, documenta- ries or movies) are the most successful in outreach- ing and engaging learners.

        "In addition, it emerged that themed events and festi- vals were considered successful because they allow for interaction with participants. In particular, \u2018umbrella\u2019 days such as Adult Learning Days and Adult Learning Weeks were rated very highly. These activities should therefore be encouraged and endorsed by DG EAC, for example by establishing a European Adult Learning Day with regular parallel or joint events co-organised with LLP National Agencies. Conferences and formalised meetings were also considered very effective in communicating to pol- icy-makers, more than the provision of statisti- cal information. These include meetings under the aegis of the Open Method of Coordination (OMC) ( 1 ), Grundtvig-related promotional activities, and other events organised in the framework of the Action Plan on adult learning (2008-2010) ( 2 ). Respondents also believed that establishing a for- mal platform for the exchange of information and best practice amongst parties can prove to be highly effective for policy-makers and educational institu- tions alike. Messages: When prompted to develop and rank messages on the importance of adult learning, a large majority of respondent organisations ranked as highest the following: \u2018There is a demonstrated monetary return on investment for adult learning.\u2019 The second ranked theme concerned \u201cthe cost of not investing in adult education\u201d, thus suggesting that rational arguments are more likely to resonate with respondents than emotional ones (e.g. \u201cAdult education helps foster personal development and independence\u201d, which was ranked the lowest in terms of importance).

II. Informational and promotional activities (cid:2) In your opinion, what are the top five most successful promotional and awareness rais- ing activities on adult learning external to your organisation? Respondents were asked to provide examples of successful promotional and awareness raising activ- ities on adult learning in the field. This question was open ended. The top responses were: 1. Adult Learning Days/Weeks 2. Internet \u2013 online/email/website/social media infor- mation or campaign 3. Advertising and Media 4. Events 5. Face to face/personal contact or information Activities that involved interaction between stake- holders, such as Adult Learning Days and Events, were generally rated quite high.

        "special Adult Learning Days \u2013 with a preference for \u2018umbrella\u2019 days (i.e. wider in their scope) vs. those which were more theme based (language, mother tongue, etc.) It is again clear that a setting which involves interaction among stakeholders is thought to be very relevant. Print materials such as success stories were also rated low, which suggests that the existing prac- tice of systematically providing print materials for the promotion of adult education is not based on evidence.

When looking at the ranking of \u2018very important\u2019, the top target group was poten- tial adult learners (55 %), followed by policy mak- ers (50 %). As seen in the graph, funders and grant providers were considered by respondents as less important to communicate to than policy makers. This would imply that even if funds were available for the implementation of adult learning, there is a feeling among respondents that one of the key obstacles to promoting adult learning in Europe is insufficient commitment from national level policy-makers. Changes would therefore first need to be carried out at policy level; there is potential for European Commission to make more of a case for adult learn- ing, promoting its visibility in EU policy packages, and (cid:2) Please tell us how relevant each of these activities are / would be in promoting adult learning.

(cid:2) If you were asked to develop a message on why adult learning is important, what would your message be? Respondents were provided with a text box, and asked to develop a message on the importance of adult learning. In order to understand the key aspects of their message, a tag cloud was created. The above tag cloud visually represents all responses provided. The dominant words seen are \u2018learning\u2019, \u2018adult\u2019, \u2018life\u2019, \u2018society\u2019, \u2018education\u2019, \u2018development\u2019. In order to under- stand better what other words had been highlighted, another tag cloud is developed with certain words removed ( 3 ). Note: the following words were excluded from the tag cloud: adult, education, keep, learning, something, life, learn. In the above tag clouds, the count of words is as below: Active (38), better (54), change (74), important (76), improve (33), society (76), world (66), knowledge (62), opportunities (25), professional (22), social (53), society (76), employability (16), life (214), training (42), individual (21), value (16), experience (29), culture (14), chance (31).
